00:00:29.698 --> 00:00:32.810
infections from these species
cause pain and discomfort.

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:34.927
They steal nutrients and zap energy.

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:37.425
They stunt both physical
and cognitive growth.

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.171
In most cases, these worms
may not be fatal,

00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:42.374
but paradoxically,
that's part of the problem.

00:00:42.398 --> 00:00:43.938
It means that many countries

00:00:43.962 --> 00:00:46.694
simply have not been able
to prioritize their treatment.

00:00:46.718 --> 00:00:48.335
There's a social cost to that:

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:50.551
children without access
to deworming treatments

00:00:50.575 --> 00:00:52.618
have lower rates of school attendance.

00:00:52.642 --> 00:00:54.754
Adults who grow up
without deworming medicine

00:00:54.778 --> 00:00:57.578
are less productive
and have lower lifelong earnings.

00:00:57.602 --> 00:00:59.714
What intestinal worms do, really,

00:00:59.738 --> 00:01:01.165
is limit potential.
