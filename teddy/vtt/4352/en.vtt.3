00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:30.542
treatment can be done right at school.

00:01:30.855 --> 00:01:33.188
This process is extremely simple and fast.

00:01:33.212 --> 00:01:36.338
In Ethiopia, for example,
this is done for 20 million children

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:38.148
in a matter of weeks.

00:01:38.172 --> 00:01:39.800
The world has come a long way

00:01:39.824 --> 00:01:42.649
on getting deworming medicines
to the people who need them,

00:01:42.673 --> 00:01:45.213
and African governments
want to gain more traction.

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:47.346
It's now time to match their ambition.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.674
The END Fund will work with governments

00:01:49.698 --> 00:01:54.417
to create a plan that drastically reduces
the burden of disease caused by worms.

00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:57.579
They’ll work together to ensure
prevention and treatment programs

00:01:57.603 --> 00:01:58.897
can serve everyone.

00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:01.100
The END Fund has an audacious idea:
