The END Fund has an audacious idea:

00:02:01.124 --> 00:02:05.504
they believe we are the generation to end
sickness from worm infections forever.

00:02:05.528 --> 00:02:08.723
The key is not simply to build
new programs from scratch,

00:02:08.747 --> 00:02:12.389
but to amplify the efforts of the programs
that are already taking shape.

00:02:12.413 --> 00:02:15.525
By examining the problem
of how worms transmit disease,

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.469
the END Fund has identified five key areas
where they can drive improvement.

00:02:20.017 --> 00:02:22.460
Number one: lower the cost of treatment.

00:02:22.484 --> 00:02:25.533
Many pharmaceutical companies
offer deworming medicines for free,

00:02:25.557 --> 00:02:27.700
so the END Fund
works with the right partners

00:02:27.724 --> 00:02:29.291
to coordinate their delivery.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.735
They will continue
to secure drug donations
