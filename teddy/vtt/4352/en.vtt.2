00:00:59.738 --> 00:01:01.165
is limit potential.

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:05.408
Currently, there are 1.7 billion people
in the world still at risk for worms.

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.878
Six hundred million of them are in Africa.

00:01:07.902 --> 00:01:11.028
For every dollar invested
in worm control and prevention,

00:01:11.052 --> 00:01:15.203
African countries see up to 42 dollars
return in economic benefits.

00:01:15.227 --> 00:01:18.271
The good news is that deworming
treatment is extremely easy.

00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:20.540
One to three pills
given once or twice a year

00:01:20.564 --> 00:01:23.604
is enough to take a child
from 200 worms to zero

00:01:23.628 --> 00:01:26.051
and to protect them
from infection going forward.

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:28.695
In communities where
there's a high prevalence of worms,

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:30.542
treatment can be done right at school.
