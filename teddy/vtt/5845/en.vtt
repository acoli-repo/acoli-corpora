00:00:00.062 --> 00:00:04.649
We survey CEOs, police officers,
truck drivers, cooks, engineers.

00:00:04.673 --> 00:00:06.698
If people are working,
we've surveyed them.

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:08.895
And what we know,
in terms of their happiness:

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:10.750
workers all want the same things.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.176
[The Way We Work]

00:00:15.427 --> 00:00:17.792
There's three billion
working people in the world.

00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:20.705
And about 40 percent of them would say
they're happy at work.

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:24.559
That means about 1.8 billion,
or almost two billion people,

00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:25.957
are not happy at work.

00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:27.184
What does that do,

00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:30.433
both to those people
and the organizations that they work in?
