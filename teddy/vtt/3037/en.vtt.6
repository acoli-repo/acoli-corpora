00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.799
And we decided to grasp at those --

00:03:00.823 --> 00:03:03.934
to clutch at those straws,
if I may use that word --

00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.355
if only to make the justice system work,

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.529
and work for all.

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:10.966
Just about the same time,

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.815
I met a young university
graduate from the UK,

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:15.439
called Alexander McLean.

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:19.713
Alexander had come in with three or four
of his colleagues from university

00:03:19.737 --> 00:03:20.903
in their gap year,

00:03:20.927 --> 00:03:23.260
and they wanted to help assist,

00:03:23.284 --> 00:03:26.370
set up a library in Kamiti Maximum Prison,

00:03:26.394 --> 00:03:27.546
which if you Google,

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.767
you will see is written as one
of the 15 worst prisons in the world.
