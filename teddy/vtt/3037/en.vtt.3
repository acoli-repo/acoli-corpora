00:01:28.194 --> 00:01:31.075
And in the midst of the excruciating pain,

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:32.365
the mental torture,

00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:36.795
the many unanswered questions
that Manson faced,

00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:40.822
he knew he was not
going to play the victim.

00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:43.648
He refused to play the role of the victim.

00:01:44.497 --> 00:01:47.863
He was angry at the justice system
that had put him behind bars.

00:01:49.188 --> 00:01:52.117
But he knew the only way
he could change that justice system

00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:54.354
or help other people get justice

00:01:54.378 --> 00:01:55.799
was not to play the victim.

00:01:57.435 --> 00:02:01.673
Change came to Manson
when he decided to embrace forgiveness
