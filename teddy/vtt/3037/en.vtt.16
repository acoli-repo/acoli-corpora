00:08:00.394 --> 00:08:02.982
And as I finish my talk,

00:08:03.006 --> 00:08:06.254
I'd just like to ask
each and every single one of you here,

00:08:07.744 --> 00:08:11.625
wonderful thinkers,
changemakers, innovators,

00:08:11.649 --> 00:08:14.752
the wonderful global citizens
we have at TED,

00:08:14.776 --> 00:08:17.259
just remember the words
of Martin Luther King.

00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.545
Let them continue ringing
in your heart and your life.

00:08:21.252 --> 00:08:23.035
Whatever it is,

00:08:23.059 --> 00:08:24.685
wherever you are,

00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:26.392
whatever it takes,

00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:27.567
keep on moving.

00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:28.750
Thank you.

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:32.151
