I want to tell you a story about Manson.

00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:09.307
Manson was this 28-year-old
interior designer,

00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:11.149
a father to a loving daughter,

00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:13.651
and a son

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:17.431
who found himself behind bars
due to a broken-down judicial system.

00:00:18.516 --> 00:00:21.728
He was framed for a murder
he didn't commit

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:23.599
and was sentenced to the gallows.

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:28.871
There were two victims of this murder --
the victim who actually died in the murder

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:31.576
and Manson, who had been
sentenced to prison
