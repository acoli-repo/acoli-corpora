00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:31.576
and Manson, who had been
sentenced to prison

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.538
for an offense which he did not commit.

00:00:35.419 --> 00:00:37.791
He was locked up in a cell,
eight by seven,

00:00:37.815 --> 00:00:39.402
with 13 other grown-up men

00:00:40.262 --> 00:00:42.134
for 23 and a half hours a day.

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:46.593
Food was not guaranteed that you'd get.

00:00:47.688 --> 00:00:48.949
And I remember yesterday,

00:00:48.973 --> 00:00:52.046
as I walked into the room where I was,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.410
I imagined the kind of cell
that Manson would have been living in.

00:00:55.434 --> 00:00:56.834
Because the toilet --

00:00:57.371 --> 00:00:58.680
The row of the small rooms

00:00:58.704 --> 00:01:02.042
that were there were slightly bigger
than the eight-by-seven cell.
