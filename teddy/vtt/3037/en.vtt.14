WEBVTT

00:06:58.514 --> 00:07:00.791
not only to assist their fellow inmates,

00:07:00.815 --> 00:07:03.910
but to assist the entire
wider society of the poor

00:07:03.934 --> 00:07:06.016
who cannot access legal justice.

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.603
So as I speak before you today,

00:07:09.627 --> 00:07:15.198
I stand here in the full knowledge
that we can all reexamine ourselves,

00:07:15.222 --> 00:07:17.984
we can all reexamine our situations,

00:07:18.008 --> 00:07:20.541
we can all reexamine our circumstances

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:24.226
and not play the victim narrative.

00:07:24.792 --> 00:07:26.990
The victim narrative
will not take us anywhere.

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:29.749
I was behind bars, yeah.
