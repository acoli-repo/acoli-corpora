So, on 26th October last year,
after 18 years in prison,

00:06:35.482 --> 00:06:37.886
I walked out of prison
on presidential pardon.

00:06:39.061 --> 00:06:42.307
I'm now focused on helping APP --
the African Prisons Project --

00:06:42.331 --> 00:06:45.392
achieve its mandate
of training and setting up

00:06:45.416 --> 00:06:48.903
the first law school
and legal college behind bars.

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:51.006
Where we are going to train --

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.942
(Applause)

00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:58.490
Where we are going to train
inmates and staff

00:06:58.514 --> 00:07:00.791
not only to assist their fellow inmates,
