00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:33.286
But I never felt and I was not a prisoner.

00:07:36.236 --> 00:07:38.561
The basic thing I got to learn

00:07:38.585 --> 00:07:40.863
was that if I thought,

00:07:40.887 --> 00:07:43.069
and if you think, you can,

00:07:43.093 --> 00:07:44.243
you will.

00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:47.346
But if you sit thinking that you can't,

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.520
you won't.

00:07:49.593 --> 00:07:51.126
It's as simple as that.

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:54.760
And so I'm encouraged
by the peaceful revolutionaries

00:07:54.784 --> 00:07:56.060
I've heard on this stage.

00:07:56.633 --> 00:07:59.434
The world needs you now,
the world needs you today.
