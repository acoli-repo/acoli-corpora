00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.887
So I started writing
legal briefs for them.

00:05:01.911 --> 00:05:05.409
With my other colleagues in prison,
we did as much as we could.

00:05:07.743 --> 00:05:09.090
That wasn't enough.

00:05:11.022 --> 00:05:12.934
Alexander McLean

00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:16.688
and his team
at the African Prisons Project

00:05:16.712 --> 00:05:18.609
decided to support more inmates.

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.533
And as I'm speaking to you today,

00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:24.696
there are 63 inmates and staff
in the Kenya Prison Service

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.045
studying law at the University of London
through distance learning.

00:05:28.903 --> 00:05:33.934
