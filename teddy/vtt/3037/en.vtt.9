00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.204
from the University of London
from within the prison system.

00:04:32.744 --> 00:04:34.664
Having graduated, what happened next --

00:04:34.688 --> 00:04:38.193
(Applause)

00:04:38.217 --> 00:04:39.367
Thank you.

00:04:39.391 --> 00:04:40.474
(Applause)

00:04:40.498 --> 00:04:41.990
Having graduated,

00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:43.414
now I felt empowered.

00:04:44.014 --> 00:04:46.458
I was not going to play
the helpless victim.

00:04:46.823 --> 00:04:49.577
But I felt empowered
not only to assist myself,

00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:51.450
to prosecute my own case,

00:04:51.474 --> 00:04:54.529
but also to assist the other inmates

00:04:54.553 --> 00:04:58.386
who are suffering the similar injustices
that have just been spoken about here.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.887
So I started writing
legal briefs for them.
