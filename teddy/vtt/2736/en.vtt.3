slowly building into a culture
that refuses to see women as people.

00:01:31.955 --> 00:01:36.145
We see this in the school
that sends home a 10-year-old girl

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:39.811
because her clothes were
a distraction to boys trying to learn,

00:01:39.835 --> 00:01:45.011
or the government that refuses
to punish men for raping women

00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:46.611
over and over,

00:01:46.635 --> 00:01:48.091
or the woman who is killed

00:01:48.115 --> 00:01:52.195
because she asked a man to stop
grinding on her on the dance floor.

00:01:55.515 --> 00:02:00.275
Media plays a large role in perpetuating
the objectification of women.
