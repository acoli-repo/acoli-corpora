00:12:00.515 --> 00:12:04.275
When it comes to women's equality,
the two need not oppose one another.

00:12:04.995 --> 00:12:07.251
If you're somebody who has sex with women,

00:12:07.275 --> 00:12:08.771
prioritize her pleasure.

00:12:08.795 --> 00:12:11.195
If you don't know how, ask.

00:12:12.075 --> 00:12:13.571
If you have children --

00:12:13.595 --> 00:12:15.531
(Laughter)

00:12:15.555 --> 00:12:19.331
have conversations about sex
as early as possible,

00:12:19.355 --> 00:12:23.731
because kids don't look up s-e-x
in the dictionary anymore.

00:12:23.755 --> 00:12:25.395
They look it up on the internet.

00:12:26.355 --> 00:12:29.035
And when you're having
those conversations about sex,

00:12:29.795 --> 00:12:31.731
don't center them on reproduction only.
