When we tell women that sex
isn't worth the risk during pregnancy,

00:08:31.915 --> 00:08:36.171
what we're telling her is that
her sexual pleasure doesn't matter.

00:08:36.195 --> 00:08:39.491
So what we are telling her
is that she in fact doesn't matter,

00:08:39.515 --> 00:08:44.235
even though the needs of her fetus
are not at odds with her own needs.

00:08:45.195 --> 00:08:47.451
So medical providers,

00:08:47.475 --> 00:08:50.451
such as the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists

00:08:50.475 --> 00:08:55.371
have the opportunity to educate
about the safety of sex during pregnancy.

00:08:55.395 --> 00:08:56.795
So what do the experts say?

00:08:57.755 --> 00:09:00.251
ACOG actually has
no public official statement
