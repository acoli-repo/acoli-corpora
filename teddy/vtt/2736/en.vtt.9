Most of the responses were negative.

00:04:32.242 --> 00:04:33.669
"Gross."

00:04:33.693 --> 00:04:35.066
"Awkward."

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.531
"Not sexy." "Odd."

00:04:37.555 --> 00:04:38.755
"Uncomfortable."

00:04:39.235 --> 00:04:40.491
"How?"

00:04:40.515 --> 00:04:42.515
(Laughter)

00:04:43.315 --> 00:04:46.411
"Not worth the trouble."
"Not worth the risk."

00:04:46.435 --> 00:04:48.435

00:04:49.715 --> 00:04:54.451

pregnant women and moms from sexuality,

00:04:54.475 --> 00:04:59.491
we are removing the constraints
of sexual objectification.

00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:01.555
They experience less sexism. Right?
