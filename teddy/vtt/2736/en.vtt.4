Media plays a large role in perpetuating
the objectification of women.

00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:04.211
Let's consider
the classic romantic comedy.

00:02:04.235 --> 00:02:08.131
We're typically introduced
to two kinds of women in these movies,

00:02:08.155 --> 00:02:10.891
two kinds of desirable women, anyway.

00:02:10.915 --> 00:02:13.331
The first is the sexy bombshell.

00:02:13.355 --> 00:02:17.011
This is the unbelievably gorgeous woman
with the perfect body.

00:02:17.035 --> 00:02:19.651
Our leading man
has no trouble identifying her

00:02:19.675 --> 00:02:22.035
and even less trouble having sex with her.

00:02:22.755 --> 00:02:24.611
The second is our leading lady,

00:02:24.635 --> 00:02:28.491
the beautiful but demure woman
our leading man falls in love with

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:30.651
despite not noticing her at first
