00:08:57.755 --> 00:09:00.251
ACOG actually has
no public official statement

00:09:00.275 --> 00:09:03.435
about the safety of sex during pregnancy.

00:09:04.078 --> 00:09:07.091
Guidance from the Mayo Clinic
is generally positive

00:09:07.115 --> 00:09:09.611
but presented with a caveat:

00:09:09.635 --> 00:09:12.786
"Although most women can safely
have sex throughout pregnancy,

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.931
sometimes it's best to be cautious."

00:09:14.955 --> 00:09:18.051
Some women don't want
to have sex during pregnancy,

00:09:18.075 --> 00:09:19.331
and that's OK.

00:09:19.355 --> 00:09:21.971
Some women do want
to have sex during pregnancy,

00:09:21.995 --> 00:09:23.411
and that's OK, too.

00:09:23.435 --> 00:09:26.091
What needs to stop
is society telling women

00:09:26.115 --> 00:09:28.435
what they can and cannot do
with their bodies.

00:09:29.475 --> 00:09:31.595
