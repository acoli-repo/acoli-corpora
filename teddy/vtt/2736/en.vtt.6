00:02:56.555 --> 00:03:00.211
On the rare occasion
that I share with a new acquaintance

00:03:00.235 --> 00:03:01.971
that I study sex,

00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:04.371
if they don't end
the conversation right then,

00:03:04.395 --> 00:03:06.395
they're usually pretty intrigued.

00:03:07.315 --> 00:03:09.091
"Oh. Tell me more."

00:03:09.115 --> 00:03:10.315
So I do.

00:03:12.195 --> 00:03:14.811
"I'm really interested
in studying the sexual behaviors

00:03:14.835 --> 00:03:16.611
of pregnant and postpartum couples."

00:03:16.635 --> 00:03:20.171
At this point I get
a different kind of response.

00:03:20.195 --> 00:03:22.171
(Laughter)

00:03:22.195 --> 00:03:23.995
"Oh. Huh.

00:03:24.675 --> 00:03:26.875
Do pregnant people even have sex?

00:03:28.075 --> 00:03:32.011
Have you thought
about studying sexual desire
