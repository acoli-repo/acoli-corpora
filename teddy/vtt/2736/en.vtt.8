Babies. Puppies. Kittens.

00:04:00.355 --> 00:04:02.011
The elderly. Right?

00:04:02.035 --> 00:04:03.755
(Laughter)

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.707
When we label an adult as cute, though,

00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:10.211
we take away a lot of their intelligence,

00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:11.435
their complexity.

00:04:12.195 --> 00:04:14.675
We reduce them to childlike qualities.

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:17.211
I also asked heterosexual men

00:04:17.235 --> 00:04:20.371
to imagine a woman that they're
partnered with is pregnant,

00:04:20.395 --> 00:04:23.171
and then asked women
to imagine that they are pregnant,

00:04:23.195 --> 00:04:25.811
and then tell me
the first words that come to mind

00:04:25.835 --> 00:04:27.875
when they imagine having sex.

00:04:28.955 --> 00:04:31.035
Most of the responses were negative.
