00:00:00.708 --> 00:00:05.434
My parents gave me an extraordinary name:

00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:10.042
Baratunde Rafiq Thurston.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.393
Now, Baratunde is based
on a Yoruba name from Nigeria,

00:00:14.417 --> 00:00:15.976
but we're not Nigerian.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.018
(Laughter)

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:19.018
That's just how black my mama was.

00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:20.059
(Laughter)

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:23.226
"Get this boy the blackest name possible.
What does the book say?"

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.809
(Laughter)

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:28.559
Rafiq is an Arabic name,
but we are not Arabs.

00:00:28.583 --> 00:00:32.976
My mom just wanted me to have difficulty
boarding planes in the 21st century.
