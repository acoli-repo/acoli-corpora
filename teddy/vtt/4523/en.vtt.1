00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I fly above the wind,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and yet I cannot arise;

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And naught I have,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and all the world I seize upon."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫
