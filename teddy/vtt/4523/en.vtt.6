00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
♫ Sick and tired of the "Later, maybe" ♫

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
♫ Take it, fake it, make it, leave it life ♫

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
♫ And I gotta just name it, I gotta just claim it ♫

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
♫ I gotta just seize ♫

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
♫ Oh please, oh please, oh please me right ♫

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
♫ Have but I don't have -- you know that ♫

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
♫ Nobody knows how to hold me, no ♫

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫
