00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
♫ Nobody knows how to hold me, no ♫

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
♫ 'Cause I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
♫ Have but I -- have what I want ♫

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
♫ Have but I don't have, what I want ♫

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
♫ Have but I don't have, what I want ♫

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
♫ Have but I don't have what I want ♫
