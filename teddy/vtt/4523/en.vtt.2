00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
♫ Have but I don't have ♫

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
♫ It feels like all I got is loss on a bad back ♫

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
♫ Gone with the last train, honey don't you fret ♫

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
♫ Every cloud has a silver lining ♫

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
♫ Just a little rain, just a little rain, just a little rain ♫

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
♫ I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
♫ Have but I don't have ♫

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
♫ Nobody knows how to hold me ♫
