00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
♫ Nobody knows how to hold me ♫

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says, ♫

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
♫ "Good things come to those who wait" ♫

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
♫ And I can't stand in ... ♫

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
♫ I can't stand in line forever ♫

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
♫ Stand the cold air ♫

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
♫ Glad-handed ♫

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
♫ Sick and tired of the "Later, maybe" ♫

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
♫ Take it, fake it, take it, take-it-or-leave-it life ♫
