00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.551
because I'm a masochist,

00:03:31.551 --> 00:03:34.623
and eventually, things like Michael Tilson Thomas

00:03:34.623 --> 00:03:37.439
and Tod Machover, and seeing

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:39.606
their visceral passion talking about music,

00:03:39.606 --> 00:03:41.433
it definitely stirred something in me,

00:03:41.433 --> 00:03:43.778
and I'm a sucker for anyone talking devotedly

00:03:43.778 --> 00:03:45.169
about the power of music.

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.829
And I started to write down on these little note cards

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.172
every time I heard something

00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:51.387
that struck a chord in me, pardon the pun,

00:03:51.387 --> 00:03:53.143
or something that I thought I could use,

00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:57.810
and pretty soon, my studio looked like this,

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.573
kind of like a John Nash, "Beautiful Mind" vibe.
