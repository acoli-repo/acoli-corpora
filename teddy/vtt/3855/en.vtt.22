00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:01.143
when I was working with the late,

00:11:01.143 --> 00:11:02.455
amazing Amy Winehouse

00:11:02.455 --> 00:11:04.696
on her album "Back to Black."

00:11:04.696 --> 00:11:07.752
A lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album

00:11:07.752 --> 00:11:09.781
that myself and Salaam Remi, the other producer,

00:11:09.781 --> 00:11:11.669
achieved, how we captured this long-lost sound,

00:11:11.669 --> 00:11:15.444
but without the very, very 21st-century personality

00:11:15.444 --> 00:11:17.397
and firebrand that was Amy Winehouse

00:11:17.397 --> 00:11:20.550
and her lyrics about rehab and Roger Moore

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.476
and even a mention of Slick Rick,

00:11:22.476 --> 00:11:23.761
the whole thing would have run the risk

00:11:23.761 --> 00:11:27.222
of being very pastiche, to be honest.

00:11:27.222 --> 00:11:29.510
Imagine any other singer from that era over it

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.201
singing the same old lyrics.
