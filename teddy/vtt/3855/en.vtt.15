00:07:28.254 --> 00:07:30.779
that "La Di Da Di" means, it's an old

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:33.819
Cockney expression from the late 1800s in England,

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:35.935
so maybe a remix with Mrs. Patmore

00:07:35.935 --> 00:07:37.861
from "Downton Abbey" coming soon,

00:07:37.861 --> 00:07:41.445
or that's for another day.

00:07:41.445 --> 00:07:43.171
Doug E. Fresh was the human beat box.

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:44.955
Slick Rick is the voice you hear on the record,

00:07:44.955 --> 00:07:48.015
and because of Slick Rick's sing-songy,

00:07:48.015 --> 00:07:50.804
super-catchy vocals, it provides endless sound bites

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:53.546
and samples for future pop records.

00:07:53.546 --> 00:07:54.876
That was 1984.

00:07:54.876 --> 00:07:57.779
This is me in 1984, in case you were wondering

00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:00.310
how I was doing, thank you for asking.
