00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:31.010
the theme to "The Price Is Right."

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.143
Albums like De La Soul's "3 Feet High and Rising"

00:05:33.143 --> 00:05:35.297
and the Beastie Boys' "Paul's Boutique"

00:05:35.297 --> 00:05:37.555
looted from decades of recorded music

00:05:37.555 --> 00:05:40.604
to create these sonic, layered masterpieces

00:05:40.604 --> 00:05:42.856
that were basically the Sgt. Peppers of their day.

00:05:42.856 --> 00:05:45.503
And they weren't sampling these records

00:05:45.503 --> 00:05:48.312
because they were too lazy to write their own music.

00:05:48.312 --> 00:05:50.277
They weren't sampling these records to cash in on

00:05:50.277 --> 00:05:51.946
the familiarity of the original stuff.

00:05:51.946 --> 00:05:53.503
To be honest, it was all about sampling

00:05:53.503 --> 00:05:55.044
really obscure things,

00:05:55.044 --> 00:05:56.532
except for a few obvious exceptions

00:05:56.532 --> 00:05:59.361
like Vanilla Ice and "doo doo doo da da doo doo"

00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:00.770
that we know about.
