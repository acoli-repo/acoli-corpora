00:07:57.779 --> 00:08:00.310
how I was doing, thank you for asking.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.411
It's Throwback Thursday already.

00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:04.764
I was involved in a heavy love affair

00:08:04.764 --> 00:08:06.093
with the music of Duran Duran,

00:08:06.093 --> 00:08:08.164
as you can probably tell from my outfit.

00:08:08.164 --> 00:08:09.818
I was in the middle.

00:08:09.818 --> 00:08:11.949
And the simplest way that I knew

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:14.530
how to co-opt myself into that experience

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.463
of wanting to be in that song somehow

00:08:16.463 --> 00:08:18.884
was to just get a band together
of fellow nine-year-olds

00:08:18.884 --> 00:08:21.391
and play "Wild Boys" at the school talent show.

00:08:21.391 --> 00:08:23.880
So that's what we did, and long story short,

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.622
we were booed off the stage,

00:08:25.622 --> 00:08:28.435
and if you ever have a chance to live your life

00:08:28.435 --> 00:08:30.976
escaping hearing the sound of an auditorium
