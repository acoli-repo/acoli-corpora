00:02:59.503 --> 00:03:01.516
I wasn't quite sure what my angle was, at first,

00:03:01.516 --> 00:03:04.468
so yeah, I immediately started
watching tons of TED Talks,

00:03:04.468 --> 00:03:06.484
which is pretty much absolutely

00:03:06.484 --> 00:03:08.323
the worst thing that you can do

00:03:08.323 --> 00:03:11.151
because you start to go into panic mode, thinking,

00:03:11.151 --> 00:03:14.652
I haven't mounted a successful

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:25.266
DJing in night clubs

00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:27.245
and producing pop records.

00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:29.920
But I still kept watching the videos,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.551
because I'm a masochist,
