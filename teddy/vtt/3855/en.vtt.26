00:12:58.995 --> 00:13:01.653
if your song contains some kind of pre-written

00:13:01.653 --> 00:13:02.898
or pre-existing music,

00:13:02.898 --> 00:13:04.893
you're ineligible for song of the year.

00:13:04.893 --> 00:13:07.170
Rockists, who are racist

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.920
but only about rock music,

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.151
constantly use the argument to —

00:13:13.151 --> 00:13:15.173
That's a real word. That is a real word.

00:13:15.173 --> 00:13:17.789
They constantly use the argument to devalue rap

00:13:17.789 --> 00:13:19.699
and modern pop,

00:13:19.699 --> 00:13:23.861
and these arguments completely miss the point,

00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:25.820
because the dam has burst.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.853
We live in the post-sampling era.

00:13:27.853 --> 00:13:29.480
We take the things that we love

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.858
and we build on them.
