00:08:28.435 --> 00:08:30.976
escaping hearing the sound of an auditorium

00:08:30.976 --> 00:08:32.529
full of second- and third-graders booing,

00:08:32.529 --> 00:08:35.137
I would highly recommend it. It's not really fun.

00:08:35.137 --> 00:08:36.437
But it didn't really matter,

00:08:36.437 --> 00:08:38.205
because what I wanted somehow

00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:40.932
was to just be in the history
of that song for a minute.

00:08:40.932 --> 00:08:42.123
I didn't care who liked it.

00:08:42.123 --> 00:08:45.442
I just loved it, and I thought
I could put myself in there.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:47.210
Over the next 10 years, "La Di Da Di"

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.155
continues to be sampled by countless records,

00:08:49.155 --> 00:08:52.879
ending up on massive hits like
"Here Comes the Hotstepper"

00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:54.360
and "I Wanna Sex You Up."

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.241
Snoop Doggy Dogg covers this song

00:08:56.241 --> 00:09:00.304
on his debut album "Doggystyle"
and calls it "Lodi Dodi."
