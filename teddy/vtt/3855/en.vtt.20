00:09:59.603 --> 00:10:00.865
and as a young boy

00:10:00.865 --> 00:10:02.516
growing up in Brooklyn,

00:10:02.516 --> 00:10:04.658
it's hard not to think that that song probably held

00:10:04.658 --> 00:10:06.089
some fond memories for him.

00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:07.875
But the way he interpreted it, as you hear,

00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:09.290
is completely his own.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.365

00:10:18.257 --> 00:10:21.083
because you would be the only people
that I'd ever have a chance of getting it.

00:10:21.083 --> 00:10:24.323
And so, it's a groaner. (Laughter)

00:10:24.323 --> 00:10:27.876
Elsewhere in the pop and rap world,

00:10:27.876 --> 00:10:29.792
we're going a little bit sample-crazy.

00:10:29.792 --> 00:10:32.290
We're getting away from the obscure
samples that we were doing,
