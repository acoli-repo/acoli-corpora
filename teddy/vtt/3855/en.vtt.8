00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.573
kind of like a John Nash, "Beautiful Mind" vibe.

00:04:01.573 --> 00:04:04.368
The other good thing about watching TED Talks,

00:04:04.368 --> 00:04:06.255
when you see a really good one,

00:04:06.255 --> 00:04:08.188
you kind of all of a sudden wish the speaker

00:04:08.188 --> 00:04:11.032
was your best friend, don't you? Like, just for a day.

00:04:11.032 --> 00:04:13.027
They seem like a nice person.

00:04:13.027 --> 00:04:16.009
You'd take a bike ride, maybe share an ice cream.

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:18.760
You'd certainly learn a lot.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.214
And every now and then they'd chide you,

00:04:20.214 --> 00:04:21.950
when they got frustrated that you couldn't really

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.879
keep up with half of the technical things
they're banging on about all the time.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.348
But then they'd remember that
you're but a mere human

00:04:27.348 --> 00:04:28.830
of ordinary, mortal intelligence

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.229
that didn't finish university,
