00:04:58.537 --> 00:05:01.546
I can hear something that I love in a piece of media

00:05:01.546 --> 00:05:02.930
and I can co-opt it

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.266
and insert myself in that narrative,

00:05:05.266 --> 00:05:08.238
or alter it, even.

00:05:08.238 --> 00:05:09.968
In a nutshell, that's what I was trying to do

00:05:09.968 --> 00:05:12.174
with these things, but more importantly,

00:05:12.174 --> 00:05:14.564
that's what the past 30 years of music has been.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:16.252
That's the major thread.

00:05:16.252 --> 00:05:18.975
See, 30 years ago, you had the first digital samplers,

00:05:18.975 --> 00:05:20.460
and they changed everything overnight.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.125
All of a sudden, artists could sample

00:05:22.125 --> 00:05:24.930
from anything and everything that came before them,

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.125
from a snare drum from the Funky Meters,

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:28.939
to a Ron Carter bassline,

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:31.010
the theme to "The Price Is Right."
