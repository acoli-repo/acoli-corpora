WEBVTT

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.858
and we build on them.

00:13:30.858 --> 00:13:32.498
That's just how it goes.

00:13:32.498 --> 00:13:35.590
And when we really add
something significant and original

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:38.087
and we merge our musical journey with this,

00:13:38.087 --> 00:13:39.925
then we have a chance to be

00:13:39.925 --> 00:13:42.558
a part of the evolution of that music that we love

00:13:42.558 --> 00:13:45.799
and be linked with it once it
becomes something new again.

00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:51.163
So I would like to do one more piece

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:52.881
that I put together for you tonight,

00:13:52.881 --> 00:13:55.236
and it takes place with two

00:13:55.236 --> 00:13:58.272
pretty inspiring TED performances that I've seen.

00:13:58.272 --> 00:14:01.907
One of them is the piano player Derek Paravicini,
