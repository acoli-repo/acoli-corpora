00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.077
but that was our first successful attempt

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.529
to create a device for this major problem.

00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:40.808
In this video, we can see
how a very tiny catheter

00:03:40.832 --> 00:03:42.961
takes the coil to the heart.

00:03:43.393 --> 00:03:45.697
The coil then closes the hole.

00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:48.526
After that moment of inspiration,

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.708
there came a very long time of effort

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:56.471
developing a prototype.

00:03:56.495 --> 00:04:02.084
In vitro and in vivo studies took
thousands of hours of work in the lab.
