During those trips, my grandmother
used to recite a Kipling poem:

00:01:06.687 --> 00:01:10.272
"Something hidden. Go and find it.

00:01:10.296 --> 00:01:12.954
Go and look behind the Mountains.

00:01:12.978 --> 00:01:16.733
Something lost behind the mountains.

00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:20.494
Lost and waiting for you. Go!"

In the coming years,
I became a medical student.
