WEBVTT

00:05:28.753 --> 00:05:34.607
For centuries, indigenous women
told stories by weaving complex patterns

00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:35.796
on looms,

00:05:36.262 --> 00:05:40.578
and an unexpected skill
helped us for the new device.

00:05:41.673 --> 00:05:44.483
We take this traditional method of weaving

00:05:44.507 --> 00:05:48.477
and make a design made by a smart material

00:05:48.927 --> 00:05:50.776
that records shape.

00:05:51.236 --> 00:05:53.731
It seems this time,

00:05:53.755 --> 00:05:58.482
the weaving allows us
to create a seamless device

00:05:58.506 --> 00:06:00.279
that doesn't rust
