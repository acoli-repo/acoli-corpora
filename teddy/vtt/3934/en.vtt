00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:04.172
The most complex problems in our time

00:00:04.196 --> 00:00:07.142
can be solved with simple techniques,

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.729
if we are able to dream.

00:00:10.991 --> 00:00:15.952
As a child, I discovered
that creativity is the key

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:20.369
to cross from dreams to reality.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.883
I learned this from my grandmother,

00:00:23.907 --> 00:00:25.584
Dr. Ruth Tichauer,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.948
a Jewish refugee that settled
in the heart of the Andes.
