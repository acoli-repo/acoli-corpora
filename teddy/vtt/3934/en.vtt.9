00:04:27.817 --> 00:04:30.282
we felt really enthusiastic.

00:04:30.688 --> 00:04:34.530
But we live in a place

00:04:34.554 --> 00:04:38.036
that is 12,000 feet high.

00:04:39.694 --> 00:04:40.869
And,

00:04:42.284 --> 00:04:47.343
the patients there need a special device
to solve their heart condition.

00:04:47.865 --> 00:04:50.328
The hole in altitude
patients is different,

00:04:50.352 --> 00:04:54.022
because the orifice
between the arteries is larger.

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.381
Most patients cannot afford
to be treated on time,

00:04:59.405 --> 00:05:00.586
and they die.
