that doesn't rust

00:06:01.072 --> 00:06:04.586
because it's made of only one piece.

00:06:05.427 --> 00:06:09.907
It can change by itself
into very complex structures

00:06:09.931 --> 00:06:13.872
by a procedure that took
decades to develop.

00:06:14.903 --> 00:06:17.722
As you can see, the device enters the body

00:06:17.746 --> 00:06:19.308
through the natural channels.

00:06:20.173 --> 00:06:23.463
Doctors have only to close
the catheter through the hole.

00:06:24.104 --> 00:06:26.948
Our device expands, places itself

00:06:26.972 --> 00:06:28.447
and closes the hole.
