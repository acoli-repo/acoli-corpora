00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.948
a Jewish refugee that settled
in the heart of the Andes.

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.418
That is how I grew up:

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:37.765
encouraged to see beyond any limitation.

00:00:38.982 --> 00:00:42.406
So part of my education
included helping her

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.840
in remote, indigenous communities.

00:00:45.864 --> 00:00:48.089
I cherish those memories,

00:00:48.113 --> 00:00:53.883
because they helped me
to understand life outside the city,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.394
a life with a lot of possibilities,

00:00:58.418 --> 00:01:01.283
without barriers, as language or culture.
