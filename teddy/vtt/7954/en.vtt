00:00:00.705 --> 00:00:03.624
Let me tell you
about the fifth-grade students

00:00:03.624 --> 00:00:06.335
at Boze Elementary School in Tacoma.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.131
They spend the entire school year

00:00:10.173 --> 00:00:14.260
planning to colonize
the planet Alpha Centauri

00:00:14.302 --> 00:00:17.472
to preserve future generations.

00:00:18.473 --> 00:00:22.894
They will get there
on a multigenerational spacecraft

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:26.773
so that the grandkids
of the people on the ship

00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:32.195
will arrive at Alpha Centauri,
ready to start a new civilization.
