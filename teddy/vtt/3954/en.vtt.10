in our history of beheadings
as public spectacle.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.896
As soon as the camera
appeared on the scene,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.656
a full lifetime ago on June 17, 1939,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.376
it had an immediate
and unequivocal effect.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.520
That day, the first film of a public
beheading was created in France.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.416
It was the execution, the guillotining,
of a German serial killer, Eugen Weidmann,

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.160
outside the prison
Saint-Pierre in Versailles.
