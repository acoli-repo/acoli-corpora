00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.976
The camera may have made these scenes
more accessible than ever before,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.656
but it's not just about the camera.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.096
If we take a bigger leap back in history,

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.296
we'll see that for as long
as there have been

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.416
public judicial executions and beheadings,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.520
there have been the crowds to see them.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.056
In London, as late as
the early 19th century,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.736
there might be four or five thousand
people to see a standard hanging.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.080
There could be 40,000 or 50,000
to see a famous criminal killed.
