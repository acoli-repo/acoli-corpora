We can all watch in private,
in our own time and space,

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.496
and no one need ever know
that we've clicked on the screen to watch.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.496
This sense of separation --

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.496
from other people,
from the event itself --

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.096
seems to be key to understanding
our ability to watch,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.376
and there are several ways

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.656
in which the Internet
creates a sense of detachment

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.280
that seems to erode
individual moral responsibility.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.376
Our activities online
are often contrasted with real life,

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.480
as though the things we do online
are somehow less real.
