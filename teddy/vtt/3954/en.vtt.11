00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.216
Weidmann was due to be executed
at the crack of dawn,

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.416
as was customary at the time,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.016
but his executioner was new to the job,

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.896
and he'd underestimated
how long it would take him to prepare.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.056
So Weidmann was executed
at 4:30 in the morning,

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.456
by which time on a June morning,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.040
there was enough light
to take photographs,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.016
and a spectator in the crowd
filmed the event,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.016
unbeknownst to the authorities.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.336
Several still photographs
were taken as well,
