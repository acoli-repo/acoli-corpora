that they were almost
fantasizing about and creating

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.341
without really understanding
what they were seeing,

00:15:12.365 --> 00:15:15.936
and all the while these vast --
I mean hundreds of thousands

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.096
of skulls in our museums,
all across Europe and the States --

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:25.376
were kind of upholding this Enlightenment
pursuit of scientific rationality.

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.456
