Evidence suggests
that throughout our history

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.896
of public beheadings
and public executions,

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.256
the vast majority of the people
who come to see

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.480
are either enthusiastic
or, at best, unmoved.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.136
Disgust has been comparatively rare,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.376
and even when people
are disgusted and are horrified,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.440
it doesn't always stop them
from coming out all the same to watch.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.816
Perhaps the most striking example

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.135
of the human ability to watch
a beheading and remain unmoved
