00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.080
There could be 40,000 or 50,000
to see a famous criminal killed.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.496
And a beheading, which was
a rare event in England at the time,

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.840
attracted even more.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.200
In May 1820,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.936
five men known as
the Cato Street Conspirators

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.096
were executed in London for plotting

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.720
to assassinate members
of the British government.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.096
They were hung and then decapitated.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.096
It was a gruesome scene.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.496
Each man's head was hacked off in turn
and held up to the crowd.
