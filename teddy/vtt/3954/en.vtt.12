Several still photographs
were taken as well,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.496
and you can still watch
the film online today

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.640
and look at the photographs.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.376
The crowd on the day
of Weidmann's execution

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.376
was called "unruly"
and "disgusting" by the press,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.576
but that was nothing compared
to the untold thousands of people

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.216
who could now study the action

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.456
over and over again,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.760
freeze-framed in every detail.
