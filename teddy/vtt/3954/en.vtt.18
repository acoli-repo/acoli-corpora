00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.896
where people were mutilated
and burned and pulled apart slowly.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.896
To them, watching
the guillotine in action,

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.096
it was so quick, there was nothing to see.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.336
The blade fell, the head fell
into a basket, out of sight immediately,

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.056
and they called out,

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.920
"Give me back my gallows,
give me back my wooden gallows."

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.536

judicial executions in Europe and America
