00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.216
For the last year,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.896
everyone's been watching the same show,

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.136
and I'm not talking
about "Game of Thrones,"

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.096
but a horrifying, real-life drama

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.376
that's proved too fascinating to turn off.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.096
It's a show produced by murderers

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.880
and shared around the world
via the Internet.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.536
Their names have become familiar:

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.456
James Foley, Steven Sotloff,
David Haines, Alan Henning, Peter Kassig,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.096
Haruna Yukawa, Kenji Goto Jogo.
