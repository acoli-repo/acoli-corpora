00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.536
The end of torturous public
judicial executions in Europe and America

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.496
was partly to do with being
more humane towards the criminal,

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.256
but it was also partly because the crowd
obstinately refused to behave

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.536
in the way that they should.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.896
All too often, execution day

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.080
was more like a carnival
than a solemn ceremony.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.336
Today, a public judicial execution
in Europe or America is unthinkable,

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.096
but there are other scenarios
that should make us cautious
