00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.096
We don't know exactly how many.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.776
Obviously, it's difficult to calculate.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.456
But a poll taken in the UK,
for example, in August 2014,

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.320
estimated that 1.2 million people

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.776
had watched the beheading of James Foley

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.440
in the few days after it was released.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.056
And that's just the first few days,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.280
and just Britain.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.096
