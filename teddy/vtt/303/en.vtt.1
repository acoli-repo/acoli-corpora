We used to think we're alone in this,
but now we know we're not.

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:34.300
We're not the only medical doctors.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.706
Now we know that there's a lot of animals
out there that can do it too.

00:00:37.706 --> 00:00:39.330
Most famous, perhaps, chimpanzees.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.831
Not so much different from us,

00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:43.696
they can use plants
to treat their intestinal parasites.

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:47.143
But the last few decades have shown us
that other animals can do it too:

00:00:47.143 --> 00:00:50.522
elephants, porcupines,
sheep, goats, you name it.

00:00:50.522 --> 00:00:54.161
And even more interesting than that
is that recent discoveries are telling us

00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:59.603
that insects and other little animals with
smaller brains can use medication too.

00:00:59.603 --> 00:01:02.132
The problem with infectious diseases,
as we all know,
