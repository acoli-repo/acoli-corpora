00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.720
So infectious diseases, right?

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.870
Infectious diseases 
are still the main cause

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.197
of human suffering and death 
around the world.

00:00:06.197 --> 00:00:11.367
Every year, millions of people die
of diseases such as T.B., malaria, HIV,

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:13.713
around the world 
and even in the United States.

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:17.319
Every year, thousands of Americans
die of seasonal flu.

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:19.474
Now of course, humans,
we are creative. Right?

00:00:19.474 --> 00:00:22.799
We have come up with ways to protect
ourselves against these diseases.

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:24.104
We have drugs and vaccines.

00:00:24.104 --> 00:00:27.489
And we're conscious --
we learn from our experiences

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.416
and come up with creative solutions.

00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:32.481
We used to think we're alone in this,
but now we know we're not.
