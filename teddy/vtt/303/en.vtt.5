00:02:29.094 --> 00:02:31.316
In fact, monarchs
can take up the chemicals,

00:02:31.316 --> 00:02:33.724
put it in their own bodies,
and it makes them toxic

00:02:33.724 --> 00:02:36.003
against their predators, such as birds.

00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:38.377
And what they do, then,
is advertise this toxicity

00:02:38.377 --> 00:02:40.398
through their beautiful
warning colorations

00:02:40.398 --> 00:02:42.476
with this orange, black and white.

00:02:42.476 --> 00:02:46.348
So what I did during my job
is grow plants in the greenhouse,

00:02:46.348 --> 00:02:48.094
different ones, different milkweeds.

00:02:48.094 --> 00:02:50.848
Some were toxic, including
the tropical milkweed,

00:02:50.848 --> 00:02:54.137
with very high concentrations
of these cardenolides.

00:02:54.137 --> 00:02:55.315
And some were not toxic.

00:02:55.315 --> 00:02:57.635
And then I fed them to monarchs.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:03:00.258
Some of the monarchs were healthy.
They had no disease.
