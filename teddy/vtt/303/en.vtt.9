00:04:27.048 --> 00:04:30.392
is they're laying 68 percent
of their eggs in the medicinal milkweed.

00:04:30.392 --> 00:04:34.612
Intriguingly, what they do
is they actually transmit the parasites

00:04:34.612 --> 00:04:36.077
when they're laying the eggs.

00:04:36.077 --> 00:04:37.512
They cannot prevent this.

00:04:37.512 --> 00:04:39.443
They can also not medicate themselves.

00:04:39.443 --> 00:04:41.680
But what these experiments tell us

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.509
is that these monarchs, these mothers,
can lay their eggs on medicinal milkweed

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.148
that will make their
future offspring less sick.

00:04:51.058 --> 00:04:53.581
Now, this is a really
important discovery, I think,

00:04:53.581 --> 00:04:56.415
not just because it tells us
something cool about nature,

00:04:56.415 --> 00:05:00.101
but also because it may tell us something
more about how we should find drugs.
