00:02:57.635 --> 00:03:00.258
Some of the monarchs were healthy.
They had no disease.

00:03:00.258 --> 00:03:02.033
But some of the monarchs were sick,

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:05.056
and what I found is that
some of these milkweeds are medicinal,

00:03:05.056 --> 00:03:08.293
meaning they reduce the disease symptoms
in the monarch butterflies,

00:03:08.293 --> 00:03:11.410
meaning these monarchs can live longer
when they are infected

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.324
when feeding on these medicinal plants.

00:03:13.324 --> 00:03:16.035
And when I found this, I had this idea,

00:03:16.035 --> 00:03:18.343
and a lot of people said
it was a crazy idea,

00:03:18.343 --> 00:03:20.817
but I thought, 
what if monarchs can use this?

00:03:20.817 --> 00:03:23.876
What if they can use these plants
as their own form of medicine?

00:03:23.876 --> 00:03:26.478
What if they can act as medical doctors?

00:03:26.828 --> 00:03:28.854
So my team and I
started doing experiments.

00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:30.655
In the first types of experiments,
