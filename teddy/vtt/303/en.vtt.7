00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:30.655
In the first types of experiments,

00:03:30.655 --> 00:03:32.825
we had caterpillars,
and gave them a choice:

00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:35.566
medicinal milkweed versus
non-medicinal milkweed.

00:03:35.566 --> 00:03:39.186
And then we measured how much they ate
of each species over their lifetime.

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:42.200
And the result, as so often 
in science, was boring:

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.451
Fifty percent of their food was medicinal.
Fifty percent was not.

00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:49.721
These caterpillars didn't do
anything for their own welfare.

00:03:50.611 --> 00:03:52.686
So then we moved on to adult butterflies,

00:03:52.686 --> 00:03:54.577
and we started asking the question

00:03:54.577 --> 00:03:57.735
whether it's the mothers
that can medicate their offspring.

00:03:57.735 --> 00:04:00.509
Can the mothers lay their eggs
on medicinal milkweed
