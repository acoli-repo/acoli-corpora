00:04:56.415 --> 00:05:00.101
but also because it may tell us something
more about how we should find drugs.

00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:02.101
Now, these are animals that are very small

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:04.200
and we tend to think of them
as very simple.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.757
They have tiny little brains,

00:05:05.757 --> 00:05:08.181
yet they can do this
very sophisticated medication.

00:05:08.811 --> 00:05:11.389
Now, we know that even today,
most of our drugs

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.148
derive from natural products,
including plants,

00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:15.760
and in indigenous cultures,

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.595
traditional healers often look
at animals to find new drugs.

00:05:18.595 --> 00:05:22.002
In this way, elephants have told us
how to treat stomach upset,

00:05:22.002 --> 00:05:25.291
and porcupines have told people
how to treat bloody diarrhea.

00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:27.946
What I think is important, 
though, is to move beyond

00:05:27.946 --> 00:05:31.754
these large-brained mammals
and give these guys more credit,
