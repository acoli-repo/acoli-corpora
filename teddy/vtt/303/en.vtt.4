00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:01.619
And this is really detrimental
to the monarch.

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.267
It shortens their lifespan,

00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:05.372
it reduces their ability to fly,

00:02:05.372 --> 00:02:07.879
it can even kill them
before they're even adults.

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:09.760
Very detrimental parasite.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.916
As part of my job, I spend a lot of time
in the greenhouse growing plants,

00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:17.469
and the reason for this is that monarchs
are extremely picky eaters.

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.464
They only eat milkweed as larvae.

00:02:19.464 --> 00:02:22.549
Luckily, there are several
species of milkweed that they can use,

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.905
and all these milkweeds
have cardenolides in them.

00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:26.699
These are chemicals that are toxic.

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.094
They're toxic to most animals,
but not to monarchs.

00:02:29.094 --> 00:02:31.316
In fact, monarchs
can take up the chemicals,
