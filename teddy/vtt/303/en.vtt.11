00:05:27.946 --> 00:05:31.754
these large-brained mammals
and give these guys more credit,

00:05:31.754 --> 00:05:34.656
these simple animals, these insects
that we tend to think of

00:05:34.656 --> 00:05:37.905
as very, very simple
with tiny little brains.

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:41.876
The discovery that these animals
can also use medication

00:05:41.876 --> 00:05:44.355
opens up completely new avenues,

00:05:44.355 --> 00:05:49.069
and I think that maybe one day,
we will be treating human diseases

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:52.178
with drugs that were first
discovered by butterflies,

00:05:52.178 --> 00:05:56.153
and I think that is an amazing opportunity
worth pursuing.

00:05:56.153 --> 00:05:58.316
Thank you so much.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:02.821
