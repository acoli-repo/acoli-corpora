The problem with infectious diseases,
as we all know,

00:01:02.132 --> 00:01:04.081
is that pathogens continue to evolve,

00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:06.317
and a lot of the drugs
that we have developed

00:01:06.317 --> 00:01:07.976
are losing their efficacy.

00:01:07.976 --> 00:01:12.209
And therefore, there is this great need
to find new ways to discover drugs

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:14.113
that we can use against our diseases.

00:01:14.113 --> 00:01:16.667
Now, I think that we
should look at these animals,

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:19.801
and we can learn from them
how to treat our own diseases.

As a biologist, I have been studying
monarch butterflies for the last 10 years.

00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:27.999
Now, monarchs are extremely famous
for their spectacular migrations

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:31.109
from the U.S. and Canada
down to Mexico every year,
