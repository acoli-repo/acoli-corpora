Can the mothers lay their eggs
on medicinal milkweed

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.708
that will make their
future offspring less sick?

00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:06.236
We have done these experiments now
over several years,

00:04:06.236 --> 00:04:08.024
and always get the same results.

00:04:08.024 --> 00:04:10.186
What we do is we put
a monarch in a big cage,

00:04:10.186 --> 00:04:13.669
a medicinal plant on one side,
a non-medicinal plant on the other side,

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:18.245
and then we measure the number of eggs
that the monarchs lay on each plant.

00:04:18.245 --> 00:04:21.354
And what we find when we do that
is always the same.

00:04:21.354 --> 00:04:24.947
What we find is that the monarchs
strongly prefer the medicinal milkweed.

00:04:24.947 --> 00:04:27.048
In other words,
what these females are doing

00:04:27.048 --> 00:04:30.392
is they're laying 68 percent
of their eggs in the medicinal milkweed.
