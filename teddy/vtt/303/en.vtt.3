00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:31.109
from the U.S. and Canada
down to Mexico every year,

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.129
where millions of them come together,

00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:35.660
but it's not why I started studying them.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.051
I study monarchs because they get sick.

00:01:38.051 --> 00:01:40.513
They get sick like you.
They get sick like me.

00:01:40.513 --> 00:01:43.200
And I think what they do
can tell us a lot about drugs

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.412
that we can develop for humans.

00:01:45.412 --> 00:01:47.847
Now, the parasites
that monarchs get infected with

00:01:47.847 --> 00:01:51.726
are called ophryocystis elektroscirrha --
a mouthful.

00:01:51.726 --> 00:01:53.492
What they do is they produce spores,

00:01:53.492 --> 00:01:55.884
millions of spores
on the outside of the butterfly

00:01:55.884 --> 00:01:59.261
that are shown as little specks
in between the scales of the butterfly.

00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:01.619
And this is really detrimental
to the monarch.
