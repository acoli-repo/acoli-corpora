00:00:00.142 --> 00:00:03.206
So I'm a doctor, but I kind of slipped
sideways into research,

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.928
and now I'm an epidemiologist.

00:00:04.952 --> 00:00:07.096
And nobody really knows
what epidemiology is.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.273
Epidemiology is the science
of how we know in the real world

00:00:10.297 --> 00:00:12.407
if something is good
for you or bad for you.

00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:14.391
And it's best understood through example

00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:19.066
as the science of those crazy,
wacky newspaper headlines.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.423
And these are just some of the examples.

00:00:21.447 --> 00:00:22.897
These are from the Daily Mail.

00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:25.440
Every country in the world
has a newspaper like this.

00:00:25.464 --> 00:00:27.814
It has this bizarre,
ongoing philosophical project

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:30.193
of dividing all the inanimate
objects in the world
