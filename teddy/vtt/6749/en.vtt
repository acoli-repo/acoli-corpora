00:00:04.246 --> 00:00:07.871
My father was only 32 years old

00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:11.454
when he designed the first
glass office tower in Brazil.

00:00:12.038 --> 00:00:16.329
It was 24 stories above
our city of São Paulo,

00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:18.663
and it was known as “Pele de Vidro” --

00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:20.704
“Skin of Glass.”

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.163
It was the golden age of architecture,

00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:26.163
a time of great hope and optimism.

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.162
Our new capital, Brasília,
was designed by Oscar Niemeyer.
