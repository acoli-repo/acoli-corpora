00:07:58.942 --> 00:08:01.116
all of a sudden,

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.306
things started to go wrong
all over the place,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.506
and their basic business practices

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.982
get looked at in a completely
different light,

00:08:09.006 --> 00:08:10.910
and you see that, "Oh, wait a minute,

00:08:10.934 --> 00:08:13.331
the cost of getting here
is higher than it looks."

00:08:13.355 --> 00:08:14.839
CA: A bunch of things happened,

00:08:14.863 --> 00:08:17.807
where they were basically
exploited by bad actors.

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:20.613
So, there's the Cambridge Analytica story,

00:08:20.637 --> 00:08:25.863
where data was sold "innocently"
for academic purposes,

00:08:25.887 --> 00:08:28.387
and then abused.

00:08:28.411 --> 00:08:30.252
Should Facebook have seen that coming?
