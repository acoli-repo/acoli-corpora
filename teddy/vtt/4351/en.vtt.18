00:08:58.167 --> 00:09:00.653
and they figured out a way
to get at friends' lists.

00:09:00.677 --> 00:09:02.934
And they began a campaign
of sharing the data.

00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.076
The Federal Trade Commission goes, "No."

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.569
They do a consent decree in 2011
that basically says

00:09:08.593 --> 00:09:12.330
there has to be informed prior consent
before anybody's data is shared.

00:09:12.354 --> 00:09:14.558
My understanding -- I can't prove this --

00:09:14.582 --> 00:09:17.346
my understanding is that Facebook
essentially moved forward

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.228
as though there was no consent decree.

00:09:19.252 --> 00:09:23.831
And continued to operate through 2014
with that basic notion of,

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:26.165
if there was a way to gain
competitive advantage

00:09:26.189 --> 00:09:29.077
by the trading of user data,
they were going to do it.

00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:33.983
And privacy was not a consideration
that was in the discussion.
