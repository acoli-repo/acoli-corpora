00:15:28.275 --> 00:15:30.497
it is not at all inconceivable

00:15:30.521 --> 00:15:35.147
that the Trump election campaign
over Facebook played a huge role

00:15:35.171 --> 00:15:36.425
in deciding the outcome.

00:15:36.449 --> 00:15:38.124
And what I'm saying here

00:15:38.148 --> 00:15:41.601
is that if we look
at the Russian part of it,

00:15:41.625 --> 00:15:45.616
stamping that out, stamping out
foreign engagement in our elections

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.119
is really essential.

00:15:47.143 --> 00:15:52.897
But I think it's just as important
to prevent manipulation domestically

00:15:52.921 --> 00:15:57.569
that is designed to, you know, discourage
people from voting, or whatever.

00:15:57.593 --> 00:16:00.381
You can say, "Well, there's
always been voter suppression,"
