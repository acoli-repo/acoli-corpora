00:13:28.331 --> 00:13:30.450
And my simple point to them was,

00:13:30.474 --> 00:13:32.585
"If I'm right, this is
not going to end well.

00:13:32.609 --> 00:13:35.236
You should protect your brand,
protect your reputation."

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.371
CA: And I'm sure if they had
their time over,

00:13:37.395 --> 00:13:38.864
they would probably agree that

00:13:38.888 --> 00:13:41.776
"We screwed up, we absolutely
should have got ahead of this."

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.686
And I think it's fair to say that now,
the company has taken at least some steps.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:46.861
RM: Oh, for sure.

00:13:46.885 --> 00:13:48.317
CA: Like we heard on Monday,

00:13:48.341 --> 00:13:50.832
Carole Cadwalladr's --
who's here in the audience --

00:13:50.856 --> 00:13:52.722
extraordinary talk about horrifying ads

00:13:52.746 --> 00:13:54.746
that were placed during
the Brexit campaign

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.760
that were never fully accounted for.

00:13:56.784 --> 00:14:01.035
A Facebook employee spoke to me afterwards
and said that may have been true then.
