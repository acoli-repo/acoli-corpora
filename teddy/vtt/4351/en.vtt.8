00:03:57.511 --> 00:04:00.632
The first was during the 2016
Democratic primary in New Hampshire,

00:04:00.656 --> 00:04:03.799
when I saw a Facebook group
associated notionally

00:04:03.823 --> 00:04:05.695
with the Bernie Sanders campaign

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:09.271
distributing misogynistic memes,

00:04:09.295 --> 00:04:12.022
and they were spreading virally
among my friend group,

00:04:12.046 --> 00:04:15.676
in a way that suggests that somebody
was spending money to make them happen.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.096
To get people into the group.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.850
And then, the second thing
was just a couple months later.

00:04:19.874 --> 00:04:21.930
A corporation was expelled from Facebook

00:04:21.954 --> 00:04:25.038
for using the ad tools to get data

00:04:25.062 --> 00:04:28.204
about anyone who expressed an interest
in Black Lives Matter.

00:04:28.228 --> 00:04:31.045
And they were then
selling that data to police departments.
