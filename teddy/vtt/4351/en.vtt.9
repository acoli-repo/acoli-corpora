00:04:28.228 --> 00:04:31.045
And they were then
selling that data to police departments.

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.607
Now Facebook did the right thing,
they expelled them,

00:04:33.631 --> 00:04:35.331
but the damage had been done.

00:04:35.355 --> 00:04:37.529
These people's civil rights
had been violated.

00:04:37.553 --> 00:04:40.022
And those two things really set me back.

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:42.950
CA: And so, did you raise
your concerns with Facebook,

00:04:42.974 --> 00:04:44.839
to try and find out what had happened?

00:04:44.863 --> 00:04:47.164
RM: At the beginning,
I didn't have enough data.

00:04:47.188 --> 00:04:48.609
And then, almost immediately,

00:04:48.633 --> 00:04:52.228
the United Kingdom had its referendum
on leaving the European Union, Brexit.

00:04:52.252 --> 00:04:54.882
And Brexit was when
I started to see, "Oh my God,

00:04:54.906 --> 00:04:58.540
the ad tools, the same thing
that makes posts viral,

00:04:58.564 --> 00:05:01.738
can be used in an electoral context."
