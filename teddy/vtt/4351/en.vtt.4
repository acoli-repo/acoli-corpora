or encouraged him not to,

00:02:01.212 --> 00:02:05.633
you introduced him to Sheryl Sandberg
and urged him to hire her.

00:02:05.657 --> 00:02:07.828
You became an investor in Facebook

00:02:07.852 --> 00:02:10.220
and a passionate believer in the company.

00:02:10.244 --> 00:02:12.403
You stepped back a bit
from direct involvement

00:02:12.427 --> 00:02:14.529
as being a direct adviser to Mark,

00:02:14.553 --> 00:02:15.724
and watched,

00:02:15.748 --> 00:02:17.990
and then this spring,
you came out with a book,

00:02:18.014 --> 00:02:21.829
and the title of the book was not
"My Brilliant Friend, Mark Zuckerberg."

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.480
It was, "Zucked: Waking Up
to the Facebook Catastrophe."

00:02:27.504 --> 00:02:31.553
At first glance, that seems
like a pretty major betrayal.
