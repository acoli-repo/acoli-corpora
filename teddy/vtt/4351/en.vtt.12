00:05:58.418 --> 00:06:01.593
When you actually look at the numbers,
if that was their intention,

00:06:01.617 --> 00:06:03.184
they shockingly undercharged,

00:06:03.208 --> 00:06:05.879
because I think the Russians spent --

00:06:05.903 --> 00:06:08.799
the number I saw
was like 100,000 dollars or less.

00:06:08.823 --> 00:06:11.968
For that, they reached
more than 100 million --

00:06:11.992 --> 00:06:13.831
RM: 126 million.

00:06:13.855 --> 00:06:15.029
CA: ... Americans.

00:06:15.053 --> 00:06:17.462
RM: In an election
where 137 million people voted.

00:06:17.486 --> 00:06:20.022
CA: That is either the most
cost-effective advertizing

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.133
ever invented in the history
of the planet,

00:06:22.157 --> 00:06:24.423
or a complete screw up.

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.768
There's no scenario that you think
that that was intended --

00:06:27.792 --> 00:06:30.886
RM: Facebook is the greatest
advertizing platform ever invented.
