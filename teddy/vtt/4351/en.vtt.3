00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:31.442
Namely, how did the big, beautiful
dream of technology connecting the world

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:32.616

00:01:33.014 --> 00:01:35.480
And what on earth can we do about it?

00:01:36.251 --> 00:01:39.574
In the audience were several

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:42.578
and they ended up chipping in
themselves, toward the end.

00:01:42.955 --> 00:01:44.889
Here is how it all went down.

00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:48.058

CA: Just to summarize it,

a little more than a decade ago,
you met Mark Zuckerberg,

00:01:57.316 --> 00:01:59.816
you persuaded him not to take
a billion-dollar offer,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.188
or encouraged him not to,
