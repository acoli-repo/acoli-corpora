00:09:59.784 --> 00:10:02.303
I sent this op-ed I was drafting --

00:10:02.327 --> 00:10:04.092
CA: The 30th of October 2016?

00:10:04.116 --> 00:10:06.619
RM: 2016, so it's nine days
before the election.

00:10:06.643 --> 00:10:10.302
It basically focuses on the issue
with the Bernie Sanders campaign,

00:10:10.326 --> 00:10:12.379
it focuses on the Black Lives Matter,

00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:15.603
on Brexit and on the housing
urban development.

00:10:16.014 --> 00:10:17.625
And I basically say, "Look, guys,

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:19.847
I think there is a problem
with the algorithms,

00:10:19.871 --> 00:10:21.879
there's a problem with the business model,

00:10:21.903 --> 00:10:23.506
you've got to get on top of this.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.918
I'm not thinking it's going to affect
the outcome of the 2016 election,

00:10:26.942 --> 00:10:28.664
I'm just reaching out to my friends

00:10:28.688 --> 00:10:32.561
with what I perceive as this failure mode
that's suddenly being exposed."
