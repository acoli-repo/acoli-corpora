00:14:29.102 --> 00:14:30.609
and I really applaud that.

00:14:30.633 --> 00:14:34.633
I wish Google were as engaged
in this conversation as Mark is.

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:38.975
I believe Mark
wants to solve this problem.

00:14:39.582 --> 00:14:44.081
What I'm afraid is that the underlying
business model is the root cause.

00:14:44.105 --> 00:14:46.728
CA: It seems to be possible
to imagine a business model

00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:48.585
that is based on advertising,

00:14:48.609 --> 00:14:53.458
but that says you can't place
misleading political ads.

00:14:53.482 --> 00:14:56.299
That that in itself would not cripple
the business model,

00:14:56.323 --> 00:14:59.680
and that's what they have
sought, at least, to do,

00:14:59.704 --> 00:15:03.434
is to put strong limits on the types
of political ads that could be placed now.
