Welcome to The TED Interview.

00:00:07.595 --> 00:00:11.561
This is the podcast series
where I get to sit down with a TED speaker

00:00:11.585 --> 00:00:13.823
and dive much deeper into their ideas

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:16.505
than was possible
during their short TED talk.

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.895
(Music)

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.482
