Should Facebook have seen that coming?

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:31.446
Possibly.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.030
But at some point,

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:35.921
they must have had
this sickening realization,

00:08:35.945 --> 00:08:39.837
"Holy crap, look what's happened.

00:08:40.172 --> 00:08:43.299
Even if money was their motive,
they got almost no money for this.

00:08:43.323 --> 00:08:47.156
But they allowed themselves
to be exploited to a spectacular degree.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.190
RM: The way I look at that experience was,

00:08:50.214 --> 00:08:55.833
when Zynga came along with FarmVille
and the poker game,

00:08:55.857 --> 00:08:58.143
they essentially
reverse engineered Facebook,

00:08:58.167 --> 00:09:00.653
and they figured out a way
to get at friends' lists.
