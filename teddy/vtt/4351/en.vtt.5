At first glance, that seems
like a pretty major betrayal.

00:02:32.148 --> 00:02:35.687
And your contention is that it's not you
who did the betraying.

00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:37.727
RM: Well, here's what I believe --

00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:40.441
and I think I can always be criticized --

00:02:40.465 --> 00:02:43.172
but when I met Mark, he was 22.

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:46.617
I thought he was different
from the other entrepreneurs of that era.

00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:47.817
If you think about it,

00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:50.320
the big success stories
out of Silicon Valley

00:02:50.344 --> 00:02:52.608
over the past dozen years

00:02:52.632 --> 00:02:56.364
have included companies
like Uber and Airbnb and Lyft,

00:02:56.388 --> 00:02:58.713
companies like Spotify,
which is not based there,

00:02:58.737 --> 00:03:00.506
but comes out of that same ecosystem.
