A Facebook employee spoke to me afterwards
and said that may have been true then.

00:14:01.059 --> 00:14:06.180
Now, it is impossible to buy
political ads in that way.

00:14:06.204 --> 00:14:09.657
Do you agree that at least
with respect to this specific case,

00:14:09.681 --> 00:14:11.935
that they have taken
some preventative measures?

00:14:11.959 --> 00:14:13.119
RM: They have.

00:14:13.143 --> 00:14:16.166
But what they've done is to protect
against the repeat of 2016

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:19.435
without thinking about
the dynamic system that is Facebook,

00:14:19.459 --> 00:14:22.515
and how many other ways there are
to accomplish that same thing.

00:14:22.539 --> 00:14:24.754
So here's what I give Mark
enormous credit for.

00:14:24.778 --> 00:14:26.609
Mark is out, speaking publicly,

00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:29.078
which is not a natural place for him,

00:14:29.102 --> 00:14:30.609
and I really applaud that.
