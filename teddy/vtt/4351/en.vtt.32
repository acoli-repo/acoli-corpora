You can say, "Well, there's
always been voter suppression,"

00:16:00.405 --> 00:16:03.315
I'm going, "But there have never been
tools like this before."

00:16:03.339 --> 00:16:06.061
And I think you just have to step back
and have the debate

00:16:06.085 --> 00:16:07.831
about what is democracy?

00:16:07.855 --> 00:16:10.410
How important is it to get
everybody to be registered?

00:16:10.434 --> 00:16:12.537
How important is it
to get everybody to vote?

00:16:12.561 --> 00:16:14.947
How important is it to have
a level playing field,

00:16:14.971 --> 00:16:16.792
where, what I would point out, Chris,

00:16:16.816 --> 00:16:19.689
is that there was roughly a 17-1 advantage

00:16:19.713 --> 00:16:23.156
to Trump's advertising
on Facebook over Clinton's,

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.155
in part because the nature of the message

00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:28.821
was perfectly tuned to its audience;
it was much more viral.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.982
And I don't want to relitigate 2016.
