00:02:58.737 --> 00:03:00.506
but comes out of that same ecosystem.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.290
And there were two
core driving principles.

00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:06.014
One was that laws didn't apply.

00:03:06.038 --> 00:03:08.871
So you had a set of people
whose basic principle

00:03:08.895 --> 00:03:12.347
was that the laws that govern the economy
in their sector didn't apply.

00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:14.807
That would be Uber, Lyft, Airbnb,

00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:17.745
or ones who said, "I can develop
an information advantage

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.118
over one of the other
constituencies in my ecosystem,"

00:03:21.142 --> 00:03:23.412
which would be Spotify,
the fintech companies,

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:26.087
and also Uber and Lyft,
relative to drivers.

00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:27.977
I thought Mark was different than that.

00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:30.331
And I was a huge, huge
believer in the company.
