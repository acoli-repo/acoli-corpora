00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.056
bringing together leading
AI researchers and other thinkers

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.816
to discuss how to grow this wisdom
we need to keep AI beneficial.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.136
Our last conference
was in Asilomar, California last year

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.216
and produced this list of 23 principles

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.136
which have since been signed
by over 1,000 AI researchers

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.456
and key industry leaders,

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.656
and I want to tell you
about three of these principles.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.640
One is that we should avoid an arms race
and lethal autonomous weapons.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.096
The idea here is that any science
can be used for new ways of helping people

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.656
or new ways of harming people.
