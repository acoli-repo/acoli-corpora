or to give humans income
and purpose with our jobs,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.136
but AGI will in any case
transform life as we know it

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.896
with humans no longer being
the most intelligent.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.616
Now, if the water level does reach AGI,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.936
then further AI progress will be driven
mainly not by humans but by AI,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.816
which means that there's a possibility

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.176
that further AI progress
could be way faster

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.576
than the typical human research
and development timescale of years,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.616
raising the controversial possibility
of an intelligence explosion

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.936
