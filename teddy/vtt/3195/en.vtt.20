I think that if we can grow
the economic pie dramatically with AI

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.096
and we still can't figure out
how to divide this pie

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.696
so that everyone is better off,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.976
then shame on us.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.096
(Applause)

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.720
Alright, now raise your hand
if your computer has ever crashed.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.736
(Laughter)

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.416
Wow, that's a lot of hands.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.616
Well, then you'll appreciate
this principle

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.776
that we should invest much more
in AI safety research,

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.456
because as we put AI in charge
of even more decisions and infrastructure,

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.096
we need to figure out how to transform
today's buggy and hackable computers
