I think of us humans as "Life 2.0"
because we can learn,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.656
which we in nerdy, geek speak,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.896
might think of as installing
new software into our brains,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.040
like languages and job skills.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.976
"Life 3.0," which can design not only
its software but also its hardware

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.656
of course doesn't exist yet.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.456
But perhaps our technology
has already made us "Life 2.1,"

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.816
with our artificial knees,
pacemakers and cochlear implants.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.720
So let's take a closer look
at our relationship with technology, OK?

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.016
As an example,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.336
the Apollo 11 moon mission
was both successful and inspiring,
