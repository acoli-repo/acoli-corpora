ignored it all and became the world's best
player by just playing against itself.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.496
And the most impressive feat here
wasn't that it crushed human gamers,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.096
but that it crushed human AI researchers

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.800
who had spent decades
handcrafting game-playing software.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.856
And AlphaZero crushed human AI researchers
not just in Go but even at chess,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.360
which we have been working on since 1950.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.240

really begs the question:

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.840
How far will it go?

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.496
I like to think about this question

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.496
in terms of this abstract
landscape of tasks,
