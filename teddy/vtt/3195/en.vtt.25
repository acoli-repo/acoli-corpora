00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.336
to see that there's some some people
who want it to be just machines.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.056
(Laughter)

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.936
And there was total disagreement
about what the role of humans should be,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.936
even at the most basic level,

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.776
so let's take a closer look
at possible futures

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.536
that we might choose
to steer toward, alright?

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.896
So don't get me wrong here.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.976
I'm not talking about space travel,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.200
merely about humanity's
metaphorical journey into the future.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.416
So one option that some
of my AI colleagues like

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.056
is to build superintelligence
and keep it under human control,

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.816
like an enslaved god,

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.416
disconnected from the internet
