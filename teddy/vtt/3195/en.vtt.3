00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.336
we can accomplish things
that our ancestors could only dream of.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.336

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.040

where the passengers
aren't just three astronauts

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.336
but all of humanity.

journey into the future

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.320
with artificial intelligence.

My friend Jaan Tallinn likes to point out
that just as with rocketry,
