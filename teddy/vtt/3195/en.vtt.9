00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.370
How high will the water end up rising?

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.640
Will it eventually rise
to flood everything,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.336
matching human intelligence at all tasks.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.096
This is the definition
of artificial general intelligence --

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.416
AGI,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.520
which has been the holy grail
of AI research since its inception.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.776
By this definition, people who say,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.216
"Ah, there will always be jobs
that humans can do better than machines,"

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.160
are simply saying
that we'll never get AGI.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.256
Sure, we might still choose
to have some human jobs

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.376
or to give humans income
and purpose with our jobs,
