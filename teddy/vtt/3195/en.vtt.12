And recent surveys have shown
that most AI researchers

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.576
actually share Demis's optimism,

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.680
expecting that we will
get AGI within decades,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.896

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.880
which begs the question -- and then what?

What do we want the role of humans to be

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.960
if machines can do everything better
and cheaper than us?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.576
One option is to be complacent.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.376
We can say, "Oh, let's just build machines
that can do everything we can do
