00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.416
disconnected from the internet

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.696
and used to create unimaginable
technology and wealth

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.960
for whoever controls it.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.256
But Lord Acton warned us

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.896
that power corrupts,
and absolute power corrupts absolutely,

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.976
so you might worry that maybe
we humans just aren't smart enough,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.536
or wise enough rather,

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.800
to handle this much power.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.176
Also, aside from any
moral qualms you might have

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.496
about enslaving superior minds,

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.496
you might worry that maybe
the superintelligence could outsmart us,

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.760
break out and take over.
