00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.136
if -- and this is a big if --

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.616
if we win the wisdom race --

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.496
the race between the growing
power of our technology

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.720
and the growing wisdom
with which we manage it.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.536
But this is going to require
a change of strategy

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.600
because our old strategy
has been learning from mistakes.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.816
We invented fire,

screwed up a bunch of times --

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.216
invented the fire extinguisher.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.576
(Laughter)

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.016
We invented the car,
screwed up a bunch of times --

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.707
invented the traffic light,
the seat belt and the airbag,

00:07:56.731 --> 00:08:00.576
but with more powerful technology
like nuclear weapons and AGI,
