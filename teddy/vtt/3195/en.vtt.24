motivated by curiosity and economics,

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.960
but what sort of future society
are we hoping for if we succeed?

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.616
We did an opinion poll on this recently,

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.856
and I was struck to see

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.776
that most people actually
want us to build superintelligence:

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.960
AI that's vastly smarter
than us in all ways.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.536
What there was the greatest agreement on
was that we should be ambitious

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.576
and help life spread into the cosmos,

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:25.096
but there was much less agreement
about who or what should be in charge.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.856
And I was actually quite amused

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.336
to see that there's some some people
who want it to be just machines.
