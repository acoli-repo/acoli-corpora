because I want to include both
biological and artificial intelligence.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.936
And I want to avoid
the silly carbon-chauvinism idea

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.320
that you can only be smart
if you're made of meat.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.056
It's really amazing how the power
of AI has grown recently.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.336
Just think about it.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.560
Not long ago, robots couldn't walk.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.760
Now, they can do backflips.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.896
Not long ago,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.680
we didn't have self-driving cars.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.400
Now, we have self-flying rockets.
