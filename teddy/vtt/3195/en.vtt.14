00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.016
but how can we steer towards a future

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.120
where AI helps humanity flourish
rather than flounder?

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.016
To help with this,

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.016
I cofounded the Future of Life Institute.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.816
It's a small nonprofit promoting
beneficial technology use,

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.576
and our goal is simply
for the future of life to exist

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.656
and to be as inspiring as possible.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.856
You know, I love technology.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.800
Technology is why today
is better than the Stone Age.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.680
And I'm optimistic that we can create
a really inspiring high-tech future ...

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.136
if -- and this is a big if --
