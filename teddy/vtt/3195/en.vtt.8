00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.496
in terms of this abstract
landscape of tasks,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.976
where the elevation represents
how hard it is for AI to do each task

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.216
at human level,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.000
and the sea level represents
what AI can do today.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.176
The sea level is rising
as AI improves,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.640
so there's a kind of global warming
going on here in the task landscape.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.375
And the obvious takeaway
is to avoid careers at the waterfront --

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.656
(Laughter)

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.536
which will soon be
automated and disrupted.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.536
But there's a much
bigger question as well.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.370
How high will the water end up rising?
