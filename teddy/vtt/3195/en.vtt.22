00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.736
we didn't do it because we were a bunch
of evil rhinoceros haters, did we?

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.816
We did it because
we were smarter than them

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.416
and our goals weren't aligned with theirs.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.096
But AGI is by definition smarter than us,

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.696
so to make sure that we don't put
ourselves in the position of those rhinos

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.696
if we create AGI,

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.896
we need to figure out how
to make machines understand our goals,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.080
adopt our goals and retain our goals.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.176
And whose goals should these be, anyway?

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.096
Which goals should they be?
