00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.376
We can say, "Oh, let's just build machines
that can do everything we can do

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.216
and not worry about the consequences.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.496
Come on, if we build technology
that makes all humans obsolete,

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.616
what could possibly go wrong?"

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.296
(Laughter)

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.080
But I think that would be
embarrassingly lame.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.576
I think we should be more ambitious --
in the spirit of TED.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.096
Let's envision a truly inspiring
high-tech future

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.520
and try to steer towards it.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.256
This brings us to the second part
of our rocket metaphor: the steering.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.176
We're making AI more powerful,

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:03.016
but how can we steer towards a future
