00:07:56.731 --> 00:08:00.576
but with more powerful technology
like nuclear weapons and AGI,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.976
learning from mistakes
is a lousy strategy,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.216
don't you think?

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.256
(Laughter)

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.856
It's much better to be proactive
rather than reactive;

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.176
plan ahead and get things

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.696
because that might be
the only time we'll get.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.056
But it is funny because
sometimes people tell me,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.816
"Max, shhh, don't talk like that.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.560
That's Luddite scaremongering."

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.576
But it's not scaremongering.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.480
It's what we at MIT
call safety engineering.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.416
Think about it:

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.656
before NASA launched
the Apollo 11 mission,
