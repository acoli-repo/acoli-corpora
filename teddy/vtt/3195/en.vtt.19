00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.656
or new ways of harming people.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.616
For example, biology and chemistry
are much more likely to be used

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.496
for new medicines or new cures
than for new ways of killing people,

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.696
because biologists
and chemists pushed hard --

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.976
and successfully --

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.176
for bans on biological
and chemical weapons.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.456
And in the same spirit,

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.920
most AI researchers want to stigmatize
and ban lethal autonomous weapons.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.416
Another Asilomar AI principle

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.136
is that we should mitigate
AI-fueled income inequality.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.616
I think that if we can grow
the economic pie dramatically with AI
