00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.936
where recursively self-improving AI

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.376
rapidly leaves human
intelligence far behind,

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.840
creating what's known
as superintelligence.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.080
Alright, reality check:

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.560
Are we going to get AGI any time soon?

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.056
Some famous AI researchers,
like Rodney Brooks,

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.576
think it won't happen
for hundreds of years.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.496
But others, like Google DeepMind
founder Demis Hassabis,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.776
are more optimistic

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.376
and are working to try to make
it happen much sooner.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.696
And recent surveys have shown
that most AI researchers
