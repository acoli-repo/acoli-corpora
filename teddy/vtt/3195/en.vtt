00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.176
After 13.8 billion years
of cosmic history,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.296
our universe has woken up

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.840
and become aware of itself.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.416
From a small blue planet,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.576
tiny, conscious parts of our universe
have begun gazing out into the cosmos

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.976
with telescopes,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.480
discovering something humbling.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.216
We've discovered that our universe
is vastly grander

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.576
than our ancestors imagined

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.856
and that life seems to be an almost
imperceptibly small perturbation

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.600
on an otherwise dead universe.
