00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.336
the poor are richer, the rich are richer,

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:34.320
everybody is healthy
and free to live out their dreams.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.536
Now, hang on.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:41.136
Do you folks want the future
that's politically right or left?

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.016
Do you want the pious society
with strict moral rules,

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.856
or do you an hedonistic free-for-all,

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.096
more like Burning Man 24/7?

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.536
Do you want beautiful beaches,
forests and lakes,

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.976
or would you prefer to rearrange
some of those atoms with the computers,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.715
enabling virtual experiences?

00:15:55.739 --> 00:15:58.896
With friendly AI, we could simply
build all of these societies

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.136
and give people the freedom
to choose which one they want to live in
