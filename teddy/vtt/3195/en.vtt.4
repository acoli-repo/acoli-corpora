My friend Jaan Tallinn likes to point out
that just as with rocketry,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.680
it's not enough to make
our technology powerful.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.735
We also have to figure out,
if we're going to be really ambitious,

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.175
how to steer it

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.880
and where we want to go with it.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.720
So let's talk about all three
for artificial intelligence:

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.496
the power, the steering
and the destination.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.806
Let's start with the power.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.696
I define intelligence very inclusively --

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.056
simply as our ability
to accomplish complex goals,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.896
because I want to include both
biological and artificial intelligence.
