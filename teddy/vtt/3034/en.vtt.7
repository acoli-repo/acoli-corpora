00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.776
And her eyes got really big
and she was like, "Yeah!"

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.056
So we dug a hole

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.816
and I covered her in sand and shells

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.640
and drew this little mermaid tail.

00:03:37.468 --> 00:03:40.176
And then I took her home
and lathered her up in the shower

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.456
and massaged her scalp

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.240
and I dried her off in a towel.

00:03:43.944 --> 00:03:45.136
And I thought,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.936
"Ah. How many times had I done that --

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.456
bathed her and dried her off --

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.936
but had I ever stopped and paid attention

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.600
to the sensations
that I was creating for her?"

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.256
I'd been treating her
like she was on some assembly line

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.400
of children needing to be fed
and put to bed.
