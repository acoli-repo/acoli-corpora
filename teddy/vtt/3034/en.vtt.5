Girls who were told
they were too sensitive, too much.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.496
Boys who were taught to man up --

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.256
"don't be so emotional."

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.880
I learned I was not alone in checking out.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.560
It was my daughter who reminded me

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.696
We were at the beach.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.056
It was this rare day.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.216
I turned off my cell phone,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.840
put in the calendar,
"Day at the beach with the girls."

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.440
I laid our towels down
just out of reach of the surf
