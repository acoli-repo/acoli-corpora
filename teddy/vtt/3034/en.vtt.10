00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.656
Finally she says,
"OK, up and to the right,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.920
like you're tickling me."

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.376
I run my fingertips up her spine.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.176
"What else?" I ask.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.120
"Over to the left, a little harder now."

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.976
We need to teach our children
how to articulate their sensations

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.640
so they're familiar with them.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.656
I look for ways to play games
with my girls at home to do this.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.256
I scratch my fingernails
on my daughter's arm and say,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.000
"Give me one word to describe this."

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.160
"Violent," she says.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.216
I embrace her, hold her tight.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.000
"Protected," she tells me.
