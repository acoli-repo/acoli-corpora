00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.456
And we do that in the ways
that we model touch, play,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.216
make eye contact --

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.560
all the ways that we engage their senses.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.936
We can teach our children
not just about sex,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.440
but about sensuality.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.456
This is the kind of talk
that I needed as a girl.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.816
I was extremely sensitive,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.576
but by the time I was an adolescent,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.096
I had numbed out.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.856
The shame of boys mocking my changing body

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.856
and then girls exiling me for,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.696
ironically, my interest in boys,

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.320
it was so much.
