00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.320
it was so much.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.816
I didn't have any language
for what I was experiencing;

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.536
I didn't know it was going to pass.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.096
So I did the best thing
I could at the time

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.320
and I checked out.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.576
And you can't isolate
just the difficult feelings,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.216
so I lost access to the joy,
the pleasure, the play,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.776
and I spent decades like that,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.496
with this his low-grade depression,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.040
thinking that this is
what it meant to be a grown-up.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.456
For the past year,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.696
I've been interviewing men and women
about their relationship to sex

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.656
and I've heard my story again and again.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.256
Girls who were told
they were too sensitive, too much.
