00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.496
I remember my aunt
brushing my hair when I was a child.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.616
I felt this tingling in my stomach,

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.720
this swelling in my belly.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.336
All her attention on me,

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.600
just me.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.136
My beautiful Aunt Bea,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.960
stroking my hair
with a fine-bristled brush.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.440
Do you have a memory like that
that you can feel in your body right now?

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.376
Before language,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.880
we're all sensation.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.856
As children, that's how we learn

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.576
to differentiate ourselves
in the world -- through touch.
