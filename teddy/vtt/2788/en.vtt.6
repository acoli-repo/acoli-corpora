If you'd asked my undergraduate professors

00:03:00.578 --> 00:03:05.337
what two subjects would I be least likely
to excel in after university,

00:03:05.361 --> 00:03:08.128
they'd have told you statistics
and computer programming,

00:03:08.152 --> 00:03:11.091
and yet here I am, about to show you
some statistical graphics

00:03:11.115 --> 00:03:12.317
that I programmed.

00:03:12.745 --> 00:03:14.500
So what inspired that change in me?

00:03:14.524 --> 00:03:18.172
What made me think that statistics
was actually an interesting thing?

00:03:18.196 --> 00:03:20.462
It's really because
statistics are about us.

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:23.451
If you look at the etymology
of the word statistics,

00:03:23.475 --> 00:03:26.084
it's the science of dealing with data

00:03:26.108 --> 00:03:28.538
about the state or the community
that we live in.

00:03:28.562 --> 00:03:31.916
So statistics are about us as a group,
