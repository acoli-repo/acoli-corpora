00:05:30.526 --> 00:05:35.859
And the average answer from the Saudis
was just over a quarter.

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:37.604
That's what they thought.

00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:40.196
Just over a quarter of adults
are overweight or obese.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.001
The official figures show, actually,
it's nearer to three-quarters.

00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:46.481
(Laughter)

00:05:46.505 --> 00:05:48.797
So again, a big variation.

00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:53.267
And I love this one: they asked in Japan,
they asked the Japanese,

00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:55.251
for every 100 Japanese people,

00:05:55.275 --> 00:05:57.876
how many of them live in rural areas?

00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:03.422
The average was about a 50-50 split,
just over halfway.
