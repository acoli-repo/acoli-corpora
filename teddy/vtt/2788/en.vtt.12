The average was about a 50-50 split,
just over halfway.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:07.593
They thought 56 out of every 100
Japanese people lived in rural areas.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:09.304
The official figure is seven.

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.709
So extraordinary variations,
and surprising to some,

00:06:14.733 --> 00:06:17.122
but not surprising to people
who have read the work

00:06:17.146 --> 00:06:21.538
of Daniel Kahneman, for example,
the Nobel-winning economist.

00:06:21.562 --> 00:06:26.654
He and his colleague, Amos Tversky,
spent years researching this disjoint

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:29.823
between what people perceive
and the reality,

00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:33.598
the fact that people are actually
pretty poor intuitive statisticians.
