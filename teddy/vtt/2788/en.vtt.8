00:03:58.876 --> 00:04:01.522
Now the average answer from this survey,

00:04:01.546 --> 00:04:04.958
which was supposed to be representative
of the total population, was 24.

00:04:04.982 --> 00:04:08.658
That's what people thought.

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:12.321
British people think 24 out of every 100
people in the country are Muslim.

00:04:12.345 --> 00:04:16.755
Now, official figures reveal
that figure to be about five.

00:04:17.732 --> 00:04:21.719
So there's this big variation
between what we think, our perception,

00:04:21.743 --> 00:04:23.781
and the reality as given by statistics.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.349
And I think that's interesting.

00:04:25.373 --> 00:04:28.663
What could possibly be causing
that misperception?

00:04:29.212 --> 00:04:31.066
And I was so thrilled with this study,
