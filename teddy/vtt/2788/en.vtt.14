I thought this was really interesting.

00:07:01.224 --> 00:07:03.234
I said, this is clearly a global problem,

00:07:03.258 --> 00:07:05.693
but maybe geography is the issue here.

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:09.626
These were questions that were all about,
how well do you know your country?

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.643
So in this case, it's how well
do you know 64 million people?

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:16.399
Not very well, it turns out.
I can't do that.

00:07:16.423 --> 00:07:17.747
So I had an idea,

00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:20.894
which was to think about
this same sort of approach

00:07:20.918 --> 00:07:23.023
but to think about it
in a very local sense.

00:07:23.047 --> 00:07:24.238
Is this a local?

00:07:24.262 --> 00:07:26.203
If we reframe the questions and say,

00:07:26.227 --> 00:07:28.349
how well do you know your local area,

00:07:28.373 --> 00:07:30.476
would your answers be any more accurate?
