00:09:55.521 --> 00:10:00.771
things like age -- there are clues
to whether a population is old or young.

00:10:00.795 --> 00:10:03.140
Just by looking around
the area, you can see it.

00:10:03.164 --> 00:10:06.555
Something like homeownership
is much more difficult to see,

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:09.187
so we revert to our own heuristics,

00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:13.662
our own biases about how many people
we think own their own homes.

00:10:13.686 --> 00:10:17.336
Now the truth is,
when we published this quiz,

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.896
the census data that it's based on
was already a few years old.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.489
We've had online applications
that allow you to put in a post code

00:10:24.513 --> 00:10:26.607
and get statistics back for years.

00:10:26.631 --> 00:10:27.820
So in some senses,

00:10:27.844 --> 00:10:31.393
this was all a little bit old
and not necessarily new.
