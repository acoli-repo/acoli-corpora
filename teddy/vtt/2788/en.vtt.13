00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:33.598
the fact that people are actually
pretty poor intuitive statisticians.

00:06:33.622 --> 00:06:35.382
And there are many reasons for this.

00:06:35.406 --> 00:06:38.521
Individual experiences, certainly,
can influence our perceptions,

00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:42.503
but so, too, can things like the media
reporting things by exception,

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:44.223
rather than what's normal.

00:06:44.855 --> 00:06:46.981
Kahneman had a nice way
of referring to that.

00:06:47.005 --> 00:06:49.090
He said, "We can be blind
to the obvious" --

00:06:49.114 --> 00:06:50.752
so we've got the numbers wrong --

00:06:50.776 --> 00:06:53.098
"but we can be blind
to our blindness about it."

00:06:53.122 --> 00:06:56.388
And that has enormous
repercussions for decision making.

00:06:56.412 --> 00:06:59.264
So at the statistics office
while this was all going on,

00:06:59.288 --> 00:07:01.200
I thought this was really interesting.
