This URL contains the words
"statistics," "gov" and "UK,"

00:11:00.429 --> 00:11:03.671
which are three of people's least
favorite words in a URL.

00:11:03.695 --> 00:11:07.680
And the amazing thing about this
was that the website came down

00:11:07.704 --> 00:11:09.797
at quarter to 10 at night,

00:11:09.821 --> 00:11:13.032
because people were actually
engaging with this data

00:11:13.056 --> 00:11:14.595
of their own free will,

00:11:14.619 --> 00:11:16.654
using their own personal time.

00:11:16.678 --> 00:11:19.165
I was very interested to see

00:11:19.189 --> 00:11:22.902
that we got something like
a quarter of a million people

00:11:22.926 --> 00:11:26.198
playing the quiz within the space
of 48 hours of launching it.

00:11:26.222 --> 00:11:30.149
And it sparked an enormous discussion
online, on social media,
