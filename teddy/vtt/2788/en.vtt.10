00:04:57.453 --> 00:05:01.366
the British public think that 15
out of every 100 teenage girls

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.683
get pregnant in the year.

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:05.660
And they had every right to be angry,

00:05:05.684 --> 00:05:08.442
because in fact, I'd have to have
closer to 200 dots

00:05:08.466 --> 00:05:10.036
before I could color one in,

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.575
in terms of what
the official figures tell us.

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.399
And rather like numeracy,
this is not just an English problem.

00:05:16.423 --> 00:05:20.927
Ipsos MORI expanded the survey
in recent years to go across the world.

00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:23.901
And so, they asked Saudi Arabians,

00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:26.446
for every 100 adults in your country,

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.343
how many of them are overweight or obese?
