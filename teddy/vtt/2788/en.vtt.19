Actually, in Exeter,
it's incredibly young,

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:34.874
and I had underestimated the impact
of the university in this area.

00:09:34.898 --> 00:09:36.929
The questions get harder
as you go through.

00:09:36.953 --> 00:09:39.336
So this one's now asking
about homeownership:

00:09:39.955 --> 00:09:43.654
For every 100 households, how many
are owned with a mortgage or loan?

00:09:43.678 --> 00:09:44.958
And I hedged my bets here,

00:09:44.982 --> 00:09:48.080
because I didn't want to be
more than 50 out on the answer.

00:09:48.104 --> 00:09:50.124
(Laughter)

00:09:50.148 --> 00:09:52.614
And actually, these get harder,
these questions,

00:09:52.638 --> 00:09:55.497
because when you're in an area,
when you're in a community,

00:09:55.521 --> 00:10:00.771
things like age -- there are clues
to whether a population is old or young.
