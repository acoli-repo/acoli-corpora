00:07:28.373 --> 00:07:30.476
would your answers be any more accurate?

00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:33.579
So I devised a quiz:

00:07:33.603 --> 00:07:35.462
How well do you know your area?

00:07:36.454 --> 00:07:38.343
It's a simple Web app.

00:07:38.367 --> 00:07:39.550
You put in a post code

00:07:39.574 --> 00:07:42.281
and then it will ask you questions
based on census data

00:07:42.305 --> 00:07:43.844
for your local area.

00:07:44.305 --> 00:07:46.428
And I was very conscious
in designing this.

00:07:46.452 --> 00:07:50.561
I wanted to make it open
to the widest possible range of people,

00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:53.413
not just the 49 percent
who can get the numbers.

00:07:53.437 --> 00:07:55.192
I wanted everyone to engage with it.

00:07:55.216 --> 00:07:56.741
So for the design of the quiz,

00:07:56.765 --> 00:08:00.380
I was inspired by the isotypes
