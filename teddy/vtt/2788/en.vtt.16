00:07:56.765 --> 00:08:00.380
I was inspired by the isotypes

00:08:00.404 --> 00:08:03.006
of Otto Neurath from the 1920s and '30s.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.378
Now, these are methods
for representing numbers

00:08:07.402 --> 00:08:09.175
using repeating icons.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.805
And the numbers are there,
but they sit in the background.

00:08:12.829 --> 00:08:15.552
So it's a great way
of representing quantity

00:08:15.576 --> 00:08:18.560
without resorting to using terms
like "percentage,"

00:08:18.584 --> 00:08:19.814
"fractions" and "ratios."

00:08:19.838 --> 00:08:21.540
So here's the quiz.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.957
The layout of the quiz is,

00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:26.800
you have your repeating icons
on the left-hand side there,

00:08:26.824 --> 00:08:29.947
and a map showing you the area
we're asking you questions about

00:08:29.971 --> 00:08:31.138
on the right-hand side.
