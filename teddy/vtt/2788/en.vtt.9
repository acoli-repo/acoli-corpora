00:04:29.212 --> 00:04:31.066
And I was so thrilled with this study,

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.570
I started to take questions out
in presentations. I was referring to it.

00:04:34.594 --> 00:04:35.812
Now, I did a presentation

00:04:35.836 --> 00:04:38.146
at St. Paul's School for Girls
in Hammersmith,

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.310
and I had an audience rather like this,

00:04:40.334 --> 00:04:44.202
except it was comprised entirely
of sixth-form girls.

00:04:44.226 --> 00:04:46.622
And I said, "Girls,

00:04:47.598 --> 00:04:52.141
how many teenage girls do you think
the British public think

00:04:52.165 --> 00:04:53.913
get pregnant every year?"

00:04:53.937 --> 00:04:56.613
And the girls were apoplectic when I said

00:04:57.453 --> 00:05:01.366
the British public think that 15
out of every 100 teenage girls
