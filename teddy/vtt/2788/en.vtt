Back in 2003,

00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:06.343
the UK government carried out a survey.

00:00:07.494 --> 00:00:10.643
And it was a survey that measured
levels of numeracy

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:11.904
in the population.

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:13.571
And they were shocked to find out

00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:16.959
that for every 100 working age
adults in the country,

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:20.484
47 of them lacked Level 1 numeracy skills.

00:00:20.892 --> 00:00:25.004
Now, Level 1 numeracy skills --
that's low-end GCSE score.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.658
It's the ability to deal with fractions,
percentages and decimals.

00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:33.310
So this figure prompted
a lot of hand-wringing in Whitehall.
