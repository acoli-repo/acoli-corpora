But I preferred, actually,
the reaction of a schoolchild

00:01:00.406 --> 00:01:03.501
when I presented
at a school this information,

00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:05.056
who raised their hand and said,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.596
"How do we know that the person
who made that number

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.435
isn't one of the 49 percent either?"

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:10.713
(Laughter)

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:14.787
So clearly, there's a numeracy issue,

00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:16.921
because these are
important skills for life,

00:01:16.945 --> 00:01:20.812
and a lot of the changes
that we want to introduce in this century

00:01:20.836 --> 00:01:23.277
involve us becoming
more comfortable with numbers.

00:01:23.301 --> 00:01:25.149
Now, it's not just an English problem.

00:01:25.173 --> 00:01:30.103
OECD this year released some figures
looking at numeracy in young people,
