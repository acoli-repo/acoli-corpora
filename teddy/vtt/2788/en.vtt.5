And one of the ways in which
we can begin that journey, for me,

00:02:34.722 --> 00:02:36.448
is looking at statistics.

00:02:36.472 --> 00:02:39.967
Now, I am the first to acknowledge
that statistics has got somewhat

00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:41.309
of an image problem.

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:42.380
(Laughter)

00:02:42.404 --> 00:02:43.936
It's the part of mathematics

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.019
that even mathematicians
don't particularly like,

00:02:47.043 --> 00:02:51.055
because whereas the rest of maths
is all about precision and certainty,

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.363
statistics is almost the reverse of that.

00:02:53.793 --> 00:02:58.448
But actually, I was a late convert
to the world of statistics myself.

00:02:58.472 --> 00:03:00.554
If you'd asked my undergraduate professors
