00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:33.310
So this figure prompted
a lot of hand-wringing in Whitehall.

00:00:33.334 --> 00:00:34.962
Policies were changed,

00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:36.708
investments were made,

00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:39.770
and then they ran
the survey again in 2011.

00:00:39.794 --> 00:00:41.999
So can you guess
what happened to this number?

00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:45.465
It went up to 49.

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:46.938
(Laughter)

00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:49.411
And in fact, when I reported
this figure in the FT,

00:00:49.435 --> 00:00:51.106
one of our readers joked and said,

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.891
"This figure is only shocking
to 51 percent of the population."

00:00:54.915 --> 00:00:57.201
(Laughter)

00:00:57.225 --> 00:01:00.382
But I preferred, actually,
the reaction of a schoolchild
