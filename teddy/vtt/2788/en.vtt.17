00:08:29.971 --> 00:08:31.138
on the right-hand side.

00:08:31.162 --> 00:08:32.443
There are seven questions.

00:08:32.467 --> 00:08:36.360
Each question, there's a possible answer
between zero and a hundred,

00:08:36.384 --> 00:08:37.733
and at the end of the quiz,

00:08:37.757 --> 00:08:40.975
you get an overall score
between zero and a hundred.

00:08:40.999 --> 00:08:43.083
And so because this is TEDxExeter,

00:08:43.107 --> 00:08:45.432
I thought we would have
a quick look at the quiz

00:08:45.456 --> 00:08:47.765
for the first few questions of Exeter.

00:08:47.789 --> 00:08:49.194
And so the first question is:

00:08:49.218 --> 00:08:52.210
For every 100 people,
how many are aged under 16?

00:08:52.784 --> 00:08:56.384
Now, I don't know Exeter very well
at all, so I had a guess at this,

00:08:56.408 --> 00:08:58.969
but it gives you an idea
of how this quiz works.

00:08:58.993 --> 00:09:02.699
