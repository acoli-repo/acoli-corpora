OECD this year released some figures
looking at numeracy in young people,

00:01:30.127 --> 00:01:32.907
and leading the way, the USA --

00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:37.601
nearly 40 percent of young people
in the US have low numeracy.

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:38.922
Now, England is there too,

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:44.479
but there are seven OECD countries
with figures above 20 percent.

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:47.262
That is a problem,
because it doesn't have to be that way.

00:01:47.286 --> 00:01:49.294
If you look at the far end of this graph,

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:52.278
you can see the Netherlands and Korea
are in single figures.

00:01:52.302 --> 00:01:56.718
So there's definitely a numeracy
problem that we want to address.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.440
Now, as useful as studies like these are,
