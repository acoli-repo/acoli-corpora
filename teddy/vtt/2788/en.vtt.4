00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.440
Now, as useful as studies like these are,

00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:05.864
I think we risk herding people
inadvertently into one of two categories;

00:02:05.888 --> 00:02:07.664
that there are two kinds of people:

00:02:07.688 --> 00:02:12.037
those people that are comfortable
with numbers, that can do numbers,

00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:14.297
and the people who can't.

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:16.422
And what I'm trying
to talk about here today

00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:19.488
is to say that I believe
that is a false dichotomy.

00:02:19.512 --> 00:02:21.380
It's not an immutable pairing.

00:02:21.404 --> 00:02:25.052
I think you don't have to have
tremendously high levels of numeracy

00:02:25.076 --> 00:02:26.804
to be inspired by numbers,

00:02:26.828 --> 00:02:29.937
and that should be the starting point
to the journey ahead.
