And it sparked an enormous discussion
online, on social media,

00:11:30.173 --> 00:11:32.210

00:11:32.234 --> 00:11:36.227
by people having fun
with their misconceptions,

00:11:36.251 --> 00:11:39.310

00:11:39.334 --> 00:11:40.494

00:11:49.992 --> 00:11:52.322
going back to the two kinds of people,

00:11:52.346 --> 00:11:54.603
I thought it would be
really interesting to see

00:11:54.627 --> 00:11:57.442
how people who are good with numbers
would do on this quiz.

00:11:57.466 --> 00:12:00.482
