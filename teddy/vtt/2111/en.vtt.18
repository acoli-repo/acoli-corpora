Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Now, the unexpected thing about this

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
is that Zach could stand up on stage and drench

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
that we'd damage the electronics, that we'd get him wet,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
that we'd hurt the books or the computers. It works because it's non-conductive.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
So you can see here, you can immerse a whole circuit board

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
in this and it wouldn't cause any damage.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
You can circulate it to draw the heat away.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
But today it's most widely used in office buildings --

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
in the sprinkler system -- as a fire-suppression fluid.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Again, it's perfectly safe for people. It puts out the fires, doesn't hurt anything.
