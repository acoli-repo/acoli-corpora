By detecting the odor of particular bacteria, or viruses,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
or even lung cancer, the dots will change and they can use

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
software to analyze the results.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Currently, they're using a method of trial and error,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
but this could tell you precisely what disease you have.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000

of what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this,
