00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
we shared the same ideas. And you could see it in his face:

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder;

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
he opens it up and Keith and I look in,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
These things just get him really excited. And so we're looking

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
at these concepts, and we were just like, whoa, this guy's good.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
was totally different than ours. He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now.
