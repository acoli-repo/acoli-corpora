00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Zach Kaplan: Keith and I lead a research team.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We investigate materials and technologies

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that have unexpected properties. Over the last three years,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we found over 200 of these things, and so we looked

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
back into our library and selected six we thought would be most

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
surprising for TED.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Of these six, the first one that we're going to talk about

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
is in the black envelope you're holding.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It comes from a company in Japan called GelTech. Now go ahead and open it up.
