00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
For our next technology, it's hard to observe

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
the unexpected property by itself, because it's an ink.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
So, we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
KS: As this paper is bending, the resistance of the ink changes.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So with simple electronics, you can detect how much the page is being bent.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Now, to think about the potential for this,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
think of all the places ink is supplied: on business cards,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
on the back of cereal boxes, board games. Any place you use ink,
