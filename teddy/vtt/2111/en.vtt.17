00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
It's so safe you could drink this stuff.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
(Laughter)

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
25 times faster than water.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
(Laughter)

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
All right, well thanks for coming up.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
(Laughter)

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
ZK: Wait, wait, Steven -- before you go we filled this with the dry liquid

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
so during the break you can shoot your friends.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
SJ: Excellent, thank you.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
KS: Thanks for coming up. Let's give him a big round of applause.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
(Applause)

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So what's the significance of this dry liquid?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer.
