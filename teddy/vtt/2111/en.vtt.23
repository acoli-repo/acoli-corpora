on the back of cereal boxes, board games. Any place you use ink,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
you could change the way you interact with it.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
ZK: So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
This could totally change the way that you interface with paper.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
You see the dark line on the side and the top. As you turn the pages

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
of the book, the book can actually detect what page you're on,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
based on the curvature of the pages.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
In addition, if you were to fold in one of the corners, then you could program

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
KS: For our last technology, we worked again with Roman and his team

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future
