of what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
we would have assumed: a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket;

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent;

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
every one of these things -- and we're constantly trying to find more.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
ZK: This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
I'm sure it's obvious to you now, but it was actually yesterday

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
and he was telling me that when Chris sent out that little box,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand --

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
the sand that doesn't get wet. He said that he was playing with it with his son.
