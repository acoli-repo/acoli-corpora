Now, think about your interactions with aluminum foil.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Shape-retaining is common in metal: you bend a piece of aluminum foil,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and it holds its place. Contrast that with

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and it always bounces back.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
ZK: For example, you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
but doesn't use a buckle.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Taking it a little further, if you wove

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
those strips together -- kind of like a little basket -- you could make

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
a shape-retaining sheet, and then you could embed it in a cloth:

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away.
