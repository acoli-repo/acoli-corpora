Again, it's perfectly safe for people. It puts out the fires, doesn't hurt anything.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
But our favorite idea for this

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
was using it in a basketball game. So during halftime,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
it could rain down on the players, cool everyone down,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and in a matter of minutes it would dry. Wouldn't hurt the court.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
ZK: Our next technology comes to us from a company in Japan

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
called Sekisui Chemical. One of their R&amp;D engineers

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
was working on a way to make plastic stiffer.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
While he was doing this, he noticed an unexpected thing.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
We have a video to show you.
