the sand that doesn't get wet. He said that he was playing with it with his son.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And you know, his son was mesmerized,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
because he would dunk it in the water, he would take it out

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and it was bone dry. A few weeks later, he said that his son

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
was playing with a lock of his mother's hair, and he noticed

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
that there were some drops of water on the hair.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
"Look, hydrophobic string."

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
(Laughter)

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I mean, after hearing that story -- that really summed it up for me.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
KS: Thank you.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
