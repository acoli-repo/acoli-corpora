00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The force of the water rushing down, in addition to that repulsion force,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
It's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
When you get to the very bottom of the slide --

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
(Laughter)

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
-- the rider passes through an aluminum tube.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
from a technical standpoint.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
KS: So I'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
a metal, it's not a magnetic material. But something unexpected

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube.
