00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
KS: Now, we showed the concept to a few people before this,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and they asked us, when's it coming out?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
So I just wanted to let you know, it's not actually coming out,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
just the concept is.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
ZK: So now, when we dream up these concepts, it's important for us

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So I just want to quickly explain how this would work.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
This is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
The gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Now this is important for two reasons.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
One: the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that, if it were

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
to hit the rider in the head, it wouldn't injure him.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
In addition, you can see from the diagram on the right,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet.
