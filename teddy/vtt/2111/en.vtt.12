ZK: As we were talking to the vendor -- to try to learn about

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
how you could apply these, or how they're being applied currently --

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
he was telling us that, in the military they use this one

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
so soldiers can keep it on their chests -- very concealed --

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and then, when they're out on the field, erect it as an antenna

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
to clearly send signals back to the base.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
In our brainstorms, we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal:

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
so at the end of the game, you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
(Laughter)

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
KS: Now, the interesting thing about this is,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting.
