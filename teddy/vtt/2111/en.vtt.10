00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
(Laughter)

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Now, you see the magnet fell really slowly.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Now, I'm not going to get into the physics of it,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
the greater the stopping force.
