As you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
if you assume that all magnets had to be hard,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
of the way magnets could work.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
ZK: Now, it's important to understand what the unexpected properties are.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
But to really think about the implications of what this makes possible,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So, a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material --

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed.
