You know, this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door, in your closet,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
If you come to my apartment and see my closet,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I'm sure you'd figure out why: it's a mess.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
KS: Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
applications -- it helps you see why this is significant, what the potential is.
