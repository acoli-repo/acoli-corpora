00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I grew up in New York City,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
between Harlem and the Bronx.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Growing up as a boy, we were taught

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that men had to be tough, had to be strong,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
had to be courageous, dominating --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
no pain, no emotions,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
with the exception of anger --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and definitely no fear;

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that men are in charge,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which means women are not;

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that men lead,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and you should just follow and do what we say;

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that men are superior; women are inferior;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that men are strong; women are weak;
