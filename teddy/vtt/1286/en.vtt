00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
As an artist,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
connection is very important to me.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Through my work I'm trying to articulate

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that humans are not separate from nature

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and that everything is interconnected.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
where I saw my first icebergs.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I was in awe.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The icebergs around me

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
were almost 200 feet out of the water,
