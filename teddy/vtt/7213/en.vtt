00:00:00.872 --> 00:00:04.667
Every year, humans change
10 million hectares of land,

00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:06.461
and not for the better.

00:00:06.461 --> 00:00:10.173
Right now, there are more than two billion
hectares of degraded land

00:00:10.173 --> 00:00:11.549
around the world.

00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:15.178
We need to fix this fast,
and technology can help.

00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:18.473
Restoration is an enormous,
complex challenge.

00:00:18.514 --> 00:00:21.476
It cannot be done
by simply planting trees.

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:25.813
We need to bring native,
complex ecosystems back to life,

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:28.649
and it requires deep ecological expertise.

00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:32.487
Until now, we have been limited
to poor facsimiles,
