00:02:27.702 --> 00:02:31.559
So in the 1970s, Elinor Ostrom
came up with this theory,

00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:34.260
really called coproduction,
and this is how it works.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:38.879
You bring people into the space
that come with separate expertise,

00:02:38.903 --> 00:02:42.956
and you also come with new ideas
and lived experience,

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.367
and you produce a new knowledge.

00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:47.551
And when you produce that new knowledge,

00:02:47.575 --> 00:02:50.424
and you apply this theory
to public safety,

00:02:50.448 --> 00:02:53.115
you produce a new type of public safety.

00:02:53.657 --> 00:02:57.888
And so, in New York, it feels like this.

00:02:58.291 --> 00:03:03.732
It is called building relationships,
literally one block at a time.
