And it's "Build the Block."

So this is how it works.

00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:11.602
You go to buildtheblock.nyc,
you put in your address.

00:03:11.974 --> 00:03:15.954
And up pops location, date and time
of your neighborhood meeting.

00:03:17.378 --> 00:03:20.410
The important part of this
is you've got to go to the meeting.

00:03:20.434 --> 00:03:22.561

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.447

00:03:29.062 --> 00:03:32.536
What's important about bringing, now,
the lived experience into this space
