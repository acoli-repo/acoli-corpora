00:03:29.062 --> 00:03:32.536
What's important about bringing, now,
the lived experience into this space

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.312
to produce new knowledge

00:03:34.336 --> 00:03:36.780
is that we have to have
a new way of delivering it.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:38.807
So the new way of delivering it

00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:42.680
is through what we call neighborhood
coordinating officers, or NCOs.

00:03:43.196 --> 00:03:46.625
And so, also in this meeting are the NCOs,

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:49.561
the what we call 911 response cars,

00:03:49.585 --> 00:03:52.490
sector cars, detectives,

00:03:52.514 --> 00:03:55.969
all of us working together
to collaborate in this new way

00:03:55.993 --> 00:03:57.643
to reduce crime.

00:03:58.707 --> 00:04:02.746
And what's interesting about this
is that we know that it works.
