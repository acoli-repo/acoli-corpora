00:04:29.514 --> 00:04:32.163
How many of you in here
have ever had a speeding ticket?

00:04:32.187 --> 00:04:33.339
Raise your hand.

00:04:33.363 --> 00:04:34.505
Oh, higher, come on!

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:36.674
There's more than that, this is New York.

00:04:36.698 --> 00:04:39.492
So those are other issues
that brought to the NCO.

00:04:39.516 --> 00:04:41.280
Speeding -- what the NCOs do

00:04:41.304 --> 00:04:44.039
is they collaborate
with the Department of Transportation,

00:04:44.063 --> 00:04:48.643
they look at issues such as speed bumps
and signage and all types of things.

00:04:48.667 --> 00:04:52.421
And when we come together to create
this different type of policing,

00:04:52.445 --> 00:04:54.524
it also feels different.

00:04:55.818 --> 00:04:58.243
The coproduction
of public safety also means

00:04:58.267 --> 00:05:00.093
that officers need to understand
