WEBVTT

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:02.193
that we have put faith in a system
that sometimes is broken,

00:08:02.217 --> 00:08:05.133
hoping that it would give us
solutions for better.

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.565
But we cannot walk away.

00:08:09.177 --> 00:08:11.177
Because there is a better way.

00:08:12.101 --> 00:08:17.102
And we know this because the NYPD's
neighborhood policing philosophy

00:08:17.126 --> 00:08:20.451
is grounded in the coproduction
of public safety.

00:08:21.554 --> 00:08:24.061
And in order for us
to move forward together,

00:08:24.085 --> 00:08:27.903
with our family, our friends
and for our health,

00:08:27.927 --> 00:08:30.927
we have to make sure
that we focus this way.
