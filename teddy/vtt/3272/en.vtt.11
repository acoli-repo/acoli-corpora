That's why the NYPD, along with other
departments throughout the United States,

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:36.936
are training all of their officers
in implicit bias.

00:05:37.472 --> 00:05:42.528
They have to understand
that learning about their implicit biases,

00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:46.711
having good training, tactics
and deescalation

00:05:46.735 --> 00:05:49.910
and understanding how it impacts
your decision making

00:05:49.934 --> 00:05:51.513
makes us all safer.

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.387
We also know how officers
are treated inside the organization

00:05:56.411 --> 00:05:59.887
impacts how they're going to behave
with the community at large.
