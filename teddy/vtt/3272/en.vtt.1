00:00:29.268 --> 00:00:31.691
But even as I learned about public safety,

00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:34.660
I wondered if what
I was doing on the street

00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:36.991
was hurting or harming the community.

00:00:37.323 --> 00:00:41.680
And I often wondered if, you know,
how did they perceive me,

00:00:41.704 --> 00:00:43.585
this woman in uniform?

00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:45.888
But there is one thing that I knew.

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:49.619
I knew there was a way that we could
do this, probably, different or better.

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:54.291
A way that preserved dignity
and guaranteed justice.

00:00:54.883 --> 00:00:58.283
But I also knew that police
could not do it alone.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:01.933
It's the coproduction of public safety.
