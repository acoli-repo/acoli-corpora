00:03:58.707 --> 00:04:02.746
And what's interesting about this
is that we know that it works.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.188
So, for example, in Washington Heights.

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:08.323
At a community meeting, there was a bar,
up in Washington Heights,

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:11.291
and the neighbors were complaining
about outcry and noises.

00:04:11.315 --> 00:04:14.410
So in their conversations with their NCO,

00:04:14.434 --> 00:04:16.760
they talked about, you know,
sound barriers,

00:04:16.784 --> 00:04:18.916
different ways to sort of approach this.

00:04:19.235 --> 00:04:21.442
Is there a different way
we can direct traffic?

00:04:21.466 --> 00:04:25.400
And of course now they have
relatively quieter bar nights.

00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:29.490
So, another issue that always
comes up in neighborhoods is speeding.

00:04:29.514 --> 00:04:32.163
How many of you in here
have ever had a speeding ticket?
