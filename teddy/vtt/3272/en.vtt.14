00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:04.167
We have to own our part in history.

00:07:04.672 --> 00:07:07.529
But we also have to have
those folks at the table

00:07:07.553 --> 00:07:11.114
when we're talking about
how do we move forward with coproduction.

00:07:12.297 --> 00:07:13.941
But understanding this,

00:07:13.965 --> 00:07:18.782
we also have to understand
that we need to have voices come to us

00:07:18.806 --> 00:07:19.956
in a different way.

00:07:20.998 --> 00:07:22.642
We also have to recognize

00:07:22.666 --> 00:07:25.926
that the community
may not be willing or ready

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.958
to come to the table
to have the conversation.

00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:30.132
And that's OK.
