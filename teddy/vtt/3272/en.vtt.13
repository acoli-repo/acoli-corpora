00:06:29.307 --> 00:06:31.525
We make sure all
of those things are in place,

00:06:31.549 --> 00:06:32.942
because without it --

00:06:32.966 --> 00:06:36.761
it's a critical component
to the coproduction of public safety.

00:06:37.704 --> 00:06:40.633
Equally as important
is that we also have social issues

00:06:40.657 --> 00:06:43.625
that are often laid at the feet
of law enforcement.

00:06:43.649 --> 00:06:46.790
So, for example,
mental health and education.

00:06:47.763 --> 00:06:50.517
Historically, we've been
pulled into those spaces

00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:54.287
where we have not necessarily
provided public safety

00:06:54.311 --> 00:06:59.464
but have enforced long, historical
legislative racial desegregation.
