00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.456
but I gather a lot of what
you've written as fiction

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.880
has become prediction this season?

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.816
SR: You know, "Scandal" has been

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.816
We have this show
that's about politics gone mad,

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.776

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.976
what would happen
if the wheels came off the bus

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.296
and everything went crazy?

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.856
And that was always great,
