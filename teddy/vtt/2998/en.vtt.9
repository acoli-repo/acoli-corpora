00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.416
television seems to be getting --

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.376
and by television I mean anything
you can watch, television shows on --

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.616
seems to be getting
wider and wider and wider.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.296
And so anybody's making stories,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.616
and the geniuses are sometimes hidden.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.416
But it's going to be harder to find,

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.456
and at some point that will collapse.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.216
People keep talking about peak TV.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.216
I don't know when that's going to happen.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.696
I think at some point
it'll collapse a little bit

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.616
and we'll, sort of, come back together.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.816
I don't know if it
will be network television.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.880
I don't know if that model is sustainable.
