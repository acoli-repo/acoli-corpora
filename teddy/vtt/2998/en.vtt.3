SR: What else does it not yet realize?

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.496
Well, I mean, I don't think
we're anywhere near there yet.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.256
I mean, we're still in a place

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.216
in which we're far, far behind what looks
like the real world in actuality.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.936
I wasn't bringing in
a bunch of actors

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.576
who looked very different from one another

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.696
simply because I was
trying to make a point,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.056
and I wasn't trying
to do anything special.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.056
It never occurred to me
that that was new, different or weird.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.136
I just brought in actors
because I thought they were interesting
