SR: I think a lot about the fact
that television has the power

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.136
to educate people in a powerful way,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.016
and when you're watching television --

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.296
for instance, they do studies
about medical shows.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.456
I think it's 87 percent,
87 percent of people

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.856
get most of their knowledge
about medicine and medical facts

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.336
from medical shows,

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.496
much more so than
they do from their doctors,

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.896
than from articles.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:54.336
So we work really hard to be accurate,
and every time we make a mistake,

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.176
I feel really guilty,
like we're going to do something bad,

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.856
but we also give a lot
of good medical information.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.936
There are so many other ways
to give information on those shows.
