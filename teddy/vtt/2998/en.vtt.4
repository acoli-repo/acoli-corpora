00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.136
I just brought in actors
because I thought they were interesting

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.976
and to me, the idea that it
was completely surprising to everybody --

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.175
I didn't know that for a while.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:11.416
I just thought: these are the actors
I want to see play these parts.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.656
I want to see what
they look like if they read.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.936
We'll see what happens.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.336
So I think the interesting thing
that happens is

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.896
that when you look at the world
through another lens,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.176
when you're not the person
normally in charge of things,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.840
it just comes out a different way.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.816
CS: So you now have
this big machine that you run,
