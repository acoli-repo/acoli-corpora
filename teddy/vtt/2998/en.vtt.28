00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.136
you're watching a feed,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.776
and the feeds are being corrected

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.936
so that you're only getting
your own opinions

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.496
and you're feeling
more and more right about yourself.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.376
So how do you really start to discern?

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.216

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.720
or maybe we'll all just become --

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.616
I hate to be negative about it,

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.576
but maybe we'll all
just become more idiotic.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.336
(Cyndi laughs)

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.776
CS: Yeah, can you picture
any corrective that you could do

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.696
with scripted, fictional work?

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.376
SR: I think a lot about the fact
that television has the power
