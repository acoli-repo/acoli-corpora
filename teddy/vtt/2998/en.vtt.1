to discuss the things
that tell each one of us

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.000
that we are not alone in the world.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.016
Those things to me
are never going to change.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.200

is never going to change.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.736
CS: OK. In preparation

this indelible memory she had

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.736
of your casting process,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.416
where without discussing it
with any of the executives,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.816
you got people coming in
to read for your scripts,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.936
and every one of them
was the full range of humanity,
