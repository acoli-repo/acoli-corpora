I think there's some scary in the idea
that you can't find the good work now.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.376
There's so much work out there.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.496
I think there's something like
417 dramas on television right now

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.056
at any given time in any given place,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.336
but you can't find them.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.776
You can't find the good ones.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.456
So there's a lot of bad stuff out there
because everybody can make something.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.496
It's like if everybody painted a painting.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.016
You know, there's not
that many good painters.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.056
But finding the good stories,
the good shows,

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.656
is harder and harder and harder.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.296
Because if you have
one tiny show over here on AMC

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.216
and one tiny show over here over there,
