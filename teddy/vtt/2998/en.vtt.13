Do you have any other
tricks up your sleeve

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.376
when you launch your next one?

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.536
What do you think
will happen in that regard?

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.016
SR: We do have some interesting ideas.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.176
We have a show called "Still Star-Crossed"
coming out this summer.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.136
We have some interesting ideas for that.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.896
I'm not sure if we're going

But the idea
that we would live-tweet our show

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.536
was really just us thinking
that would be fun.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.096
We didn't realize that the critics
would start to live-tweet along with us.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.496
But the fans -- getting people
to be a part of it,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.056
making it more of a campfire --
