making it more of a campfire --

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.216
you know, when you're all
on Twitter together

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.816
and you're all talking together,

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.656
and finding other ways
to make that possible

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.016
and finding other ways
to make people feel engaged

how do you think
storytellers will get paid?

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.016
SR: I actually have been struggling
with this concept as well.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.136
Is it going to be a subscriber model?

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.816
Are people going to say, like, I'm going
to watch this particular person's shows,
