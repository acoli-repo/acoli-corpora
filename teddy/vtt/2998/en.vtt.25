some distributor has figured out
a way to make a lot more money.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.296
If you're making content,

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.216
it costs less money
to make it and put it out there.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.456
And, by the way,

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.976
if you're 14 and have
a short attention span, like my daughter,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.736
that's what you want to see,
that's what you want to make,

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:46.976
that's how it works.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.216
And if you do it right
and it actually feels like narrative,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.560
people will hang on for it
no matter what you do.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.456
CS: I'm glad you raised your daughters,

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.296
because I am wondering how are they
going to consume entertainment,
