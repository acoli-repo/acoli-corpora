people who rent networks,
who rent the audience to advertisers

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.776
and make it all pay.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.016
How do you see the business model changing
now that anyone can be a storyteller?

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.776
SR: I think it's changing every day.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.736
I mean, the rapid, rapid change
that's happening is amazing.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.096
And I feel -- the panic is palpable,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.936
and I don't mean that in a bad way.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.616
I think it's kind of exciting.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.296
The idea that there's
sort of an equalizer happening,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.096
that sort of means that anybody
can make something, is wonderful.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.856
I think there's some scary in the idea
that you can't find the good work now.
