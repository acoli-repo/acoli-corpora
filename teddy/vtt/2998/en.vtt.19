00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.816
And instead of having a scene

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.656
where, you know, he's talking
to another character very rapidly,

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.056
he goes into a closet and turns to you
and tells you, you know,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.696
what's going to happen
and why he's afraid and nervous.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.736
It's a little more like theater,
and I'm not sure it would work,

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.456
but I'm fascinating by the concept
of something like that

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.456
and what that would mean for an audience.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.176
And to get to play with those ideas
would be interesting,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.616
and I think, you know, for my audience,
the people who watch my shows,

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.936
which is, you know, women 12 to 75,

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.640
there's something interesting
in there for them.
