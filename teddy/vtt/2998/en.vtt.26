00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.296
because I am wondering how are they
going to consume entertainment,

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.576
and also not just entertainment,

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.800
but news, too.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.936
When they're not -- I mean,
the algorithmic robot overlords

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.056
are going to feed them
what they've already done.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.680
How do you think we will correct for that
and make people well-rounded citizens?

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.936
SR: Well, me and how I correct for it

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.736
is completely different
than how somebody else might do it.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.856
CS: Feel free to speculate.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.856
SR: I really don't know
how we're going to do it in the future.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.296
I mean, my poor children have been
the subject of all of my experiments.
