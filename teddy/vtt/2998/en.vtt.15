00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.816
Are people going to say, like, I'm going
to watch this particular person's shows,

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.576
and that's how we're going to do it?

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.336
CS: I think we should buy
a passport to Shondaland. Right?

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.616
SR: I don't know about that, but yeah.
That's a lot more work for me.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.456
I do think that there are
going to be different ways,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.976
but I don't know necessarily.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.656
I mean, I'll be honest and say
a lot of content creators

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.096
are not necessarily interested
in being distributors,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.336
mainly because what I dream of doing

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.776
is creating content.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.656
I really love to create content.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.896
I want to get paid for it

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.096
and I want to get paid the money
that I deserve to get paid for it,
