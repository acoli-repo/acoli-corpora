SR: It's interesting.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.480
Part of me thinks
it sounds like commercials.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.096
I mean, it does -- like, sponsored by.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.736
But part of me also gets it completely.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.856
There's something
really wonderful about it.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.176
If you think about a world

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.096
in which most people
are watching television on their phones,

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.976
if you think about a place like India,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.736
where most of the input is coming in

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.136
and that's where
most of the product is coming in,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.416
shorter makes sense.

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.976
If you can charge people more
for shorter periods of content,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.256
some distributor has figured out
a way to make a lot more money.
