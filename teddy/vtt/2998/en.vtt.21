I know for a fact
that a story is not as good

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.056
when I have control
over exactly what's going to happen

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.816
to somebody else's character.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.616
You know, if I could tell you exactly
what I wanted to happen to Walter White,

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.216
that's great, but the story
is not the same, and it's not as powerful.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.816
You know, if I'm in charge
of how "The Sopranos" ends,

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.016
then that's lovely and I have an ending
that's nice and satisfying,

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.216
but it's not the same story
and it's not the same emotional impact.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.616
CS: I can't stop imagining
what that might be.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.456
Sorry, you're losing me for a minute.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.056
SR: But what's wonderful is
I don't get to imagine it,
