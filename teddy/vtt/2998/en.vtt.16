00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.096
and I want to get paid the money
that I deserve to get paid for it,

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.056
and there's a hard part in finding that.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.616
But I also want it to be made possible

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.616
for, you know,
the people who work with me,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.976
the people who work for me,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.376
everybody to sort of get paid in a way,
and they're all making a living.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.600
How it gets distributed
is getting harder and harder.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.616
CS: How about the many new tools,

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.856
you know, VR, AR ...

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.896
I find it fascinating
that you can't really binge-watch,

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.176
you can't fast-forward in those things.
