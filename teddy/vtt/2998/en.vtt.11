00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.736
I mean, I think the international sense
that television can now take on

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.976
makes sense to me,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.616
that programming can now take on.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.896
Television so much is made for, like --
here's our American audience.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.176
We make these shows,

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.216
and then they shove them
out into the world

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.536
and hope for the best,

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.496
as opposed to really thinking
about the fact that America is not it.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.256
I mean, we love ourselves
and everything, but it's not i.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.456
And we should be
taking into account the fact

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.976
that there are all
of these other places in the world

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.016
that we should be interested in
while we're telling stories.
