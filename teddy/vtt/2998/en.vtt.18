00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.376
the idea that -- picture this,

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.896
you can sit there
and have a conversation with Fitz,

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.096

President Fitzgerald Grant III,

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.336

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.296
or being with a character like Huck
who's about to execute somebody.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.816
And instead of having a scene
