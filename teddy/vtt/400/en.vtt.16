00:07:56.625 --> 00:08:01.851
(Applause and cheers)

00:08:01.875 --> 00:08:05.333
and Momposhi is our greatest
advocate in the community.

00:08:06.375 --> 00:08:08.726
I also brought mothers to the table,

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.268
including my own.

00:08:10.292 --> 00:08:12.893
That's my mother
in one of our training programs.

00:08:12.917 --> 00:08:16.333
And our mothers are involved
in the education of their own children.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.684
I also brought grandmothers into the mix.

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:20.809
(Laughter)

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:23.934
In my community, grandmothers
are the proud keepers

00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.059
of our stories and cultures,

00:08:26.083 --> 00:08:30.708
and I wanted my girls to learn
and embrace our rich Maasai culture.
