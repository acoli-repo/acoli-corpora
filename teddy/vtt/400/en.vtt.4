(Applause and cheers)

00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:05.059
At my first enrollment,

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:07.333
I had hoped for 10 girls.

00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:09.434
100 came.

00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:11.351
(Cheers and applause)

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:15.268
I started to realize
just how big this dream was,

00:02:15.292 --> 00:02:19.476
and soon I learned that my school
could be the foundation --

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.684
but it wasn't going to be enough.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:25.684
So that first year,
I enrolled these 30 girls.

00:02:25.708 --> 00:02:28.309
Some had been abused, others were orphans,

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:30.893
and some came from families
that are very traditional,
