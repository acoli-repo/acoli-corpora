00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:03.101
Faith did something very brave.

00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:06.393
She stole an egg from her mother's house,

00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:07.684
went to the market,

00:04:07.708 --> 00:04:10.184
sold the egg and bought a single pencil.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:12.018
Then she walked five miles,

00:04:12.042 --> 00:04:14.375
clenching that pencil, trying to enroll.

00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:16.892
She arrived --

00:04:16.916 --> 00:04:19.059
(Applause)

00:04:19.083 --> 00:04:22.184
She arrived tired and hungry,

00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:23.684
but determined.

00:04:23.708 --> 00:04:27.768
I listened to her story,
and we enrolled her in my school.

00:04:27.792 --> 00:04:30.833
But getting into my school
was only just the start.
