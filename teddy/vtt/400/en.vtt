To empower girls,

00:00:02.292 --> 00:00:03.934
you need to educate them.

00:00:03.958 --> 00:00:05.518
That was my dream.

00:00:05.542 --> 00:00:07.143
And so I built a school,

00:00:07.167 --> 00:00:10.059
and in the process,
I learned something much bigger.

00:00:10.083 --> 00:00:13.042
When you empower a girl,
you transform a community.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.750
School is just a start.

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:18.476
I grew up in rural Kenya

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.226
in a small village called Enoosaen.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.893
I was the first of eight children,

00:00:22.917 --> 00:00:28.059
and I spent my childhood
helping my mother cook, clean, farm

00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:30.018
and take care of my siblings.
