00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:30.893
and some came from families
that are very traditional,

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:32.792
that had never sent any girl to school.

00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:34.917
So school started.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.059
Though the girls
seemed excited to be there,

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.833
they were having difficulty staying awake.

00:02:41.917 --> 00:02:43.309
What was going on?

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:45.184
They had a teacher, they had books,

00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:47.851
there was a new classroom on the way,

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:49.143
but ...

00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:53.083
They were determined to be there,
but they had no energy.

00:02:53.708 --> 00:02:55.375
Then I realized they were hungry,

00:02:56.458 --> 00:02:59.250
so I quickly found a cook and food.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.684
Soon thereafter, I learned
that a classroom was not enough.
