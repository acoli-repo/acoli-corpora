00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.616
Oh, wait a minute,
actually it sounds really scary.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.640
This dinosaur is really scary.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.256
But here's the catch:

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.856
our semisynthetic organisms
in order to survive,

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.800
need to be fed the chemical
precursors of X and Y.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.280
X and Y are completely different
than anything that exists in nature.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.760
Cells just don't have them
or the ability to make them.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.856
So when we prepare them,

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.816
when we grow them up
in the controlled environment of the lab,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.936
we can feed them
lots of the unnatural food.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.296
Then, when we deploy them
in a person or out on a beach
