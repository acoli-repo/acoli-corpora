00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.400
with some desired property or function?

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.896
For example,

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.056
many proteins just aren't stable
when you inject them into people.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.256
They are rapidly degraded or eliminated,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.080
and this stops them from being drugs.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.496
What if we could make proteins
with new amino acids

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.336
with things attached to them

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.336
that protect them from their environment,

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.536
that protect them
from being degraded or eliminated,

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.240
so that they could be better drugs?

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.976
Could we make proteins
with little fingers attached

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.480
that specifically
grab on to other molecules?
