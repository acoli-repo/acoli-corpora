Many have interpreted
life as being perfect,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.696
and this was taken
as evidence of a creator.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.376
Living things are different
because a god breathed life into them.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.736
Others have sought
a more scientific explanation,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.136
but I think it's fair to say

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.056
that they still consider
the molecules of life to be special.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.496
I mean, evolution has been optimizing them
for billions of years, right?

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.456
Whatever perspective you take,
it would seem pretty impossible

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.496
for chemists to come in
and build new parts

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.536
that function within and alongside
the natural molecules of life

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.920
without somehow
really screwing everything up.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.456
But just how perfectly
created or evolved are we?
