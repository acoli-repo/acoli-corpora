00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.480
that specifically
grab on to other molecules?

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.216
Many small molecules
failed during development as drugs

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.176
because they just weren't
specific enough to find their target

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.336
in the complex environment
of the human body.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.976
So could we take those molecules
and make them parts of new amino acids

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.776
that, when incorporated into a protein,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.160
are guided by that protein
to their target?

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.216
I started a biotech company
called Synthorx.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.856
Synthorx stands for synthetic organism

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.536
with an X added at the end because
that's what you do with biotech companies.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.976
(Laughter)

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.016
Synthorx is working closely with my lab,
