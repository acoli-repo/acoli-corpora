00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.576
So of course, with natural cells,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.096
you can only get them to make
proteins with the natural amino acids,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.336
and so the properties
those proteins can have,

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.856
the applications
they could be developed for,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.376
must be limited by the nature
of those amino acids

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.896
that the protein's built from.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.136
So here they are,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.416
the 20 normal amino acids that are
strung together to make a protein,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.296
and I think you can see,
they're not that different-looking.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.536
They don't bring
that many different functions.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.216
They don't make that many
different functions available.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.816
Compare that with the small molecules
that synthetic chemists make as drugs.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.776
Now, they're much simpler than proteins,
