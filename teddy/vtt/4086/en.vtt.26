maybe things without DNA at all.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.376
CA: I mean, in your mind,

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.736
how big might that possibility space be?

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.416
Do we even know? Are most things going
to look something like a DNA molecule,

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.376
or something radically different
that can still self-reproduce

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.336
and potentially create living organisms?

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.856
FR: My personal opinion
is that if we found new life,

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.096
we might not even recognize it.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.056
CA: So this obsession
with the search for Goldilocks planets

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.496
in exactly the right place
with water and whatever,

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.816
that's a very parochial
assumption, perhaps.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.256
FR: Well, if you want to find someone
you can talk to, then maybe not,
