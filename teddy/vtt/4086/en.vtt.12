00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.776
Now, they're much simpler than proteins,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.216
but they're routinely built from
a much broader range of diverse things.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.176
Don't worry about the molecular details,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.416
but I think you can see
how different they are.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.376
And in fact, it's their differences
that make them great drugs

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.776
to treat different diseases.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.976
So it's really provocative to wonder
what sort of new protein drugs

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.360
you could develop if you could build
proteins from more diverse things.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.776
So can we get our semisynthetic organism

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.016
to make proteins that include
new and different amino acids,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.296
maybe amino acids
selected to confer the protein

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.400
with some desired property or function?
