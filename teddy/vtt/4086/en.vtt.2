Would life with more letters
be able to tell different stories,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.440
maybe even more interesting ones?

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.296
In 1999, my lab at the Scripps
Research Institute in La Jolla, California

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.016
started working on this question
with the goal of creating living organisms

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.056
with DNA made up
of a six-letter genetic alphabet,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.560
the four natural letters
plus two additional new man-made letters.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.376
Such an organism would be

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.256
the first radically altered
form of life ever created.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.216
It would be a semisynthetic form of life

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.120
that stores more information
than life ever has before.
