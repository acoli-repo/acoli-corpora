00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.056
but maybe they seem a little esoteric.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.816
So what about practical motivations?

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.616
Well, we want to explore
what sort of new stories

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.736
life with an expanded
vocabulary could tell,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.976
and remember, stories here
are the proteins that a cell produces

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.376
and the functions they have.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.496
So what sort of new proteins
with new types of functions

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.176
could our semisynthetic organisms
make and maybe even use?

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.160
Well, we have a couple of things in mind.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.816
The first is to get the cells
to make proteins for us, for our use.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.256
Proteins are being used today

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.016
for an increasingly broad
range of different applications,
