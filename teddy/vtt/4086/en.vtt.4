00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.696
is that the four natural letters
pair together to form two base pairs.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.976
G pairs with C and A pairs with T,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.816
so to create our new letters,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.376
we synthesized hundreds of new candidates,
new candidate letters,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.448
and examined their abilities
to selectively pair with each other.

00:02:11.472 --> 00:02:13.176
And after about 15 years of work,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.776
we found two that paired
together really well,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.496
at least in a test tube.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.216
They have complicated names,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.860
but let's just call them X and Y.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.376
The next thing we needed to do
was find a way to get X and Y into cells,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.936
and eventually we found that a protein
that does something similar in algae

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.336
worked in our bacteria.
