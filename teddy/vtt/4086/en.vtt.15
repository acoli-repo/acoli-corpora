Synthorx is working closely with my lab,

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.376
and they're interested in a protein
that recognizes a certain receptor

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.096
on the surface of human cells.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.576
But the problem is that it also recognizes

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.296
another receptor on the surface
of those same cells,

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.960
and that makes it toxic.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.936
So could we produce
a variant of that protein

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.296
where the part that interacts
with that second bad receptor is shielded,

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.256
blocked by something like a big umbrella

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.360
so that the protein only interacts
with that first good receptor?

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.256
Doing that would be really difficult
