00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.000
Every living cell, every living cell ever,

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.536
has made every one of its proteins

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.600
using a four-letter genetic alphabet.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.856
These cells are living and growing
and making protein

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.776
with a six-letter alphabet.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.200
These are a new form of life.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.520
This is a semisynthetic form of life.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.616
So what about the future?

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.216
My lab is already working on expanding
the genetic alphabet of other cells,

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.456
including human cells,

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.136
and we're getting ready to start working
on more complex organisms.
