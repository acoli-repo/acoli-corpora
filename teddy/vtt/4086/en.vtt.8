00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.456
But just how perfectly
created or evolved are we?

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.720
Just how special
are the molecules of life?

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.976
These questions have been
impossible to even ask,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.120
because we've had nothing
to compare life to.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.976
Now for the first time, our work suggests

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.696
that maybe the molecules of life
aren't that special.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.760
Maybe life as we know it
isn't the only way it could be.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.136
Maybe we're not the only solution,
maybe not even the best solution,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.600
just a solution.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.176
These questions address
fundamental issues about life,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.056
but maybe they seem a little esoteric.
