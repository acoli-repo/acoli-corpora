00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.016
For example, could we develop
semisynthetic organisms

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.176
that when injected into a person,
seek out cancer cells

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.520
and only when they find them,
secrete a toxic protein that kills them?

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.336
Could we create bacteria
that eat different kinds of oil,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.256
maybe to clean up an oil spill?

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.496
These are just a couple
of the types of stories

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.776
that we're going to see if life
with an expanded vocabulary can tell.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.296
So, sounds great, right?

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.216
Injecting semisynthetic
organisms into people,

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.616
dumping millions and millions of gallons
of our bacteria into the ocean

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.136
or out on your favorite beach?

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.616
Oh, wait a minute,
actually it sounds really scary.
