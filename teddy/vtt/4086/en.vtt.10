00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.016
for an increasingly broad
range of different applications,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.296
from materials that protect
soldiers from injury

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.536
to devices that detect
dangerous compounds,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.896
but at least to me,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.320
the most exciting application
is protein drugs.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.576
Despite being relatively new,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.016
protein drugs have already
revolutionized medicine,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.736
and, for example, insulin is a protein.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.616
You've probably heard of it,
and it's manufactured as a drug

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.296
that has completely changed
how we treat diabetes.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.296
But the problem is that proteins
are really hard to make

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.920
and the only practical way to get them
is to get cells to make them for you.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.576
So of course, with natural cells,
