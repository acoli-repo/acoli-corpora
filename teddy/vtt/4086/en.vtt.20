00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.856
the creation of semisynthetic organisms
that store more information,

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.976
X and Y, in their DNA.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.456
But all the motivations
that we just talked about

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.936
require cells to use X and Y
to make proteins,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.640
so we started working on that.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.296
Within a couple years, we showed
that the cells could take DNA with X and Y

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.160
and copy it into RNA,
the working copy of DNA.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.376
And late last year,

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.536
we showed that they could then
use X and Y to make proteins.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.216
Here they are, the stars of the show,

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.720
the first fully-functional
semisynthetic organisms.
