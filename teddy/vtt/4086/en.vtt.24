00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.256
what are the implications of your work

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.136
for how we should think
about the possibilities for life,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.416
like, in the universe, elsewhere?

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.576
It just seems like so much of life,
or so much of our assumptions are based

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.456
on the fact that of course,
it's got to be DNA,

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.736
but is the possibility space
of self-replicating molecules

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.856
much bigger than DNA,
even just DNA with six letters?

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.256
Floyd Romesberg:
Absolutely, I think that's right,

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.016
and I think what our work has shown,

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.736
as I mentioned, is that
there's been always this prejudice

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.136
that sort of we're perfect,
