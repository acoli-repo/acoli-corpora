All life,

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.856
every living thing ever,

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.816
has been built according
to the information in DNA.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.216
What does that mean?

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.736
Well, it means that just
as the English language

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.976
is made up of alphabetic letters
that, when combined into words,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.816
allow me to tell you the story
I'm going to tell you today,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.936
DNA is made up of genetic letters
that, when combined into genes,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.696
allow cells to produce proteins,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.776
strings of amino acids
that fold up into complex structures

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.816
that perform the functions
that allow a cell to do what it does,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.576
to tell its stories.
