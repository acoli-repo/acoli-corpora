00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.720
the first fully-functional
semisynthetic organisms.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.200
(Applause)

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.536
These cells are green because
they're making a protein that glows green.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.096
It's a pretty famous protein,
actually, from jellyfish

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.216
that a lot of people use
in its natural form

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.280
because it's easy to see that you made it.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.176
But within every one of these proteins,

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.960
there's a new amino acid that
natural life can't build proteins with.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.000
Every living cell, every living cell ever,
