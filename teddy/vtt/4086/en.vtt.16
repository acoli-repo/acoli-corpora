00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.256
Doing that would be really difficult

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.536
or impossible to do
with the normal amino acids,

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.000
but not with amino acids that are
specifically designed for that purpose.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.696
So getting our semisynthetic cells
to act as little factories

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.216
to produce better protein drugs

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.976
isn't the only potentially
really interesting application,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.400
because remember, it's the proteins
that allow cells to do what they do.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.616
So if we have cells that make
new proteins with new functions,

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.216
could we get them to do things
that natural cells can't do?

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.016
For example, could we develop
semisynthetic organisms
