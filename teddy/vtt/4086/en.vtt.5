00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.336
worked in our bacteria.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.856
So the final thing that we needed to do
was to show that with X and Y provided,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.400
cells could grow and divide
and hold on to X and Y in their DNA.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.976
Everything we had done up to then
took longer than I had hoped --

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.016
I am actually a really impatient person --

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.840
but this, the most important step,
worked faster than I dreamed,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.040
basically immediately.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.856
On a weekend in 2014,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.960
a graduate student in my lab
grew bacteria with six-letter DNA.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.776
Let me take the opportunity
to introduce you to them right now.
