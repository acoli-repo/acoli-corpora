00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.120
that stores more information
than life ever has before.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.976
It would be able to make new proteins,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.736
proteins built from more
than the 20 normal amino acids

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.680
that are usually used to build proteins.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.640
What sort of stories could that life tell?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.216
With the power of synthetic chemistry
and molecular biology

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.816
and just under 20 years of work,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.376
we created bacteria with six-letter DNA.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.829
Let me tell you how we did it.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.176
All you have to remember
from your high school biology

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.696
is that the four natural letters
pair together to form two base pairs.
