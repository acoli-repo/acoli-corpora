00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:11.924
It’s your first day in your new job 
as Center Realm’s official cartographer,

00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:13.801
and you've already got a big problem.

00:00:14.093 --> 00:00:19.348
Center Realm is home to three 
elder dragons: two ice, one fire,

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:22.894
and they’ve lived in harmony 
on the east coast for centuries.

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.899
But scouts have sighted three fire dragons
and five ice dragons

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.276
flying across the Western Ocean.
