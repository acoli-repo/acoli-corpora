00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I was thinking about my place in the universe,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and about my first thought about what infinity might mean,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
when I was a child.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And I thought that if time could reach

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
forwards and backwards infinitely,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
doesn't that mean that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
every point in time is really infinitely small,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and therefore somewhat meaningless.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So we don't really have a place in the universe,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
as far as on a time line.
