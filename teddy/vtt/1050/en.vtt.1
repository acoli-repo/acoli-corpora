00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So we don't really have a place in the universe,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
as far as on a time line.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But nothing else does either.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Therefore every moment really is the most important moment

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that's ever happened, including this moment right now.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And so therefore this music you're about to hear

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
is maybe the most important music

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
you'll ever hear in your life.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
(Laughter)

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
(Applause)
