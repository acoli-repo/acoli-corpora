00:00:27.884 --> 00:00:31.436
And I suspect if you had put
spiders in there,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.989
the combinations of insects and spiders
would have just topped the chart.

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.839
Now, I am not one of those people.

00:00:38.863 --> 00:00:41.009
I really love insects.

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:45.084
I think they're interesting and beautiful,

00:00:45.108 --> 00:00:46.596
and sometimes even cute.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.087
(Laughter)

00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:49.479
And I'm not alone.

00:00:49.503 --> 00:00:53.209
For centuries, some
of the greatest minds in science,

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:56.245
from Charles Darwin to E.O. Wilson,

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.550
have drawn inspiration from studying
some of the smallest minds on Earth.
