00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:01.550
have drawn inspiration from studying
some of the smallest minds on Earth.

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:04.362
Well, why is that?

00:01:04.386 --> 00:01:07.431
What is that keeps us
coming back to insects?

00:01:08.055 --> 00:01:12.654
Some of it, of course, is just the sheer
magnitude of almost everything about them.

00:01:12.678 --> 00:01:15.665
They're more numerous
than any other kind of animal.

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.513
We don't even know how many species
of insects there are,

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:21.254
because new ones
are being discovered all the time.

00:01:21.278 --> 00:01:24.903
There are at least a million,
maybe as many as 10 million.

00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:29.485
This means that you could have
an insect-of-the-month calendar

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.494
and not have to reuse a species
for over 80,000 years.
