(Laughter)

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:10.343
All right, it is not a lesson in the sense
of us imitating them

00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:13.891
or of them setting
an example for us to follow.

00:04:13.915 --> 00:04:17.241
Which, given this,
is probably just as well.

00:04:17.265 --> 00:04:20.839
And also, did I mention sexual cannibalism
is rampant among insects?

00:04:20.863 --> 00:04:23.191
So, no, that's not the point.

00:04:23.215 --> 00:04:24.952
But what I think insects do,

00:04:24.976 --> 00:04:30.965
is break a lot of the rules
that we humans have about the sex roles.
