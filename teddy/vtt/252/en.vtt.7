Now, male insects do compete with weapons,
like the horns on these beetles.

00:03:31.553 --> 00:03:35.797
But they also compete
after mating with their sperm.

00:03:36.726 --> 00:03:41.852
Dragonflies and damselflies have penises
that look kind of like Swiss Army knives

00:03:41.876 --> 00:03:43.969
with all of the attachments pulled out.

00:03:43.993 --> 00:03:45.863
(Laughter)

00:03:45.887 --> 00:03:50.033
They use these formidable devices
like scoops,

00:03:50.057 --> 00:03:54.794
to remove the sperm from previous males
that the female has mated with.

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.885
(Laughter)

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.606
So, what can we learn from this?

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:05.309
(Laughter)
