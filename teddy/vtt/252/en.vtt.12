00:05:58.111 --> 00:06:01.191
about who they offer
these nuptial gifts to.

00:06:01.215 --> 00:06:03.141
Now, the gift is very nutritious,

00:06:03.165 --> 00:06:05.859
and the female eats it
during and after mating.

00:06:05.883 --> 00:06:08.240
So, the bigger it is,
the better off the male is,

00:06:08.264 --> 00:06:10.440
because that means more time for his sperm

00:06:10.464 --> 00:06:12.912
to drain into her body
and fertilize her eggs.

00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:17.871
But it also means that the males
are very passive about mating,

00:06:17.895 --> 00:06:21.420
whereas the females
are extremely aggressive and competitive,

00:06:21.444 --> 00:06:25.760
in an attempt to get as many of these
nutritious nuptial gifts as they can.

00:06:25.784 --> 00:06:29.579
So, it's not exactly
a stereotypical set of rules.
