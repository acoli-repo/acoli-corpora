00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:43.974
More seriously, insects are essential.

00:01:43.998 --> 00:01:45.445
We need them.

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:48.869
It's been estimated

00:01:52.972 --> 00:01:56.199
Scientist use insects to make fundamental
discoveries

00:01:56.223 --> 00:01:59.124
about everything from the structure
of our nervous systems

00:01:59.148 --> 00:02:01.296
to how our genes and DNA work.
