There's nowhere where that's more true

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:33.686
than when it comes to one
of our most consuming interests -- sex.

00:02:34.142 --> 00:02:36.975
Now, I will maintain.
and I think I can defend,

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:39.400
what may seem like a surprising statement.

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:44.296
I think sex in insects is more
interesting than sex in people.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.107
(Laughter)

00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:49.270
And the wild variety that we see

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:52.207
makes us challenge
some of our own assumptions

00:02:52.231 --> 00:02:54.955
about what it means to be male and female.

00:02:55.663 --> 00:02:57.314
Of course, to start with,

00:02:57.338 --> 00:03:00.295
a lot of insects don't need
to have sex at all to reproduce.
