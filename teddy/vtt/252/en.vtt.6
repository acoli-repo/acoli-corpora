00:02:57.338 --> 00:03:00.295
a lot of insects don't need
to have sex at all to reproduce.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.749
Female aphids can make little, tiny clones
of themselves without ever mating.

00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:06.914
Virgin birth, right there.

00:03:06.938 --> 00:03:08.226
On your rose bushes.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.446
(Laughter)

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.011
When they do have sex,

00:03:13.035 --> 00:03:16.292
even their sperm is more
interesting than human sperm.

00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:18.691
There are some kinds of fruit flies

00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:22.192
whose sperm is longer
than the male's own body.

00:03:22.216 --> 00:03:26.476
And that's important because the males
use their sperm to compete.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:31.060
Now, male insects do compete with weapons,
like the horns on these beetles.
