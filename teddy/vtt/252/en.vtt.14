00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.998
The ancient Greeks knew that there was
a class of bees, the drones,

00:07:03.022 --> 00:07:05.073
that are larger than the workers,

00:07:05.097 --> 00:07:07.667
although they disapproved
of the drones' laziness

00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:10.746
because they could see that
the drones just hang around the hive

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.295
until the mating flight --

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:13.538
they're the males.

00:07:13.562 --> 00:07:15.581
They hang around until the mating flight,

00:07:15.605 --> 00:07:18.344
but they don't participate
in gathering nectar or pollen.

00:07:18.368 --> 00:07:20.652
The Greeks couldn't figure out
the drones' sex,

00:07:20.676 --> 00:07:25.243
and part of the confusion was that they
were aware of the stinging ability of bees

00:07:25.267 --> 00:07:28.124
but they found it difficult to believe

00:07:28.148 --> 00:07:31.395
that any animals that bore such a weapon
could possibly be a female.
