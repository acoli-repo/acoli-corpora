00:04:24.976 --> 00:04:30.965
is break a lot of the rules
that we humans have about the sex roles.

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:36.848
So, people have this idea that nature
dictates kind of a 1950s sitcom version

00:04:36.872 --> 00:04:38.827
of what males and females are like.

00:04:38.851 --> 00:04:42.004
So that males are always
supposed to be dominant and aggressive,

00:04:42.028 --> 00:04:43.770
and females are passive and coy.

00:04:43.794 --> 00:04:45.744
But that's just not the case.

00:04:46.606 --> 00:04:48.668
So for example, take katydids,

00:04:48.692 --> 00:04:51.534
which are relatives of crickets
and grasshoppers.

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:55.035
The males are very picky
about who they mate with,

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:58.284
because they not only transfer
sperm during mating,

00:04:58.308 --> 00:05:02.774
they also give the female
something called a nuptial gift.
