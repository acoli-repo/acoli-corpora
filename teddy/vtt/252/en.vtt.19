And females as a kind of variant --

00:09:32.583 --> 00:09:36.310
something special that you only study
after you get the basics down.

00:09:37.802 --> 00:09:40.485
And so, back to the insects.

00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:41.857
I think what that means

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:44.700
is that people just couldn't see
what was in front of them.

00:09:44.724 --> 00:09:51.160
Because they assumed that the world's
stage was largely occupied by male players

00:09:51.184 --> 00:09:55.036
and females would only have
minor, walk-on roles.

00:09:55.626 --> 00:10:01.065
But when we do that, we really miss out
on a lot of what nature is like.
