They have little, tiny brains

00:10:30.387 --> 00:10:33.780
with very little cognitive ability,
the way we normally think of it.

00:10:34.398 --> 00:10:39.074
They have complicated behavior,
but they lack complicated brains.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:45.037
And so, we can't just think of them
as though they're little people

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:48.606
because they don't do things
the way that we do.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.730
I really love that it's difficult
to anthropomorphize insects,

00:10:52.754 --> 00:10:56.277
to look at them and just think of them
like they're little people

00:10:56.301 --> 00:10:58.439
in exoskeletons, with six legs.

00:10:58.927 --> 00:11:00.188
