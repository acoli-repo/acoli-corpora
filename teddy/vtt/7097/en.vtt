00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:09.745
When it was ratified in 1789,

00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:14.154
the U.S. Constitution didn't just
institute a government by the people.

00:00:14.154 --> 00:00:19.498
It provided a way for the people to alter
the constitution itself.

00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:24.490
And yet, of the nearly 11,000 amendments
proposed in the centuries since,

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.732
only 27 have succeeded as of 2016.

00:00:28.732 --> 00:00:32.723
So what is it that makes the Constitution
so hard to change?
