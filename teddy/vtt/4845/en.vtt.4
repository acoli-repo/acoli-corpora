00:01:58.068 --> 00:02:02.798
it seems like Amaro should try to bribe
the other pirates with most of the gold

00:02:02.798 --> 00:02:06.170
to increase the chances of his plan
being accepted.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.129
But it turns out he can do
much better than that. Why?

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.570
Like we said, the pirates all know
each other to be top-notch logicians.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.069
So when each votes, they won't just
be thinking about the current proposal,

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.968
but about all possible outcomes
down the line.

00:02:25.968 --> 00:02:28.832
And because the rank order is known
in advance,

00:02:28.832 --> 00:02:34.151
each can accurately predict how the others
would vote in any situation
