00:02:56.701 --> 00:03:00.471
and Eliza's one vote would not be
enough to override him,

00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:05.631
so Eliza wants to avoid this situation
at all costs.

00:03:05.631 --> 00:03:08.271
Now we move to the previous decision point

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:12.560
with three pirates left 
and Charlotte making the proposal.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.501
Everyone knows that if she's outvoted,
the decision moves to Daniel,

00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:19.941
who will then get all the gold
while Eliza gets nothing.

00:03:19.941 --> 00:03:22.156
So to secure Eliza's vote,

00:03:22.156 --> 00:03:27.291
Charlotte only needs to offer her
slightly more than nothing, one coin.

00:03:27.291 --> 00:03:29.113
Since this ensures her support,

00:03:29.113 --> 00:03:33.821
Charlotte doesn't need to offer Daniel
anything at all.
