00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:36.728
gets to vote either yarr or nay.

00:00:36.728 --> 00:00:42.604
If the vote passes, or if there's a tie,
the coins are divided according to plan.

00:00:42.604 --> 00:00:44.663
But if the majority votes nay,

00:00:44.663 --> 00:00:46.995
Amaro must walk the plank

00:00:46.995 --> 00:00:50.046
and Bart becomes captain.

00:00:50.046 --> 00:00:52.854
Then, Bart gets to propose
a new distribution

00:00:52.854 --> 00:00:56.746
and all remaining pirates vote again.

00:00:56.746 --> 00:01:00.036
