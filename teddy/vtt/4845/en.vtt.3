00:01:27.108 --> 00:01:31.148
if anyone thinks they'll end up
with the same amount of gold either way,

00:01:31.148 --> 00:01:36.297
they'll vote to make the captain
walk the plank just for fun.

00:01:36.297 --> 00:01:40.158
Finally, each pirate is excellent
at logical deduction

00:01:40.158 --> 00:01:43.368
and knows that the others are, too.

00:01:43.368 --> 00:01:48.287
What distribution should Amaro
propose to make sure he lives?

00:01:48.287 --> 00:01:53.399
Pause here if you want to figure
it out for yourself!

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.378
Answer in: 3

00:01:54.378 --> 00:01:55.308
Answer in: 2

00:01:55.308 --> 00:01:56.449
Answer in: 1

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:58.068
If we follow our intuition,

00:01:58.068 --> 00:02:02.798
it seems like Amaro should try to bribe
the other pirates with most of the gold
