00:02:28.832 --> 00:02:34.151
each can accurately predict how the others
would vote in any situation

00:02:34.151 --> 00:02:37.801
and adjust their own votes accordingly.

00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:42.170
Because Eliza's last, she has the most
outcomes to consider,

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.989
so let's start by following 
her thought process.

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.431
She'd reason this out by working
backwards from the last possible scenario

00:02:49.431 --> 00:02:53.201
with only her and Daniel remaining.

00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:56.701
Daniel would obviously propose
to keep all the gold

00:02:56.701 --> 00:03:00.471
and Eliza's one vote would not be
enough to override him,
