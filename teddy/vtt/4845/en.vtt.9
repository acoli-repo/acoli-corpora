00:04:27.383 --> 00:04:30.124
One is the concept of common knowledge

00:04:30.124 --> 00:04:33.064
where each person is aware of what
the others know

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:36.407
and uses this to predict their reasoning.

00:04:36.407 --> 00:04:40.334
And the final distribution is an example
of a Nash equilibrium

00:04:40.334 --> 00:04:43.593
where each player knows every other
players' strategy

00:04:43.593 --> 00:04:46.394
and chooses theirs accordingly.

00:04:46.394 --> 00:04:49.355
Even though it may lead to a worse
outcome for everyone

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:50.979
than cooperating would,

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:56.555
no individual player can benefit
by changing their strategy.

00:04:56.555 --> 00:04:59.826
So it looks like Amaro gets to keep
most of the gold,

00:04:59.826 --> 00:05:02.539
and the other pirates might need
to find better ways
