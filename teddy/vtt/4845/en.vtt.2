If his plan is rejected,
he walks the plank, too,

00:01:00.036 --> 00:01:02.245
and Charlotte takes his place.

00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:03.826
This process repeats,

00:01:03.826 --> 00:01:06.988
with the captain's hat moving to Daniel
and then Eliza

00:01:06.988 --> 00:01:12.526
until either a proposal is accepted
or there's only one pirate left.

00:01:12.526 --> 00:01:18.427
Naturally, each pirate wants to stay alive
while getting as much gold as possible.

00:01:18.427 --> 00:01:21.759
But being pirates, 
none of them trust each other,

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.107
so they can't collaborate in advance.

00:01:25.107 --> 00:01:27.108
And being blood-thirsty pirates,

00:01:27.108 --> 00:01:31.148
if anyone thinks they'll end up
with the same amount of gold either way,
