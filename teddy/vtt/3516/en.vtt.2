00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.760
Indian ragas are tried and tested

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.176
and these are the ones I know for sure.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.560
So instead of dissecting like in a lab,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.896
why don't we play it
and check out the results?

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.096
(Piano)

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.656
I want you to close your eyes,
open your hearts --

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.160
(Piano)

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.160
The first tune is based on Raga Khamas.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.456
It's a very popular Indian tune.
