00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.256
How many times have you felt

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.856
that someone good-looking
felt more beautiful

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.296
when the right music played?

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.656
(Laughter)

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.576
(Piano)

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.616
Do the notes matter?

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.176
Does the way the scales go up matter?

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.096
Does it matter if you have heard
or learned the tune

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.736
when you were very, very young --

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.416
for it to give you that nostalgic
transcranial attraction?

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.720
