00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.341
So for any of us in this room today,
let's start out by admitting we're lucky.

00:00:05.365 --> 00:00:08.192
We don't live in the world
our mothers lived in,

00:00:08.216 --> 00:00:09.455
our grandmothers lived in,

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:11.967
where career choices
for women were so limited.

00:00:12.368 --> 00:00:13.976
And if you're in this room today,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.744
most of us grew up in a world
where we have basic civil rights,

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:22.691
and amazingly, we still live in a world
where some women don't have them.

00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:26.086
But all that aside,
we still have a problem,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.325
and it's a real problem.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:28.976
And the problem is this:

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.172
Women are not making it
to the top of any profession
