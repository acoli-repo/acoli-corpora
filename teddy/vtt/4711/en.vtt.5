00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.808
because what's actually
happening in your brain

00:02:30.832 --> 00:02:32.806
is much harder to explain.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.021
Modern scientists believe
that sleep paralysis

00:02:35.045 --> 00:02:36.753
is caused by an abnormal overlap

00:02:36.777 --> 00:02:38.835
of the REM, rapid eye movement,

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.749
and waking stages of sleep.

00:02:40.773 --> 00:02:42.989
During a normal REM cycle,

00:02:43.013 --> 00:02:45.546
you're experiencing
a number of sensory stimuli

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.976
in the form of a dream,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.889
and your brain is unconscious
and fully asleep.

00:02:49.913 --> 00:02:51.315
During your dream,

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:53.521
special neurotransmitters are released,

00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:56.103
which paralyze almost all of your muscles.

00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:58.140
That's called REM atonia.

00:02:58.164 --> 00:03:00.260
It's what keeps you
from running in your bed
