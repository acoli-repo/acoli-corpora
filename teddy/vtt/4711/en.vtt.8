00:03:59.854 --> 00:04:00.867
because REM atonia

00:04:00.891 --> 00:04:03.517
has removed control of your breath.

00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:05.637
This struggle for air
while your body sleeps

00:04:05.661 --> 00:04:07.064
creates a perceived sensation

00:04:07.088 --> 00:04:08.761
of pressure on the chest

00:04:08.785 --> 00:04:10.957
or suffocation.

00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:12.362
While a few people experience

00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:13.973
sleep paralysis regularly

00:04:13.997 --> 00:04:15.855
and it may be linked to sleep disorders

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.063
such as narcolepsy,

00:04:17.087 --> 00:04:19.551
many who experience
an episode of sleep paralysis

00:04:19.575 --> 00:04:21.218
do so infrequently,

00:04:21.242 --> 00:04:23.590
perhaps only once in a lifetime.

00:04:23.614 --> 00:04:24.860
So you can rest easy,

00:04:24.884 --> 00:04:27.354
knowing that an evil entity is not trying

00:04:27.378 --> 00:04:27.783
to haunt,

00:04:27.807 --> 00:04:28.248
possess,

00:04:28.272 --> 00:04:28.735
strangle,

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.444
or suffocate you.
