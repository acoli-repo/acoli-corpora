00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:31.496
but you can't fight back.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.645
You've awoken into your dream,

00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:35.806
and it's a nightmare.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.129
It sounds like a Stephen King movie,

00:00:38.153 --> 00:00:39.915
but it's actually a medical condition

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:41.673
called sleep paralysis,

00:00:41.697 --> 00:00:43.221
and about half of the population

00:00:43.245 --> 00:00:45.103
has experienced this strange phenomenon

00:00:45.127 --> 00:00:46.772
at least once in their life.

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:48.841
This panic-inducing episode

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:50.818
of coming face-to-face with the creatures

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:52.101
from your nightmares

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:54.353
can last anywhere from seconds to minutes

00:00:54.377 --> 00:00:57.405
and may involve visual
or auditory hallucinations

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:59.003
of an evil spirit

00:00:59.027 --> 00:01:01.784
or an out-of-body feeling
like you're floating.
