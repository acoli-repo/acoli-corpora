00:03:28.973 --> 00:03:30.630
from acting out your dreams,

00:03:30.654 --> 00:03:32.048
REM atonia,

00:03:32.072 --> 00:03:33.848
also removes voluntary control

00:03:33.872 --> 00:03:35.017
of your breathing.

00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:36.893
Your breath becomes more shallow

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:37.841
and rapid.

00:03:37.865 --> 00:03:39.342

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:42.195
and experience a small
blockage of your airway.

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:44.575
During a sleep paralysis episode,

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.748

to a perceived attack by an evil creature

00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:50.716
and your brain being wide awake

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.189
while your body is in an REM sleep state

00:03:53.213 --> 00:03:56.204
triggers a response for you
to take in more oxygen.

00:03:56.228 --> 00:03:57.758
That makes you gasp

00:03:57.782 --> 00:03:58.794
for air,

00:03:58.818 --> 00:03:59.830
but you can't

00:03:59.854 --> 00:04:00.867
because REM atonia
