00:02:58.164 --> 00:03:00.260
It's what keeps you
from running in your bed

00:03:00.284 --> 00:03:02.336
when you're being chased in your dreams.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.829
During an episode of sleep paralysis,

00:03:04.853 --> 00:03:07.738
you're experiencing
normal components of REM.

00:03:07.762 --> 00:03:09.967
You're dreaming and your muscles
are paralyzed,

00:03:09.991 --> 00:03:12.720
only your brain is conscious
and wide awake.

00:03:12.744 --> 00:03:14.010
This is what causes you to imagine

00:03:14.034 --> 00:03:15.511
that you're having an encounter

00:03:15.535 --> 00:03:17.066
with a menacing presence.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.825
So this explains the hallucinations,

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.647
but what about the feelings of panic,

00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:22.562
strangling,

00:03:22.586 --> 00:03:23.380
choking,

00:03:23.404 --> 00:03:24.138
chest pressure

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:26.212
that so many people describe?

00:03:26.935 --> 00:03:28.090
Well during REM,

00:03:28.114 --> 00:03:28.949
the function that keeps you

00:03:28.973 --> 00:03:30.630
from acting out your dreams,
