He gave each of them some mescaline,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And then he did what’s called the Purdue Creativity Test.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
You might know it as, "How many uses can you find for a paper clip?"

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000

what the difference was in people’s

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
facility and speed with coming up with ideas.
