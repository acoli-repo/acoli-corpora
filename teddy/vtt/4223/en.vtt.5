They just quite happily show their masterpiece

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to whoever wants to look at it.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
But as they learn to become adults,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
time after time that kids who feel secure,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
who are in a kind of trusted environment --

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
they’re the ones that feel most free to play.
