That’s great. If you could pass it up. Thanks, David, I appreciate it.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So this is a finger blaster, and you will find that every one of you

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
has got one taped under your chair.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And I’m going to run a little experiment. Another little experiment.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
But before we start, I need just to put these on.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Thank you. All right.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Now, what I’m going to do is, I’m going to see how --

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I can’t see out of these, OK.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I’m going to see how many of you at the back of the room

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
can actually get those things onto the stage.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So the way they work is, you know,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
you just put your finger in the thing,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
pull them back, and off you go.
