00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and that it’s a permissive environment.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So, whether it’s this microbus meeting room

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that we have in one our buildings at IDEO;

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
or at Pixar, where the animators work in wooden huts and decorated caves;

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
or at the Googleplex, where

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
it’s famous for its [beach] volleyball courts,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and even this massive dinosaur skeleton with pink flamingos on it.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Don’t know the reason for the pink flamingos,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
but anyway, they’re there in the garden.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Or even in the Swiss office of Google,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
which perhaps has the most wacky ideas of all.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And my theory is, that’s so the Swiss can prove

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
to their Californian colleagues that they’re not boring.
