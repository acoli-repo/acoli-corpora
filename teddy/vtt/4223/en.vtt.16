00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And there’s a reason for that: we want to settle on an answer.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Life’s complicated; we want to figure out

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
what’s going on around us very quickly.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I suspect, actually, that the evolutionary biologists

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
probably have lots of reasons [for] why we want

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
to categorize new things very, very quickly.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
One of them might be, you know,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
when we see this funny stripy thing:

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Or is it just some weird shadows on the tree?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
We need to figure that out pretty fast.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Well, at least, we did once.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Most of us don’t need to anymore, I suppose.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
This is some aluminum foil, right? You use it in the kitchen.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
That’s what it is, isn’t it? Of course it is, of course it is.
