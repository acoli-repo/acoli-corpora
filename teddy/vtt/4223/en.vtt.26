facility and speed with coming up with ideas.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And then he asked them to go away

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and work on those problems that they’d brought.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And they’d come up with a bunch of

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
interesting solutions -- and actually, quite

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
valid solutions -- to the things that they’d been working on.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And so, some of the things that they figured out,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
some of these individuals figured out;

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
in one case, a new commercial building and designs for houses

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
that were accepted by clients;

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
a design of a solar space probe experiment;

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
a redesign of the linear electron accelerator;

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder --
