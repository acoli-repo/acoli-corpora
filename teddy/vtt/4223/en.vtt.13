00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
(Laughter)

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Well, they’re still coming in from the back there;

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
they’re still coming in.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Some of you haven’t fired them yet.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Can you not figure out how to do it, or something?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
It’s not that hard. Most of your kids figure out how to do this

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Okay, all right. Let’s -- I suppose we'd better...

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
I'd better clear these up out of the way;

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
otherwise, I’m going to trip over them.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
All right. So the rest of you can save them
