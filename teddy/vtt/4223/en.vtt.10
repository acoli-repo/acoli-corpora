to their Californian colleagues that they’re not boring.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So they have the slide, and they even have a fireman’s pole.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Don’t know what they do with that, but they have one.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So all of these places have these symbols.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Now, our big symbol at IDEO is actually

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
not so much the place, it’s a thing.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000

or created a few years ago.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And I forgot to bring one up with me.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So if somebody can reach under the chair that’s next to them,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
you’ll find something taped underneath it.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
That’s great. If you could pass it up. Thanks, David, I appreciate it.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So this is a finger blaster, and you will find that every one of you
