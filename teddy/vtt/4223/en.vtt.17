That’s what it is, isn’t it? Of course it is, of course it is.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Well, not necessarily.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Kids are more engaged with open possibilities.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Now, they’ll certainly -- when they come across something new,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
they’ll certainly ask, "What is it?"

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Of course they will. But they’ll also ask, "What can I do with it?"

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And you know, the more creative of them

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
might get to a really interesting example.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And this openness is the beginning of exploratory play.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Any parents of young kids in the audience? There must be some.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Yeah, thought so. So we’ve all seen it, haven’t we?
