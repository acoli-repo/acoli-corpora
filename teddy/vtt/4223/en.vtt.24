McKim published a paper in 1966, describing an experiment

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
that he and his colleagues conducted

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
to test the effects of psychedelic drugs on creativity.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.000
So he picked 27 professionals -- they were

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
engineers, physicists, mathematicians, architects,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
furniture designers even, artists --

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and he asked them to come along one evening,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and to bring a problem with them that they were working on.
