Okay. Put down your pencils, as they say.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
So, who got more than five circles figured out?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Hopefully everybody? More than 10?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Keep your hands up if you did 10.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
15? 20? Anybody get all 30?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
No? Oh! Somebody did. Fantastic.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Did anybody to a variation on a theme? Like a smiley face?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Happy face? Sad face? Sleepy face? Anybody do that?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Anybody use my examples? The sun and the football?
