00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
where he got them to take a piece of paper

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and draw the person who sat next to them, their neighbor,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
very quickly, just as quickly as they could.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And in fact, we’re going to do that exercise right now.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You all have a piece of cardboard and a piece of paper.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It’s actually got a bunch of circles on it.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I need you to turn that piece of paper over;

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
you should find that it’s blank on the other side.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And there should be a pencil.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And I want you to pick somebody that’s seated next to you,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and when I say, go, you’ve got 30 seconds to draw your neighbor, OK?
