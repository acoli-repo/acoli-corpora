00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
They were exploring following what was interesting to them.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
They went from designing splints for wounded soldiers

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
coming out of World War II and the Korean War, I think,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
and from this experiment they moved on to chairs.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Through constant experimentation with materials,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
they developed a wide range of iconic solutions

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
that we know today, eventually resulting in,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
of course, the legendary lounge chair.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Now, if the Eameses had stopped with that first great solution,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
then we wouldn’t be the beneficiaries of so many

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
wonderful designs today.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And of course, they used experimentation in all aspects of their work,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
from films to buildings, from games to graphics.
