00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
a redesign of the linear electron accelerator;

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder --

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
you can tell this is a while ago;

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
the completion of a line of furniture;

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and even a new conceptual model of the photon.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
So it was a pretty successful evening.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
In fact, maybe this experiment was the reason that Silicon Valley

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
got off to its great start with innovation.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
We don’t know, but it may be.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
We need to ask some of the CEOs

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
whether they were involved in this mescaline experiment.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
But really, it wasn’t the drugs that were important;

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
it was this idea that what the drugs did

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
would help shock people out of their normal way of thinking,
