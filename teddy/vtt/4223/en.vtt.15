00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
we have them because we think maybe playfulness is important.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
But why is it important?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
We use it in a pretty pragmatic way, to be honest.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
We think playfulness helps us get to better creative solutions.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Helps us do our jobs better,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and helps us feel better when we do them.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Now, an adult encountering a new situation --

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
when we encounter a new situation we have a tendency

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
to want to categorize it just as quickly as we can, you know.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And there’s a reason for that: we want to settle on an answer.
