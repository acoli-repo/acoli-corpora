This is a guy named Bob McKim.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
He was a creativity researcher in the '60s and '70s,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and also led the Stanford Design Program.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And in fact, my friend and IDEO founder, David Kelley,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
whoâ€™s out there somewhere, studied under him at Stanford.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And he liked to do an exercise with his students

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
where he got them to take a piece of paper
