Diners in Singapore are eating
chicken nuggets

00:00:04.625 --> 00:00:07.420
made from a chicken who was never killed.

00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:09.547
How is this possible?

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.176
Through the power of what I call
"cellular agriculture."

00:00:14.802 --> 00:00:18.431
For the past decade, I've been an advocate
for growing meat in a lab.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.103
To me, this chicken nugget,
this hamburger, this sausage --

00:00:24.103 --> 00:00:27.148
all made from cells instead of animals --

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.400
arenâ€™t just fast-food products.

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:31.569
They're our ticket to a new food system.
