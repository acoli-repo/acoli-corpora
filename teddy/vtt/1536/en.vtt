00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
When I was five years old

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I fell in love with airplanes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now I'm talking about the '30s.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In the '30s an airplane had two wings

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and a round motor,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and was always flown

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
by a guy who looked like Cary Grant.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
He had high leather boots,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
jodhpurs, an old leather jacket,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a wonderful helmet
