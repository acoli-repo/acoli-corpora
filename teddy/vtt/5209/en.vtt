00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.491
Lizet Ocampo: I have
a team meeting with my team.

00:00:02.515 --> 00:00:04.921
It's Monday morning,
so we kind of miss each other.

00:00:04.945 --> 00:00:06.476
"Let's turn our cameras on."

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.926
Adam Grant: For Lizet Ocampo,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.126
it seemed like a regular day
in quarantine.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.606
But when they turned on
their cameras, something was off.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.036
Her face was a potato,

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.566
a flat image of a potato,

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.166
with Lizet's eyes and lips moving on it.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.758
LO: And I just remember
thinking, "Why am I a potato?"

00:00:22.782 --> 00:00:25.376
and of all things,
why a potato? (Chuckles)

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.558
Like, I couldn't go back
to a regular camera,

00:00:27.582 --> 00:00:30.916
so I just essentially was
a potato for the meeting.
