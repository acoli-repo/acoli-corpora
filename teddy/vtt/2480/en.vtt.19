00:09:28.174 --> 00:09:31.697
and we found out that this shark
sees discretely and acutely

00:09:31.721 --> 00:09:33.815
in the blue-green interface,

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:36.669
probably about 100 times better
than we can see in the dark,

00:09:36.693 --> 00:09:38.419
but they only see blue-green.

00:09:38.443 --> 00:09:41.562
So what it's doing
is taking this blue world

00:09:41.586 --> 00:09:44.339
and it's absorbing the blue,
creating green.

00:09:44.363 --> 00:09:47.181
It's creating contrast
that they can indeed see.

00:09:47.205 --> 00:09:48.356
So we have a model,

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.752
showing that it creates an ability
for them to see all these patterns.

00:09:51.776 --> 00:09:54.657
And males and females
also have, we're finding,

00:09:54.681 --> 00:09:56.617
distinct patterns among them.

00:09:57.276 --> 00:10:02.709
But our last find came really just
a few miles from where we are now,
