I was thinking about: How do we
interact with life delicately?

00:11:30.355 --> 00:11:33.052
Because we're entering
a new age of exploration,

00:11:33.076 --> 00:11:34.879
where we have to take great care,

00:11:34.903 --> 00:11:37.598
and we have to set examples
how we explore.

00:11:37.622 --> 00:11:41.286
So I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood
at Harvard University,

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:45.449
and we've been designing
squishy underwater robot fingers,

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.462
so we can delicately interact
with the marine life down there.

00:11:49.486 --> 00:11:54.201
The idea is that most of our technologies
to explore the deep ocean

00:11:54.225 --> 00:11:57.005
come from oil and gas and military,

00:11:57.029 --> 00:11:59.870
who, you know, they're not really
caring to be gentle.

00:11:59.894 --> 00:12:02.577
Some corals could be 1,000 years old.
