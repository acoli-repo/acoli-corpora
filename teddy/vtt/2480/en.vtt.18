Just magnificent -- I mean,
they're showing these distinct patterns,

00:09:01.974 --> 00:09:05.547
and there are areas that are fluorescent
and areas that are not fluorescent,

00:09:05.571 --> 00:09:08.160

00:09:15.004 --> 00:09:17.835
But what does it mean to the shark?

00:09:17.859 --> 00:09:19.206
Can they see this?

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.762
And we looked in the literature,

00:09:20.786 --> 00:09:23.944
and nothing was known
about this shark's vision.

00:09:23.968 --> 00:09:28.150
So I took this shark to eye specialist
Ellis Loew at Cornell University,

00:09:28.174 --> 00:09:31.697
and we found out that this shark
sees discretely and acutely
