00:09:57.276 --> 00:10:02.709
But our last find came really just
a few miles from where we are now,

00:10:02.733 --> 00:10:04.184
in the Solomon Islands.

00:10:04.208 --> 00:10:08.668
Swimming at night, I encountered
the first biofluorescent sea turtle.

00:10:08.692 --> 00:10:12.104
So now it's going from fish
and sharks into reptiles,

00:10:12.128 --> 00:10:15.412
which, again, this is only one month old,

00:10:15.436 --> 00:10:17.814
but it shows us
that we know almost nothing

00:10:17.838 --> 00:10:20.112
about this hawksbill turtle's vision.

00:10:20.136 --> 00:10:22.992
And it makes me think about
how much more there is to learn.

00:10:23.016 --> 00:10:24.548
And here in the Solomon Islands,

00:10:24.572 --> 00:10:28.143
there's only a few thousand
breeding females of this species left,

00:10:28.167 --> 00:10:30.211
and this is one of the hotspots for them.
