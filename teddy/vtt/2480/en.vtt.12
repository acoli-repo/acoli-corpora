00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.277
After this fish,

00:06:00.301 --> 00:06:04.602
we were introduced to this red
fluorescent scorpionfish

00:06:04.626 --> 00:06:06.769
cloaked and hidden on this rock.

00:06:06.793 --> 00:06:10.594
The only time we've ever seen this,
it's either on red fluorescent algae

00:06:10.618 --> 00:06:12.293
or red fluorescent coral.

00:06:12.634 --> 00:06:17.967
Later, we found this stealthy
green fluorescent lizardfish.

00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:20.079
These lizardfish come in many varieties,

00:06:20.103 --> 00:06:23.372
and they look almost exactly alike
under white light.

00:06:23.396 --> 00:06:25.770
But if you look at them
under fluorescent light,

00:06:25.794 --> 00:06:27.195
you see lots of patterns,

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:29.905
you can really see
the differences among them.

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:32.866
And in total -- we just reported
this last year --
