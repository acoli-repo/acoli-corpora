I'm a marine biologist
and an explorer-photographer

00:00:03.922 --> 00:00:05.663
with National Geographic,

00:00:05.687 --> 00:00:07.365

00:00:15.372 --> 00:00:17.816
that I've blown their idea of mermaids.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.491
All right, the mermaid is indeed real,

00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:22.650
but anyone who's gone on a dive

will know that the ocean
looks more like this.

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:29.267
It's because the ocean
is this massive filter,

00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:31.364
and as soon as you start going underwater,
