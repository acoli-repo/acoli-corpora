00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:31.364
and as soon as you start going underwater,

00:00:31.388 --> 00:00:33.061
you're going to lose your colors,

00:00:33.085 --> 00:00:36.291
and it's going to get dark
and blue very quickly.

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:39.100
But we're humans --
we're terrestrial mammals.

00:00:39.124 --> 00:00:41.299
And we've got trichromatic vision,

00:00:41.323 --> 00:00:43.989
so we see in red, green and blue,

00:00:44.013 --> 00:00:46.338
and we're just complete color addicts.

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:49.005
We love eye-popping color,

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:51.616
and we try to bring this eye-popping color

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.020
underwater with us.

00:00:53.044 --> 00:00:57.081
So there's been a long and sordid history
of bringing color underwater,

00:00:57.105 --> 00:01:02.051
and it starts 88 years ago
with Bill Longley and Charles Martin,
