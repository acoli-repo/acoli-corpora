00:12:57.581 --> 00:13:02.120
You're essentially looking at
a portal into consciousness

00:13:02.144 --> 00:13:05.058
that was designed by marine creatures.

00:13:06.102 --> 00:13:10.788
So this brings me all back
to perspective and relationship.

00:13:10.812 --> 00:13:13.051
From deep space,

00:13:13.075 --> 00:13:16.227
our universe looks
like a human brain cell,

00:13:16.251 --> 00:13:18.733
and then here we are in the deep ocean,

00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:21.628
and we're finding
marine creatures and cells

00:13:21.652 --> 00:13:23.931
that can illuminate the human mind.

00:13:23.955 --> 00:13:27.073
And it's my hope
that with illuminated minds,

00:13:27.097 --> 00:13:30.882
we could ponder the overarching
interconnectedness of all life,
