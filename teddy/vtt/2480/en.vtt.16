00:07:55.442 --> 00:08:00.455
when we found green
fluorescence in the stingray,

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:03.243
because stingrays are
in the Elasmobranch class,

00:08:03.267 --> 00:08:04.506
which includes ...

00:08:05.075 --> 00:08:06.534
sharks.

00:08:06.558 --> 00:08:09.756
So I'm, like, a coral biologist.

00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:13.606
Somebody's got to go down and check
to see if the sharks are fluorescent.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.892
And there I am.

00:08:14.916 --> 00:08:16.314
(Laughter)

00:08:16.338 --> 00:08:18.877
And I was like, "Maybe I should
go back to corals."

00:08:18.901 --> 00:08:19.933
(Laughter)

00:08:19.957 --> 00:08:22.353
It turns out that these sharks
are not fluorescent.

00:08:23.473 --> 00:08:24.889
And then we found it.

00:08:24.913 --> 00:08:29.751
In a deep, dark canyon
off the coast of California,

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:34.212
we found the first
biofluorescent swellshark,
