00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:31.099
because this molecule has turned out
to be one of the most revolutionary tools

00:03:31.123 --> 00:03:32.823
in biomedical science,

00:03:32.847 --> 00:03:36.361
and it's allowing us
to better see inside ourselves.

00:03:37.464 --> 00:03:39.805
So, how do I study this?

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.900
In order to study biofluorescence,
we swim at night.

00:03:42.924 --> 00:03:44.302
And when I started out,

00:03:44.326 --> 00:03:48.337
I was just using these blue
duct-tape filters over my strobe,

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.740
so I could make sure
I'm actually seeing the light

00:03:50.764 --> 00:03:52.796
that's being transformed by the animals.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.297
We're making an exhibit
for the Museum of Natural History,

00:03:56.321 --> 00:04:00.128
and we're trying to show off how great
the fluorescent corals are on the reef,
