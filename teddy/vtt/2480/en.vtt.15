(Music)

00:07:34.476 --> 00:07:35.943
They're the most cryptic fish.

00:07:35.967 --> 00:07:39.347
You could be swimming right on top of them
and not see the seahorse.

00:07:40.228 --> 00:07:44.736
They would blend right into the algae,
which would also fluoresce red,

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.221
but they've got great vision,

00:07:46.245 --> 00:07:48.419
and they go through
this long mating ritual,

00:07:48.443 --> 00:07:50.545
and perhaps they're using it
in that effect.

00:07:51.647 --> 00:07:54.566
But things got pretty edgy

00:07:55.442 --> 00:08:00.455
when we found green
fluorescence in the stingray,
