00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:30.204
and get an image
like this beautiful hogfish.

00:01:30.228 --> 00:01:33.077
I mean, it's a gorgeous image,
but this is not real.

00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:35.860
They're creating an artificial environment

00:01:35.884 --> 00:01:39.560
so we can satisfy
our own addiction to color.

00:01:39.996 --> 00:01:43.824
And looking at it the other way,
what we've been finding

00:01:43.848 --> 00:01:47.052
is that instead of bringing color
underwater with us,

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:49.828
that we've been looking at the blue ocean,

00:01:49.852 --> 00:01:52.114
and it's a crucible of blue,

00:01:52.138 --> 00:01:55.234
and these animals living there
for millions of years

00:01:55.258 --> 00:01:59.788
have been evolving all sorts of ways
to take in that blue light

00:01:59.812 --> 00:02:01.503
and give off other colors.
