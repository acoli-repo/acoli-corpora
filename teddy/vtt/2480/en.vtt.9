00:04:28.317 --> 00:04:31.651
So I had to put down my corals and team up

00:04:31.675 --> 00:04:33.708
with a fish scientist, John Sparks,

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:36.231
and begin a search around the world

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:39.506
to see how prevalent this phenomenon is.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.005
And fish are much more
interesting than corals,

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:44.243
because they have really advanced vision,

00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:48.052
and some of the fish even have,
the way that I was photographing it,

00:04:48.076 --> 00:04:51.512
they have lenses in their eyes
that would magnify the fluorescence.

00:04:51.536 --> 00:04:53.846
So I wanted to seek this out further.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.592
So we designed a new set of gear

00:04:55.616 --> 00:04:57.905
and we're scouring the reefs
around the world,

00:04:57.929 --> 00:04:59.508
looking for fluorescent life.

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.587
And it's a bit like "E.T. phone home."
