00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:34.212
we found the first
biofluorescent swellshark,

00:08:34.236 --> 00:08:36.011
right underneath all the surfers.

00:08:36.035 --> 00:08:37.220
Here it is.

00:08:37.244 --> 00:08:39.968
They're just about a meter long.
It's called a swellshark.

00:08:39.992 --> 00:08:42.904
And they call them a swellshark
because if they're threatened,

00:08:42.928 --> 00:08:45.674
they can gulp down water
and blow up like an inner tube,

00:08:45.698 --> 00:08:46.857
about twice their size,

00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:51.626
and wedge themselves under a rock,
so they don't get eaten by a predator.

00:08:52.158 --> 00:08:56.301
And here is our first footage
of these biofluorescent swellsharks.

00:08:57.229 --> 00:09:01.950
Just magnificent -- I mean,
they're showing these distinct patterns,
