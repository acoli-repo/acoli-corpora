00:03:56.321 --> 00:04:00.128
and we're trying to show off how great
the fluorescent corals are on the reef,

00:04:00.152 --> 00:04:03.208
and something happened
that just blew me away:

00:04:03.232 --> 00:04:04.621
this.

00:04:04.645 --> 00:04:06.461
In the middle of our corals,

00:04:06.485 --> 00:04:09.491
is this green fluorescent fish.

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:12.327
It's the first time we've ever seen
a green fluorescent fish

00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:13.978
or any vertebrate for that matter.

00:04:14.002 --> 00:04:16.557
And we're rubbing our eyes,
checking the filters,

00:04:16.581 --> 00:04:19.780
thinking that somebody's maybe
playing a joke on us with the camera,

00:04:19.804 --> 00:04:21.747
but the eel was real.

00:04:21.771 --> 00:04:25.310
It was the first green
fluorescent eel that we found,

00:04:25.334 --> 00:04:28.293
and this just changed
my trajectory completely.

00:04:28.317 --> 00:04:31.651
So I had to put down my corals and team up
