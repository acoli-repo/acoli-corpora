00:12:28.345 --> 00:12:31.712
that's using the DNA
of fluorescent marine creatures,

00:12:31.736 --> 00:12:33.742
this one from jellyfish and corals,

00:12:33.766 --> 00:12:37.235
to illuminate the living brain
and see its connections.

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:38.775
It's funny that we're using RGB

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:41.347
just to kind of satisfy
our own human intuition,

00:12:41.371 --> 00:12:43.705
so we can see our brains better.

00:12:43.729 --> 00:12:45.777
And even more mind-blowing,

00:12:45.801 --> 00:12:48.911
is my close colleague
Vincent Pieribone at Yale,

00:12:48.935 --> 00:12:52.312
who has actually designed and engineered
a fluorescent protein

00:12:52.336 --> 00:12:54.431
that responds to voltage.

00:12:54.455 --> 00:12:57.557
So he could see
when a single neuron fires.

00:12:57.581 --> 00:13:02.120
You're essentially looking at
a portal into consciousness
