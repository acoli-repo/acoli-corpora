One of the things that they do,
one of their miraculous feats,

00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:05.344
is they produce lots of these
fluorescent proteins,

00:03:05.368 --> 00:03:06.853
fluorescent molecules.

00:03:06.877 --> 00:03:11.624
And in this coral, it could be making
up to 14 percent of its body mass --

00:03:11.648 --> 00:03:13.733
could be this fluorescent protein.

00:03:13.757 --> 00:03:18.186
So you wouldn't be making, like,
14 percent muscle and not using it,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.794
so it's likely doing something
that has a functional role.

00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:25.655
And for the last 10, 15 years,
this was so special to me,

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:31.099
because this molecule has turned out
to be one of the most revolutionary tools
