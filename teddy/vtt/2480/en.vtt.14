00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.638
So this is the male seahorse.

00:07:01.662 --> 00:07:06.376
They were one of the first fish
to start swimming upright

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.028
with their brain above their head.

00:07:08.052 --> 00:07:09.203
The males give birth,

00:07:09.227 --> 00:07:10.647
just phenomenal creatures.

00:07:12.955 --> 00:07:14.297
So he stayed awake for days.

00:07:14.321 --> 00:07:17.496
He even put this electrical visor
on his head that would shock him,

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.112
so he could capture this moment.

00:07:20.796 --> 00:07:22.916
Now, I wish I could have shown Painlevé

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.037
the moment where we found
biofluorescent seahorses

00:07:26.061 --> 00:07:28.760
in the exact same species
that he was studying.

00:07:28.784 --> 00:07:29.998
And here's our footage.
