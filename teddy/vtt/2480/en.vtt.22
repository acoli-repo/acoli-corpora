00:10:57.467 --> 00:11:01.371
There's no biofluorescent marine life
down there, below 1,000 meters --

00:11:01.395 --> 00:11:03.400
almost nothing, it's just darkness.

00:11:03.424 --> 00:11:05.854
So it's mainly a shallow phenomenon.

00:11:05.878 --> 00:11:07.331
And below 1,000 meters,

00:11:07.355 --> 00:11:10.016
we encountered the bioluminescent zone,

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.377
where nine out of 10 animals
are actually making their own lights

00:11:13.401 --> 00:11:15.155
and flashing and blinking.

00:11:15.179 --> 00:11:16.552
As I try to get deeper,

00:11:16.576 --> 00:11:19.551
this is slapping on a one-person
submarine suit --

00:11:19.575 --> 00:11:23.338
some people call this my "Jacques Cousteau
meets Woody Allen" moment.

00:11:23.362 --> 00:11:24.513
(Laughter)

00:11:24.537 --> 00:11:26.588
But as we explore down here,

00:11:26.612 --> 00:11:30.331
I was thinking about: How do we
interact with life delicately?
