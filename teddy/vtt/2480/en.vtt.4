00:02:01.527 --> 00:02:04.813
And here's just a little sample

00:02:04.837 --> 00:02:06.715
It's like an underwater light show.

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:10.823

00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:15.415
Again, what we're seeing here
is blue light hitting this image.

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.528
These animals are absorbing the blue light

00:02:17.552 --> 00:02:20.033

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.763

00:02:27.787 --> 00:02:31.857
and blue light can extend down
to almost a 1,000 meters.
