00:10:28.167 --> 00:10:30.211
and this is one of the hotspots for them.

00:10:30.235 --> 00:10:33.302
So it shows us how much we need
to really protect these animals

00:10:33.326 --> 00:10:35.682
while they're still here,
and understand them.

00:10:35.706 --> 00:10:37.850
In thinking about biofluorescence,

00:10:37.874 --> 00:10:39.819
I wanted to know, how deep does it go?

00:10:39.843 --> 00:10:42.287
Does this go all the way
to the bottom of the ocean?

00:10:42.311 --> 00:10:45.858
So we started using submarines,
and we equipped them

00:10:45.882 --> 00:10:48.056
with special blue lights
on the front here.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.040
And we dropped down,

00:10:50.064 --> 00:10:52.781
and we noticed one important thing --

00:10:52.805 --> 00:10:56.103
that as we get down to 1,000 meters,

00:10:56.127 --> 00:10:57.443
it drops off.

00:10:57.467 --> 00:11:01.371
There's no biofluorescent marine life
down there, below 1,000 meters --
