00:02:27.787 --> 00:02:31.857
and blue light can extend down
to almost a 1,000 meters.

00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:33.985
As we go down underwater,

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:36.703
after about 10 meters,
all the red is gone.

00:02:36.727 --> 00:02:39.930
So if you see anything
under 10 meters that's red,

00:02:39.954 --> 00:02:43.012
it's an animal transforming
and creating its own red.

00:02:43.472 --> 00:02:49.725
This is the largest single monochromatic
blue environment on our planet.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.360
And my gateway into this world
of biofluorescence begins with corals.

00:02:55.384 --> 00:02:57.470
And I want to give
a full TED Talk on corals

00:02:57.494 --> 00:02:59.296
and just how cool these things are.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.542
One of the things that they do,
one of their miraculous feats,
