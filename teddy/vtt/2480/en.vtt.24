Some corals could be 1,000 years old.

00:12:02.601 --> 00:12:05.710
You don't want to just go
and crush them with a big claw.

00:12:05.734 --> 00:12:07.732
So my dream is something like this.

00:12:07.756 --> 00:12:10.052
At night, I'm in a submarine,

00:12:10.076 --> 00:12:12.186
I have force-feedback gloves,

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.528
and I could delicately set up
a lab in the front of my submarine,

00:12:15.552 --> 00:12:18.091
where the squishy robot fingers

00:12:18.115 --> 00:12:20.600
are delicately collecting
and putting things in jars,

00:12:20.624 --> 00:12:22.209
and we can conduct our research.

00:12:22.607 --> 00:12:25.457
Back to the powerful applied applications.

00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:28.321
Here, you're looking at a living brain

00:12:28.345 --> 00:12:31.712
that's using the DNA
of fluorescent marine creatures,
