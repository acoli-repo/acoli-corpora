And it's a bit like "E.T. phone home."

00:05:01.611 --> 00:05:04.320
We're out there swimming
with this blue light,

00:05:04.344 --> 00:05:06.549
and we're looking for a response,

00:05:06.573 --> 00:05:10.148
for animals to be absorbing the light
and transferring this back to us.

00:05:10.172 --> 00:05:14.884
And eventually, we found

00:05:14.908 --> 00:05:19.378
It's a really shy, reclusive eel
that we know almost nothing about.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:21.363
They're only about the size of my finger,

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:25.867
and they spend about 99.9 percent
of their time hidden under a rock.

00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:30.012
But these eels do come out to mate
under full-moon nights,
