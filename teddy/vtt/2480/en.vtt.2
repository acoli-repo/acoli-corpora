00:00:57.105 --> 00:01:02.051
and it starts 88 years ago
with Bill Longley and Charles Martin,

00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:04.996
who were trying to take
the first underwater color photograph.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.735
And they're in there
with old-school scuba suits,

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.884
where you're pumping air down to them,

00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:15.498
and they've got a pontoon
of high-explosive magnesium powder,

00:01:15.522 --> 00:01:17.729
and the poor people
at the surface are not sure

00:01:17.753 --> 00:01:21.383
when they're going to pull the string
when they've got their frame in focus,

00:01:21.407 --> 00:01:24.331
and -- boom! -- a pound
of high explosives would go off

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:27.410
so they could put
a little bit of light underwater

00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:30.204
and get an image
like this beautiful hogfish.
