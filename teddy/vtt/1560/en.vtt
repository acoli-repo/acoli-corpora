00:00:00.732 --> 00:00:03.619
So here's the good news about families.

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:05.868
The last 50 years have seen a revolution

00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:07.924
in what it means to be a family.

00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:10.219
We have blended families, adopted families,

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.524
we have nuclear families living in separate houses

00:00:12.524 --> 00:00:15.403
and divorced families living in the same house.

00:00:15.403 --> 00:00:18.462
But through it all, the family has grown stronger.

00:00:18.462 --> 00:00:21.011
Eight in 10 say the family they have today

00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:25.548
is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in.

00:00:25.548 --> 00:00:27.532
Now, here's the bad news.

00:00:27.532 --> 00:00:29.930
Nearly everyone is completely overwhelmed

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.241
by the chaos of family life.
