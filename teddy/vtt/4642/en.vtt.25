Even if there's something hinky going on."

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.136
That can make all the difference.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.696
That can -- it turns out,
when these things emerge --

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.496
be something for the history books.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:45.840

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.856

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.016
where some of this behavior
gets normalized
