00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.976
And so one of the ways
that we interrupt sexual violence

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.976
is by sharing truths
that tear down the lie

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.176
that these things are your fault,

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.456
that tear down the lie

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.336
that there's something
that you could have done differently.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.096
Once we start tearing down those lies,
it's empowering, right?

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.696
I think it's really important
to engage survivors in general --

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.096
particularly young people --

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.336
but survivors in general
from a place of power,

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.576
from a position of power.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.096
It's not just empowering -- we have power.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.616
So a lot of times
it's not about empowering,

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.536
but it's activating that power.
