00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.896
So the difference I think
was that the "New York Times"

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.336
and Jodi Cantor and Megan Twohey
did such a phenomenal journalistic job

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.616
with the article,

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.216
Ronan followed it up with his
completely shattering pieces

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.976
and the world was finally able to hear.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.760

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.936
AG: Ronan, when you
were breaking this story,

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.560
what was going through your mind?
