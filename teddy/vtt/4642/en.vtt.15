00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.536
but it's activating that power.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.576
And you can activate that power
by lifting the veil of shame.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.176
We can activate that power
by talking openly

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.016
about the truth about sexual violence

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.936
and not shying away from those words.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.576
(Applause)

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.096
AG: So Ashley,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.616
you were a major catalyst
for this movement

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.776
when you spoke up about Harvey Weinstein.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.256
What was it that motivated you
to break the silence?

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.216
AJ: I'm a teller.
I've always been a teller.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:01.136
I really have to go back to the first time
that I was molested that I remember.
