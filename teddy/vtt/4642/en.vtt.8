00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.536
who interacted with me and showed me
immense amounts of empathy, right?

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.056
It was when it shifted from, you know,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.816
if you reveal your story to somebody

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.696
and they're like, "Oh, I'm so sorry
that happened to you."

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.456
There's still a distance there.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.936
There's an othering that happens

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.456
that makes you feel more alone.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.815
And the times when people embraced me

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.096
and said, "You know what?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.496
I understand that.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.856
I have a real deep connection
to that, I get it,"

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.296
and I could talk about things

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.936
that I thought were just
singular issues to me
