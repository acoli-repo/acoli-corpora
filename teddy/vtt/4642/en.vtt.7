00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.656
and not think of that
as a community issue.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.616
And as an individual,
I'm a survivor of sexual violence.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.896
I'd carried that weight my whole life,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.336
since I was child,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.616
and didn't have people at an early age
who were interrupters,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.856
who intervened,

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.376
who even gave me any kind of hope.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.176
I felt very isolated and alone
for most of my childhood

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.456
and a lot of my adult life,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.056
and what started to change that for me
was when I had a couple of things.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.616
One, I had other adult women survivors
who became interrupters;

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.536
who interacted with me and showed me
immense amounts of empathy, right?
