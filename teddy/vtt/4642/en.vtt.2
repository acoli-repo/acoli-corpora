00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.496
and that every leader has a responsibility

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.256
to make sure people are supported,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.575
not punished for speaking up.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.616
To move that conversation forward,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.376
Globoforce invited me
to host a panel on Me Too

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.736
at their annual WorkHuman conference.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.456
Every year they gather thousands of people
who care about making work better

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.336
and this year in Austin, Texas,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.136
I had the honor of interviewing
Ashley Judd, Ronan Farrow

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.400
and Tarana Burke.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.936
Tarana founded the Me Too movement

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.816
and she and Ashley were recognized
as silence breakers

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.880
for "TIME" magazine's
"Person of the Year."

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.696
Ronan just shared the Pulitzer Prize
