00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.536
but gender-based violence, sexual violence
was never seen as a social justice issue.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.296
It was always seen as a singular,
individual issue, right?

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.296
We would deal with individual people
and what happened to them.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.456
And so I was in a position where
we had founded this organization

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.816
for young black and brown girls
in Selma, Alabama --

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.736
in the Southern community --

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.296
and the thing that was very constant
in those interactions with those girls

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.696
is that they had experiences
with sexual violence.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.856
These were seventh and eighth-grade girls.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.936
And so all of my experience
as an organizer --

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.336
I had heard the same things
about how you engage our community
