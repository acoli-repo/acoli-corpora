She created the acronym
for exactly what happens

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.056
when a perpetrator denies attacks

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.576
and then reverses
the victim-offender order,

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.856
and it's called DARVO.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.616
So for example, when Harvey posts
a picture of him with his arm around me

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:15.216
and it's clear that I'm uncomfortable
and shrinking and trying to get away,

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.576
that's an example of DARVO,

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.176
where he's trying to reverse
the victim-offender order

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.576
and say that we were actually
buddies and friends,

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.336
and there are a variety of ways
that perpetrators do that.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.256
So she's really a handy professor.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.536
And in terms of institutional
betrayal and bad barrels,
