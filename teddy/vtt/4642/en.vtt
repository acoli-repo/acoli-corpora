00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.416
I was always a fighter

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.096
and I was hyperverbal
from the time I was really little.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.336
I got, "talks too much"
on my nursery school --

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.416
(Laughter)

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.656
you know, evaluation.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.216
Adam Grant: That's Ashley Judd.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.296
She's an actor, activist and humanitarian.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.776
In October, she fueled the Me Too movement

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.616
with her allegations of sexual harassment
against Harvey Weinstein.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.696
I asked her if she was afraid to speak up.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.936
AJ: I was afraid of what
it would cost me if I didn't

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.776
and what it would cost me if I didn't

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.360
would be my integrity
and my character and my dignity.
