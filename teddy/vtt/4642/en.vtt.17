00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.016
and I also heard someone
recently use "fawn,"

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.696
which I think is quite interesting

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.296
because some people do return
repeatedly to their perpetrator.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.775
But I was always a fighter

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.456
and I was hyperverbal
from the time I was really little;

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.296
I got "talks too much"
on my nursery card --

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.016
my nursery school evaluation --

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.056
(Laughter)

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.936
And so when Harvey sexually harassed me,

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.056
the particular incident
that's so well-known at the Peninsula,

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.456
my dad was with me.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.096
He was visiting me from Kentucky,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.696
and I went straight down
into the lobby of that hotel,

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.536
and he says that he could tell
from the look on my face
