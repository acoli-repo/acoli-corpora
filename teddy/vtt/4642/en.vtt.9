00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.936
that I thought were just
singular issues to me

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.136
and people would say,
"No, I understand that,"

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.136
that's what started to change for me.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.816
And there was a time in my life
when a young person came to me

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.416
and shared these very hard circumstances
that they had gone through,

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.200
and I didn't have the wherewithal
to say "that happened to me too."

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.736
And the moment that I didn't say it,

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.936
I realized that that would
have been enough --

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.216
at least that,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.016
because if somebody
had said to me at 13 or 14,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.096
"You're not the only
person in the world --

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.616
you and Maya Angelou are not the only
two people that this happened to" --
