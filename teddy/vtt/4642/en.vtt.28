00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.416
That the systems at their companies
were set up to oppose them

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.656
and silence them and intimidate them.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:11.136
That the media landscape that they
entered into before these stories

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.176
was very inhospitable.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.096
And I hope that we've nudged that
in the right direction,

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.536
and by we I really mean survivors
of sexual assault and of harassment

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.376
and people like Ashley who spoke,

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:27.296
and people like Tarana who are turning
the facts we now have into a movement

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.056
that can galvanize change.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.456
But yeah, it's a bad barrel.
