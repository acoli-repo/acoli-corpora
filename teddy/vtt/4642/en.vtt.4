Can you tell us about
how you started it and why?

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.896
Tarana Burke: So I lived in the South
in the early 2000s.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.976
I spent my whole life
doing social justice work --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.256
literally since
about 13 or 14 years old --

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.576
and it was really strange to me

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.776
that in the communities
where I fought and worked,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.136
where I organized,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.016
we would fight about police brutality,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.936
we would fight about economic injustice
and political issues,

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.536
but gender-based violence, sexual violence
was never seen as a social justice issue.
