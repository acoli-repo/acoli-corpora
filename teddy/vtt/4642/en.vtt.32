Cherish the whistle-blower
is really important

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.816
to protect that culture of it being OK
to come forward and divulge,

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.136
and then having that
trauma-informed response

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.096
to folks who have been harassed
and experienced sexual misconduct

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.456
so that they can tell their stories
in ways that are safe and appropriate

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.736
and effective.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.776
So those are just some of the examples
of institutional courage,

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.256
but it really has to boil down

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.496
to individuals just
growing a damn backbone --

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.736
TB: How about that?

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.736
AJ: And being willing to end impunity
and do the right thing.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.496
(Applause)

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.336
And of course hiring and promoting
women is absolutely key
