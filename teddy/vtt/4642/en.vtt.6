I had heard the same things
about how you engage our community

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.216
and one of the main things was community
issues deserve community responses,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.816
and so nobody in the community
was ready to galvanize

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.696
and put together a community response.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.296
And so the Me Too movement --

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.816
the idea of it as a movement --

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.296
came from wanting to respond

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.256
to what I saw as a social justice issue
in our community.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.416
You can't have seventh
and eighth-grade girls

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.376
over and over again revealing
experiences with sexual violence

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.656
and not think of that
as a community issue.
