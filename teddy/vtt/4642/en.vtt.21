00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.856
and so when you're dealing
with what it's increasingly apparent

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.936
is a pattern of widespread rapes,

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.816
at a certain point it became
impossible to sleep at night

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.536
if I wasn't going to try
to honor the sources

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.336
who were putting so much
on the line to talk about this.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.776
And you know, people like Ashley
speaking out early on,

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.416
were absolutely a lifeline --

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.216
every single voice counted,

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.816
and for the victims
of sexual assault in this story,

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.456
the women who spoke out
about the harassment

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.016
were part of the foundation
that they could stand on.
