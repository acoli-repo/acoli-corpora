00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.096
and clearly that's a "bad apple,"
to use your metaphor.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.976
But you're right -- the barrel is bad.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.376
The systems are bad.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.536
It became very apparent to me
over many, many months of conversation

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:45.616
with very, very brave women living
in the worst moments of their lives,

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.336
which they had to relive very painfully
and at great risk of retaliation

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.936
to tell these stories,

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:56.296
that we had a whole legal,
criminal justice system

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.256
that was set against these women,

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.856
not set up to help them.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.416
That the systems at their companies
were set up to oppose them
