00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.896
And so very early on,

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.816
I saw how sharing my story
and using my story as the impetus

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.936
became a way to change the trajectory
of these young people's lives.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.656
And very quickly that became adult women,

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.656
and then it spread from there
to other survivors,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.096
and so this idea of empowerment
through empathy was so strong

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.256
and so useful,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.776
it was beyond just individual healing.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.656
I recognized that healing was possible

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.496
and individual healing was necessary,

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.696
but community healing
was what would be needed

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.976
to actually interrupt sexual violence.
