Ronan just shared the Pulitzer Prize

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.616
for his investigative reporting
in "The New Yorker" on Harvey Weinstein.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.336
It was the first time
the three of them had come together

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.856
to talk about the movement.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.696
There were some sobering comments,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.816
but also some real moments of levity --

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.040
and of hope.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.096
I came away with a strong conviction
that we can make progress,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.040
not just in awareness
but in action and change.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.696
AG: Tarana, I'd love to start with you

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.136
since you dreamed up the Me Too movement
more than a decade ago.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.456
Can you tell us about
how you started it and why?
