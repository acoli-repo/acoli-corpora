00:02:57.826 --> 00:03:00.118
When the toxic key slides into the lock,

00:03:00.118 --> 00:03:04.113
it sets off a cascade of chemical 
and electrical signals

00:03:04.113 --> 00:03:05.872
that can cause paralysis,

00:03:05.872 --> 00:03:07.202
unconsciousness,

00:03:07.202 --> 00:03:08.939
and eventually death.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.341
But if you change the shape of the lock,
the key can’t fit.

00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:17.217
For poison dart frogs and many other
animals with neurotoxic defenses,

00:03:17.217 --> 00:03:21.895
a few genetic changes alter
the structure of the alkaloid-binding site

00:03:21.895 --> 00:03:26.972
just enough to keep the neurotoxin 
from exerting its adverse effects.

00:03:26.972 --> 00:03:28.888
Poisonous and venomous animals

00:03:28.888 --> 00:03:31.833
aren’t the only ones that can develop 
this resistance:
