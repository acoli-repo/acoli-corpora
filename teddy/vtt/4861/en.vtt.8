00:03:58.146 --> 00:04:02.506
will be passed on in greatest quantities 
to the next generations.

00:04:02.506 --> 00:04:05.831
As toxicity ramps up, resistance does too,

00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:10.875
in an evolutionary arms race 
that plays out over millions of years.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:14.171
This pattern appears over and over again.

00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:18.516
Grasshopper mice resist painful 
venom from scorpion prey

00:04:18.516 --> 00:04:21.295
through genetic changes 
in their nervous systems.

00:04:21.295 --> 00:04:24.629
Horned lizards readily 
consume harvester ants,

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:29.253
resisting their envenomed sting 
with specialized blood plasma.

00:04:29.253 --> 00:04:32.530
And sea slugs eat jellyfish nematocysts,
