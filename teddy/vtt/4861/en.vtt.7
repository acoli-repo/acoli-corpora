00:03:28.888 --> 00:03:31.833
aren’t the only ones that can develop 
this resistance:

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:34.155
their predators and prey can, too.

00:03:34.155 --> 00:03:37.968
The garter snake, which dines 
on neurotoxic salamanders,

00:03:37.968 --> 00:03:40.946
has evolved resistance 
to salamander toxins

00:03:40.946 --> 00:03:45.351
through some of the same genetic changes 
as the salamanders themselves.

00:03:45.351 --> 00:03:49.728
That means that only the most toxic 
salamanders can avoid being eaten—

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:53.669
and only the most resistant snakes
will survive the meal.

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:58.146
The result is that the genes providing 
the highest resistance and toxicity

00:03:58.146 --> 00:04:02.506
will be passed on in greatest quantities 
to the next generations.
