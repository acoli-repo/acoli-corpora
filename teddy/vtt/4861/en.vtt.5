00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:32.032
that they accumulate from consuming 
small arthropods like mites and ants.

00:02:32.032 --> 00:02:35.714
One of their most potent alkaloids 
is the chemical epibatidine,

00:02:35.714 --> 00:02:39.834
which binds to the same receptors 
in the brain as nicotine

00:02:39.834 --> 00:02:42.340
but is at least ten times stronger.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.505
An amount barely heavier than 
a grain of sugar would kill you.

00:02:47.505 --> 00:02:51.071
So what prevents poison frogs 
from poisoning themselves?

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:55.094
Think of the molecular target 
of a neurotoxic alkaloid as a lock,

00:02:55.094 --> 00:02:57.826
and the alkaloid itself as the key.

00:02:57.826 --> 00:03:00.118
When the toxic key slides into the lock,
