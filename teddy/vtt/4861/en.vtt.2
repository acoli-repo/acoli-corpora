hurt the beetle itself?

00:01:00.364 --> 00:01:05.524
In fact, how do any toxic animals 
survive their own secretions?

00:01:05.524 --> 00:01:09.123
The answer is that they use one 
of two basic strategies:

00:01:09.123 --> 00:01:11.412
securely storing these compounds

00:01:11.412 --> 00:01:14.572
or evolving resistance to them.

00:01:14.572 --> 00:01:17.417
Bombardier beetles use the first approach.

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:21.154
They store ingredients for their poison 
in two separate chambers.

00:01:21.154 --> 00:01:24.736
When they’re threatened, the valve 
between the chambers opens

00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:28.250
and the substances combine 
in a violent chemical reaction

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.922
that sends a corrosive spray 
shooting out of the glands,
