And sea slugs eat jellyfish nematocysts,

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.911
prevent their activation 
with compounds in their mucus,

00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:39.063
and repurpose them for their own defenses.

00:04:39.063 --> 00:04:42.186
The bombardier beetle is no exception:

00:04:42.186 --> 00:04:43.784
the toads that swallow them

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:48.010
can tolerate the caustic spray 
that Darwin found so distasteful.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.880
Most of the beetles 
are spit up hours later,

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.254
amazingly alive and well.

00:04:53.254 --> 00:04:56.147
But how do the toads 
survive the experience?

00:04:56.147 --> 00:04:58.556
That is still a mystery.
