00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:30.058
he reached for the new specimen –

00:00:30.058 --> 00:00:34.866
when a sudden spray of hot, 
bitter fluid scalded his tongue.

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:38.013
Darwin’s assailant 
was the bombardier beetle.

00:00:38.013 --> 00:00:40.355
It’s one of thousands of animal species,

00:00:40.355 --> 00:00:41.210
like frogs,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.217
jellyfish,

00:00:42.217 --> 00:00:43.075
salamanders,

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:44.118
and snakes,

00:00:44.118 --> 00:00:47.150
that use toxic chemicals 
to defend themselves –

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.465
in this case, by spewing poisonous liquid 
from glands in its abdomen.

00:00:52.465 --> 00:00:57.921
But why doesn’t this caustic substance,
ejected at 100 degrees Celsius,

00:00:57.921 --> 00:01:00.364
hurt the beetle itself?
