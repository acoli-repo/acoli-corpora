00:01:55.644 --> 00:02:01.782
Snakes also employ the second strategy:
built-in biochemical resistance.

00:02:01.782 --> 00:02:06.846
Rattlesnakes and other types of vipers
manufacture special proteins

00:02:06.846 --> 00:02:11.864
that bind and inactivate venom 
components in the blood.

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:17.383
Meanwhile, poison dart frogs have also
evolved resistance to their own toxins,

00:02:17.383 --> 00:02:19.221
but through a different mechanism.

00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:24.214
These tiny animals defend themselves 
using hundreds of bitter-tasting compounds

00:02:24.214 --> 00:02:25.879
called alkaloids

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:32.032
that they accumulate from consuming 
small arthropods like mites and ants.
