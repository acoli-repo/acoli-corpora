00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.922
that sends a corrosive spray 
shooting out of the glands,

00:01:31.922 --> 00:01:36.212
passing through a hardened chamber that
protects the beetle’s internal tissues.

00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:39.956
Similarly, jellyfish package 
their venom safely

00:01:39.956 --> 00:01:43.249
in harpoon-like structures 
called nematocysts.

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:48.159
And venomous snakes store their
flesh-eating, blood-clotting compounds

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.885
in specialized compartments
that only have one exit:

00:01:51.885 --> 00:01:55.644
through the fangs 
and into their prey or predator.

00:01:55.644 --> 00:02:01.782
Snakes also employ the second strategy:
built-in biochemical resistance.
