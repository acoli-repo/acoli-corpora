00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.521
is me, Shameem,
who is talking before you now.

00:03:30.545 --> 00:03:36.982
(Applause)

00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:41.431
Throughout centuries, people
have been fighting for their identity.

00:03:41.768 --> 00:03:46.220
People have been loved, privileged,
because of their identity,

00:03:46.244 --> 00:03:48.666
their nationality, their ethnicity.

00:03:48.994 --> 00:03:52.704
Again, people have been hated, denied,

00:03:52.728 --> 00:03:56.164
because of their nationality,
their identity,

00:03:56.188 --> 00:03:58.922
their race, their gender, their religion.
