00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.376
Now, the straight-up,
self-interested move here

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.976
is to go for that.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.936
So my friend Adam here might jump up,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.320
get the sausage and thereby ruin
all this beautiful tableware.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.816
But that's not what Adam Smith meant.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.496
He didn't mean
disregard all consequences --

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.736
to the contrary.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.016
He would have thought,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.056
well, there may be negative consequences,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.296
for example,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.416
the owner might be angry with the dog

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.040
and the dog, anticipating that,
might not behave in this way.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.096
That might be us,

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.176
weighing the benefits
and costs of our actions.
