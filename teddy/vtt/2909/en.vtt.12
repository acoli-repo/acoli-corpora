If you believe that people
are motivated like that,

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.136
then all the stuff about incentives,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.936
all the stuff about code of conduct
and bonus systems and so on,

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.136
doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.336
People are motivated
by different values perhaps.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.736
So, what are people actually motivated by?

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.936
These two gentlemen here
have perfect hairdos,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.440
but they give us
very different views of the world.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.096
What do we do with this?

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.776
Well, I'm an economist

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.976
and we conduct so-called experiments
to address this issue.
