00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.160
That's what our research shows.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.976
If, on the other hand,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.256
we do so --

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.696
if we get the sausage

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.176
and in doing so
we actually violate values,

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.176
we value the sausage less.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.656
Quantitatively, that's quite powerful.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.136
We can measure these protected values,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.376
for example,

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.320
by a survey measure.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:56.336
Simple, nine-item survey that's quite
predictive in these experiments.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.696
If you think about the average
of the population

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.816
and then there's
a distribution around it --
