00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.576
and the desirable
characteristics, of course --

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.176
competencies that go
in line with your organization.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.416
I do not yet know where
these protected values really come from.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.816
Is it nurture or is it nature?

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.216
What I can tell you

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.336
is that the distribution
looks pretty similar for men and women.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.136
It looks pretty similar
for those who had studied economics

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.520
or those who had studied psychology.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.376
It looks even pretty similar
around different age categories

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.616
among adults.
