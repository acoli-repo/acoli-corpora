00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.816
and then there's
a distribution around it --

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.880
people are different,
we all are different.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.456
People who have a set of protected values

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.656
that's one standard deviation
above the average,

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:15.736
they discount money they receive
by lying by about 25 percent.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.376
That means a dollar received when lying

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.536
is worth to them only 75 cents

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.256
without any incentives you put in place
for them to behave honestly.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.016
It's their intrinsic motivation.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.896
By the way, I'm not a moral authority.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.840
I'm not saying I have
all these beautiful values, right?
