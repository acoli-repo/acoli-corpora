18th-century German philosopher superstar.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.536
He developed this notion

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.696
that independent of the consequences,

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.696
some actions are just right

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.416
and some are just wrong.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.656
It's just wrong to lie, for example.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.816
So, meet my friend Immanuel here.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.656
He knows that the sausage is very tasty,

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.136
but he's going to turn away
because he's a good dog.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.856
He knows it's wrong to jump up

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.680
and risk ruining
all this beautiful tableware.
