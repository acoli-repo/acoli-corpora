00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.136
in front of you.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.736
Here are your instructions:

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.240
toss the coin four times,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.216
and then on a computer
terminal in front of you,

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.896
enter the number of times tails came up.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.200
This is the situation.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.936
Here's the rub.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.336
For every time that you announce
that you had a tails throw,

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.856
you get paid five francs.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.416
So if you say I had two tails throws,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.656
you get paid 10 francs.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.616
If you say you had zero,
you get paid zero francs.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.096
If you say, "I had four tails throws,"
