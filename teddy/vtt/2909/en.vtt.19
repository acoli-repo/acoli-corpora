Don't check, OK?

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.056

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.376
What I can tell you

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.840
is that not everybody behaved
like Adam Smith would have predicted.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.416
So what does that leave us with?

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.936
Well, it seems people are motivated
by certain intrinsic values

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.760
and in our research, we look at this.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.920
We look at the idea that people have
so-called protected values.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.576
A protected value isn't just any value.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:03.416
A protected value is a value
where you're willing to pay a price
