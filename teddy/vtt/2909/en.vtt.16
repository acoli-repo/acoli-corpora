We did it at the Manifesta art exhibition

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.656
that took place here in Zurich recently,

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.536
not with students in the lab
at the university

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.336
but with the real population,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.560
like you guys.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.216
First, a quick reminder of stats.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.816
If I throw the coin four times
and it's a fair coin,

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.936
then the probability
that it comes up four times tails

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.360
is 6.25 percent.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.736
And I hope you can intuitively see

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.136
that the probability that all four
of them are tails is much lower

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.280
than if two of them are tails, right?
