I'm a researcher,
a scientist working with economists,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.016
financial economists,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.096

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.160
founding father of modern economics.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.576
His basic idea was that if everybody
behaves in their own self-interests,
