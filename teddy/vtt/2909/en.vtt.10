00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.376
In my research, we find, for example,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.776
at the University of Zurich,

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.000
that Swiss banks
who get caught up in media,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.496
and in the context, for example,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.056
of tax evasion, of tax fraud,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.816
have bad media coverage.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.576
They lose net new money in the future

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.216
and therefore make lower profits.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.600
That's a very powerful reputational force.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.800
Benefits and costs.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.696
Here's another viewpoint of the world.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.256
Meet Immanuel Kant,

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.040
18th-century German philosopher superstar.
