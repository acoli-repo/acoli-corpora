00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.976
and we conduct so-called experiments
to address this issue.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.296
We strip away facts
which are confusing in reality.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.056
Reality is so rich,
there is so much going on,

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.040
it's almost impossible to know
what drives people's behavior really.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.240
So let's do a little experiment together.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.280
Imagine the following situation.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.816
You're in a room alone,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.376
not like here.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.840
There's a five-franc coin
like the one I'm holding up right now

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.136
in front of you.
