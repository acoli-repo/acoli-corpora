I'm not saying I have
all these beautiful values, right?

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.376
But I'm interested in how people behave

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.776
and how we can leverage
that richness in human nature

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.240
to actually improve
the workings of our organizations.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.576
So there are two
very, very different visions here.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.936
On the one hand,

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.976
you can appeal to benefits and costs

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.656
and try to get people
to behave according to them.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.296
On the other hand,

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.336
you can select people who have the values

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.576
and the desirable
characteristics, of course --
