00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.616
among adults.

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.296
But I don't know yet
how this develops over a lifetime.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.760
That will be the subject
of future research.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.296
The idea I want to leave you with

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.096
is it's all right to appeal to incentives.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.336
I'm an economist;

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.280
I certainly believe in the fact
that incentives work.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.416
But do think about selecting
the right people

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.936
rather than having people
and then putting incentives in place.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.216
Selecting the right people
with the right values

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:01.176
may go a long way
to saving a lot of trouble
