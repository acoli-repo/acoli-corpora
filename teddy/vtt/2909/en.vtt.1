I'm pretty sure there are

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.320
you've interacted with today.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.960
Let me tell you a stunning statistic.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.216
One out of seven
large, public corporations

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.480

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.816

that looks at US companies --

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.040
I have no reason to believe
that it's different in Europe.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.696
This is a study that looks
at both detected and undetected fraud

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.456
using statistical methods.
