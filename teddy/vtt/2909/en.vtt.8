weighing the benefits
and costs of our actions.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.440
How does that play out?

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.936
Well, many of you, I'm sure,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.496

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.456

if you disregard it,

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.576

In other words,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.256
this is a very economic motivation

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.056
of trying to get people to be more honest,
