00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.976
shows us that that process
of task encroachment

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.936
not only strengthens
the force of machine substitution,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.296
but it wears down
those helpful complementarities too.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.256
Bring these three myths together

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.216
and I think we can capture a glimpse
of that troubling future.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.256
Machines continue to become more capable,

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.936
encroaching ever deeper
on tasks performed by human beings,

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.536
strengthening the force
of machine substitution,

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.176
weakening the force
of machine complementarity.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.496
And at some point, that balance
falls in favor of machines
