The threat of technological
unemployment is real,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.696
and yet it's a good problem to have.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.936
And to explain
how I came to that conclusion,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.496
I want to confront three myths

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.800
that I think are currently obscuring
our vision of this automated future.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.216
A picture that we see
on our television screens,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.456
in books, in films, in everyday commentary

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.176
is one where an army of robots
descends on the workplace

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.576
with one goal in mind:

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.096
to displace human beings from their work.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.816
And I call this the Terminator myth.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.816
Yes, machines displace
human beings from particular tasks,
