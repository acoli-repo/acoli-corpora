Yes, machines substitute for human beings,
making the original lump of work smaller,

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.376
but they also complement human beings,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.496
and the lump of work
gets bigger and changes.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.376
But LOLFF.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.776
Here's the mistake:

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.016
it's right to think
that technological progress

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.016
makes the lump of work to be done bigger.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.056
Some tasks become more valuable.
New tasks have to be done.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.616
But it's wrong to think that necessarily,

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.896
human beings will be best placed
to perform those tasks.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.536
And this is the superiority myth.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.976
Yes, the lump of work
might get bigger and change,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.976
but as machines become more capable,
