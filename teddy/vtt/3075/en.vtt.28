If economic growth continues
at two percent,

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.776
our children will be twice as rich as us.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.096
If it continues
at a more measly one percent,

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.776
our grandchildren
will be twice as rich as us.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.480
By and large, we've solved
that traditional economic problem.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.216
Now, technological unemployment,
if it does happen,

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.456
in a strange way will be
a symptom of that success,

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.336
will have solved one problem --
how to make the pie bigger --

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.176
but replaced it with another --

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.960
how to make sure
that everyone gets a slice.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.336
As other economists have noted,
solving this problem won't be easy.
