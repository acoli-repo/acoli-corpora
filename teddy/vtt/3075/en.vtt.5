00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.256
150 years ago, in factories,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.136
and today, most people work in offices.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.216
And once again, people displaced
from tasks in the old bit of pie

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.040
could tumble into tasks
in the new bit of pie instead.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.056
Economists call these effects
complementarities,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.336
but really that's just a fancy word
to capture the different way

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.496
that technological progress
helps human beings.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.616
Resolving this Terminator myth

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.976
shows us that there are
two forces at play:

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.536
one, machine substitution
that harms workers,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.440
but also these complementarities
that do the opposite.
