00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.256
to design bigger,
more complicated buildings.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.976
But technological progress doesn't
just complement human beings directly.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.336
It also complements them indirectly,
and it does this in two ways.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.696
The first is if we think
of the economy as a pie,

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.616
technological progress
makes the pie bigger.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.496
As productivity increases,
incomes rise and demand grows.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.296
The British pie, for instance,

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.280
is more than a hundred times
the size it was 300 years ago.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.136
And so people displaced
from tasks in the old pie

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.880
could find tasks to do
in the new pie instead.
