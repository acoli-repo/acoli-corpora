Yes, machines displace
human beings from particular tasks,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.096
but they don't just
substitute for human beings.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.096
They also complement them in other tasks,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.736
making that work more valuable
and more important.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.096
Sometimes they complement
human beings directly,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.136
making them more productive
or more efficient at a particular task.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.776
So a taxi driver can use a satnav system
to navigate on unfamiliar roads.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.136
An architect can use
computer-assisted design software

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.256
to design bigger,
more complicated buildings.
