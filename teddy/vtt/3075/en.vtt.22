00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.816
will simply make these
driverless cars more efficient,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.376
helping the machines instead.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.456
Or go to those indirect complementarities
that I mentioned as well.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.256
The economic pie may get larger,

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.016
but as machines become more capable,

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.183
it's possible that any new demand
will fall on goods that machines,

00:11:13.207 --> 00:11:15.856
rather than human beings,
are best placed to produce.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.776
The economic pie may change,

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.696
but as machines become more capable,

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.576
it's possible that they'll be best placed
to do the new tasks that have to be done.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.296
In short, demand for tasks
isn't demand for human labor.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.256
Human beings only stand to benefit
