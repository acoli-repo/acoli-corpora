00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.976
but as machines become more capable,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.896
it's likely that they'll take on
the extra lump of work themselves.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.176
Technological progress,
rather than complement human beings,

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.080
complements machines instead.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.936
To see this, go back
to the task of driving a car.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.056
Today, satnav systems
directly complement human beings.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.360
They make some
human beings better drivers.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.176
But in the future,

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.296
software is going to displace
human beings from the driving seat,

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.256
and these satnav systems,
rather than complement human beings,

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.816
will simply make these
driverless cars more efficient,
