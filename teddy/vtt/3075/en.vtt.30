00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.256
can be enjoyed by everyone

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.696
in a world in which
our traditional mechanism

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.576
for slicing up the pie,

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.536
the work that people do,

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.720
withers away and perhaps disappears.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.640
Solving this problem is going to require
us to think in very different ways.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.576
There's going to be a lot of disagreement
about what ought to be done,

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.016
but it's important to remember
that this is a far better problem to have

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.856
than the one that haunted
our ancestors for centuries:

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.256
how to make that pie
big enough in the first place.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.536
Thank you very much.
