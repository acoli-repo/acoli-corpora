00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.360
the small metal discs
that fasten on the end of screws.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.760
And this dock worker
felt guilty for being more productive.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.736
Now, most of the time,
we expect the opposite,

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.976
that people feel guilty
for being unproductive,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.016
you know, a little too much time
on Facebook or Twitter at work.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.576
But this worker felt guilty
for being more productive,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.896
and asked why, he said,
"I know I'm doing wrong.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.960
I'm taking away the work of another man."

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.736
In his mind, there was
some fixed lump of work

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.896
to be divided up between him and his pals,

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.976
so that if he used
this machine to do more,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.016
there'd be less left for his pals to do.
