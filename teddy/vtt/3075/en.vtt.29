00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.336
As other economists have noted,
solving this problem won't be easy.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.016
Today, for most people,

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.536
their job is their seat
at the economic dinner table,

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.976
and in a world with less work
or even without work,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.056
it won't be clear
how they get their slice.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.416
There's a great deal
of discussion, for instance,

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.136
about various forms
of universal basic income

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.376
as one possible approach,

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.016
and there's trials underway

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.440
in the United States
and in Finland and in Kenya.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.176
And this is the collective challenge
that's right in front of us,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:59.256
to figure out how this material prosperity
generated by our economic system

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.256
can be enjoyed by everyone
