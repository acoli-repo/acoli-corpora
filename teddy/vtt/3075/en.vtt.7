There's countless systems out there
that can diagnose medical problems.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.776
And there's even an app
that can identify a bird

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.000
at a fleeting glimpse.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.296
Now, this wasn't simply a case of bad luck
on the part of economists.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.616
They were wrong,

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.136
and the reason why
they were wrong is very important.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.416
They've fallen for the intelligence myth,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.336
the belief that machines
have to copy the way

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.416
that human beings think and reason

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.216
in order to outperform them.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.456
When these economists
were trying to figure out

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.336
what tasks machines could not do,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.496
they imagined the only way
to automate a task
