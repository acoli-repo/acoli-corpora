00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.656
rules-based or well-defined.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.616
Those are all just
different words for routine.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.616
And go back to those three cases
that I mentioned at the start.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.536
Those are all classic cases
of nonroutine tasks.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.536
Ask a doctor, for instance,
how she makes a medical diagnosis,

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.216
and she might be able
to give you a few rules of thumb,

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.896
but ultimately she'd struggle.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.736
She'd say it requires things like
creativity and judgment and intuition.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.136
And these things are
very difficult to articulate,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.256
and so it was thought these tasks
would be very hard to automate.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.816
If a human being can't explain themselves,
