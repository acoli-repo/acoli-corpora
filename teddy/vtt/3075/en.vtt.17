00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.016
those complementarities from before,

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.080
are committing something
known as the lump of labor fallacy.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.135
Now, the problem is
the lump of labor fallacy

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.655
is itself a fallacy,

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.616
and I call this the lump
of labor fallacy fallacy,

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.960
or LOLFF, for short.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.416
Let me explain.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.576
The lump of labor fallacy
is a very old idea.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.816
It was a British economist, David Schloss,
who gave it this name in 1892.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.656
He was puzzled
to come across a dock worker

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.016
who had begun to use
a machine to make washers,

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.360
the small metal discs
that fasten on the end of screws.
