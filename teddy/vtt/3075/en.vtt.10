get her to explain to you
how it was she solved a legal problem,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.456
and then try and capture that explanation
in a set of rules for a machine to follow.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.096
In economics, if human beings
could explain themselves in this way,

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.416
the tasks are called routine,
and they could be automated.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.776
But if human beings
can't explain themselves,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.056
the tasks are called non-routine,
and they're thought to be out reach.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.376
Today, that routine-nonroutine
distinction is widespread.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.456
Think how often you hear people say to you

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.736
machines can only perform tasks
that are predictable or repetitive,

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.656
rules-based or well-defined.
