00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.256
Human beings only stand to benefit

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.096
if they retain the upper hand
in all these complemented tasks,

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.840
but as machines become more capable,
that becomes less likely.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.776
So what do these three myths tell us then?

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.496
Well, resolving the Terminator myth

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.216
shows us that the future of work depends
upon this balance between two forces:

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.376
one, machine substitution
that harms workers

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.976
but also those complementarities
that do the opposite.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.040
And until now, this balance
has fallen in favor of human beings.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.856
But resolving the intelligence myth

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.376
shows us that that first force,
machine substitution,
