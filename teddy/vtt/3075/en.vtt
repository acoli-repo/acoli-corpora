Automation anxiety
has been spreading lately,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.816

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.296

rather than human beings,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.616
given the remarkable advances
that are unfolding

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.416
in artificial intelligence and robotics.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.256
What's clear is that
there will be significant change.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.896

The threat of technological
unemployment is real,
