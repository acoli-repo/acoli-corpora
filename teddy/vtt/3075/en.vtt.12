If a human being can't explain themselves,

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.736
where on earth do we begin
in writing a set of instructions

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.960
for a machine to follow?

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.216
Thirty years ago, this view was right,

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.376
but today it's looking shaky,

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.656
and in the future
it's simply going to be wrong.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.936
Advances in processing power,
in data storage capability

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.616
and in algorithm design

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.136
mean that this
routine-nonroutine distinction

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.896
is diminishingly useful.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.176
To see this, go back to the case
of making a medical diagnosis.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.576
Earlier in the year,

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.896
a team of researchers at Stanford
announced they'd developed a system
