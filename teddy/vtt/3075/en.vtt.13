00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.896
a team of researchers at Stanford
announced they'd developed a system

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.976
which can tell you
whether or not a freckle is cancerous

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.680
as accurately as leading dermatologists.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.536
How does it work?

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.856
It's not trying to copy the judgment
or the intuition of a doctor.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.016
It knows or understands
nothing about medicine at all.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.616
Instead, it's running
a pattern recognition algorithm

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.296
through 129,450 past cases,

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.416
hunting for similarities
between those cases

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.520
and the particular lesion in question.
