00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So I'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and why this is an incredibly important,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
long, oily, hot summer,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But before I talk about the political chemistry,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is a photograph from when I visited

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in 2002

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to watch the Minerals Management Service

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
testing their ability

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to burn oil spills in ice.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And what you see here is, you see a little bit of crude oil,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
you see some ice cubes,
