00:01:59.441 --> 00:02:01.969
and actually seeing it during
a specific event.

00:02:01.993 --> 00:02:05.426
And I decided I wanted to see
the historical Regata,

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.929
an event that's actually been
taking place since 1498.

00:02:09.906 --> 00:02:13.548
The boats and the costumes
look exactly as they did then.

00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:18.323
And an important element that I really
want you guys to understand is:

00:02:18.347 --> 00:02:19.821
this is not a timelapse,

00:02:19.845 --> 00:02:23.709
this is me photographing
throughout the day and the night.

00:02:25.181 --> 00:02:28.487
I am a relentless collector
of magical moments.

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:32.546
And the thing that drives me
is the fear of just missing one of them.
