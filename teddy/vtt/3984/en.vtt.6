00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:00.872
of 250 single images.

00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:04.949
So I had DiCaprio and Claire Danes
embracing.

00:03:04.973 --> 00:03:07.763
And as I pan my camera to the right,

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:10.385
I noticed there was a mirror on the wall

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.824
and I saw they were
actually reflecting in it.

00:03:12.848 --> 00:03:14.778
And for that one moment, that one image

00:03:14.802 --> 00:03:16.668
I asked them, "Would you guys just kiss

00:03:16.692 --> 00:03:18.061
for this one picture?"

00:03:18.085 --> 00:03:20.876
And then I came back
to my studio in New York,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.821
and I hand-glued these 250 images together

00:03:24.845 --> 00:03:27.670
and stood back and went,
"Wow, this is so cool!

00:03:27.694 --> 00:03:30.051
I'm changing time in a photograph."
