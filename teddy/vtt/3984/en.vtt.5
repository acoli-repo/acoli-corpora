And the thing that drives me
is the fear of just missing one of them.

00:02:36.227 --> 00:02:40.869
The entire concept came about in 1996.

00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:45.118
LIFE Magazine commissioned me
to create a panoramic photograph

00:02:45.142 --> 00:02:49.797
of the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann's
film Romeo + Juliet.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.087
I got to the set and realized:
it's a square.

00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:58.509
So the only way I could actually create
a panoramic was to shoot a collage

00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:00.872
of 250 single images.
