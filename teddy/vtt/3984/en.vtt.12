00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.841
and I've always been a huge fan
of Albert Bierstadt,

00:06:01.865 --> 00:06:03.699
the great Hudson River School painter.

00:06:03.723 --> 00:06:07.096
He inspired a recent series
that I did on the National Parks.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.389
This is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley.

00:06:10.347 --> 00:06:13.092
So this is the photograph
I created of Yosemite.

00:06:13.427 --> 00:06:17.206
This is actually the cover story
of the 2016 January issue

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.523
of National Geographic.

00:06:19.592 --> 00:06:22.347
I photographed for over
30 hours in this picture.

00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:24.242
I was literally on the side of a cliff,

00:06:25.044 --> 00:06:29.085
capturing the stars
and the moonlight as it transitions,

00:06:29.109 --> 00:06:30.964
the moonlight lighting El Capitan.
