00:04:29.257 --> 00:04:31.635
Think of the surface of a trampoline:

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:34.246
it warps and stretches with gravity.

00:04:34.924 --> 00:04:37.718
I see time as a fabric as well,

00:04:37.742 --> 00:04:43.071
except I take that fabric and flatten it,
compress it into single plane.

00:04:43.095 --> 00:04:45.294
One of the unique aspects
of this work is also,

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:46.818
if you look at all my pictures,

00:04:46.842 --> 00:04:48.352
the time vector changes:

00:04:48.376 --> 00:04:50.062
sometimes I'll go left to right,

00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:54.114
sometimes front to back,
up or down, even diagonally.

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:57.986
I am exploring the space-time continuum

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.249
within a two-dimensional still photograph.
