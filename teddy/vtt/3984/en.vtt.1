00:00:29.222 --> 00:00:32.140
compressing the best moments
of the day and the night

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:34.663
seamlessly into one single image?

00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:38.172
I've created a concept
called "Day to Night"

00:00:38.196 --> 00:00:39.823
and I believe it's going to change

00:00:39.847 --> 00:00:41.284
the way you look at the world.

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:42.458
I know it has for me.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.870
My process begins by photographing
iconic locations,

00:00:47.894 --> 00:00:50.735
places that are part of what I call
our collective memory.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.000
I photograph from a fixed vantage point,
and I never move.

00:00:55.024 --> 00:00:59.371
I capture the fleeting moments
of humanity and light as time passes.

00:00:59.981 --> 00:01:02.848
Photographing for anywhere
from 15 to 30 hours
