00:08:28.384 --> 00:08:30.498
I discovered that those people in cars

00:08:30.522 --> 00:08:32.832
that I sort of live with everyday,

00:08:32.856 --> 00:08:34.912
they don't look like people
in cars anymore.

00:08:34.936 --> 00:08:37.414
They feel like a giant school of fish,

00:08:37.438 --> 00:08:39.398
it was a form of emergent behavior.

00:08:40.063 --> 00:08:42.983
And when people describe
the energy of New York,

00:08:43.007 --> 00:08:45.943
I think this photograph begins
to really capture that.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.995
When you look closer in my work,

00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:50.211
you can see there's stories going on.

00:08:50.235 --> 00:08:53.174
You realize that Times Square is a canyon,

00:08:53.198 --> 00:08:55.474
it's shadow and it's sunlight.

00:08:55.883 --> 00:08:59.081
So I decided, in this photograph,
I would checkerboard time.

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:01.166
So wherever the shadows are, it's night
