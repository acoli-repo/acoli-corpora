00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:30.396
And simultaneously,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.654
I can show you Notre Dame aglow at night.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.319
And in between, I can show you
the romance of the City of Light.

00:01:39.885 --> 00:01:43.177
I am essentially a street photographer
from 50 feet in the air,

00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:45.531
and every single thing you see
in this photograph

00:01:45.555 --> 00:01:47.416
actually happened on this day.

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.702
Day to Night is a global project,

00:01:52.726 --> 00:01:55.019
and my work has always been about history.

00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:59.417
I'm fascinated by the concept
of going to a place like Venice

00:01:59.441 --> 00:02:01.969
and actually seeing it during
a specific event.
