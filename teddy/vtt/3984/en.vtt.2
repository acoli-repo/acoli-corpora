00:00:59.981 --> 00:01:02.848
Photographing for anywhere
from 15 to 30 hours

00:01:02.872 --> 00:01:05.109
and shooting over 1,500 images,

00:01:05.508 --> 00:01:08.213
I then choose the best moments
of the day and night.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.010
Using time as a guide,

00:01:11.034 --> 00:01:15.327
I seamlessly blend those best moments
into one single photograph,

00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:17.999
visualizing our conscious
journey with time.

00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:21.400
I can take you to Paris

00:01:21.424 --> 00:01:23.273
for a view from the Tournelle Bridge.

00:01:24.342 --> 00:01:26.456
And I can show you the
early morning rowers

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.797
along the River Seine.

00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:30.396
And simultaneously,
