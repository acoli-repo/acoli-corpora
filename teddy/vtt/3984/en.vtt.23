00:11:36.479 --> 00:11:38.586
is something we all have to share.

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:42.310
When I created this picture,

00:11:43.222 --> 00:11:47.476

is really a new way of seeing,

00:11:48.127 --> 00:11:49.349
compressing time,

00:11:50.349 --> 00:11:53.524
exploring the space-time continuum
