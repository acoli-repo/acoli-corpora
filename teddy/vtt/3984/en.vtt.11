00:05:28.543 --> 00:05:30.361
It's at the end of the process,

00:05:30.385 --> 00:05:33.393
if I've had a really great day
and everything remained the same,

00:05:33.417 --> 00:05:36.026
that I then decide who's in and who's out,

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.785
and it's all based on time.

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:41.232
I'll take those best moments that I pick
over a month of editing

00:05:41.256 --> 00:05:44.898
and they get seamlessly blended
into the master plate.

00:05:46.168 --> 00:05:48.463
I'm compressing the day and night

00:05:48.487 --> 00:05:49.637
as I saw it,

00:05:50.151 --> 00:05:54.097
creating a unique harmony between
these two very discordant worlds.

00:05:55.268 --> 00:05:59.106
Painting has always been a really
important influence in all my work

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.841
and I've always been a huge fan
of Albert Bierstadt,
