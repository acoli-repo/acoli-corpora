I'm driven by pure passion

00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:06.039
to create photographs that tell stories.

00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:11.245
Photography can be described
as the recording of a single moment

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.475
frozen within a fraction of time.

00:00:14.184 --> 00:00:18.337
Each moment or photograph
represents a tangible piece

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:20.874
of our memories as time passes.

00:00:21.547 --> 00:00:25.136
But what if you could capture more
than one moment in a photograph?

00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:28.533
What if a photograph
could actually collapse time,

00:00:29.222 --> 00:00:32.140
compressing the best moments
of the day and the night
