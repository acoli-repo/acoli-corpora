00:10:29.532 --> 00:10:32.440
I went specifically during
the peak migration

00:10:32.464 --> 00:10:35.535
to hopefully capture
the most diverse range of animals.

00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:38.083
Unfortunately, when we got there,

00:10:38.107 --> 00:10:40.687
there was a drought going on
during the peak migration,

00:10:40.711 --> 00:10:41.862
a five-week drought.

00:10:41.886 --> 00:10:44.479
So all the animals
were drawn to the water.

00:10:44.503 --> 00:10:46.744
I found this one watering hole,

00:10:46.768 --> 00:10:50.793
and felt if everything remained
the same way it was behaving,

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:54.301
I had a real opportunity
to capture something unique.

00:10:54.325 --> 00:10:56.130
We spent three days studying it,

00:10:56.154 --> 00:10:57.821
and nothing could have prepared me

00:10:57.845 --> 00:10:59.845
for what I witnessed during our shoot day.
