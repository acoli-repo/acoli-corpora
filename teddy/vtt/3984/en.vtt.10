within a two-dimensional still photograph.

00:05:01.114 --> 00:05:03.018
Now when I do these pictures,

00:05:03.042 --> 00:05:05.994
it's literally like a real-time puzzle
going on in my mind.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.408
I build a photograph based on time,

00:05:09.432 --> 00:05:11.455
and this is what I call the master plate.

00:05:11.766 --> 00:05:14.527
This can take us several
months to complete.

00:05:15.126 --> 00:05:17.425
The fun thing about this work is

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.779
I have absolutely zero control
when I get up there

00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:23.194
on any given day and capture photographs.

00:05:23.218 --> 00:05:25.512
So I never know who's
going to be in the picture,

00:05:25.536 --> 00:05:28.519
if it's going to be a great
sunrise or sunset -- no control.

00:05:28.543 --> 00:05:30.361
It's at the end of the process,
