I'm changing time in a photograph."

00:03:30.422 --> 00:03:34.612
And that concept actually
stayed with me for 13 years

00:03:34.636 --> 00:03:38.619
until technology finally
has caught up to my dreams.

00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:42.504
This is an image I created
of the Santa Monica Pier, Day to Night.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.809
And I'm going to show you a little video

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:47.386
that gives you an idea of what
it's like being with me

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.306
when I do these pictures.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.766
To start with, you have to understand
that to get views like this,

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.519
most of my time is spent up high,
and I'm usually in a cherry picker

00:03:56.543 --> 00:03:57.694
or a crane.

00:03:57.718 --> 00:04:01.110
So this is a typical day,
12-18 hours, non-stop
