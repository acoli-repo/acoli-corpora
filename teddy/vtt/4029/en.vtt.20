00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:00.239
which is based on a bacteria.

00:10:00.239 --> 00:10:06.067
This pesticide is very specific
to caterpillar pests,

00:10:06.067 --> 00:10:09.643
and in fact, it's nontoxic
to humans, fish and birds.

00:10:09.643 --> 00:10:12.754
It's less toxic than table salt.

00:10:12.754 --> 00:10:15.332
But this approach
does not work well in Bangladesh.

00:10:15.332 --> 00:10:17.746
That's because these insecticide sprays

00:10:17.746 --> 00:10:19.999
are difficult to find, they're expensive,

00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:24.341
and they don't prevent the insect
from getting inside the plants.

00:10:24.341 --> 00:10:27.545
In the genetic approach, scientists
cut the gene out of the bacteria

00:10:27.545 --> 00:10:30.726
and insert it directly into
the eggplant genome.
