It could withstand two weeks
of complete submergence.

00:04:30.178 --> 00:04:35.448
He asked if I would be willing
to help them isolate this gene.

00:04:35.448 --> 00:04:39.999
I said yes -- I was very excited,
because I knew if we were successful,

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:43.993
we could potentially help
millions of farmers grow rice

00:04:43.993 --> 00:04:47.453
even when their fields were flooded.

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:51.516
Kenong spent 10 years
looking for this gene.

00:04:51.516 --> 00:04:53.513
Then one day, he said,

00:04:53.513 --> 00:04:57.135
"Come look at this experiment.
You've got to see it."

00:04:57.135 --> 00:04:58.992
I went to the greenhouse and I saw

00:04:58.992 --> 00:05:04.292
that the conventional variety
that was flooded for 18 days had died,
