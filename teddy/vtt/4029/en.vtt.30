00:14:59.575 --> 00:15:02.245
one thing that's really important
to understand is that,

00:15:02.245 --> 00:15:04.911
in the developed world,
farmers in the United States,

00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:07.732
almost all farmers, whether
they're organic or conventional,

00:15:07.732 --> 00:15:09.830
they buy seed produced by seed companies.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.932
So there's definitely a commercial
interest to sell a lot of seed,

00:15:12.932 --> 00:15:15.935
but hopefully they're selling seed
that the farmers want to buy.

00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:18.196
It's different in the
less developed world.

00:15:18.196 --> 00:15:20.309
Farmers there cannot afford the seed.

00:15:20.309 --> 00:15:21.935
These seeds are not being sold.

00:15:21.935 --> 00:15:24.303
These seeds are being distributed freely

00:15:24.303 --> 00:15:29.365
through traditional kinds
of certification groups,

00:15:29.365 --> 00:15:31.848
so it is very important
in less developed countries
