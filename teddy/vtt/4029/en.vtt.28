00:13:59.902 --> 00:14:01.736
and safeguard the environment.

00:14:01.736 --> 00:14:03.988
Thank you.

00:14:03.988 --> 00:14:05.915
(Applause)

00:14:05.915 --> 00:14:08.493
Thank you.

00:14:08.493 --> 00:14:10.397
Chris Anderson: Powerfully argued.

00:14:10.397 --> 00:14:12.556
The people who argue against GMOs,

00:14:12.556 --> 00:14:16.387
as I understand it, the core piece
comes from two things.

00:14:16.387 --> 00:14:19.277
One, complexity and
unintended consequence.

00:14:19.277 --> 00:14:21.318
Nature is this incredibly complex machine.

00:14:21.318 --> 00:14:23.902
If we put out these brand new genes
that we've created,

00:14:23.902 --> 00:14:26.326
that haven't been challenged
by years of evolution,

00:14:26.326 --> 00:14:29.233
and they started mixing up
with the rest of what's going on,

00:14:29.233 --> 00:14:32.670
couldn't that trigger some kind
of cataclysm or problem,
