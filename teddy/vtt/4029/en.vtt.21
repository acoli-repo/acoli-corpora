00:10:27.545 --> 00:10:30.726
and insert it directly into
the eggplant genome.

00:10:30.726 --> 00:10:34.116
Will this work to reduce
insecticide sprays in Bangladesh?

00:10:34.116 --> 00:10:35.555
Definitely.

00:10:35.555 --> 00:10:40.106
Last season, farmers reported they were
able to reduce their insecticide use

00:10:40.106 --> 00:10:44.471
by a huge amount, almost down to zero.

00:10:44.471 --> 00:10:47.560
They're able to harvest
and replant for the next season.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.505
Now, I've given you a couple examples
of how genetic engineering can be used

00:10:52.505 --> 00:10:54.293
to fight pests and disease

00:10:54.293 --> 00:10:57.033
and to reduce the amount of insecticides.

00:10:57.033 --> 00:11:00.400
My final example is an example
