00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.888
Now, the same month
that my laboratory published

00:03:37.888 --> 00:03:40.675
our discovery on the rice immunity gene,

00:03:40.675 --> 00:03:44.274
my friend and colleague Dave Mackill
stopped by my office.

00:03:44.274 --> 00:03:51.794
He said, "Seventy million rice farmers
are having trouble growing rice."

00:03:52.864 --> 00:03:55.651
That's because their fields are flooded,

00:03:55.651 --> 00:04:00.272
and these rice farmers are living
on less than two dollars a day.
