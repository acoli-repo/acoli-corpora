In fact, it produces
three and a half times more grain

00:06:00.124 --> 00:06:03.468
than the conventional variety.

00:06:03.468 --> 00:06:05.465
I love this video

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:09.760
because it shows the power
of plant genetics to help farmers.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.150
Last year, with the help
of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.260
three and a half million farmers
grew Sub1 rice.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.439
(Applause)

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:24.388
Thank you.

00:06:25.168 --> 00:06:29.310
Now, many people don't mind
genetic modification

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.050
when it comes to moving rice genes around,
