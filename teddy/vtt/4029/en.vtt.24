00:12:02.504 --> 00:12:05.967
to save their sight and their lives.

00:12:05.967 --> 00:12:08.710
Some of my friends and family still worry:

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.961
How do you know genes
in the food are safe to eat?

00:12:11.961 --> 00:12:13.679
I explained the genetic engineering,

00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:16.047
the process of moving
genes between species,

00:12:16.047 --> 00:12:18.857
has been used for more than 40 years

00:12:18.857 --> 00:12:23.172
in wines, in medicine,
in plants, in cheeses.

00:12:23.172 --> 00:12:26.296
In all that time, there hasn't been
a single case of harm

00:12:26.296 --> 00:12:30.164
to human health or the environment.
