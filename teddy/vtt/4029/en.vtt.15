Many people thought
that the Hawaiian papaya was doomed,

00:07:33.465 --> 00:07:36.529
but then, a local Hawaiian,

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:39.200
a plant pathologist
named Dennis Gonsalves,

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.631
decided to try to fight this disease
using genetic engineering.

00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:47.299
He took a snippet of viral DNA
and he inserted it

00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:49.412
into the papaya genome.

00:07:49.412 --> 00:07:52.686
This is kind of like a human
getting a vaccination.

00:07:52.686 --> 00:07:55.217
Now, take a look at his field trial.

00:07:55.217 --> 00:07:58.839
You can see the genetically
engineered papaya in the center.

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:01.022
It's immune to infection.
