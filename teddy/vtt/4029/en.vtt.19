cannot afford proper protection,
like these children.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.903
In less developed countries,
it's estimated that 300,000 people

00:09:37.903 --> 00:09:43.313
die every year because of
insecticide misuse and exposure.

00:09:43.313 --> 00:09:47.121
Cornell and Bangladeshi scientists
decided to fight this disease

00:09:47.121 --> 00:09:52.373
using a genetic technique that builds
on an organic farming approach.

00:09:52.373 --> 00:09:57.263
Organic farmers like my husband Raoul
spray an insecticide called B.T.,

00:09:57.263 --> 00:10:00.239
which is based on a bacteria.
