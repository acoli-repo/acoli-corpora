Now, today, breeders have
even more options to choose from.

00:02:31.626 --> 00:02:35.364
Some of them are extraordinarily precise.

00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:39.172
I want to give you a couple examples
from my own work.

00:02:39.172 --> 00:02:45.047
I work on rice, which is a staple food
for more than half the world's people.

00:02:45.047 --> 00:02:48.181
Each year, 40 percent
of the potential harvest

00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:51.037
is lost to pest and disease.

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:54.167
For this reason,
farmers plant rice varieties

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:57.023
that carry genes for resistance.

00:02:57.023 --> 00:03:00.761
This approach has been used
for nearly 100 years.
