00:10:57.033 --> 00:11:00.400
My final example is an example

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.514
where genetic engineering
can be used to reduce malnutrition.

00:11:06.024 --> 00:11:08.573
In less developed countries,

00:11:08.573 --> 00:11:13.239
500,000 children go blind every year
because of lack of Vitamin A.

00:11:13.239 --> 00:11:16.004
More than half will die.

00:11:16.004 --> 00:11:19.857
For this reason, scientists supported
by the Rockefeller Foundation

00:11:19.857 --> 00:11:22.713
genetically engineered a golden rice

00:11:22.713 --> 00:11:27.264
to produce beta-carotene,
which is the precursor of Vitamin A.

00:11:27.264 --> 00:11:30.589
This is the same pigment
that we find in carrots.
