00:04:58.992 --> 00:05:04.292
that the conventional variety
that was flooded for 18 days had died,

00:05:04.292 --> 00:05:07.955
but the rice variety that we
had genetically engineered

00:05:07.955 --> 00:05:12.459
with a new gene we had discovered,
called Sub1, was alive.

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:14.944
Kenong and I were amazed and excited

00:05:14.944 --> 00:05:18.775
that a single gene could have
this dramatic effect.

00:05:18.775 --> 00:05:22.417
But this is just a greenhouse experiment.

00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:25.783
Would this work in the field?

00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:28.523
Now, I'm going to show you
a four-month time lapse video

00:05:28.523 --> 00:05:31.565
taken at the International
Rice Research Institute.
