00:15:29.365 --> 00:15:31.848
so it is very important
in less developed countries

00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:33.473
that the seed be freely available.

00:15:33.473 --> 00:15:37.097
CA: Wouldn't some activists say that this
is actually part of the conspiracy?

00:15:37.097 --> 00:15:38.513
This is the heroin strategy.

00:15:38.513 --> 00:15:40.765
You seed the stuff,
and people have no choice

00:15:40.765 --> 00:15:42.704
but to be hooked on these seeds forever?

00:15:42.704 --> 00:15:48.091
PR: There are a lot of conspiracy theories
for sure, but it doesn't work that way.

00:15:48.091 --> 00:15:52.067
For example, the seed that's being
distributed, the flood-tolerant rice,

00:15:52.067 --> 00:15:53.912
this is distributed freely

00:15:53.912 --> 00:15:58.029
through Indian and Bangladeshi
seed certification agencies,

00:15:58.029 --> 00:16:00.444
so there's no commercial interest at all.
