00:05:28.523 --> 00:05:31.565
taken at the International
Rice Research Institute.

00:05:31.565 --> 00:05:36.590
Breeders there developed
a rice variety carrying the Sub1 gene

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.226
using another genetic technique
called precision breeding.

00:05:40.226 --> 00:05:42.826
On the left, you can see the Sub1 variety,

00:05:42.826 --> 00:05:46.471
and on the right
is the conventional variety.

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:48.933
Both varieties do very well at first,

00:05:48.933 --> 00:05:52.346
but then the field is flooded for 17 days.

00:05:52.346 --> 00:05:55.271
You can see the Sub1 variety does great.

00:05:55.271 --> 00:06:00.124
In fact, it produces
three and a half times more grain
