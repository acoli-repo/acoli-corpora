00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.292
I am a plant geneticist.

00:00:03.292 --> 00:00:06.867
I study genes that make plants
resistant to disease

00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:09.189
and tolerant of stress.

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:11.465
In recent years,

00:00:11.465 --> 00:00:14.367
millions of people around the world
have come to believe

00:00:14.367 --> 00:00:18.500
that there's something sinister
about genetic modification.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.003
Today, I am going to provide
a different perspective.

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:26.569
First, let me introduce my husband, Raoul.

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.192
He's an organic farmer.

00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:33.140
On his farm, he plants
a variety of different crops.
