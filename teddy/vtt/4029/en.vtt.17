00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:30.463
Now, some of you may still feel a little
queasy about viral genes in your food,

00:08:30.463 --> 00:08:32.600
but consider this:

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:39.380
The genetically engineered papaya
carries just a trace amount of the virus.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.770
If you bite into an organic
or conventional papaya

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.625
that is infected with the virus,

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:50.641
you will be chewing on tenfold
more viral protein.

00:08:50.641 --> 00:08:54.593
Now, take a look at this pest
feasting on an eggplant.

00:08:54.593 --> 00:08:56.980
The brown you see is frass,

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.161
what comes out
the back end of the insect.
