00:01:59.607 --> 00:02:01.720
using a process called grafting

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.522
to create this variety
that's half tomato and half potato.

00:02:07.525 --> 00:02:12.076
Breeders have also used
other types of genetic techniques,

00:02:12.076 --> 00:02:14.119
such as random mutagenesis,

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:17.509
which induces uncharacterized mutations

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:19.808
into the plants.

00:02:19.808 --> 00:02:24.134
The rice in the cereal
that many of us fed our babies

00:02:24.134 --> 00:02:27.957
was developed using this approach.

00:02:27.957 --> 00:02:31.626
Now, today, breeders have
even more options to choose from.
