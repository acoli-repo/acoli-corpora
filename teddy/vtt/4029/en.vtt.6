This approach has been used
for nearly 100 years.

00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:03.942
Yet, when I started graduate school,

00:03:03.942 --> 00:03:06.195
no one knew what these genes were.

00:03:06.195 --> 00:03:11.280
It wasn't until the 1990s
that scientists finally uncovered

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.414
the genetic basis of resistance.

00:03:14.414 --> 00:03:19.174
In my laboratory, we isolated a gene
for immunity to a very serious

00:03:19.174 --> 00:03:21.937
bacterial disease in Asia and Africa.

00:03:21.937 --> 00:03:27.277
We found we could engineer the gene
into a conventional rice variety

00:03:27.277 --> 00:03:29.088
that's normally susceptible,

00:03:29.088 --> 00:03:31.526
and you can see the two leaves
