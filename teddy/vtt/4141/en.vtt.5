Voice: The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic.

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:35.091
MT: There are two colors in a deck of cards.

00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:38.082
There is the color red

00:02:38.082 --> 00:02:43.019
and the color black,

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.018
representing the constant change

00:02:46.018 --> 00:02:49.018
from day to night.

00:02:49.018 --> 00:02:51.059
Voice: Marco, I did not know you could do that. (Laughter)

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:55.096
MT: And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards

00:02:55.096 --> 00:03:00.099
in a deck of cards, just as there are 52 weeks in a year?
