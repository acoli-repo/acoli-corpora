00:02:55.096 --> 00:03:00.099
in a deck of cards, just as there are 52 weeks in a year?

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.033
(Music)

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:06.071
Voice: If you total all the spots on a deck of cards,

00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:09.005
the result is 365.

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:12.049
MT: Oh, 365, the number of days in a year,

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.049
the number of days between

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.084
each birthday.

00:03:17.084 --> 00:03:21.040
Make a wish. (Blowing noise)

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.084
Voice: Don't tell, or it won't come true.

00:03:23.084 --> 00:03:26.043
MT: Well, as a matter of fact, it was on my sixth birthday

00:03:26.043 --> 00:03:29.087
that I received my first deck of cards,

00:03:29.087 --> 00:03:34.027
and ever since that day, I have traveled around the world
