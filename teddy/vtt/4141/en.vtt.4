00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:02.025
Winter is like magic. It's a time of change,

00:02:02.025 --> 00:02:05.096
when warmth turns to cold, water turns to snow,

00:02:05.096 --> 00:02:09.070
and then it all disappears.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.093
There are 13 cards in each suit. (Music)

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:19.050
Voice: Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.008
MT: So over here is low tide,

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.078
and over here is high tide,

00:02:24.078 --> 00:02:27.066
and in the middle is the moon.

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:31.026
Voice: The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic.
