00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:01.727
Like the Ship of Theseus,

00:04:01.727 --> 00:04:05.420
you are a collection of constantly
changing parts:

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.628
your physical body, mind, emotions,
circumstances, and even your quirks,

00:04:11.628 --> 00:04:16.629
always changing, but still in an amazing
and sometimes illogical way,

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:19.074
you stay the same, too.

00:04:19.074 --> 00:04:24.431
This is one of the reasons that 
the question, "Who am I?" is so complex.

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:25.875
And in order to answer it,

00:04:25.875 --> 00:04:28.445
like so many great minds before you,

00:04:28.445 --> 00:04:33.897
you must be willing to dive into the
bottomless ocean of philosophical paradox.
