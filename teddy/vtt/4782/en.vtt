Throughout the history of mankind,

00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:12.384
three little words have sent poets
to the blank page,

00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:14.762
philosophers to the Agora,

00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:17.102
and seekers to the oracles:

00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:19.099
"Who am I?"

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.723
From the ancient Greek aphorism

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:24.459

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:27.192
to The Who's rock anthem, "Who Are You?"

00:00:27.192 --> 00:00:30.312
