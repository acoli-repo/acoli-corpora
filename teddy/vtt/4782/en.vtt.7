What if, as each piece 
of the original ship was cast off,

somebody collected them all,
and rebuilt the entire original ship?

00:03:38.744 --> 00:03:43.783
When it was finished, undeniably

00:03:43.783 --> 00:03:45.798
the one that's docked in Athens,

00:03:45.798 --> 00:03:48.242
and the one in some guy's backyard.

00:03:48.242 --> 00:03:51.875
Each could lay claim to the title,
"The Ship of Theseus,"

00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:55.085

what does this have to do with you?

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:01.727
Like the Ship of Theseus,
