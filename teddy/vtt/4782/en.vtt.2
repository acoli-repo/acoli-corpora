00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.095
The person you are today?

00:01:00.095 --> 00:01:01.383
Five years ago?

00:01:01.383 --> 00:01:03.402
Who you'll be in 50 years?

00:01:03.402 --> 00:01:05.382
And when is "am"?

00:01:05.382 --> 00:01:06.875
This week?

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:08.005
Today?

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:09.143
This hour?

00:01:09.143 --> 00:01:10.531
This second?

00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:13.390
And which aspect of you is "I"?

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.094
Are you your physical body?

00:01:15.094 --> 00:01:16.695
Your thoughts and feelings?

00:01:16.695 --> 00:01:18.368
Your actions?

00:01:18.368 --> 00:01:22.153
These murky waters of abstract logic
are tricky to navigate,

00:01:22.153 --> 00:01:25.752
and so it's probably fitting
that to demonstrate the complexity,

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:31.373
the Greek historian Plutarch
used the story of a ship.
