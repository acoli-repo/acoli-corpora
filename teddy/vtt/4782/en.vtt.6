00:02:56.267 --> 00:03:01.200
the two ships are numerically identical,
meaning one and the same,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.772
so A equals B.

00:03:03.772 --> 00:03:08.981
However, others could argue
that Theseus never set foot on Ship B,

00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:12.698
and his presence on the ship
is an essential qualitative property

00:03:12.698 --> 00:03:14.762
of the Ship of Theseus.

00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:17.169
It cannot survive without him.

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:20.478
So, though the two ships 
are numerically identical,

00:03:20.478 --> 00:03:23.295
they are not qualitatively identical.

00:03:23.295 --> 00:03:26.993
Thus, A does not equal B.

00:03:26.993 --> 00:03:29.523
But what happens 
when we consider this twist?

00:03:29.523 --> 00:03:33.605
What if, as each piece 
of the original ship was cast off,
