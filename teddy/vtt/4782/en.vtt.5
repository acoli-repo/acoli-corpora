Very simply, our question is this:
does A equal B?

00:02:40.517 --> 00:02:45.408
Some would say that for 1000 years
there has been only one Ship of Theseus,

00:02:45.408 --> 00:02:48.493
and because the changes made to it
happened gradually,

00:02:48.493 --> 00:02:53.667
it never at any point in time
stopped being the legendary ship.

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:56.267
Though they have absolutely 
no parts in common,

00:02:56.267 --> 00:03:01.200
the two ships are numerically identical,
meaning one and the same,
