philosophers, psychologists, academics,

00:00:30.312 --> 00:00:34.514
scientists, artists,
theologians and politicians

00:00:34.514 --> 00:00:38.433
have all tackled the subject of identity.

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:42.990
Their hypotheses are widely varied
and lack significant consensus.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.600
These are smart, creative people,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.540
so what's so hard about coming up
with the right answer?

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.559
One challenge certainly lies

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.301
with the complex concept 
of the persistence of identity.

00:00:56.301 --> 00:00:58.490
Which you is who?

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.095
The person you are today?
