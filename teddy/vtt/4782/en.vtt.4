00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:01.319
Whenever a part of the ship
was worn or damaged,

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.592
it was replaced with an identical piece
of the same material

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:09.439
until, at some point, 
no original parts remained.

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:11.372
Plutarch noted the Ship of Theseus


00:02:11.372 --> 00:02:14.549
was an example 
of the philosophical paradox

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.667
revolving around 
the persistence of identity.

00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:20.305
How can every single part 
of something be replaced,

00:02:20.305 --> 00:02:24.022
yet it still remains the same thing?

00:02:24.022 --> 00:02:26.053
Let's imagine there are two ships:

00:02:26.053 --> 00:02:29.299
the ship that Theseus 
docked in Athens, Ship A,

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:35.101
and the ship sailed by the Athenians
1000 years later, Ship B.
