On their 20th birthday, identical twin 
astronauts volunteer for an experiment.

00:00:11.236 --> 00:00:15.311
Terra will remain on Earth, while Stella

00:00:18.903 --> 00:00:21.653
to visit a star that is 10 
light-years away,

00:00:21.653 --> 00:00:23.843
then return to Earth at the same speed.

00:00:23.843 --> 00:00:25.773
As they prepare to part ways,

00:00:25.773 --> 00:00:28.713
