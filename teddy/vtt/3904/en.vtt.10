00:04:57.486 --> 00:05:00.007
and she became passionate
about our climate crisis --

00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:01.365
learned everything about it.

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:02.743
And faced with the evidence,

00:05:02.767 --> 00:05:05.395
she just felt so disappointed
in her leadership

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.091
that she started striking
in front of the Swedish parliament.

00:05:09.115 --> 00:05:11.134
And now she has started a global movement,

00:05:11.158 --> 00:05:14.216
and hundreds and thousands
of school kids are out in the streets

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.232
asking us to hold ourselves
accountable for their future.

00:05:17.592 --> 00:05:20.120
No one gave her that authority,

00:05:20.144 --> 00:05:23.684
and she now speaks to the leaders
of the world, heads of state,

00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:25.667
and really is impacting the world.

00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:29.751
So I really think that when we think
about leadership today,

00:05:29.775 --> 00:05:32.156
it can't be defined
to those in positions of power
