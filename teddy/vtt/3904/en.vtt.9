00:04:29.323 --> 00:04:31.354
because we tend to think about leadership

00:04:31.378 --> 00:04:34.432
as only those who sit
in positions of power.

00:04:34.456 --> 00:04:36.814
To me, leadership is not at all like that.

00:04:36.838 --> 00:04:39.572
There's a leader inside
every single one of us,

00:04:39.596 --> 00:04:43.103
and our most important work in life
is to release that leader.

00:04:43.127 --> 00:04:45.962
And I think one of the greatest
global examples we have

00:04:45.986 --> 00:04:48.508
of someone who didn't --

00:04:48.532 --> 00:04:49.971
no one gave her power --

00:04:49.995 --> 00:04:52.649
is the 16-year-old girl
called Greta Thunberg.

00:04:52.673 --> 00:04:53.835
She's from Sweden,

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:56.231
and a few years ago, she really became --

00:04:56.255 --> 00:04:57.462
she has Asperger's,

00:04:57.486 --> 00:05:00.007
and she became passionate
about our climate crisis --
