00:12:58.965 --> 00:13:04.063
is because right now, our definition
of success is incredibly masculine.

00:13:04.526 --> 00:13:08.809
It's about financial profit alone
or economic growth alone,

00:13:08.833 --> 00:13:11.188
and we all know that we need
more than money.

00:13:11.212 --> 00:13:13.519
I mean, we need wellness:

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:15.018
well-being of people,

00:13:15.042 --> 00:13:19.219
and there is no future
beyond the well-being of our planet.

00:13:19.243 --> 00:13:23.096
So I think gender may very well be
one of the most powerful levers

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.725
to help all of us shift
our economic and social systems

00:13:26.749 --> 00:13:28.169
to be more welcoming.

00:13:28.193 --> 00:13:29.891
And the answer to your last part --

00:13:29.915 --> 00:13:33.082
it's so complicated, but let me try
to give you a short one.
