So to me, that's holistic,
courageous leadership,

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.332
and it's really the vision
we all need to hold.

00:03:34.356 --> 00:03:35.929
BF: Is this "Back to the Future"?

00:03:35.953 --> 00:03:38.803
I mean, I wonder,
when I think about companies --

00:03:38.827 --> 00:03:41.793
Anheuser-Busch comes to mind in America --

00:03:41.817 --> 00:03:44.714
a 100-year-old company
that invested in its community,

00:03:44.738 --> 00:03:45.971
that gave a living wage

00:03:45.995 --> 00:03:48.715
before it ended up, you know,
losing and getting sold.

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.601
Are we really looking now for companies
that are global and community citizens,

00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:57.280
or is that something that is not
even useful anymore?

00:03:57.304 --> 00:04:01.493
HT: Well, you can do this for the reason
that it's risky, actually,
