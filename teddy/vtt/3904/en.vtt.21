00:10:27.253 --> 00:10:31.506
So I would start by trying to build
a coalition for your good idea.

00:10:31.897 --> 00:10:37.631
And I don't know a single leader today
who will not listen to a concern

00:10:37.655 --> 00:10:39.340
that many of their employees hold.

00:10:39.738 --> 00:10:42.435
I'll give you an example
from another B Team leader,

00:10:42.459 --> 00:10:44.198
Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce.

00:10:44.222 --> 00:10:47.538
He's really been outspoken
on homelessness in San Francisco,

00:10:47.562 --> 00:10:51.714
on LGBTQI rights,

00:10:51.738 --> 00:10:54.671
and all of the things
that he's been standing up for,

00:10:54.695 --> 00:10:57.793
he does because his employees
care about them.

00:10:57.817 --> 00:11:02.043
So don't ever think you don't have power
if you don't sit in a position of power.
