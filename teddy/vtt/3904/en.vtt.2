for us to deal with these complicated

is that we are at the lowest levels
of trust we've ever been at.

00:01:07.513 --> 00:01:10.294

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:21.026
HT: We need courageous leaders,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.717
yet they have to be humble.

00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:25.861
And they have to be guided
by a moral compass,

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:29.629
and the moral compass is the combination
of having a social purpose --
