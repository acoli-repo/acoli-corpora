00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.937
and what do you think can impact
the change in that setting

00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:07.742
but also to disrupt the overflow
of generations of people staying in place?

00:12:07.766 --> 00:12:12.824
And what do you think is the next step
to breaking several glass ceilings?

00:12:12.848 --> 00:12:15.752
BF: We're going to do an entire Salon
just on that question.

00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:16.887
(Laughter)

00:12:16.911 --> 00:12:19.877
HT: I think Bryn said it well,
but let me try and touch on it.

00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:24.562
So the way I see gender,
it is a spectrum --

00:12:24.586 --> 00:12:26.115
you know, men also have gender.

00:12:26.139 --> 00:12:28.542
We sometimes forget about that.

00:12:28.566 --> 00:12:29.567
(Laughter)

00:12:29.591 --> 00:12:31.069
We sometimes forget about that.
