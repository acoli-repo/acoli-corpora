I hope we don't need another one
to learn or to wake up.

00:08:32.126 --> 00:08:35.538
But I do see that we can't choose
one or the other.

00:08:35.875 --> 00:08:40.146
We do have to transform the way we lead --

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:42.384
from the top, the boardroom, the CEOs --

00:08:42.408 --> 00:08:44.146
we really do have to transform that,

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.429
but increasingly, we will transform that,

00:08:46.453 --> 00:08:49.435
because we have these social
movements coming from the bottom

00:08:49.459 --> 00:08:50.902
and throughout society.

00:08:51.224 --> 00:08:53.004

00:08:53.622 --> 00:08:56.036
The only thing that's missing is will.

00:08:56.928 --> 00:09:02.866
So if we just all find a way to embrace
a moral compass of our own
