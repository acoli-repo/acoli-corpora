that their way of business is set?

00:10:01.889 --> 00:10:04.387
How do you change minds
when you have no influence?

00:10:04.411 --> 00:10:07.148
HT: Well, thank you very much
for that fantastic question.

00:10:07.172 --> 00:10:09.956
So sometimes people
at the top won't listen,

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.967
but it's interesting that with the low
trust we have in society right now,

00:10:13.991 --> 00:10:15.854
the greatest trust we have

00:10:15.878 --> 00:10:19.167
is actually between the employee
and the employer,

00:10:19.191 --> 00:10:20.830
according to recent research.

00:10:20.854 --> 00:10:24.906
So I think that relationship
may be the most powerful way

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.229
to actually transform
the way we do things.

00:10:27.253 --> 00:10:31.506
So I would start by trying to build
a coalition for your good idea.
