00:13:29.915 --> 00:13:33.082
it's so complicated, but let me try
to give you a short one.

00:13:33.526 --> 00:13:39.743
I believe that the way talent
and consumption is shifting

00:13:39.767 --> 00:13:42.508
is going to increasingly get companies

00:13:42.532 --> 00:13:46.338
to look at adding difference
into their leadership,

00:13:46.362 --> 00:13:48.834
because sameness is not working --

00:13:48.858 --> 00:13:50.569
BF: And difference is a superpower.

00:13:50.593 --> 00:13:52.071
HT: Difference is a superpower.

00:13:52.095 --> 00:13:53.324
BF: Thank you very much.

00:13:53.348 --> 00:13:56.263
Halla, thank you so much,
I wish we could talk to you all day.

00:13:56.287 --> 00:13:57.288
(Applause and cheers)

00:13:57.312 --> 00:13:58.463
HT: Thank you.

00:13:58.487 --> 00:13:59.864
(Applause)
