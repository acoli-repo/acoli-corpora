00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:31.487
But I'm increasingly now thinking
about how we close the generational gap,

00:06:31.511 --> 00:06:34.875
because look at these young children
in the streets around the world --

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:36.197
they're asking us to lead.

00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:39.837
Kofi Annan used to say,
"You're never too young to lead."

00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:41.065
And then he would add,

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:42.958
"Or too old to learn."

00:06:42.982 --> 00:06:45.089
And I think we have now entered this era

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:49.106
where we need the wisdom
of those with experience,

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.800
but we need the digital natives
of the young generation

00:06:52.824 --> 00:06:56.480
to co-mentor or to mentor us
just as much as we can help

00:06:56.504 --> 00:06:59.054
with wisdom from the older people.

00:06:59.078 --> 00:07:00.563
So it's a new reality,
