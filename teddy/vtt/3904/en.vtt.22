So don't ever think you don't have power
if you don't sit in a position of power.

00:11:02.067 --> 00:11:04.531
Find the way to go convince him ...

00:11:04.555 --> 00:11:05.721
or her.

00:11:05.745 --> 00:11:10.360
And Marc, for example, was convinced
to close the gender pay gap by two women

00:11:10.384 --> 00:11:12.310
who worked inside of his organization,

00:11:12.334 --> 00:11:14.782
who told him, "We have a gender pay gap."

00:11:14.806 --> 00:11:17.213
He didn't believe it;
he said, "Bring me the data."

00:11:17.237 --> 00:11:20.936
They did, and he was smart enough to know
he needed to do something about it,

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.233
and was one the first tech leaders
to step up and do so voluntarily.

00:11:24.656 --> 00:11:27.046
So don't ever think
that you don't have power,

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.512
even if you don't sit
in a position of power,

00:11:29.536 --> 00:11:32.351
but find other people to support you
