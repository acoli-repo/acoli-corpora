00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:01.044
He's so committed to equality
that when he took on as CEO

00:03:01.068 --> 00:03:02.846
and he said gender balance matters,

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.696
he created a gender-balanced
executive team

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.418
and gave men and women
equal maternity and paternity leave.

00:03:09.883 --> 00:03:11.707
He's so committed to accountability

00:03:11.731 --> 00:03:15.431
that he turned his US operations
into a B Corporation.

00:03:15.455 --> 00:03:17.512
Now many of you may not know what that is,

00:03:17.536 --> 00:03:19.930
but that's a company
that holds itself responsible

00:03:19.954 --> 00:03:23.383
for not just profit but its impact
on people and the planet,

00:03:23.407 --> 00:03:26.835
and transparently reports
on their performance on all of that.

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.891
It's the largest B Corp in the world.

00:03:28.915 --> 00:03:31.395
So to me, that's holistic,
courageous leadership,
