HT: Well, you can do this for the reason
that it's risky, actually,

00:04:01.517 --> 00:04:03.675
to continue without doing
the right thing now.

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:05.381
You can't attract the right talent,

00:04:05.405 --> 00:04:06.707
you can't attract customers

00:04:06.731 --> 00:04:09.303
and increasingly,
you won't be able to attract capital.

00:04:09.327 --> 00:04:10.913
You might do it for risk reasons,

00:04:10.937 --> 00:04:13.496
you might do it for business

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.536
because this is where the growth is,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.036
which is why many leaders
are doing the right thing.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.842
But at the end of the day,

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:21.208
we need to ask ourselves:

00:04:21.232 --> 00:04:24.012
"Who are we holding
ourselves accountable for?"

00:04:24.036 --> 00:04:25.871
And if that isn't the next generation,

00:04:25.895 --> 00:04:27.323
I don't know who.

00:04:27.347 --> 00:04:29.299
So I want to just make very clear,

00:04:29.323 --> 00:04:31.354
because we tend to think about leadership
