WEBVTT

00:01:55.591 --> 00:02:00.314
we embrace sustainability, equality
and accountability as our principles.

00:02:00.338 --> 00:02:05.703
BF: Do you think this whole question
of purpose is really window dressing --

00:02:05.727 --> 00:02:08.248
they're saying what they think
people want to hear,

00:02:08.272 --> 00:02:10.958
but they're actually not making
the fundamental changes

00:02:10.982 --> 00:02:12.133
that are necessary?

00:02:12.157 --> 00:02:13.955
HT: A lot of people feel that way,

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.403
and I think there's a growing
momentum behind that.

00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:19.384
So I think the world is calling
for responsible leadership now,

00:02:19.408 --> 00:02:22.449
and any leader who wants
to be around for the 21st century

00:02:22.473 --> 00:02:25.479
really needs to start thinking
courageously and holistically

00:02:25.503 --> 00:02:27.552
how they're going
to be part of the solution

00:02:27.576 --> 00:02:29.033
and not window-dress anymore.

00:02:29.057 --> 00:02:30.542
You have to do it for real now.
