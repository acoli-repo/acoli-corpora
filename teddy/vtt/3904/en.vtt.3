00:01:29.653 --> 00:01:32.304
you can't have your license
to operate anymore

00:01:32.328 --> 00:01:35.295
without a purpose
that contributes to society,

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.667
but what, to me, has been missing
from that dialogue is a set of principles.

00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:42.150
We cannot just define why we exist,

00:01:42.174 --> 00:01:45.142
we have to define
how we're going to do business

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.500
and how we're going to lead.

00:01:46.524 --> 00:01:50.419
And to us, that has to be
to solve these imminent crises:

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:51.673
the climate crisis,

00:01:51.697 --> 00:01:52.978
the crisis of inequality

00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:54.374
and the crisis of trust.

00:01:54.398 --> 00:01:55.567
So at The B Team,

00:01:55.591 --> 00:02:00.314
we embrace sustainability, equality
and accountability as our principles.
