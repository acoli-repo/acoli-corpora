00:05:29.775 --> 00:05:32.156
it can't be defined
to those in positions of power

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.836
though they have disproportionately
greater responsibility.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.673
But all of us need to think about,

00:05:37.697 --> 00:05:38.848
"What am I doing?"

00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:40.039
"How am I contributing?"

00:05:40.063 --> 00:05:42.075
And we need to release that leader inside

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:44.371
and actually start making
the positive impact

00:05:44.395 --> 00:05:46.182
this world is calling for right now.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.108
BF: But we have such
hierarchical leadership.

00:05:49.132 --> 00:05:51.164
I mean, I understand what you're saying --

00:05:51.188 --> 00:05:53.195
it's nice to release the leader inside --

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:55.171
but in these corporations,

00:05:55.195 --> 00:05:57.800
the truth is, it's extremely hierarchical.

00:05:57.824 --> 00:05:59.675
What can companies do

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:04.431
to create less vertical
and more horizontal relationships?
