00:08:56.928 --> 00:09:02.866
So if we just all find a way to embrace
a moral compass of our own

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:07.481
to figure out why we exist
and how we're going to lead,

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:11.439
and if we embrace courage
and humility in equal amounts,

00:09:11.463 --> 00:09:16.111
each one of us can be part
of this 10-year period

00:09:16.135 --> 00:09:19.410
where we can dramatically transform
the world we live in,

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:20.915
and make it just,

00:09:20.939 --> 00:09:24.323
and make it about humanity
and not just the financial markets.

00:09:24.347 --> 00:09:27.924
BF: Well, we have a lot of people here
who I bet have questions for you,

00:09:27.948 --> 00:09:29.854
and we have a few minutes for questions,

00:09:29.878 --> 00:09:34.157
so is there anybody that would like
to ask Halla a question?
