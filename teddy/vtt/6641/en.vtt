00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:10.371
In 1864, French zoologist August Duméril

00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:13.371
was baffled while investigating 
the axolotl.

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:18.538
Unlike many other amphibians,
which transform into terrestrial adults,

00:00:18.538 --> 00:00:23.621
axolotls retain their juvenile
characteristics and never leave the water.

00:00:23.913 --> 00:00:26.454
In an attempt to induce metamorphosis,

00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:29.163
Duméril spent months removing their gills.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.371
But in most instances, the axolotls
simply... grew them back.
