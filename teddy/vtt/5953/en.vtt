In 1984, two field workers discovered 
a body in a bog outside Cheshire, England.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.663
Officials named the body the Lindow Man

00:00:15.663 --> 00:00:18.663
and determined that heâ€™d suffered 
serious injuries,

00:00:18.663 --> 00:00:22.038
including blunt trauma and strangulation.

00:00:22.038 --> 00:00:24.996
But the most shocking thing 
about this gruesome story

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:31.413
was that they were able to determine these
details from a body over 2,000 years old.
