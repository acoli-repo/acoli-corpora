00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
How was I ever going to live

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.728
the life full of adventure and stories,

00:03:02.728 --> 00:03:05.000
as I always wanted?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.844
And how was I going to snowboard again?

00:03:09.844 --> 00:03:13.000
That day, I went home, I crawled into bed

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and this is what my life looked like

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.440
for the next few months:

00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:21.640
me passed out, escaping from reality,

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.013
with my legs resting by my side.

00:03:26.013 --> 00:03:34.290
I was absolutely physically
and emotionally broken.
