00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.637
My leg maker and I
put random parts together

00:06:31.637 --> 00:06:34.902
and we made a pair of feet
that I could snowboard in.

00:06:34.902 --> 00:06:37.000
As you can see,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
rusted bolts, rubber,
wood and neon pink duct tape.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And yes, I can change my toenail polish.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It was these legs

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.965
and the best 21st birthday gift
I could ever receive —

00:06:52.965 --> 00:06:55.452
a new kidney from my dad —

00:06:55.452 --> 00:06:58.000
that allowed me to follow my dreams again.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I started snowboarding,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.916
then I went back to work,
then I went back to school.
