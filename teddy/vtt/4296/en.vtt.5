00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000

00:02:40.716 --> 00:02:44.000
I strapped on these chunky legs

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.997
and I stood up.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.280

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.010

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
How was I ever going to live

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.728
the life full of adventure and stories,
