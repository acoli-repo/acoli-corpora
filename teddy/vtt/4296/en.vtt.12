00:05:59.308 --> 00:06:03.000
but I knew that if I could find the right pair of feet

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
that I would be able to do this again.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And this is when I learned
that our borders

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.028
and our obstacles
can only do two things:

00:06:12.028 --> 00:06:15.000
one, stop us in our tracks

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.190
or two, force us to get creative.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.600
I did a year of research,
still couldn't figure out

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.000
what kind of legs to use,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.287
couldn't find any resources
that could help me.

00:06:25.287 --> 00:06:28.580
So I decided to make a pair myself.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.637
My leg maker and I
put random parts together
