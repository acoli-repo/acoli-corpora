00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And I didn't just see myself

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
carving down a mountain of powder,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I could actually feel it.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I could feel the wind against my face

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and the beat of my racing heart

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.010
as if it were happening
in that very moment.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:23.400
And that is when a new chapter
in my life began.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.830
Four months later
I was back up on a snowboard,

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.420
although things didn't go
quite as expected:

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.000
My knees and my ankles wouldn't bend
