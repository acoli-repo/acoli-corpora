00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.000
as I lay in a coma

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that the doctors diagnosed me

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
with bacterial meningitis,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.560
a vaccine-preventable blood infection.

00:01:39.563 --> 00:01:41.978
Over the course of two and a half months

00:01:41.978 --> 00:01:45.670
I lost my spleen, my kidneys,

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.000
the hearing in my left ear

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and both of my legs below the knee.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.824
When my parents
wheeled me out of the hospital

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:58.682
I felt like I had been
pieced back together

00:01:58.682 --> 00:02:02.008
like a patchwork doll.
