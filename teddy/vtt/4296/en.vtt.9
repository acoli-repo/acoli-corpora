00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.665
It was this moment that I asked myself

00:04:31.665 --> 00:04:34.590
that life-defining question:

00:04:34.592 --> 00:04:36.932
If my life were a book

00:04:36.932 --> 00:04:40.150
and I were the author,

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.960
how would I want the story to go?

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.450
And I began to daydream.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.240
I daydreamed like I did as a little girl

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.000
and I imagined myself

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
walking gracefully,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.441
helping other people through my journey

00:04:56.441 --> 00:04:59.000
and snowboarding again.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And I didn't just see myself
