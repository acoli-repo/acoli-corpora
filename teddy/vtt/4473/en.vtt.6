00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:00.482
between the strings.

00:03:00.784 --> 00:03:02.450
Things you just find lying around,

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:05.505
like screws, tape and rubber erasers.

00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:08.077
So now, you've transformed the piano

00:03:08.101 --> 00:03:10.934
from a tonal instrument
with high and low pitches

00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.497
into a collection of unique sounds.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.561
The music you're hearing 
is Cage's "Sonata V,"

00:03:16.585 --> 00:03:18.997
from "Sonatas and Interludes
for Prepared Piano."

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.161
Probably his most famous work
outside of "4'33''."

00:03:22.703 --> 00:03:25.029
This version was performed
by Boris Berman.

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:28.752
John Cage wrote incredibly
detailed instructions

00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:31.593
about where to place
each object in the piano.
