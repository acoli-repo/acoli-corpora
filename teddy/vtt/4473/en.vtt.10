John Cage visited an anechoic chamber
at Harvard University.

00:05:04.378 --> 00:05:07.078
Anechoic chambers are rooms
that are acoustically treated

00:05:07.102 --> 00:05:09.553
to minimize sound to almost zero.

00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:11.712
There are no sounds in these rooms,

00:05:11.736 --> 00:05:14.587
so John Cage didn't expect
to hear anything at all.

00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:18.147
But he actually heard
his own blood circulating.

00:05:18.171 --> 00:05:19.851

I've personally experienced
an anechoic chamber,

00:05:22.157 --> 00:05:24.117
and it's a really wild experience

00:05:24.141 --> 00:05:26.410
that can completely change
your perceptions

00:05:26.434 --> 00:05:28.574
about sound and silence.

00:05:28.926 --> 00:05:31.974
It really felt like my brain
just turning up an amplifier,
