What John Cage really wanted us to hear

00:06:36.872 --> 00:06:40.124
(Birds chirping)

00:06:40.785 --> 00:06:45.166
(Overlapping voices)

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.037
(Church bell ringing)

00:06:49.061 --> 00:06:53.227

00:06:56.363 --> 00:07:00.264
that helps you focus on accepting things
just the way they are.
