00:03:59.212 --> 00:04:01.418
But to hear the answer to the question,

00:04:01.442 --> 00:04:03.243
first, you have to listen.

00:04:03.561 --> 00:04:05.014
And in the 1940s,

00:04:05.038 --> 00:04:08.037
listening to the universe
was getting harder to do.

00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:10.283
(Elevator music)

00:04:10.307 --> 00:04:12.641
The Muzak company was founded in the '30s.

00:04:12.665 --> 00:04:13.855
It really took off,

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.363
and soon, there was constant
background music nearly everywhere.

00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:19.932
It was almost impossible to escape.

00:04:20.584 --> 00:04:23.707
John Cage realized
that people were losing the option

00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:26.091
to shut out the background
music of the world.

00:04:26.457 --> 00:04:30.337
He worried that Muzak would prevent people
from hearing silence altogether.
