Because what I've come to understand

00:00:30.824 --> 00:00:34.666
is that there is no such thing as silence.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.236
And the person who opened
my mind to this idea

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.335
is one of the most influential
composers in history.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.915
John Cage has made an impact
on artists in many genres,

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:50.740
from avant-garde musicians,
to modern dance, to pop music.

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.426
Right now, we're listening
to his 1948 piece

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.831
called "In a Landscape."

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:58.387
This version was recorded in 1994
by Stephen Drury.
