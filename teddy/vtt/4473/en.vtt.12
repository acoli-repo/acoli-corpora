00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:00.847
met his interest in silence.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.627
He realized that creating an environment
with no distractions

00:06:04.651 --> 00:06:06.704
wasn't about creating silence.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.753
It wasn't even about controlling noise.

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:13.165
It was about the sounds
that were already there,

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:15.673
but you suddenly hear for the first time

00:06:15.697 --> 00:06:18.030
when you're really ready to listen.

00:06:19.204 --> 00:06:22.355
That's what's so often
misunderstood about "4'33''."

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:24.227
People assume it's a joke,

00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:26.895
but that couldn't be further
from the truth.

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.212
It sounds different
everywhere you play it.

00:06:29.236 --> 00:06:30.887
And that's the point.
