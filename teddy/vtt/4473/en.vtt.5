begging that he not turn
his career into a joke.

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:33.601
John Cage had, well, if you could call it,

00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:35.293
composed a piece of music

00:02:35.317 --> 00:02:38.761
that really challenged
some very established ideas

00:02:38.785 --> 00:02:40.313
about music composition.

00:02:40.337 --> 00:02:43.105
It's something that musicians
still debate today.

00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:46.786
To understand just what
John Cage was thinking,

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.588
let's back up to the 1940s.

00:02:48.612 --> 00:02:49.769
Back then,

00:02:49.793 --> 00:02:53.841
John Cage was making a name for himself
composing for the prepared piano.

00:02:53.865 --> 00:02:55.077
(Piano music)

00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:56.315
To make music like this,

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.125
John Cage would put objects
inside the piano,

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:00.482
between the strings.
