00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.903
So, David Tudor walked out on stage,

00:02:01.927 --> 00:02:03.491
sat down at the piano,

00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:05.443
then closed the piano lid.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.274
He then sat in silence,

00:02:07.298 --> 00:02:09.814
only moving to open
and close the piano lid

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:12.433
between each of the three movements.

00:02:12.457 --> 00:02:13.790
After the time was up,

00:02:13.814 --> 00:02:14.981
he got up

00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:16.671
and walked off the stage.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:18.981
(Piano music)

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:21.598
The audience had no idea what to think.

00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:26.101
It made people wonder if Cage
is even taking his career seriously.

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:27.855
A close friend even wrote to him,

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.260
begging that he not turn
his career into a joke.
