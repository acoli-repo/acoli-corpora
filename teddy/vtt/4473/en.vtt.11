00:05:28.926 --> 00:05:31.974
It really felt like my brain
just turning up an amplifier,

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.149
grasping for anything to hear.

00:05:34.575 --> 00:05:35.853
Just like John Cage,

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:39.821
I could very clearly hear my blood
pushing through my body.

00:05:39.845 --> 00:05:42.191
John Cage realized, in that moment,

00:05:42.215 --> 00:05:46.350
that no matter where we are,
even our bodies are making sound.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.544
There's basically no such thing
as true silence.

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:53.044
As long as you are in your body,

00:05:53.068 --> 00:05:55.059
you're always hearing something.

00:05:55.538 --> 00:05:58.561
This is where John Cage's interest
in chance and randomness

00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:00.847
met his interest in silence.
