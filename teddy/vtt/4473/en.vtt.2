(Piano music)

00:01:04.792 --> 00:01:08.643
This piece is actually not very typical
of John Cage's writing.

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:12.182
He's more known for his innovations
and avant-garde techniques.

00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:14.206
But despite his reputation,

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.752
no one was prepared
for what he did in 1952,

00:01:18.776 --> 00:01:22.309
when he created the most daring
piece of his career.

00:01:22.657 --> 00:01:26.147
It was called "4'33'',"

00:01:26.171 --> 00:01:31.299
and it was a piece that some critics
even refused to call "music,"
