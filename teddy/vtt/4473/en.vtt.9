00:04:26.457 --> 00:04:30.337
He worried that Muzak would prevent people
from hearing silence altogether.

00:04:31.454 --> 00:04:32.755
In 1948,

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:35.438
four years before he wrote "4'33'',"

00:04:35.462 --> 00:04:37.492
John Cage mentioned
that he wanted to write

00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:40.025
a four-and-a-half-minute-long
piece of silence

00:04:40.049 --> 00:04:42.461
and sell it to the Muzak company.

00:04:42.485 --> 00:04:44.802
It started as something

and quickly evolved.

00:04:50.176 --> 00:04:53.457
John Cage was starting to think
deeply about silence.

00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:57.314
And when he visited a truly quiet place,

00:04:57.338 --> 00:04:59.338
he made a startling discovery.
