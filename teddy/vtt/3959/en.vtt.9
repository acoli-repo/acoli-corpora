00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.696
more than 350 Ice Age rock art sites
have been found across the continent,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.096
decorated with animals, abstract shapes
and even the occasional human

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.736
like these engraved figures
from Grotta dell'Addaura in Sicily.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.816
They provide us with a rare glimpse

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.920
into the creative world and imagination
of these early artists.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.216
Since their discovery,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.640
it's been the animals that have received
the majority of the study

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.760
like this black horse
from Cullalvera in Spain,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.680
or this unusual purple bison
from La Pasiega.
