Over the course of two years,

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.056
my faithful husband Dylan and I
each spent over 300 hours underground,

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.056
hiking, crawling and wriggling
around 52 sites

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.016
in France, Spain, Portugal and Sicily.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.896
And it was totally worth it.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.656
We found new, undocumented geometric signs
at 75 percent of the sites we visited.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.496
This is the level of accuracy
I knew I was going to need

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.696
if I wanted to start answering
those larger questions.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.296
So let's get to those answers.
