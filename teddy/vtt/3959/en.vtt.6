of those that came before us for so long

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.840

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.136
It's one of the things
I find most fascinating

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.736
about studying our deep history.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.856
Those people didn't have the shoulders
of any giants to stand on.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.336
They were the original shoulders.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.256
And while a surprising number
of important inventions

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.176
come out of that distant time,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.880
what I want to talk to you about today
is the invention of graphic communication.
