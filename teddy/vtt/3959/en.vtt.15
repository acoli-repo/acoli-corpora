00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.136
like we see here
with these divided rectangles

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.376
that are only found in northern Spain,

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.456
and which some researchers have speculated

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.800
could be some sort
of family or clan signs.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.256
On a side note,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.696
there is surprising degree
of similarity in the earliest rock art

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.296
found all the way from France and Spain
to Indonesia and Australia.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.616
With many of the same signs
appearing in such far-flung places,

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.616
especially in that 30,000
to 40,000-year range,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.496
it's starting to seem increasingly likely

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.376
that this invention actually traces back
to a common point of origin in Africa.
