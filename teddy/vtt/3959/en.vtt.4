00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.056
this is the kind of question that
I'm trying to answer with my research.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.760
I study some of the oldest
art in the world.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.856
It was created by these
early artists in Europe,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.960
between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.696
And the thing is

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.216
that I'm not just studying it
because it's beautiful,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.717
though some of it certainly is.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.496
But what I'm interested in
is the development of the modern mind,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.456
of the evolution of creativity,
of imagination, of abstract thought,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.600
about what it means to be human.
