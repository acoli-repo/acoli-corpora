The irony in all of this, of course,

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.616
is that having just carefully classified
all of the signs into a single category,

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.136
I have a feeling that my next step
will involve breaking it back apart

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.416
as different types of imagery
are identified and separated off.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.656
Now don't get me wrong,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.296
the later creation
of fully developed writing

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.936
was an impressive feat in its own right.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.416
But it's important to remember

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.736
that those early writing systems
didn't come out of a vacuum.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.736
And that even 5,000 years ago,

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.096
people were already building
on something much older,

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.856
with its origins stretching back
tens of thousands of years --
