for a message to be
transmitted and preserved

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.776
beyond a single moment in place and time.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.576
Europe is one of the first places

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.296
that we start to see graphic marks
regularly appearing

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.560
in caves, rock shelters
and even a few surviving open-air sites.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.776
But this is not the Europe we know today.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.776
This was a world dominated
by towering ice sheets,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.776
three to four kilometers high,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.056
with sweeping grass plains
and frozen tundra.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.120
This was the Ice Age.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.376
Over the last century,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.696
more than 350 Ice Age rock art sites
have been found across the continent,
