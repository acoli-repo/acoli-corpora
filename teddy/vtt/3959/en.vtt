There's something about caves --

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.840
a shadowy opening in a limestone
cliff that draws you in.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.456
As you pass through the portal
between light and dark,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.015
you enter a subterranean world --

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.720
a place of perpetual gloom,
of earthy smells, of hushed silence.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.136
Long ago in Europe,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.616
ancient people also entered
these underground worlds.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.056
As witness to their passage,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.735
they left behind mysterious
engravings and paintings,
