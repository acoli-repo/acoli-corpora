00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.856
There are three
main types of communication,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.256
spoken, gestural --
so things like sign language --

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.576
and graphic communication.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.256
Spoken and gestural are
by their very nature ephemeral.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.216
It requires close contact
for a message to be sent and received.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.176
And after the moment
of transmission, it's gone forever.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.176
Graphic communication, on the other hand,
decouples that relationship.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.176
And with its invention,
it became possible for the first time

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.056
for a message to be
transmitted and preserved
