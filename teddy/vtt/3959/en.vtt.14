00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.816
Some signs start out strong,
before losing popularity and vanishing,

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.176
while other signs are later inventions.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.816
But 65 percent of those signs stayed
in use during that entire time period --

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.136
things like lines, rectangles
triangles, ovals and circles

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.303
like we see here
from the end of the Ice Age,

00:07:15.327 --> 00:07:19.256
at a 10,000-year-old site
high in the Pyrenees Mountains.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.496
And while certain signs
span thousands of kilometers,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.496
other signs had much more
restricted distribution patterns,

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.936
with some being limited
to a single territory,

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.136
like we see here
with these divided rectangles
