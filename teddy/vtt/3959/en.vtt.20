00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.576
it seems highly unlikely that
the geometric signs from Ice Age Europe

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.296
were truly abstract written characters.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.536
Instead, what's much more likely

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.536
is that these early artists
were also making counting marks,

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.576
maybe like this row of lines
from Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.216
as well as creating
stylized representations

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.736
of things from the world around them.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.376
Could some of the signs
be weaponry or housing?

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.536
Or what about celestial objects
like star constellations?

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.176
Or maybe even rivers, mountains,
trees -- landscape features,
