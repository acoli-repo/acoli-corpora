00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.856
with its origins stretching back
tens of thousands of years --

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.976
to the geometric signs
of Ice Age Europe and far beyond,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.296
to that point, deep
in our collective history,

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.376
when someone first came up with the idea
of making a graphic mark,

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.336
and forever changed the nature
of how we communicate.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.576
Thank you.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.040
(Applause)
