or this unusual purple bison
from La Pasiega.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.256
But for me, it was the abstract shapes,
what we call geometric signs,

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.880
that drew me to study the art.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.536
The funny this is that at most sites

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.056
the geometric signs far outnumber
the animal and human images.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.256
But when I started on this back in 2007,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.256
there wasn't even a definitive list
of how many shapes there were,

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.616
nor was there a strong sense

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.520
of whether the same ones
appeared across space or time.
