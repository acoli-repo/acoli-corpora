00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.256
that my husband
and project photographer, Dylan,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.416
could no longer achieve focus
on the ceiling with his DSLR camera.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.096
So while he filmed me,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.416
I kept following the trail of red paint
with a single light

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.760
and a point-and-shoot camera
that we kept for that type of occasion.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.061
Half a kilometer underground.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.816
Seriously.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.840
What was somebody doing down there
with a torch or a stone lamp?

00:01:52.864 --> 00:01:54.056
(Laughter)

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.976
I mean -- me, it makes sense, right?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.216
But you know,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.056
this is the kind of question that
I'm trying to answer with my research.
