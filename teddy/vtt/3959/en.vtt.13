00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.296
So let's get to those answers.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.936
Barring a handful of outliers,
there are only 32 geometric signs.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.776
Only 32 signs

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.280
across a 30,000-year time span
and the entire continent of Europe.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.296
That is a very small number.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.776
Now, if these were random
doodles or decorations,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.216
we would expect to see
a lot more variation,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.656
but instead what we find
are the same signs

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.120
repeating across both space and time.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.816
Some signs start out strong,
before losing popularity and vanishing,
