Before I could even
get started on my questions,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.336
my first step was to compile a database

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.256
of all known geometric signs
from all of the rock art sites.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.856
The problem was that while they were
well documented at some sites,

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.176
usually the ones
with the very nice animals,

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.856
there was also a large number of them
where it was very vague --

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.136
there wasn't a lot
of description or detail.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.496
Some of them hadn't been visited
in half a century or more.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.936
These were the ones
that I targeted for my field work.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.816
