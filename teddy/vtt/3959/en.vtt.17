00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.320
tells us that the artists
were making intentional choices.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.176
If we're talking about geometric shapes,

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.936
with specific, culturally recognized,
agreed-upon meanings,

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.616
than we could very well be looking

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.176
at one of the oldest systems
of graphic communication in the world.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.096
I'm not talking about writing yet.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.456
There's just not enough
characters at this point

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.336
to have represented all of the words
in the spoken language,

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.176
something which is a requirement
for a full writing system.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.576
Nor do we see the signs
repeating regularly enough

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.256
to suggest that they were
some sort of alphabet.
