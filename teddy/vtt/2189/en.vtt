I'm a protein designer.

00:00:04.917 --> 00:00:07.851
And I'd like to discuss
a new type of medicine.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:11.976
It's made from a molecule
called a constrained peptide.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.976
There are only a few constrained
peptide drugs available today,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.143
but there are a lot that will hit
the market in the coming decade.

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.601
Let's explore what these new
medicines are made of,

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:23.768
how they're different and what's causing
this incoming tidal wave

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:25.375
of new and exciting medicines.

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:30.184
Constrained peptides
are very small proteins.
