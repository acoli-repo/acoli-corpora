00:02:28.917 --> 00:02:31.059
those extra chemical bonds
are unable to form

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:33.059
and the whole molecule falls apart.

00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:36.518
So we needed to figure out
how to gain control over their shape.

00:02:36.542 --> 00:02:38.768
I was part of a collaborative
scientific effort

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:41.976
that spanned a dozen institutions
across three continents

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.393
that came together
and solved this problem.

00:02:45.417 --> 00:02:48.518
We took a radically different approach
from previous efforts.

00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:51.059
Instead of making changes
to the constrained peptides

00:02:51.083 --> 00:02:52.351
that we find in nature,

00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:55.643
we figured out how to build new ones
totally from scratch.

00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:56.934
To help us do this,

00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.006
we developed freely available
open-source peptide-design software
