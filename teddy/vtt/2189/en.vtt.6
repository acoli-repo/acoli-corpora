00:02:56.958 --> 00:03:00.006
we developed freely available
open-source peptide-design software

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.809
that anyone can use to do this, too.

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:03.268
To test our method out,

00:03:03.292 --> 00:03:06.226
we generated a series
of constrained peptides

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.476
that have a wide variety
of different shapes.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.934
Many of these had never been seen
in nature before.

00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.851
Then we went into the laboratory
and produced these peptides.

00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:16.393
Next, we determined
their molecular structures,

00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:17.809
using experiments.

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:19.726
When we compared our designed models

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.476
with the real molecular structures,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.601
we found that our software
can position individual atoms

00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:27.851
with an accuracy that's at the limit
of what's possible to measure.

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:30.059
Three years ago, this couldn't be done.
