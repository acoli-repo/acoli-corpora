Constrained peptide design
is a cutting-edge technology,

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:05.768
and the drug development pipeline
is slow and cautious.

00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:08.476
So we're still three to five years
out from human trials.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.768
But during that time,

00:04:09.792 --> 00:04:11.226
more constrained peptide drugs

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.851
are going to be entering
the drug development pipeline.

00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:18.018
And ultimately, I believe
that designed peptide drugs

00:04:18.042 --> 00:04:20.059
are going to enable us all to break free

00:04:20.083 --> 00:04:22.601
from the constraints of our diseases.

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:23.893
Thank you.
