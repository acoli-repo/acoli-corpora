00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:30.184
Constrained peptides
are very small proteins.

00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:33.685
They've got extra chemical bonds
that constrain the shape of the molecule,

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:35.684
and this makes them incredibly stable

00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:37.375
as well as highly potent.

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:41.518
They're naturally occurring,
our bodies actually produce a few of these

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:44.447
that help us to combat
bacterial, fungal and viral infections.

00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:46.351
And animals like snakes and scorpions

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:48.601
use constrained peptides in their venom.

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:51.809
Drugs that are made of protein
are called biologic drugs.

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:53.726
So this includes constrained peptides,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.184
as well as medicines like insulin

00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:59.809
or antibody drugs like Humira or Enbrel.

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:02.934
And in general, biologics are great,
