00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:04.059
This is what makes constrained peptides
so desirable for drug development.

00:02:04.083 --> 00:02:05.893
They combine some of the best features

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:09.684
of small-molecule
and biologic drugs into one.

00:02:09.708 --> 00:02:12.268
But unfortunately,
it's incredibly difficult

00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:15.184
to reengineer the constrained peptides
that we find in nature

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:16.893
to become new drugs.

00:02:16.917 --> 00:02:18.226
So this is where I come in.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.601
Creating a new drug
is a lot like crafting a key

00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:24.101
to fit a particular lock.

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:25.851
We need to get the shape just right.

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:28.893
But if we change the shape
of a constrained peptide by too much,

00:02:28.917 --> 00:02:31.059
those extra chemical bonds
are unable to form
