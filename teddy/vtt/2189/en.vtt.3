00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:33.184
Molecules interact when they adopt shapes
that fit together perfectly.

00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:34.726
Much like a lock and key.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.768
Well, a larger key has more grooves,

00:01:36.792 --> 00:01:40.143
so it's more likely to fit
into a single lock.

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:42.893
But most biologics also have a flaw.

00:01:42.917 --> 00:01:44.184
They're fragile.

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:46.351
So they're usually
administered by injection,

00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:48.809
because our stomach acid
would destroy the medicine

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:50.101
if we tried to swallow it.

00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:52.018
Constrained peptides are the opposite.

00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:54.184
They're really durable,
like regular drugs.

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:58.750
So it's possible to administer them
using pills, inhalers, ointments.

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:04.059
This is what makes constrained peptides
so desirable for drug development.
