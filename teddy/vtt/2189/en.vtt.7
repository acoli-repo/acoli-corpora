Three years ago, this couldn't be done.

00:03:30.083 --> 00:03:33.101
But today, we have the ability
to create designer peptides

00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:36.518
with shapes that are custom-tailored
for drug development.

00:03:36.542 --> 00:03:38.500
So where is this technology taking us?

00:03:39.292 --> 00:03:40.559
Well, recently,

00:03:40.583 --> 00:03:42.869
my colleagues and I
designed constrained peptides

00:03:42.893 --> 00:03:46.309
that neutralize influenza virus,

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:49.268
protect against botulism poisoning

00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:51.393
and block cancer cells from growing.

00:03:51.417 --> 00:03:52.726
Some of these new drugs

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.726
have been tested in preclinical trials
with laboratory animals.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.976
And so far, they're all safe
and highly effective.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.143
Constrained peptide design
is a cutting-edge technology,
