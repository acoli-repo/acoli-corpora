And in general, biologics are great,

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:07.143
because they avoid several ways
that drugs can cause side effects.

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:08.601
First, protein.

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:11.726
It's a totally natural,
nontoxic material in our bodies.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.518
Our cells produce tens of thousands
of different proteins,

00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:17.226
and basically, all of our food
has protein in it.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.143
And second, sometimes drugs interact
with molecules in your body

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:22.601
that you don't want them to.

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:24.518
Compared to small molecule drugs,

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:27.309
and by this I mean
regular drugs, like aspirin,

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.268
biologics are quite large.

00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:33.184
Molecules interact when they adopt shapes
that fit together perfectly.
