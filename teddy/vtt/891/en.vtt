00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.081
The Olympic motto is "Citius, Altius, Fortius."

00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:06.850
Faster, Higher, Stronger.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.790
And athletes have fulfilled that motto rapidly.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.946
The winner of the 2012 Olympic marathon

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:16.262
ran two hours and eight minutes.

00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:17.882
Had he been racing against the winner

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:20.348
of the 1904 Olympic marathon,

00:00:20.348 --> 00:00:23.681
he would have won by nearly an hour and a half.

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:25.453
Now we all have this feeling

00:00:25.453 --> 00:00:27.043
that we're somehow just getting better

00:00:27.043 --> 00:00:29.383
as a human race, inexorably progressing,

00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:31.524
but it's not like we've evolved into a new species
