00:01:29.577 --> 00:01:31.279
are made up of smaller molecules,

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:33.529
called isothiocyanates,

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:36.279
that easily float up into your sinuses.

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:38.362
This is why chili peppers burn your mouth,

00:01:38.362 --> 00:01:41.447
and wasabi burns your nose.

00:01:41.447 --> 00:01:42.967
The standard measure of a food's spiciness

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:44.716
is its rating on the Scoville scale,

00:01:44.716 --> 00:01:47.954
which measures how much its capsaicin content can be diluted

00:01:47.954 --> 00:01:50.557
before the heat is no longer detectable to humans.

00:01:50.557 --> 00:01:53.184
A sweet bell pepper gets 0 Scoville heat units,

00:01:53.184 --> 00:01:57.863
while Tabasco sauce clocks in between 1,200-2,400 units.

00:01:57.863 --> 00:01:59.400
The race to create the hottest pepper

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.861
is a constant battle,
