00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:30.142
Instead, what's really happening

00:00:30.142 --> 00:00:31.978
is that certain compounds in spicy foods

00:00:31.978 --> 00:00:33.811
activate the type of sensory neurons

00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:36.861
called polymodal nociceptors.

00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:38.570
You have these all over your body,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.467
including your mouth and nose,

00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:41.977
and they're the same receptors

00:00:41.977 --> 00:00:44.323
that are activated by extreme heat.

00:00:44.323 --> 00:00:45.780
So, when you eat a chili pepper,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.448
your mouth feels like it's burning

00:00:47.448 --> 00:00:50.329
because your brain actually thinks it's burning.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.912
The opposite happens when you eat something

00:00:51.912 --> 00:00:53.417
with menthol in it.

00:00:53.417 --> 00:00:54.695
The cool, minty compound

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:56.947
is activating your cold receptors.

00:00:56.947 --> 00:00:58.797
When these heat-sensitive receptors are activated,

00:00:58.797 --> 00:01:00.300
your body thinks it's in contact
