00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.861
is a constant battle,

00:02:00.861 --> 00:02:02.985
but two peppers generally come out on top:

00:02:02.985 --> 00:02:05.071
The Trinidad Moruga Scorpion

00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:06.740
and the Carolina Reaper.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.112
These peppers measure

00:02:08.112 --> 00:02:10.993
between 1.5 and 2 million Scoville heat units,

00:02:10.993 --> 00:02:14.695
which is about half the units found in pepper spray.

00:02:14.695 --> 00:02:16.446
So, why would anyone want to eat something

00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:19.196
that causes such high levels of pain?

00:02:19.196 --> 00:02:21.170
Nobody really knows when or why

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.214
humans started eating hot peppers.

00:02:23.214 --> 00:02:25.299
Archaeologists have found spices like mustard

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.177
along with human artifacts

00:02:27.177 --> 00:02:29.053
dating as far back as 23,000 years ago.

00:02:29.053 --> 00:02:30.804
But they don't know whether the spices were used
