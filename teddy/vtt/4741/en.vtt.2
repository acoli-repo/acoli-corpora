00:00:58.797 --> 00:01:00.300
your body thinks it's in contact

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.633
with a dangerous heat source

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:03.029
and reacts accordingly.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:04.511
This is why you start to sweat,

00:01:04.511 --> 00:01:06.178
and your heart starts beating faster.

00:01:06.178 --> 00:01:07.390
The peppers have elicited

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.766
the same fight-or-flight response

00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:11.184
with which your body reacts to most threats.

00:01:11.184 --> 00:01:12.540
But you may have noticed that

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.397
not all spicy foods are spicy in the same way.

00:01:15.397 --> 00:01:18.528
And the difference lies in the types of compounds involved.

00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:20.234
The capsaicin and piperine,

00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:21.986
found in black pepper and chili peppers,

00:01:21.986 --> 00:01:23.987
are made up of larger, heavier molecules

00:01:23.987 --> 00:01:25.657
called alkylamides,

00:01:25.657 --> 00:01:27.575
and those mostly stay in your mouth.

00:01:27.575 --> 00:01:29.577
Mustard, horseradish, and wasabi

00:01:29.577 --> 00:01:31.279
are made up of smaller molecules,
