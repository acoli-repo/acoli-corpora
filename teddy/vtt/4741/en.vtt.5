00:02:29.053 --> 00:02:30.804
But they don't know whether the spices were used

00:02:30.804 --> 00:02:34.029
for food or medication or just decoration.

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.810
More recently, a 6,000 year old crockpot,

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.862
lined with charred fish and meat,

00:02:37.862 --> 00:02:39.522
also contained mustard.

00:02:39.522 --> 00:02:41.148
One theory says that humans

00:02:41.148 --> 00:02:42.400
starting adding spices to food

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.944
to kill off bacteria.

00:02:43.944 --> 00:02:46.198
And some studies show that spice developed

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:47.612
mostly in warmer climates

00:02:47.612 --> 00:02:50.279
where microbes also happen to be more prevalent.

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.696
But why we continue to subject ourselves

00:02:52.696 --> 00:02:53.947
to spicy food today

00:02:53.947 --> 00:02:55.612
is still a bit of a mystery.

00:02:55.612 --> 00:02:56.619
For some people,

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:57.696
eating spicy food

00:02:57.696 --> 00:02:58.917
is like riding rollercoasters;

00:02:58.917 --> 00:03:00.446
they enjoy the ensuing thrill,
