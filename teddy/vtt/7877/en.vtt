00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.415
For the past five years,

00:00:02.457 --> 00:00:05.334
I've been working
as a psychologist in Russia,

00:00:05.376 --> 00:00:08.254
a country where mental
health is stigmatized

00:00:08.296 --> 00:00:11.257
and people are often afraid
to seek professional help.

00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:15.470
Right now, people in Ukraine
are fighting for their lives.

00:00:16.054 --> 00:00:19.348
What is happening
is devastating and traumatic,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.519
and everyone, including both
Russians and Ukrainians,

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.856
will need mental health support,
but on different levels.

00:00:26.898 --> 00:00:29.734
No matter where in the world
I'll be working from,

00:00:29.776 --> 00:00:31.778
I'm committed to helping people.
