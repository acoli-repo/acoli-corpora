00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Four years ago, on the TED stage,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.398
I announced a company I was working with at the time

00:00:05.398 --> 00:00:07.307
called Odeo.

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:08.984
And because of that announcement,

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:11.046
we got a big article in The New York Times,

00:00:11.046 --> 00:00:14.323
which led to more press, which led to more attention,

00:00:14.323 --> 00:00:17.000
and me deciding to become CEO of that company --

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
whereas I was just an adviser --

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.353
and raising a round of venture capital

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:23.000
and ramping up hiring.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.846
One of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey,

00:00:26.846 --> 00:00:30.784
and a year later, when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo,
