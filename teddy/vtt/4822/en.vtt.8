as a prototype for 20th century
propaganda,

00:04:01.506 --> 00:04:06.786
and the philosopher king as inspiration
for the dictators that used them.

Should a few bad ideas

00:04:07.917 --> 00:04:11.817
tarnish Plato's status as one 
of the greatest philosophers in history?

00:04:11.817 --> 00:04:12.987
No!

00:04:12.987 --> 00:04:17.266
Plato gave the leaders and thinkers who
came after him a place to start.

00:04:17.266 --> 00:04:18.406
Through the centuries,

00:04:18.406 --> 00:04:22.336

through writing and experience,

00:04:22.336 --> 00:04:25.646
and have accepted some
while rejecting others.

00:04:25.646 --> 00:04:29.816
We are continuing to refine,
amend, and edit his ideas

00:04:29.816 --> 00:04:33.056
which have become foundations
of the modern world.
