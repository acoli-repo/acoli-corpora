Few individuals have influenced the world
and many of today's thinkers like Plato.

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.799
One 20th century philosopher 
even went so far

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:22.129
as to describe all of Western philosophy
as a series of footnotes to Plato.

00:00:22.129 --> 00:00:24.390
He created the first Western university

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.330
and was teacher to Ancient Greece's 
greatest minds,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.129
including Aristotle.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:32.731
But even one of the founders of philosophy
wasn't perfect.
