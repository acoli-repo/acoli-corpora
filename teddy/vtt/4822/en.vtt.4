00:01:57.753 --> 00:02:01.364
But reason didn't always pan out
for Plato himself.

00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:04.522
When he sought to situate humankind
amongst the animals,

00:02:04.522 --> 00:02:07.752
he lumped us in with birds.

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:11.603
"Featherless bipeds" 
was his official designation.

00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:14.682
Diogenes the Cynic,
annoyed by this definition,

00:02:14.682 --> 00:02:17.992
stormed into Plato's class
with a plucked chicken,

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:22.303
announcing, "Behold. Plato's man."

00:02:22.303 --> 00:02:24.423
But back to a few good ideas.

00:02:24.423 --> 00:02:27.614
Plato is one of the earliest 
political theorists on record,

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:32.425
and with Aristotle, is seen as one 
of the founders of political science.
