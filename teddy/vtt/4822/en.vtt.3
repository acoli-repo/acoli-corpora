00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.069
the disconnect between the world
as it appears

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:34.211
and the greater truth behind it

00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:37.432
is one of philosophy's
most vexing problems.

00:01:37.432 --> 00:01:40.741
It's been the subject of thousands
of pages by theologians,

00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:41.932
philosophers,

00:01:41.932 --> 00:01:44.212
and screenwriters alike.

00:01:44.212 --> 00:01:48.201
It raises questions like should we trust
our senses to come to the truth

00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:50.401
or our own reason?

00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:52.892
For Plato, the answer is reason.

00:01:52.892 --> 00:01:57.753
It alone provides us with at least
the potential to contemplate the Forms.

00:01:57.753 --> 00:02:01.364
But reason didn't always pan out
for Plato himself.
