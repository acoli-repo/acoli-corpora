But even one of the founders of philosophy
wasn't perfect.

00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:34.249
Along with his great ideas,

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:38.640
Plato had a few that haven't 
exactly stood the test of time.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.359
So here are brief rundowns
of a few of his best and worst ideas.

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.829
Plato argued that beyond
our imperfect world

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.049
was a perfect unchanging world of Forms.

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:57.556
Forms are the ideal versions of the things
and concepts we see around us.

00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:01.761
They serve as a sort of instruction
manual to our own world.
