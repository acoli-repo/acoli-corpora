On October 21st, 1909, 125 residents 
of an affluent Minneapolis neighborhood

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:17.847
approached William Simpson,
who’d just bought a plot in the area,

00:00:17.847 --> 00:00:19.599
and told him to leave.

00:00:19.974 --> 00:00:22.310
The Simpsons would be the second 
Black family

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.272
in the otherwise white neighborhood,  
where they intended to build a home.

00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:29.901
When the Simpsons refused offers 
to buy them out,

00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:33.321
their neighbors tried blocking
their home’s construction.
