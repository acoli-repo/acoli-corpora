00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.016
Find your reason.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.256
For me, it's all three.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.560
Find your reason and step up
to be there for someone who needs you.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.376
So, what can you do as an ally?

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.736
Start by doing no harm.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.816
It's our job as allies to know what
microaggressions are and to not do them.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.216
It's our job as allies
to listen, to learn,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.896
to unlearn and to relearn,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.000
and to make mistakes and to keep learning.
