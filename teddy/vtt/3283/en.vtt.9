Women, people who are nonbinary --

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.496
so people who don't necessarily
identify as man or woman --

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.176
racial and ethnic minorities,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.536
LGBTQIA, people
with disabilities, veterans,

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.736
anybody over age 35.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.920
(Laughter)

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.496
We have a major bias toward youth
in the tech industry.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.736
And many others.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.976
There is always someone
with less privilege than you.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.600
On this stage, in this room.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.360
At your company, on your team,
in your city or town.
