00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.296
all of these can give you more
of fewer opportunities for success.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.656
And that's where allyship comes in.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.296
Allyship is about understanding
that imbalance in opportunity

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.680
and working to correct it.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.936
Allyship is really seeing
the person next to us.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.456
And the person missing,
who should be standing next to us.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.176
And first, just knowing
what they're going through.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.840
And then, helping them succeed
and thrive with us.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.816
When we work together to develop
more diverse and inclusive teams,

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.760
data shows we will be more innovative,
more productive and more profitable.
