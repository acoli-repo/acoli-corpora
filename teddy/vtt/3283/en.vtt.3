00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.976
I was the only woman in that room.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.560
And I could have used an ally.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.416
Little behaviors and pattern like this,
every day, again and again,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.456
they wear you down.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.080
Pretty soon, my energy
was absolutely tapped.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.456
At a real low point, I read an article

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.936
about toxic workplace culture
and microaggressions.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.016
Microaggressions --
everyday slights, insults,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.376
negative verbal
and nonverbal communication,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.096
whether intentional or not,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.440
that impede your ability
to do your work well.
