00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.920
Give me your full attention.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.136
Close your laptops,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.680
put down your cellphones
and pay attention.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.456
If somebody is new or the only
person in the room like them,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.736
or they're just nervous,

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.136
this is going to make a huge difference
in how they show up.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.376
Don't interrupt.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.136
Underrepresented people
are more likely to be interrupted,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.976
so just take a step back and listen.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.016
Echo and attribute.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.776
If I have a great idea,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.400
echo my idea and then attribute it to me,
and we thrive together.
