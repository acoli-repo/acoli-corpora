diversity and inclusion
programs are stronger.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.135
You and I can be allies for each other,

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:36.520
whether we're inside or outside of work.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.799
So, I realized recently

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.816
that I still have lingering shame and fear

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.176
from that moment in my career
when I felt utterly alone,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.880
shut out and unsupported.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.016
There are millions of people out there,
like me, right now, feeling that way.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.296
And it doesn't take much
for us to be there for each other.
