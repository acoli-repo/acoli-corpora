An executive told me recently
that after doing allyship on his team,

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.576
the whole team started to normalize
calling themselves out and each other out

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.800
for interrupting.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.696
"I'm so sorry I'm interrupting
you right now, carry on."

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.880
"Hey, she's got
a great idea, let's listen."

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.056
Number two, advocate
for underrepresented people in small ways.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.176
Intervene; you can change
the power dynamics in the room.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.736
If you see somebody is the only
person in the room like them

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.416
and they are being belittled,
they are being interrupted,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.480
do something, say something.
