00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.280
with unlearning what we know
about success and opportunity.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.336
We've been told our whole lives

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.616
that if we work hard,
that hard work pays off,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.800
we'd get what we deserve,
we'd live our dream.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.256
But that isn't true for everyone.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.256
Some people have to work 10 times as hard

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.976
to get to the same place

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.536
due to many barriers
put in front of them by society.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.776
Your gender, your race, your ethnicity,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.976
your religion, your disability,
your sexual orientation,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.216
your class, your geography,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.296
all of these can give you more
of fewer opportunities for success.
