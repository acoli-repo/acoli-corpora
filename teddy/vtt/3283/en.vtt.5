00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.736
So, in the tech industry,
we want quick solutions.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.976
But there is no magic wand
for correcting diversity and inclusion.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.136
Change happens one person at a time,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.240
one act at a time, one word at a time.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.216
We make a mistake
when we see diversity and inclusion

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.576
as that side project over there
the diversity people are working on,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.440
rather than this work inside all of us
that we need to do together.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.256
And that work begins

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.280
with unlearning what we know
about success and opportunity.
