00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.936
In 2013, I was an executive
at an international engineering firm

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.336
in San Francisco.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.936
It was my dream job.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.256
A culmination of all the skills
that I've acquired over the years:

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.296
storytelling, social impact,
behavior change.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.216
I was the head of marketing and culture

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.216
and I worked with the nation's
largest health care systems,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.336
using technology and culture change

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.056
to radically reduce
their energy and water use

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.256
and to improve their social impact.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.400
I was creating real change in the world.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.440
And it was the worst
professional experience of my life.
