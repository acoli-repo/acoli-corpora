00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.536
I walk up to the front of the room

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.336
to give a presentation on the strategy
that I believe is right for the company.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.936
The one they hired me to create.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.456
And I look around the room
at my fellow executives.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.736
And I watch as they
pick up their cell phones

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.016
and look down at their laptops.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.976
They're not paying attention.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.496
As soon as I start to speak,
the interruptions begin

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.680
and people talk over me
again and again and again.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.016
Some of my ideas are flat out dismissed

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.280
and then brought up
by somebody else and championed.
