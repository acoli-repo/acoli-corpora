00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.936
So, people are allies
for different reasons.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.416
Find your reason.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.096
It could be for the business case,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.776
because data shows
diverse and inclusive teams

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.336
will be more productive,
more profitable and more innovative.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.696
It could be for fairness
and social justice.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.696
Because we have a long history
of oppression and inequity

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.800
that we need to work on together.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.056
Or it could be for your kids,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.656
so your kids grow up
with equal opportunities.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.600
And they grow up creating
equal opportunities for others.
