00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:01.707
It does this by damaging the cilia,

00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:07.067
tiny hairlike structures whose job it is 
to keep the airways clean.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.504
It then fills the alveoli,

00:01:09.504 --> 00:01:13.654
tiny air sacs that enable the exchange 
of oxygen and carbon dioxide

00:01:13.654 --> 00:01:15.258
between the lungs and blood.

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:20.251
A toxic gas called carbon monoxide 
crosses that membrane into the blood,

00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:21.958
binding to hemoglobin

00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.561
and displacing the oxygen

00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:26.771
it would usually have transported
around the body.

00:01:26.771 --> 00:01:30.380
That’s one of the reasons smoking 
can lead to oxygen deprivation
