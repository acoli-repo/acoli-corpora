00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:31.158
smoke brings its more than 5,000 
chemical substances

00:00:31.158 --> 00:00:33.766
into contact with the body’s tissues.

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:37.444
From the start, tar, 
a black, resinous material,

00:00:37.444 --> 00:00:39.825
begins to coat the teeth and gums,

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:43.708
damaging tooth enamel, 
and eventually causing decay.

00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:47.721
Over time, smoke also damages 
nerve-endings in the nose,

00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:50.006
causing loss of smell.

00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:51.815
Inside the airways and lungs,

00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:54.604
smoke increases 
the likelihood of infections,

00:00:54.604 --> 00:00:59.277
as well as chronic diseases
like bronchitis and emphysema.

00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:01.707
It does this by damaging the cilia,
