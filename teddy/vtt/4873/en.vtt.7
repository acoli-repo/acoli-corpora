00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.077
start recovering within weeks,

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:35.340
and are restored after 9 months, 
improving resistance to infection.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.717
By the one-year anniversary of quitting,

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:42.761
heart disease risk plummets to half
as blood vessel function improves.

00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:44.025
Five years in,

00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:46.845
the chance of a clot forming
dramatically declines,

00:03:46.845 --> 00:03:49.751
and the risk of stroke 
continues to reduce.

00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:53.352
After ten years, the chances 
of developing fatal lung cancer

00:03:53.352 --> 00:03:55.398
go down by 50%,

00:03:55.398 --> 00:04:00.169
probably because the body’s ability 
to repair DNA is once again restored.
