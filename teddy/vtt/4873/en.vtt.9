may help wean smokers off cigarettes.

00:04:32.345 --> 00:04:35.458
They work by stimulating 
nicotine receptors in the brain

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:37.850
and thus preventing withdrawal symptoms,

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.758
without the addition 
of other harmful chemicals.

00:04:40.758 --> 00:04:42.470
Counselling and support groups,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.413
cognitive behavioral therapy,

00:04:44.413 --> 00:04:46.606
and moderate intensity exercise

00:04:46.606 --> 00:04:50.061
also help smokers stay cigarette-free.

00:04:50.061 --> 00:04:51.608
That’s good news,

00:04:51.608 --> 00:04:56.256
since quitting puts you and your body 
on the path back to health.
