00:01:57.675 --> 00:02:00.957
These vascular effects lead 
to thickening of blood vessel walls

00:02:00.957 --> 00:02:03.471
and enhance blood platelet stickiness,

00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:06.055
increasing the likelihood 
that clots will form

00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:08.929
and trigger heart attacks and strokes.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.689
Many of the chemicals inside cigarettes 
can trigger dangerous mutations

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.965
in the body’s DNA that make cancers form.

00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:18.955
Additionally, ingredients like arsenic 
and nickel

00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:21.524
may disrupt the process of DNA repair,

00:02:21.524 --> 00:02:25.443
thus compromising the body’s ability 
to fight many cancers.

00:02:25.443 --> 00:02:29.175
In fact, about one of every three 
cancer deaths in the United States

00:02:29.175 --> 00:02:31.218
is caused by smoking.
