00:01:26.771 --> 00:01:30.380
That’s one of the reasons smoking 
can lead to oxygen deprivation

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.954
and shortness of breath.

00:01:32.954 --> 00:01:35.121
Within about 10 seconds,

00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:38.897
the bloodstream carries a stimulant 
called nicotine to the brain,

00:01:38.897 --> 00:01:42.413
triggering the release of dopamine 
and other neurotransmitters

00:01:42.413 --> 00:01:43.689
including endorphins

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.684
that create the pleasurable sensations 
which make smoking highly addictive.

00:01:47.684 --> 00:01:50.043
Nicotine and other chemicals 
from the cigarette

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:53.006
simultaneously cause constriction 
of blood vessels

00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:55.942
and damage their delicate 
endothelial lining,

00:01:55.942 --> 00:01:57.675
restricting blood flow.

00:01:57.675 --> 00:02:00.957
These vascular effects lead 
to thickening of blood vessel walls
