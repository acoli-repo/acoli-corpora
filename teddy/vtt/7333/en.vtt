00:00:01.956 --> 00:00:04.083
Imagine you're planning
a trip up the coast,

00:00:04.792 --> 00:00:06.210
but instead of driving,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.214
you decide to hop into a vehicle
shaped like a giant aluminum can.

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:13.509
Your heart pounds
as you strap yourself in.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.344
The air is stagnant.

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:19.599
Beads of sweat are pooling on your brow
as you prepare to launch.

00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:22.643
The vehicle starts to move.

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:25.271
Before you know it,
you're going 500 miles per hour.

00:00:25.897 --> 00:00:28.900
You hope that the people in control
know what they're doing.

00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:33.654
Turns out that's just your average
airplane experience.
