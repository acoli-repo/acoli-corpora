Sydney. I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney.

I got to the airport, to the hotel, checked in,

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:10.253

00:00:19.648 --> 00:00:22.189

created by international artists

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:27.195
in collaboration with the people of Minto."

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.271
Sydney, as I would learn, is a city of suburbs,
