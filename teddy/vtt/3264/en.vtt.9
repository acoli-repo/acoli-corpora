00:04:29.182 --> 00:04:31.446
I know -- like, really?

00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:33.513
No. Just kidding.

00:04:33.537 --> 00:04:34.719
(Laughter)

00:04:34.743 --> 00:04:37.675
No more disasters. No.
Just the opposite, in fact.

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.239
That was 21 years ago,

00:04:39.263 --> 00:04:41.150
and for 19 of those years,

00:04:41.174 --> 00:04:44.774
I have been married
to that marvelous introvert

00:04:44.798 --> 00:04:47.310
who never in a million years
would have approached me

00:04:47.334 --> 00:04:49.025
under other circumstances.

00:04:49.049 --> 00:04:51.109
We have a wonderful 14-year-old daughter,

00:04:51.133 --> 00:04:52.740
who did all my illustrations.

00:04:52.764 --> 00:04:54.340
(Cheers and applause)

00:04:54.364 --> 00:04:55.526
Yeah.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.888
So, pro tip:

00:04:56.912 --> 00:04:59.696
apparently, nothing makes you sexier
than needing a walker

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.955
on your first date.
