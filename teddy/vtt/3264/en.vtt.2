if you've ever tangled with them,

00:01:00.948 --> 00:01:05.595
you know that a sea urchin spine in you
gives you horrible, painful inflammation.

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.316
But that wasn't even topmost
in my mind at this point.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.491
This did not look real.

00:01:10.515 --> 00:01:12.979
I could not believe that this was my hand.

00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:17.762
Now, in a crisis, I tend to disassociate
into, like, little scientists,

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:20.903
and I start talking very analytically.

00:01:20.927 --> 00:01:23.906
All analysis was gone,
adrenaline brain kicked in,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.769
and I just yanked the spines out.

00:01:26.793 --> 00:01:28.932
I don't remember doing it.

00:01:29.665 --> 00:01:33.522
I just remember thinking, "I can't
get my glove off with these in here."
