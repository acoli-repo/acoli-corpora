00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:30.928
And on the Friday before,

00:03:30.952 --> 00:03:34.020
I broke my pelvis
in a horseback riding accident.

00:03:34.044 --> 00:03:35.743
(Laughter)

00:03:35.767 --> 00:03:36.976
Yeah.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.611
So we kind of postponed that surgery.

00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:45.018
My broken pelvis and I were now
facing six weeks on the couch,

00:03:45.042 --> 00:03:50.146
and I would have gone absolutely insane
if it hadn't been for my friends.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.629
Spontaneous parties broke out
at my house every night for weeks.

00:03:53.653 --> 00:03:55.929
I was fed. I was entertained.

00:03:55.953 --> 00:03:57.278
It was great.

00:03:58.015 --> 00:04:01.936
But that kind of enthusiasm is sort of
hard to sustain over the long term,
