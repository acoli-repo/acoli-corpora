00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.955
on your first date.

00:05:01.393 --> 00:05:04.006
So this isn't a story about piercings

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.815
or sharks or boilings or breakings.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.273
It's a love story.

00:05:08.758 --> 00:05:11.646
It's a love story with
a funny little epilogue.

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:16.875
Now I was weight-bearing again,
I could reschedule that surgery,

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:18.195
get the spine out.

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:19.756
But I didn't need it anymore.

00:05:20.407 --> 00:05:22.107
Turns out, when you break a bone,

00:05:22.131 --> 00:05:26.057
your body scavenges calcium
from all the bones in your body --

00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:29.970
and from the little sea urchin spine
that you happen to have lodged

00:05:29.994 --> 00:05:31.998
in the joint of your finger.
