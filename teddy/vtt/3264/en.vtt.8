00:03:58.015 --> 00:04:01.936
But that kind of enthusiasm is sort of
hard to sustain over the long term,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.256
and eventually it petered down
to just one friend,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.272
who would send me jokes during the day

00:04:07.296 --> 00:04:09.900
and come and keep me company
in the evenings --

00:04:09.924 --> 00:04:14.290
someone I got to know a whole lot better
during this period of convalescence.

00:04:14.314 --> 00:04:16.430
And when I was finally
pronounced well enough

00:04:16.454 --> 00:04:18.144
to do weight-bearing activities,

00:04:18.168 --> 00:04:21.207
we loaded a telescope in the car
and drove up into the mountains

00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:23.347
to look at the Hale–Bopp comet.

00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:25.465
Yes, we are geeks.

00:04:25.489 --> 00:04:27.189
And got caught in a landslide.

00:04:27.213 --> 00:04:29.158
(Laughter)

00:04:29.182 --> 00:04:31.446
I know -- like, really?
