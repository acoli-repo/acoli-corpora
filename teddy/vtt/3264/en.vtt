My story starts in the northern
Galapagos Islands,

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.414
under 50 feet of water
and a big school of sharks.

00:00:08.148 --> 00:00:11.119
I'd been scuba diving with a group
of friends for about a week,

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:12.472
and it had been glorious:

00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:15.124
manta rays, whale sharks,

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:17.898
penguins and, of course,
hammerhead sharks.

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:22.077
Today's dive was particularly tricky.

00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:23.332
The surge was terrible.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.546
You had to have your camera rig tight in

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.722
and your arm out,

00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:29.104
because the surge kept
throwing you into the rocks

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:31.748
while you're scanning up
for that beautiful photograph.
