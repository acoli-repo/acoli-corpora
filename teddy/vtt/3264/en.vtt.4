00:02:00.793 --> 00:02:02.392
So what are you gonna do?"

00:02:02.965 --> 00:02:07.531
Well, I cranked my cummerbund
down really hard over my hand,

00:02:07.555 --> 00:02:10.308
and I simply swam away.

00:02:11.078 --> 00:02:16.392
"Let's let that big old cloud of blood
dissipate a bit before we have to surface

00:02:16.416 --> 00:02:18.224
through all of these sharks."

00:02:18.248 --> 00:02:19.715
So when I did surface,

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.640
my warm-blooded-mammal brain

00:02:21.664 --> 00:02:23.716
was in an absolute gibbering panic:

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.868
"They don't feed when they're schooling.
They don't feed when they're schooling.

00:02:27.892 --> 00:02:29.219
All the way up."

00:02:29.243 --> 00:02:30.427
And they didn't.
