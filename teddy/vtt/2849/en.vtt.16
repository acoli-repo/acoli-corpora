British law put the onus,
put the burden of proof on me

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:07.901
to prove the truth of what I said,

00:08:07.925 --> 00:08:10.688
in contrast to as it would have
been in the United States

00:08:10.712 --> 00:08:12.216
and in many other countries:

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.246
on him to prove the falsehood.

00:08:15.921 --> 00:08:17.382
What did that mean?

00:08:17.406 --> 00:08:20.782
That meant if I didn't fight,

00:08:20.806 --> 00:08:23.232
he would win by default.

00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:25.546
And if he won by default,

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.211
he could then legitimately say,

00:08:28.235 --> 00:08:33.571
"My David Irving version of the Holocaust
is a legitimate version.
