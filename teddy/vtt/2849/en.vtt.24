00:11:54.978 --> 00:12:00.559
has also allowed the difference
between facts -- established facts --

00:12:00.583 --> 00:12:02.340
and lies

00:12:02.364 --> 00:12:03.762
to be flattened.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.500
Third of all:

00:12:06.524 --> 00:12:07.995
extremism.

00:12:08.987 --> 00:12:12.564
You may not see Ku Klux Klan robes,

00:12:12.588 --> 00:12:14.659
you may not see burning crosses,

00:12:14.683 --> 00:12:19.002
you may not even hear outright
white supremacist language.

00:12:19.026 --> 00:12:23.932
It may go by names: "alt-right,"
"National Front" -- pick your names.

00:12:23.956 --> 00:12:29.791
But underneath, it's that same extremism
that I found in Holocaust denial

00:12:29.815 --> 00:12:33.209
parading as rational discourse.
