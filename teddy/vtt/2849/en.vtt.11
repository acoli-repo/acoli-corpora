dress them up as opinions --

00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:32.211
maybe edgy opinions,

00:05:32.235 --> 00:05:34.944
maybe sort of out-of-the-box opinions --

00:05:34.968 --> 00:05:36.352
but then if they're opinions,

00:05:36.376 --> 00:05:38.508
they should be part of the conversation.

00:05:38.532 --> 00:05:41.925
And then they encroach on the facts.

00:05:43.305 --> 00:05:44.868
I published my work --

00:05:44.892 --> 00:05:46.066
the book was published,

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.492
"Denying the Holocaust: The Growing
Assault on Truth and Memory,"

00:05:49.516 --> 00:05:51.472
it came out in many different countries,

00:05:51.496 --> 00:05:53.656
including here in Penguin UK,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.110
and I was done with those folks
and ready to move on.

00:05:58.163 --> 00:06:01.871
Then came the letter from Penguin UK.
