00:10:26.196 --> 00:10:31.576
What we did is follow his footnotes
back to his sources.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.973
And what did we find?

00:10:33.997 --> 00:10:35.476
Not in most cases,

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.468
and not in the preponderance of cases,

00:10:37.492 --> 00:10:41.803
but in every single instance where
he made some reference to the Holocaust,

00:10:41.827 --> 00:10:46.069
that his supposed evidence was distorted,

00:10:46.093 --> 00:10:47.513
half-truth,

00:10:47.537 --> 00:10:48.871
date-changed,

00:10:48.895 --> 00:10:51.082
sequence-changed,

00:10:51.106 --> 00:10:53.230
someone put at a meeting who wasn't there.

00:10:53.254 --> 00:10:56.015
In other words,
he didn't have the evidence.

00:10:56.039 --> 00:10:58.148
His evidence didn't prove it.

00:10:58.172 --> 00:11:00.831
We didn't prove what happened.
