00:02:27.487 --> 00:02:31.320
Intrigued and flattered
that they came to me with an idea

00:02:31.344 --> 00:02:32.921
and thought me worthy of it,

00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:35.041
I asked, "What is it?"

00:02:35.665 --> 00:02:38.654
And they said, "Holocaust denial."

00:02:39.353 --> 00:02:41.848
And for the second time, I laughed.

00:02:42.336 --> 00:02:44.260
Holocaust denial?

00:02:44.284 --> 00:02:46.270
The Flat Earth folks?

00:02:46.294 --> 00:02:48.431
The Elvis-is-alive people?

00:02:48.455 --> 00:02:50.643
I should study them?

00:02:51.326 --> 00:02:52.643
And these two guys said,

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:54.600
"Yeah, we're intrigued.

00:02:55.012 --> 00:02:56.584
What are they about?

00:02:56.608 --> 00:02:58.358
What's their objective?

00:02:58.382 --> 00:03:02.036
How do they manage to get people
to believe what they say?"
