00:09:59.211 --> 00:10:03.350
We showed a pattern,
in over 25 different major instances.

00:10:03.374 --> 00:10:06.484
Not small things -- many of us
in this audience write books,

00:10:06.508 --> 00:10:07.693
are writing books;

00:10:07.717 --> 00:10:11.183
we always make mistakes, that's why
we're glad to have second editions:

00:10:11.207 --> 00:10:12.393
correct the mistakes.

00:10:12.417 --> 00:10:13.567
(Laughter)

00:10:14.634 --> 00:10:17.770
But these always moved
in the same direction:

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.829
blame the Jews,

00:10:20.853 --> 00:10:23.028
exonerate the Nazis.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.284
But how did we win?

00:10:26.196 --> 00:10:31.576
What we did is follow his footnotes
back to his sources.
