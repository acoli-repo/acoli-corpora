Now, maybe they add a caveat.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.624
They say, "I didn't have a choice;
I was forced to do it."

00:01:38.104 --> 00:01:40.773
But nonetheless, they say, "I did it."

00:01:41.938 --> 00:01:43.489
Think about it.

00:01:43.513 --> 00:01:49.452
In not one war crimes trial
since the end of World War II

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:56.112
has a perpetrator of any nationality
ever said, "It didn't happen."

00:01:57.078 --> 00:02:01.660
Again, they may have said, "I was forced,"
but never that it didn't happen.
