to the outskirts of the town

00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:05.473

00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:07.315
Or the Poles,

00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:12.020
who lived in towns and villages
around the death camps,

00:01:12.044 --> 00:01:14.420
who watched day after day

00:01:14.444 --> 00:01:17.186
as the trains went in filled with people

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.733
and came out empty.

00:01:19.787 --> 00:01:23.420
But above all, who would have to be wrong?

00:01:24.005 --> 00:01:25.469
The perpetrators.

00:01:26.112 --> 00:01:29.018
The people who say, "We did it.

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.003
I did it."
