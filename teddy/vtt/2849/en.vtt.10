This is what intrigued me.

00:05:00.374 --> 00:05:07.371
It was anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice,
parading as rational discourse.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.317
The other thing I found --

00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:14.086
many of us have been taught to think
there are facts and there are opinions --

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.566
after studying deniers,

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:16.926
I think differently.

00:05:17.438 --> 00:05:19.086
There are facts,

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.824
there are opinions,

00:05:20.848 --> 00:05:22.460
and there are lies.

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:27.575
And what deniers want to do
is take their lies,

00:05:28.565 --> 00:05:30.197
dress them up as opinions --
