00:13:28.676 --> 00:13:31.283
When someone makes an outrageous claim,

00:13:31.307 --> 00:13:34.811
even though they may hold
one of the highest offices in the land,

00:13:34.835 --> 00:13:36.846
if not the world --

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.380
we must say to them,

00:13:38.404 --> 00:13:40.370
"Where's the proof?

00:13:40.394 --> 00:13:42.531
Where's the evidence?"

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:45.482
We must hold their feet to the fire.

00:13:45.506 --> 00:13:50.112
We must not treat it as if their lies
are the same as the facts.

00:13:51.395 --> 00:13:54.935
And as I said earlier,
truth is not relative.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.815
Many of us have grown up
in the world of the academy

00:13:57.839 --> 00:13:59.580
and enlightened liberal thought,

00:13:59.604 --> 00:14:02.565
where we're taught
everything is open to debate.
