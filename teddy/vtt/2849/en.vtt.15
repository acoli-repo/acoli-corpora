"More people died in Senator Kennedy's car

00:07:30.461 --> 00:07:31.773
at Chappaquiddick

00:07:31.797 --> 00:07:35.111
than died in gas chambers at Auschwitz."

00:07:35.135 --> 00:07:37.972
That's an American reference,
but you can look it up.

00:07:39.406 --> 00:07:42.420
This was not a man who seemed
at all ashamed or reticent

00:07:42.444 --> 00:07:44.513
about being a Holocaust denier.

00:07:45.136 --> 00:07:48.916

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.458
When I explained you can't just
ignore a libel suit,

00:07:54.482 --> 00:07:57.264
they said, "Who's going to
believe him anyway?"

00:07:57.783 --> 00:07:59.863
But here was the problem:

00:07:59.887 --> 00:08:05.195
British law put the onus,
put the burden of proof on me
