00:00:30.257 --> 00:00:32.538
For deniers to be right,

00:00:32.562 --> 00:00:34.458
who would have to be wrong?

00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:37.777
Well, first of all, the victims --

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:42.518
the survivors who have told us
their harrowing stories.

00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:46.035
Who else would have to be wrong?

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.012
The bystanders.

00:00:48.036 --> 00:00:52.014
The people who lived in the myriads
of towns and villages and cities

00:00:52.038 --> 00:00:54.010
on the Eastern front,

00:00:54.034 --> 00:00:56.476
who watched their neighbors
be rounded up --

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.713
men, women, children, young, old --

00:00:59.737 --> 00:01:02.457
and be marched
to the outskirts of the town
