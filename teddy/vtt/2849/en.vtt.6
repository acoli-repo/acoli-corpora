How do they manage to get people
to believe what they say?"

00:03:02.756 --> 00:03:06.284
So thinking, if they thought
it was worthwhile,

00:03:06.308 --> 00:03:09.682
I would take a momentary diversion --

00:03:09.706 --> 00:03:12.644
maybe a year, maybe two,
three, maybe even four --

00:03:12.668 --> 00:03:14.913
in academic terms, that's momentary.

00:03:14.937 --> 00:03:16.079
(Laughter)

00:03:16.103 --> 00:03:18.490
We work very slowly.

00:03:18.514 --> 00:03:20.086
(Laughter)

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.912
And I would look at them.

00:03:21.936 --> 00:03:23.091
So I did.

00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:25.954
I did my research, and I came up
with a number of things,

00:03:25.978 --> 00:03:28.571
two of which I'd like to share
with you today.

00:03:28.595 --> 00:03:29.928
One:

00:03:29.952 --> 00:03:34.909
deniers are wolves in sheep's clothing.
