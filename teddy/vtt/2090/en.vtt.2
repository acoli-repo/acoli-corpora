00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
when they didn't have any.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But we would also like to understand it.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
As a cosmologist, I want to ask, why is the universe like this?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
One big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
it would be moving away from you.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And if you look at a galaxy even farther away,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
it would be moving away faster.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So we say the universe is expanding.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
What that means, of course, is that, in the past,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
things were closer together.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
In the past, the universe was more dense,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and it was also hotter.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
If you squeeze things together, the temperature goes up.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
That kind of makes sense to us.
