all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
by the scientific and external communities.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
We will all believe that our little universe

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
is just a small part of a much larger multiverse.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And even better, we will understand what happened at the Big Bang

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
in terms of a theory

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
that we will be able to compare to observations.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
This is a prediction. I might be wrong.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
But we've been thinking as a human race

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
about what the universe was like,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
why it came to be in the way it did for many, many years.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
It's exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Thank you.
