00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
space is limited to us.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Finally, empty space has a temperature.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
In the 1970s, Stephen Hawking told us

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
that a black hole, even though you think it's black,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
it actually emits radiation

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
when you take into account quantum mechanics.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
The curvature of space-time around the black hole

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and the black hole radiates.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
A precisely similar calculation by Hawking and Gary Gibbons

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
showed that if you have dark energy in empty space,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
then the whole universe radiates.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
The energy of empty space

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
brings to life quantum fluctuations.
