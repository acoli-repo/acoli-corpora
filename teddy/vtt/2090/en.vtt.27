00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
equal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
So here's two questions for you.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Number one: If the universe lasts for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
why are we born

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
in the first 14 billion years of it,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
in the warm, comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Why aren't we in empty space?

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
You might say, "Well there's nothing there to be living,"

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
but that's not right.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
You could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Why aren't you?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
More homework assignment for you.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
So like I said, I don't actually know the answer.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
I'm going to give you my favorite scenario.
