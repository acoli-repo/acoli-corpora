00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
into lower entropy configurations.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And then, of course, in the natural course of things,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
they will expand back.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So it's not that entropy must always increase --

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
you can get fluctuations into lower entropy,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
more organized situations.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Well if that's true,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Boltzmann then goes onto invent

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
two very modern-sounding ideas --

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
the multiverse and the anthropic principle.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
He says, the problem with thermal equilibrium

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
is that we can't live there.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Remember, life itself depends on the arrow of time.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
We would not be able to process information,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
metabolize, walk and talk,
