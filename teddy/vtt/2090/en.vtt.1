00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
in the observable universe.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
100 billion is the only number you need to know.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The age of the universe, between now and the Big Bang,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
is a hundred billion in dog years.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
(Laughter)

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Which tells you something about our place in the universe.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's extremely beautiful.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I've often wondered, what is the evolutionary pressure

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to really enjoy pictures of galaxies

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
when they didn't have any.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But we would also like to understand it.
