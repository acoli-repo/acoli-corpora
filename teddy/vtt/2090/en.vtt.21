00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
where life is possible.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
That's the region where entropy is low.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Maybe our universe is just one of those things

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
that happens from time to time.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Now your homework assignment

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
is to really think about this, to contemplate what it means.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Carl Sagan once famously said

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
that "in order to make an apple pie,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
you must first invent the universe."

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
But he was not right.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
In Boltzmann's scenario, if you want to make an apple pie,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
you just wait for the random motion of atoms

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
to make you an apple pie.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
That will happen much more frequently
