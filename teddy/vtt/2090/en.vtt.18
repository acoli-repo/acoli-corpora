00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
would eventually be obtained.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So Boltzmann says, look, you could start with a universe

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
that was in thermal equilibrium.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
He didn't know about the Big Bang. He didn't know about the expansion of the universe.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton --

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
they were absolute; they just stuck there forever.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So his idea of a natural universe

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere --

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
the everything molecules.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
But if you're Boltzmann, you know that if you wait long enough,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
the random fluctuations of those molecules

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
will occasionally bring them

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
into lower entropy configurations.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And then, of course, in the natural course of things,
