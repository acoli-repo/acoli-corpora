00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
a hundred billion stars each.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
At early times, those hundred billion galaxies

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
were squeezed into a region about this big --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
literally -- at early times.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And you have to imagine doing that squeezing

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
without any imperfections,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
without any little spots

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Because if there had been, they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
into a huge black hole.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Keeping the universe very, very smooth at early times

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
is not easy; it's a delicate arrangement.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It's a clue
