00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
if we look at a part of the world we've never seen before,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
we will find it mixed up, and not like the piece we've just looked at --

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
high entropy.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
If our order were due to a fluctuation,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
We therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation."

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So that's good. The question is then what is the right answer?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
If the universe is not a fluctuation,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
why did the early universe have a low entropy?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And I would love to tell you the answer, but I'm running out of time.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
(Laughter)

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Here is the universe that we tell you about,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
versus the universe that really exists.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I just showed you this picture.
