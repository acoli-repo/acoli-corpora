00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
If you squeeze things together, the temperature goes up.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
That kind of makes sense to us.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The thing that doesn't make sense to us as much

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is that the universe, at early times, near the Big Bang,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
was also very, very smooth.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You might think that that's not a surprise.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The air in this room is very smooth.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You might say, "Well, maybe things just smoothed themselves out."

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
But the conditions near the Big Bang are very, very different

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
than the conditions of the air in this room.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
In particular, things were a lot denser.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The gravitational pull of things

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
was a lot stronger near the Big Bang.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
What you have to think about

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies,
