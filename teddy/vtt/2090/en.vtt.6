00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that entropy is the number of ways

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don't notice,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
so that macroscopically it looks the same.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
If you have the air in this room,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
you don't notice each individual atom.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
A low entropy configuration

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is one in which there's only a few arrangements that look that way.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
A high entropy arrangement

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
is one that there are many arrangements that look that way.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
This is a crucially important insight

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
because it helps us explain

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
the second law of thermodynamics --

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
the law that says that entropy increases in the universe,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
or in some isolated bit of the universe.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The reason why entropy increases
