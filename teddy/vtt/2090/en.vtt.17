00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
for the universe to be high entropy, rather than low entropy.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
But that's a probabilistic statement.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
It will probably increase,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and the probability is enormously huge.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
It's not something you have to worry about --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
It's very, very unlikely.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Except if they locked the doors

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and kept us here literally forever,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
that would happen.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Everything that is allowed,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
would eventually be obtained.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So Boltzmann says, look, you could start with a universe
