00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The fact that you are born, and then you live, and then you die,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
always in that order,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
that's because entropy is increasing.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
it's very natural for it to increase

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
because there's more ways to be high entropy.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
What he didn't explain

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
was why the entropy was ever low in the first place.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
The fact that the entropy of the universe was low

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
was a reflection of the fact

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that the early universe was very, very smooth.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
We'd like to understand that.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
That's our job as cosmologists.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Unfortunately, it's actually not a problem

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that we've been giving enough attention to.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It's not one of the first things people would say,
