00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
to make you an apple pie.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
That will happen much more frequently

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
than the random motions of atoms

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
making you an apple orchard

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and some sugar and an oven,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and then making you an apple pie.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
So this scenario makes predictions.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And the predictions are

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
that the fluctuations that make us are minimal.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Even if you imagine that this room we are in now

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
exists and is real and here we are,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and we have, not only our memories,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
but our impression that outside there's something

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
called Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy,
