00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Because dark energy, unlike matter or radiation,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
does not dilute away as the universe expands.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The amount of energy in each cubic centimeter

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
remains the same,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
even as the universe gets bigger and bigger.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
This has crucial implications

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
for what the universe is going to do in the future.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
For one thing, the universe will expand forever.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Back when I was your age,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
we didn't know what the universe was going to do.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Einstein was fond of this idea.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
But if there's dark energy, and the dark energy does not go away,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever.
