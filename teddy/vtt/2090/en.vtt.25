00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
versus the universe that really exists.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I just showed you this picture.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
The universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
It's cooling off.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
But we now know enough about the future of the universe

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
to say a lot more.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
If the dark energy remains around,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel, they will stop burning.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
They will fall into black holes.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
We will live in a universe

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
with nothing in it but black holes.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
That universe will last 10 to the 100 years --

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
a lot longer than our little universe has lived.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
The future is much longer than the past.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
But even black holes don't last forever.
