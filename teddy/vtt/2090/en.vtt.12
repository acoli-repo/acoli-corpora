00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
we at least have a good theory that can explain it,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
if that theory is right,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and that's the theory of dark energy.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
It's just the idea that empty space itself has energy.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
In every little cubic centimeter of space,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
whether or not there's stuff,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
whether or not there's particles, matter, radiation or whatever,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
there's still energy, even in the space itself.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And this energy, according to Einstein,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
exerts a push on the universe.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
It is a perpetual impulse

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
that pushes galaxies apart from each other.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Because dark energy, unlike matter or radiation,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
does not dilute away as the universe expands.
