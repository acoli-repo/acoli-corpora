00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
14 billion years in the past,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
100 billion dog years,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
but an infinite number of years into the future.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Meanwhile, for all intents and purposes,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
space looks finite to us.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Space may be finite or infinite,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
but because the universe is accelerating,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
there are parts of it we cannot see

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and never will see.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
There's a finite region of space that we have access to,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
surrounded by a horizon.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
So even though time goes on forever,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
space is limited to us.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Finally, empty space has a temperature.
