00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
So like I said, I don't actually know the answer.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
I'm going to give you my favorite scenario.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Either it's just like that. There is no explanation.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
This is a brute fact about the universe

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Or maybe the Big Bang

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
is not the beginning of the universe.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
An egg, an unbroken egg, is a low entropy configuration,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
and yet, when we open our refrigerator,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
we do not go, "Hah, how surprising to find

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator."

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
That's because an egg is not a closed system;

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
it comes out of a chicken.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken.
