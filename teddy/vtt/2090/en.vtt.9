00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that we've been giving enough attention to.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It's not one of the first things people would say,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
if you asked a modern cosmologist,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
"What are the problems we're trying to address?"

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
was Richard Feynman.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
50 years ago, he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
He gave the popular lectures

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
that became "The Character of Physical Law."

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
He gave lectures to Caltech undergrads

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
that became "The Feynman Lectures on Physics."

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
He gave lectures to Caltech graduate students

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
that became "The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation."

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
In every one of these books, every one of these sets of lectures,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
he emphasized this puzzle:

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Why did the early universe have such a small entropy?
