00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It's a clue

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
that the early universe is not chosen randomly.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
There is something that made it that way.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We would like to know what.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So part of our understanding of this was given to us by Ludwig Boltzmann,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
an Austrian physicist in the 19th century.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And Boltzmann's contribution was that he helped us understand entropy.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You've heard of entropy.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It's the randomness, the disorder, the chaoticness of some systems.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Boltzmann gave us a formula --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
engraved on his tombstone now --

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
that really quantifies what entropy is.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And it's basically just saying

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that entropy is the number of ways
