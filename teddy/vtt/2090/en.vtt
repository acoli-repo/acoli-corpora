00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The universe

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
is really big.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We live in a galaxy, the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
There are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And if you take a camera

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and you point it at a random part of the sky,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and you just keep the shutter open,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
as long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
it will see something like this.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Every one of these little blobs

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
is a galaxy roughly the size of our Milky Way --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies
