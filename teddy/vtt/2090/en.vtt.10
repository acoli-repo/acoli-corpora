00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Why did the early universe have such a small entropy?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So he says -- I'm not going to do the accent --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
he says, "For some reason, the universe, at one time,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
had a very low entropy for its energy content,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and since then the entropy has increased.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The arrow of time cannot be completely understood

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
are reduced still further

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
from speculation to understanding."

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So that's our job.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
We want to know -- this is 50 years ago, "Surely," you're thinking,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
"we've figured it out by now."

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It's not true that we've figured it out by now.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
The reason the problem has gotten worse,
