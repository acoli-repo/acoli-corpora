00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
called Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
it's much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
than for them actually to randomly fluctuate

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
into Caltech, the United States and the galaxy.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
The good news is that,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
therefore, this scenario does not work; it is not right.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
This scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Even if you left our galaxy out,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And Feynman also understood this.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Feynman says, "From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
all the predictions are that

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
if we look at a part of the world we've never seen before,
