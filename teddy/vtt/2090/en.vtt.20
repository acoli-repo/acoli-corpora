00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
metabolize, walk and talk,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
if we lived in thermal equilibrium.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
So if you imagine a very, very big universe,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
an infinitely big universe,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
with randomly bumping into each other particles,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and then they relax back.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
But there will also be large fluctuations.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Occasionally, you will make a planet

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
or a star or a galaxy

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
or a hundred billion galaxies.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So Boltzmann says,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
we will only live in the part of the multiverse,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
where life is possible.
