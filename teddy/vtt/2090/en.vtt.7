00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
or in some isolated bit of the universe.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The reason why entropy increases

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
is simply because there are many more ways

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
to be high entropy than to be low entropy.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
That's a wonderful insight,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
but it leaves something out.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
This insight that entropy increases, by the way,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
is what's behind what we call the arrow of time,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
the difference between the past and the future.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Every difference that there is

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
between the past and the future

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
is because entropy is increasing --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
the fact that you can remember the past, but not the future.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The fact that you are born, and then you live, and then you die,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
always in that order,
