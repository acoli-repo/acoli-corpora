00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It's not true that we've figured it out by now.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
The reason the problem has gotten worse,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
rather than better,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
is because in 1998

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn't know before.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
We learned that it's accelerating.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
The universe is not only expanding.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
If you look at the galaxy, it's moving away.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
If you come back a billion years later and look at it again,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
it will be moving away faster.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Individual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
so we say the universe is accelerating.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Unlike the low entropy of the early universe,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
even though we don't know the answer for this,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
we at least have a good theory that can explain it,
