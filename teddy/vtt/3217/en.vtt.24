00:11:58.241 --> 00:12:00.943
because, for instance,
you can use clean electricity

00:12:00.967 --> 00:12:03.152
to split water to produce hydrogen,

00:12:03.176 --> 00:12:07.057
which is an excellent, carbon-free
replacement for natural gas,

00:12:07.081 --> 00:12:08.831
to supply the heat required.

00:12:10.212 --> 00:12:13.984
But I want us to reflect a little bit
again on negative emissions.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.973
Negative emissions should not be
considered a silver bullet,

00:12:17.997 --> 00:12:20.500
but they may help us
if we continue to stall

00:12:20.524 --> 00:12:23.783
at cutting down on CO2
pollution worldwide.

00:12:24.441 --> 00:12:27.475
But that's also why we have to be careful.

00:12:27.499 --> 00:12:30.476
This approach is so alluring
that it can even be risky,
