00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.120
that allows them to co-capture
the CO2 from the air

00:06:04.144 --> 00:06:08.103
and the CO2 that they generate
from burning the natural gas.

00:06:08.127 --> 00:06:09.929
And so by doing this,

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:13.371
they offset excess pollution
and they reduce costs.

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:18.052
Switzerland-based Climeworks
and US-based Global Thermostat

00:06:18.076 --> 00:06:19.679
use a different approach.

00:06:19.703 --> 00:06:22.312
They use solid materials for capture.

00:06:22.336 --> 00:06:25.119
Climeworks uses heat from the earth,

00:06:25.143 --> 00:06:26.556
or geothermal,

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.692
or even excess steam
from other industrial processes

00:06:29.716 --> 00:06:32.075
to cut down on pollution and costs.
