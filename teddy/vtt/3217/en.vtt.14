00:06:56.724 --> 00:07:02.216
A synthetic forest has a significant
advantage over a real forest: size.

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:06.708
This next image that I'm showing you
is a map of the Amazon rainforest.

00:07:06.732 --> 00:07:12.811
The Amazon is capable of capturing
1.6 billion tons of CO2 each year.

00:07:12.835 --> 00:07:16.214
This is the equivalent
of roughly 25 percent

00:07:16.238 --> 00:07:18.533
of our annual emissions in the US.

00:07:19.007 --> 00:07:21.942
The land area required
for a synthetic forest

00:07:21.966 --> 00:07:24.263
or a manufactured direct air capture plant

00:07:24.287 --> 00:07:25.719
to capture the same

00:07:25.743 --> 00:07:27.831
is 500 times smaller.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.227
In addition, for a synthetic forest,
