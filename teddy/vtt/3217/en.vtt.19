WEBVTT

00:09:29.726 --> 00:09:32.419
is for carbon-neutral,
carbon-negative paths

00:09:32.443 --> 00:09:35.132
to be affordable for
the majority of society

00:09:35.156 --> 00:09:36.933
in order to impact climate.

00:09:37.403 --> 00:09:39.976
In addition to those kinds of investments,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.608
we also need investments
in research and development.

00:09:43.632 --> 00:09:45.189
So what might that look like?

00:09:45.865 --> 00:09:52.145
In 1966, the US invested about
a half a percent of gross domestic product

00:09:52.169 --> 00:09:53.664
in the Apollo program.

00:09:54.568 --> 00:09:57.420
It got people safely to the moon

00:09:57.444 --> 00:09:58.891
and back to the earth.

00:09:59.464 --> 00:10:02.993
Half a percent of GDP today
is about 100 billion dollars.
