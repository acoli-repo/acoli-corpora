No matter which approach you choose,
they basically look the same.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.592
So what I'm showing you here
is what a system might look like

00:02:05.616 --> 00:02:07.077
to do just this.

00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:09.338
This is called an air contactor.

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:11.648
You can see it has to be
really, really wide

00:02:11.672 --> 00:02:13.830
in order to have
a high enough surface area

00:02:13.854 --> 00:02:16.570
to process all of the air required,

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:17.746
because remember,

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.748
we're trying to capture
just 400 molecules out of a million.

00:02:22.293 --> 00:02:25.264
Using the liquid-based
approach to do this,

00:02:25.288 --> 00:02:27.654
you take this high surface area
packing material,

00:02:27.678 --> 00:02:30.499
you fill the contactor
with the packing material,
