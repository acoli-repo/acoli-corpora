00:00:29.224 --> 00:00:32.943
That's the challenge we're facing
when capturing CO2

00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:34.545
directly out of the air.

00:00:35.357 --> 00:00:36.783
Sounds pretty easy,

00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:39.199
pulling CO2 out of the air.

00:00:39.223 --> 00:00:40.766
It's actually really difficult.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.610
But I'll tell you what is easy:

00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:46.065
avoiding CO2 emissions to begin with.

00:00:46.701 --> 00:00:48.317
But we're not doing that.

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.290
So now what we have to think
about is going back;

00:00:53.314 --> 00:00:56.284
pulling CO2 back out of the air.

00:00:56.663 --> 00:01:00.538
Even though it's difficult,
it's actually possible to do this.
