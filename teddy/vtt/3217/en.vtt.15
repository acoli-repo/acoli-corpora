In addition, for a synthetic forest,

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:35.116
you don't have to build it on arable land,

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.411
so there's no competition
with farmland or food,

00:07:39.435 --> 00:07:44.429
and there's also no reason
to have to cut down any real trees

00:07:44.453 --> 00:07:45.714
to do this.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.350
I want to step back,

00:07:48.374 --> 00:07:51.940
and I want to bring up the concept
of negative emissions again.

00:07:52.394 --> 00:07:55.963
Negative emissions require
that the CO2 separated

00:07:55.987 --> 00:08:00.374
be permanently removed
from the atmosphere forever,
