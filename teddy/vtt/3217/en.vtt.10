00:04:57.381 --> 00:05:00.959
you end up emitting more CO2
than you capture.

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.332
Now let's talk about costs.

00:05:03.356 --> 00:05:06.830
An energy-intensive version
of this technology

00:05:06.854 --> 00:05:09.945
could cost you as much
as $1,000 a ton

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:11.318
just to capture it.

00:05:12.183 --> 00:05:13.543
Let's translate that.

00:05:14.128 --> 00:05:18.143
If you were to take that very expensive
CO2 and convert it to a liquid fuel,

00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:20.504
that comes out to 50 dollars a gallon.

00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:23.713
That's way too expensive;
it's not feasible.

00:05:23.737 --> 00:05:26.148
So how could we bring these costs down?

00:05:26.172 --> 00:05:28.644
That's, in part, the work that I do.

00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:32.490
There's a company today,
a commercial-scale company,
