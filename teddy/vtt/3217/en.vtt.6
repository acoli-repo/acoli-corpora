00:02:58.825 --> 00:03:00.871
because the deeper
you make that contactor,

00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:04.580
the more energy you're spending
on bubbling all that air through.

00:03:05.055 --> 00:03:09.409
So air contactors for direct air capture
have this unique characteristic design,

00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:13.755
where they have this huge surface area,
but a relatively thin thickness.

00:03:14.178 --> 00:03:16.805
And now once you've captured the CO2,

00:03:17.527 --> 00:03:21.408
you have to be able to recycle
that material that you used to capture it,

00:03:21.432 --> 00:03:22.971
over and over again.

00:03:22.995 --> 00:03:25.982
The scale of carbon capture is so enormous

00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:28.214
that the capture process
must be sustainable,

00:03:28.238 --> 00:03:30.318
and you can't use a material just once.
