00:00:56.663 --> 00:01:00.538
Even though it's difficult,
it's actually possible to do this.

00:01:00.983 --> 00:01:04.552
And I'm going to share with you today
where this technology is at

00:01:04.576 --> 00:01:07.265
and where it just may be heading
in the near future.

00:01:08.106 --> 00:01:12.936
Now, the earth naturally
removes CO2 from the air

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.613
by seawater, soils, plants and even rocks.

00:01:17.637 --> 00:01:22.355
And although engineers and scientists
are doing the invaluable work

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:25.631
to accelerate these natural processes,

00:01:25.655 --> 00:01:27.695
it simply won't be enough.

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.073
The good news is, we have more.
