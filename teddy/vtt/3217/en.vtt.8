And that's really important,

00:04:00.164 --> 00:04:04.366
because high-purity CO2
is easier to liquify,

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.554
easier to transport, whether
it's in a pipeline or a truck,

00:04:07.578 --> 00:04:09.799
or even easier to use directly,

00:04:09.823 --> 00:04:12.411
say, as a fuel or a chemical.

00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:16.811
So I want to talk a little bit more
about that energy.

00:04:16.835 --> 00:04:21.048
The heat required to regenerate
or recycle these materials

00:04:21.072 --> 00:04:27.525
absolutely dictates the energy
and the subsequent cost of doing this.

00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:30.762
So I ask a question:
