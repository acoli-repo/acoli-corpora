00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:03.441
But we also need to be willing to invest

00:09:03.465 --> 00:09:05.121
as a global society.

00:09:06.534 --> 00:09:09.908
We could have all of the clever thinking
and technology in the world,

00:09:09.932 --> 00:09:11.567
but it's not going to be enough

00:09:11.591 --> 00:09:16.470
in order for this technology
to have a significant impact on climate.

00:09:16.494 --> 00:09:18.676
We really need regulation,

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.233
we need subsidies,

00:09:20.257 --> 00:09:22.450
taxes on carbon.

00:09:22.474 --> 00:09:27.284
There are a few of us that would
absolutely be willing to pay more,

00:09:27.308 --> 00:09:29.702
but what will be required

00:09:29.726 --> 00:09:32.419
is for carbon-neutral,
carbon-negative paths
