Four hundred parts per million:

00:00:03.445 --> 00:00:08.233
that's the approximate concentration
of CO2 in the air today.

00:00:08.257 --> 00:00:09.680
What does this even mean?

00:00:10.083 --> 00:00:13.507
For every 400 molecules of carbon dioxide,

00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:18.044
we have another million molecules
of oxygen and nitrogen.

00:00:18.068 --> 00:00:21.969
In this room today,
there are about 1,800 of us.

00:00:21.993 --> 00:00:25.826
Imagine just one of us
was wearing a green shirt,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.664
and you're asked to find
that single person.

00:00:29.224 --> 00:00:32.943
That's the challenge we're facing
when capturing CO2
