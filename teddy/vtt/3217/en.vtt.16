00:07:55.987 --> 00:08:00.374
be permanently removed
from the atmosphere forever,

00:08:00.398 --> 00:08:03.120
which means putting it back underground,

00:08:03.144 --> 00:08:05.513
where it came from in the first place.

00:08:05.537 --> 00:08:09.076
But let's face it, nobody
gets paid to do that today --

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.458
at least not enough.

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:14.497
So the companies that are developing
these technologies

00:08:14.521 --> 00:08:16.998
are actually interested in taking the CO2

00:08:17.022 --> 00:08:20.169
and making something useful
out of it, a marketable product.

00:08:20.193 --> 00:08:23.773
It could be liquid fuels, plastics

00:08:23.797 --> 00:08:25.543
or even synthetic gravel.

00:08:26.043 --> 00:08:29.209
And don't get me wrong --
these carbon markets are great.
