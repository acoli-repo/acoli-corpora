There's a company today,
a commercial-scale company,

00:05:32.514 --> 00:05:35.203
that can do this as low
as 600 dollars a ton.

00:05:35.227 --> 00:05:39.008
There are several other companies
that are developing technologies

00:05:39.032 --> 00:05:41.157
that can do this even cheaper than that.

00:05:41.583 --> 00:05:43.352
I'm going to talk to you a little bit

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:45.349
about a few of these different companies.

00:05:45.373 --> 00:05:47.041
One is called Carbon Engineering.

00:05:47.065 --> 00:05:48.533
They're based out of Canada.

00:05:48.557 --> 00:05:51.450
They use a liquid-based
approach for separation

00:05:51.474 --> 00:05:55.739
combined with burning
super-abundant, cheap natural gas

00:05:55.763 --> 00:05:58.098
to supply the heat required.

00:05:58.122 --> 00:05:59.806
They have a clever approach

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.120
that allows them to co-capture
the CO2 from the air
