00:03:28.238 --> 00:03:30.318
and you can't use a material just once.

00:03:30.758 --> 00:03:34.981
And so recycling the material requires
an enormous amount of heat,

00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:38.261
because think about it:
CO2 is so dilute in the air,

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:41.135
that material is binding it really strong,

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.996
and so you need a lot of heat
in order to recycle the material.

00:03:45.407 --> 00:03:48.070
And to recycle the material
with that heat,

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:53.887
what happens is that concentrated CO2
that you got from dilute CO2 in the air

00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:55.504
is now released,

00:03:55.528 --> 00:03:58.002
and you produce high-purity CO2.

00:03:58.417 --> 00:04:00.140
And that's really important,
