The good news is, we have more.

00:01:30.097 --> 00:01:33.911
Thanks to human ingenuity,
we have the technology today

00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:37.223
to remove CO2 out of the air

00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:39.852
using a chemically manufactured approach.

00:01:39.876 --> 00:01:43.141
I like to think of this
as a synthetic forest.

00:01:43.165 --> 00:01:48.485
There are two basic approaches
to growing or building such a forest.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.613
One is using CO2-grabbing chemicals
dissolved in water.

00:01:53.637 --> 00:01:57.491
Another is using solid materials
with CO2-grabbing chemicals.

00:01:57.515 --> 00:02:00.998
No matter which approach you choose,
they basically look the same.
