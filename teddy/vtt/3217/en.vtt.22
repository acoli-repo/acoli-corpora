00:10:59.744 --> 00:11:04.559
So this investment
could absolutely be significant.

00:11:05.496 --> 00:11:08.599
Now, what would it take
in terms of land area to do this,

00:11:08.623 --> 00:11:09.961
200 plants?

00:11:10.406 --> 00:11:14.717
It turns out that they would take up
about half the land area of Vancouver.

00:11:14.741 --> 00:11:16.837
That's if they were fueled by natural gas.

00:11:16.861 --> 00:11:21.533
But remember the downside
of natural gas -- it also emits CO2.

00:11:21.557 --> 00:11:24.454
So if you use natural gas
to do direct air capture,

00:11:24.478 --> 00:11:28.239
you only end up capturing
about a third of what's intended,

00:11:28.263 --> 00:11:30.826
unless you have that
clever approach of co-capture
