00:02:27.678 --> 00:02:30.499
you fill the contactor
with the packing material,

00:02:30.523 --> 00:02:35.195
you use pumps to distribute liquid
across the packing material,

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:38.130
and you can use fans,
as you can see in the front,

00:02:38.154 --> 00:02:40.595
to bubble the air through the liquid.

00:02:41.173 --> 00:02:44.985
The CO2 in the air
is separated [by] the liquid

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:51.668
by reacting with the really strong-binding
CO2 molecules in solution.

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:54.354
And in order to capture a lot of CO2,

00:02:54.378 --> 00:02:56.947
you have to make this contactor deeper.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.801
But there's an optimization,

00:02:58.825 --> 00:03:00.871
because the deeper
you make that contactor,
