00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:30.762
So I ask a question:

00:04:30.786 --> 00:04:33.644
How much energy do you think it takes

00:04:33.668 --> 00:04:37.409
to remove a million tons
of CO2 from the air

00:04:37.433 --> 00:04:38.791
in a given year?

00:04:39.343 --> 00:04:41.154
The answer is: a power plant.

00:04:41.178 --> 00:04:44.847
It takes a power plant
to capture CO2 directly from the air.

00:04:44.871 --> 00:04:46.755
Depending on which approach you choose,

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:51.197
the power plant could be on the order
of 300 to 500 megawatts.

00:04:51.847 --> 00:04:55.656
And you have to be careful about
what kind of power plant you choose.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.357
If you choose coal,

00:04:57.381 --> 00:05:00.959
you end up emitting more CO2
than you capture.
