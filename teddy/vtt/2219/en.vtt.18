00:08:57.862 --> 00:09:00.259
Next, when you're working from home,

00:09:00.283 --> 00:09:03.053
wear clothes you only wear
when you're working.

00:09:03.077 --> 00:09:04.602
And then at the end of the day,

00:09:04.626 --> 00:09:05.823
change clothes,

00:09:05.847 --> 00:09:09.553
and use music and lighting
to shift the atmosphere

00:09:09.577 --> 00:09:11.535
from work to home.

00:09:11.559 --> 00:09:12.860
Make it a ritual.

00:09:12.884 --> 00:09:15.170
Now, some of you might think that's silly.

00:09:15.194 --> 00:09:17.009
That changing clothes and lighting

00:09:17.033 --> 00:09:19.646
will convince my mind
I'm no longer at work.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.101
Trust me, your mind will fall for it.

00:09:22.125 --> 00:09:24.746
Because we are really smart,
our mind is really stupid.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:25.785
(Laughter)

00:09:25.809 --> 00:09:28.296
It falls for random associations
all the time, right?

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.872
I mean, that's why Pavlov's dog
began drooling at the sound of a bell.
