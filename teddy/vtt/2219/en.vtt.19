00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.872
I mean, that's why Pavlov's dog
began drooling at the sound of a bell.

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:35.617
And why TED speakers begin sweating
at the sight of a red circle.

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:37.045
(Laughter)

00:09:37.069 --> 00:09:38.720
Now those things will help,

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:41.022
but ruminations will still invade.

00:09:41.046 --> 00:09:43.625
And when they do, you have to convert them

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:47.135
into productive forms of thinking,
like problem-solving.

00:09:47.611 --> 00:09:49.857
My patient Sally is a good example.

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:52.929
Sally was given
the promotion of a lifetime,

00:09:52.953 --> 00:09:54.778
but it came with a price.

00:09:54.802 --> 00:09:57.024
She was no longer able
to pick up her daughter

00:09:57.048 --> 00:09:58.237
from school every day,

00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:00.062
and that broke her heart.
