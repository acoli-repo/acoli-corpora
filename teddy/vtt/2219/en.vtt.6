00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.434
the distressing things,

00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:04.545
and we do it in ways
that are entirely unproductive.

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:09.014
It's the hours we spend
obsessing about tasks we didn't complete

00:03:09.038 --> 00:03:12.307
or stewing about tensions
with a colleague,

00:03:12.331 --> 00:03:14.208
or anxiously worrying about the future,

00:03:14.232 --> 00:03:16.631
or second-guessing decisions we've made.

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:21.439
Now there's a lot of research
on how we think about work

00:03:21.463 --> 00:03:23.812
when we are not at work,

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:26.236
and the findings are quite alarming.

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:27.948
Ruminating about work,

00:03:27.972 --> 00:03:32.248
replaying the same thoughts and worries
over and over again,
