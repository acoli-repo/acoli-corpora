00:00:01.175 --> 00:00:05.063
I wanted to be a psychologist
since I was a teenager,

00:00:05.087 --> 00:00:07.821
and I spent years pursuing that one goal.

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.746
I opened my private practice
as soon as I was licensed.

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.507
It was a risky move, not getting a day job
at a hospital or a clinic,

00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:19.426
but within one year,
my practice was doing quite well

00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:23.194
and I was making more money
than I ever made before.

00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:26.699
Of course, I was a full-time
student my entire life.

00:00:26.723 --> 00:00:27.766
(Laughter)

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.387
I could have worked at McDonald's

00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:32.191
and made more money
than I ever made before.
