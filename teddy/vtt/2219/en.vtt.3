00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:32.276
What if I had chosen the wrong profession?

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.608
What if I had spent my entire life
pursuing the wrong career?

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:41.195
But then I realized, no,
I still loved psychology.

00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:44.909
The problem wasn't the work
I did in my office.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.847
It was the hours I spent
ruminating about work

00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:50.148
when I was home.

00:01:50.172 --> 00:01:52.244
I closed the door
to my office every night,

00:01:52.268 --> 00:01:55.938
but the door in my head remained wide-open

00:01:55.962 --> 00:01:58.028
and the stress just flooded in.

00:01:58.938 --> 00:02:01.699
That's the interesting thing
about work stress.
