00:05:29.585 --> 00:05:31.553
that was 45 minutes a day.

00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:34.331
Totally checked out for 20 minutes

00:05:34.355 --> 00:05:36.926
during the dinner party
at a colleague's house.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.418
Never got invited there again.

00:05:38.442 --> 00:05:39.450
(Laughter)

00:05:39.474 --> 00:05:43.172
And 90 minutes during
a friend's "talent show"

00:05:43.196 --> 00:05:46.444
that, coincidentally, was 90 minutes long.

00:05:46.468 --> 00:05:47.650
(Laughter)

00:05:47.674 --> 00:05:51.912
In total, that week,
it was almost 14 hours.

00:05:52.484 --> 00:05:54.913
That's how much "downtime" I was losing

00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:57.966
to something that actually
increased my stress.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.927
Try keeping a journal for one week.

00:05:59.951 --> 00:06:01.484
See how much you do it.
