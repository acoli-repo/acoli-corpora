00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:01.074
(Laughter)

00:01:01.577 --> 00:01:03.908
I felt terrible afterwards, though.

00:01:03.932 --> 00:01:05.718
Because I wasn't panicked

00:01:05.742 --> 00:01:08.488
and I knew what to say to calm him down.

00:01:08.512 --> 00:01:10.757
I was just too depleted to do it,

00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:15.536
I had nothing left to give,
and that confused me.

00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:18.643
After all, I was finally living my dream,

00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:20.635
so why wasn't I happy?

00:01:21.278 --> 00:01:23.833
Why did I feel so burned out?

00:01:24.714 --> 00:01:26.712
For a few terrible weeks,

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:29.609
I questioned whether I'd made a mistake.

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:32.276
What if I had chosen the wrong profession?
