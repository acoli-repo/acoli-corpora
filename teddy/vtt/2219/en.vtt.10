00:04:57.082 --> 00:05:00.550
Anxiously worrying about the future
feels compelling.

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:05.149
Ruminating always feels
like we're doing something important,

00:05:05.173 --> 00:05:07.828
when in fact, we're doing
something harmful.

00:05:08.134 --> 00:05:10.934
And we all do it far more than we realize.

00:05:11.563 --> 00:05:13.158
Back when I was burned out,

00:05:13.182 --> 00:05:15.809
I decided to keep a journal for a week

00:05:15.833 --> 00:05:19.918
and document exactly how much time
I spent ruminating.

00:05:19.942 --> 00:05:22.411
And I was horrified by the results.

00:05:22.435 --> 00:05:25.848
It was over 30 minutes a night
when I was trying to fall asleep.

00:05:26.157 --> 00:05:29.561
My entire commute,
to and from my office --

00:05:29.585 --> 00:05:31.553
that was 45 minutes a day.
