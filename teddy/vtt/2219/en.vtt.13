00:06:29.378 --> 00:06:31.623
I won my war against ruminating,

00:06:31.647 --> 00:06:34.629
and I'm here to tell you
how you can win yours.

00:06:35.235 --> 00:06:38.480
First, you need clear guardrails.

00:06:38.823 --> 00:06:41.506
You have to define
when you switch off every night,

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.228
when you stop working.

00:06:43.252 --> 00:06:45.585
And you have to be strict about it.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:51.248
The rule I made to myself at the time
was that I was done at 8pm.

00:06:51.617 --> 00:06:54.196
And I forced myself to stick to it.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.386
Now people say to me,

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.330
"Really? You didn't return
a single email after 8pm?

00:06:59.354 --> 00:07:01.633
You didn't even look at your phone?"
