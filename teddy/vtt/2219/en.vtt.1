00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:32.191
and made more money
than I ever made before.

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:36.089
That one-year mark
came on a Friday night in July.

00:00:36.394 --> 00:00:38.053
I walked home to my apartment

00:00:38.077 --> 00:00:41.926
and got into the elevator with a neighbor
who was a doctor in the ER.

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:44.077
The elevator rose,

00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:47.323
then it shuddered
and stalled between floors.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:50.395
And the man who dealt
with emergencies for a living

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:53.313
began poking at the buttons
and banging on the door, saying,

00:00:53.337 --> 00:00:55.662
"This is my nightmare,
this is my nightmare!"

00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:58.101
And I was like,
"And this is my nightmare."

00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:01.074
