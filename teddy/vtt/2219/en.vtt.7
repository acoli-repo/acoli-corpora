00:03:27.972 --> 00:03:32.248
replaying the same thoughts and worries
over and over again,

00:03:32.272 --> 00:03:37.827
significantly disrupts our ability
to recover and recharge in the off hours.

00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:40.711
The more we ruminate about work
when we're home,

00:03:40.735 --> 00:03:44.386
the more likely we are
to experience sleep disturbances,

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.647
to eat unhealthier foods

00:03:46.671 --> 00:03:48.147
and to have worse moods.

00:03:48.171 --> 00:03:52.663
It may even increase our risk
of cardiovascular disease

00:03:52.687 --> 00:03:55.631
and of impairing
our executive functioning,

00:03:55.655 --> 00:03:58.488
the very skill sets we need
to do our jobs well.

00:03:58.512 --> 00:04:01.971
Not to mention the toll it takes
on our relationships and family lives,
