00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:00.062
and that broke her heart.

00:10:00.086 --> 00:10:01.848
So she came up with a plan.

00:10:01.872 --> 00:10:05.427
Every Tuesday and Thursday,
Sally left work early,

00:10:05.451 --> 00:10:07.380
picked up her daughter from school,

00:10:07.404 --> 00:10:11.797
played with her, fed her,
bathed her and put her to bed.

00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:13.566
And then she went back to the office

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.057
and worked past midnight to catch up.

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:19.895
Only, Sally's rumination journal indicated

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:23.879
she spent almost every minute
of her quality time with her daughter

00:10:23.903 --> 00:10:26.918
ruminating about how much
work she had to do.

00:10:26.942 --> 00:10:30.894
Ruminations often deny us
our most precious moments.
