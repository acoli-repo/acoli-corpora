or leave it till morning,

00:04:31.006 --> 00:04:34.521
or whether we want to brainstorm
about work projects that excite us.

00:04:35.085 --> 00:04:37.653
But ruminations are involuntary.

00:04:38.217 --> 00:04:39.417
They're intrusive.

00:04:39.741 --> 00:04:42.527
They pop into our head
when we don't want them to.

00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:45.797
They upset us when
we don't want to be upset.

00:04:45.821 --> 00:04:49.868
They switch us on
when we are trying to switch off.

00:04:49.892 --> 00:04:52.868
And they are very difficult to resist,

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:56.644
because thinking of all
our unfinished tasks feels urgent.

00:04:57.082 --> 00:05:00.550
Anxiously worrying about the future
feels compelling.
