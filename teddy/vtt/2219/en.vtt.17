When we lack a physical boundary
between work and home,

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:33.270
we have to create a psychological one.

00:08:33.294 --> 00:08:35.223
We have to trick our mind

00:08:35.247 --> 00:08:39.222
into defining work and nonwork
times and spaces.

00:08:39.588 --> 00:08:40.949

00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:46.258

and try to work only there.

00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:50.750
Try not to work on the living room couch

00:08:50.774 --> 00:08:51.939
or on the bed

00:08:51.963 --> 00:08:54.227
because really, those areas
should be associated

00:08:54.251 --> 00:08:56.173
with living and ... bedding.

00:08:56.838 --> 00:08:57.838
(Laughter)

00:08:57.862 --> 00:09:00.259
Next, when you're working from home,
