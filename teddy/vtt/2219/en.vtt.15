00:07:29.292 --> 00:07:31.340
I mean, battling ruminations
was hard enough

00:07:31.364 --> 00:07:33.228
when they just invaded our thoughts.

00:07:33.252 --> 00:07:35.473
But now they have this Trojan horse,

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:37.244
our phones, to hide within.

00:07:37.268 --> 00:07:40.283
And each time we just look
at our phone after hours,

00:07:40.307 --> 00:07:42.006
we can be reminded of work

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.276
and ruminative thoughts can slip out

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.680
and slaughter our evening or weekend.

00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:49.076
So, when you switch off,

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.393
switch off your email notifications.

00:07:51.417 --> 00:07:54.354
And if you have to check them,
decide on when to do it,

00:07:54.378 --> 00:07:56.352
so it doesn't interfere with your plans,

00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:57.709
and do it only then.

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:03.186
Cell phones aren't the only way
technology is empowering rumination,
