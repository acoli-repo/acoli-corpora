00:01:58.938 --> 00:02:01.699
That's the interesting thing
about work stress.

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:05.498
We don't really experience
much of it at work.

00:02:05.522 --> 00:02:06.822
We're too busy.

00:02:06.846 --> 00:02:09.879
We experience it outside of work,

00:02:09.903 --> 00:02:11.403
when we are commuting,

00:02:11.427 --> 00:02:12.842
when we're home,

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:15.199
when we're trying to rejuvenate.

00:02:15.223 --> 00:02:17.817
It is important to recover
in our spare time,

00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:20.561
to de-stress and do things we enjoy,

00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:24.649
and the biggest obstruction
we face in that regard is ruminating.

00:02:24.673 --> 00:02:26.506
Because each time we do it,

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.760
we're actually activating
our stress response.

00:02:29.784 --> 00:02:32.711
Now, to ruminate means to chew over.
