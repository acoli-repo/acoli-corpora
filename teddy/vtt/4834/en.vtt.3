00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:32.822
Patients describe it as crushing
or vice-like.

00:01:32.822 --> 00:01:34.633
It can radiate to the left arm,

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:35.472
jaw,

00:01:35.472 --> 00:01:36.241
back,

00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:37.473
or abdomen.

00:01:37.473 --> 00:01:41.622
But it's not always as sudden and dramatic
as it is in the movies.

00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:43.513
Some people experience nausea

00:01:43.513 --> 00:01:44.932
or shortness of breath.

00:01:44.932 --> 00:01:48.283
Symptoms may be less prominent
in women and the elderly.

00:01:48.283 --> 00:01:52.592
For them, weakness and tiredness
may be the main signal.

00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:54.513
And surprisingly, in many people,

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:58.642
especially those with diabetes,
which affects the nerves that carry pain,

00:01:58.642 --> 00:02:01.192
a heart attack may be silent.
