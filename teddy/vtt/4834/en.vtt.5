00:02:27.524 --> 00:02:30.034
to measure the heart's 
electrical activity

00:02:30.034 --> 00:02:33.294
and a blood test to assess 
heart muscle damage.

00:02:33.294 --> 00:02:36.765
The patient is then taken to a high-tech
cardiac suite

00:02:36.765 --> 00:02:40.105
where tests are done 
to locate the blockages.

00:02:40.105 --> 00:02:42.734
Cardiologists can reopen 
the blocked artery

00:02:42.734 --> 00:02:47.365
by inflating it with a balloon
in a procedure called an angioplasty.

00:02:47.365 --> 00:02:50.794
Frequently, they also insert a metal
or polymer stent

00:02:50.794 --> 00:02:53.148
that will hold the artery open.

00:02:53.148 --> 00:02:57.625
More extensive blockages might require
coronary artery bypass surgery.

00:02:57.625 --> 00:03:01.730
Using a piece of vein or artery
from another part of the body,
