00:03:59.548 --> 00:04:03.167
And of course, medications can also
help prevent heart attacks.

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:06.267
Doctors often prescribe low-dose
aspirin, for example,

00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:09.976
particularly for patients who've
already had a heart attack

00:04:09.976 --> 00:04:12.847
and for those known to be
at high risk.

00:04:12.847 --> 00:04:14.956
And drugs that help manage risk factors,

00:04:14.956 --> 00:04:18.337
like high blood pressure, cholesterol,
and diabetes,

00:04:18.337 --> 00:04:21.038
will make heart attacks less likely, too.

00:04:21.038 --> 00:04:25.057
Heart attacks may be common, 
but they don't have to be inevitable.

00:04:25.057 --> 00:04:26.176
A healthy diet,

00:04:26.176 --> 00:04:27.599
avoiding tobacco use,

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:28.728
staying fit,

00:04:28.728 --> 00:04:31.528
and enjoying plenty of sleep
and lots of laughter
