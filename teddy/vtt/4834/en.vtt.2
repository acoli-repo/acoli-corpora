00:00:58.712 --> 00:01:03.061
and the oxygen-starved cells start to die
within several minutes.

00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:05.911
This is a myocardial infarction,

00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:07.311
or heart attack.

00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:11.302
Things can rapidly deteriorate
in the absence of treatment.

00:01:11.302 --> 00:01:14.712
The injured muscle may not be able
to pump blood as well,

00:01:14.712 --> 00:01:17.102
and its rhythm might be thrown off.

00:01:17.102 --> 00:01:21.472
In the worst case scenario,
a heart attack can cause sudden death.

00:01:21.472 --> 00:01:24.441
And how do you know that someone
is having a heart attack?

00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:26.723
The most common symptom is chest pain

00:01:26.723 --> 00:01:29.622
caused by the oxygen-deprived 
heart muscle.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:32.822
Patients describe it as crushing
or vice-like.
