00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.006
Doctors recommend exercising
a few times a week,

00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:35.180
doing both aerobic activity
and strength training.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.826
A heart-healthy diet is low
in sugar and saturated fats,

00:03:38.826 --> 00:03:41.096
which are both linked to heart disease.

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:42.567
So what should you eat?

00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:44.237
Lots of fiber from vegetables,

00:03:44.237 --> 00:03:46.683
chicken and fish instead of red meat,

00:03:46.683 --> 00:03:49.946
whole grains and nuts like walnuts
and almonds

00:03:49.946 --> 00:03:52.356
all seem to be beneficial.

00:03:52.356 --> 00:03:56.737
A good diet and exercise plan can also
keep your weight in a healthy range,

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:59.548
which will lower 
your heart attack risk as well.

00:03:59.548 --> 00:04:03.167
And of course, medications can also
help prevent heart attacks.
