00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.541
Fatty deposits, or plaques,

00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:33.241
develop on the walls 
of our coronary arteries.

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:37.208
Those are the vessels that supply
oxygenated blood to the heart.

00:00:37.208 --> 00:00:39.490
These plaques grow as we age,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.760
sometimes getting chunky,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.780
hardened,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.091
or enflamed.

00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:45.960
Eventually, the plaques can turn
into blockages.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.791
If one of the plaques ruptures or cracks,

00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:52.169
a blood clot will form around it
in minutes,

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:56.252
and a partially closed artery
can become completely blocked.

00:00:56.252 --> 00:00:58.712
Blood flow is cut off 
to the cardiac muscle

00:00:58.712 --> 00:01:03.061
and the oxygen-starved cells start to die
within several minutes.
