How do we get the stuff over
from the digital into the physical?

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.286
That's my question.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.436
If you look at the iPhone with its touch

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.437
and the Wii with its bodily activity,

00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:41.438
you can see the tendency;
it's getting physical.

00:00:41.462 --> 00:00:43.375
The question is: What's next?

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.992
Now, I have three options
that I would like to show you.

00:00:47.016 --> 00:00:49.014
The first one is mass.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.240
As humans, we are sensitive
to where an object in our hand is heavy.

00:00:53.264 --> 00:00:55.340
So could we use that in mobile phones?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.485
Let me show you
the weight-shifting mobile.

00:00:58.509 --> 00:01:00.218
It is a mobile phone-shaped box
