00:02:01.632 --> 00:02:03.332
We can play with the shape itself.

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:05.405
For example, it can be thin
in your pocket,

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.072
which we of course want it to be.

00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:10.522
But then if you hold it in your hand,
it can lean towards you, be thick.

00:02:10.546 --> 00:02:12.523
It's like tapered to the downside.

00:02:12.547 --> 00:02:15.021
If you change the grasp,
it can adjust to that.

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:19.258
It's also useful if you want to put it
down on your nightstand

00:02:19.282 --> 00:02:21.326
to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.511
It stands.

00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:23.976
It's fairly simple.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.691
Another thing is,

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:27.812
sometimes we watch things
on a mobile phone

00:02:27.836 --> 00:02:29.824
that are bigger than the phone itself.

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:31.858
In that case -- like here, there's an app
