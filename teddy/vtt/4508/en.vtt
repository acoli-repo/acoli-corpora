00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:03.317
I am a PhD student.

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:05.897
And that means I have a question:

00:00:05.921 --> 00:00:09.608
How can we make digital content graspable?

00:00:09.632 --> 00:00:13.185
Because you see, on the one hand,
there is the digital world

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.185
and no question, many things
are happening there right now.

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:20.095
And for us humans, it's not quite
material, it's not really there --

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.730
it's virtual.

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:22.976
On the other hand,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.086
we're humans, we live in a physical world.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.071
It's rich, it tastes good,
it feels good, it smells good.

00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:29.620
So the question is:

00:00:29.644 --> 00:00:32.696
How do we get the stuff over
from the digital into the physical?
