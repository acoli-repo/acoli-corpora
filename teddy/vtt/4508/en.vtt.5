00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:31.858
In that case -- like here, there's an app

00:02:31.882 --> 00:02:33.795
that's bigger than the phone's screen --

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.694
the shape of the phone could tell you,

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:38.316
"OK, off the screen, right here,
there is more content.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.971
You can't see it, but it's there."

00:02:39.995 --> 00:02:42.793
And you can feel it,
because it's thicker at that edge.

00:02:42.817 --> 00:02:44.348
The shape is the second thing.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.342
The third thing operates
on a different level.

00:02:48.366 --> 00:02:51.363
As humans, we are social, we are empathic,

00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:53.090
and that's great.

00:02:53.114 --> 00:02:56.183
Wouldn't that be a way to make
mobile phones more intuitive?

00:02:56.207 --> 00:02:58.064
Think of a hamster in the pocket.

00:02:58.088 --> 00:03:01.380
Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right.
I don't have to check it.
