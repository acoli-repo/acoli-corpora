00:01:29.392 --> 00:01:31.009
And the good thing about that is,

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:33.411
you don't have to look
at the device all the time;

00:01:33.435 --> 00:01:35.383
you have your eyes free to see the city.

00:01:35.407 --> 00:01:36.943
Now, mass is the first thing --

00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:39.027
the second thing, that's shape.

00:01:39.441 --> 00:01:42.795
We're also sensitive to the shape
of objects we have in our hands.

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.355
So if I download an e-book
and it has 20 pages --

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:46.926
well, they could be thin, right?

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.908
But if it has 500 pages,
I want to feel that "Harry Potter" --

00:01:49.932 --> 00:01:51.094
it's thick.

00:01:51.118 --> 00:01:52.124
(Laughter)

00:01:52.148 --> 00:01:54.976
So let me show you
the shape-changing mobile.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.976
Again, it's a mobile phone-shaped box,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and this one can change its shape.
