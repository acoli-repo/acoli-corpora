00:02:58.088 --> 00:03:01.380
Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right.
I don't have to check it.

00:03:01.404 --> 00:03:02.430
(Laughter)

00:03:02.454 --> 00:03:04.719
Let me show you the living mobile phone.

00:03:04.743 --> 00:03:07.271
So, once again, a mobile phone-shaped box.

00:03:07.295 --> 00:03:10.599
But this one, it has
a breath and a heartbeat,

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:12.445
and it feels very organic.

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:14.761
(Laughter)

00:03:14.785 --> 00:03:17.082
And you can tell, it's relaxed right now.

00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:19.437
Oh, now -- missed call, a new call,

00:03:19.461 --> 00:03:21.478
new girlfriend, maybe -- very exciting.

00:03:21.502 --> 00:03:23.247
(Laughter)

00:03:23.271 --> 00:03:25.293
How do we calm it down?

00:03:25.317 --> 00:03:28.029
You give it a pat behind the ears,

00:03:28.053 --> 00:03:29.976
and everything is all right again.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.673
That's very intuitive,
and that's what we want.
