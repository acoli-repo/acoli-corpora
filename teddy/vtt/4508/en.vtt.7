00:03:32.697 --> 00:03:36.792
So what we have seen are three ways
to make the digital graspable for us.

And I think making it physical
is a good way to do that.

00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:42.509
What's behind that is a postulation,

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:46.769
namely, not that humans should get
much more technical in the future;

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:50.746
rather than that, technology,
a bit more human.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.071
