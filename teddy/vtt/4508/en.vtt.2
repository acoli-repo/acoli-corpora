It is a mobile phone-shaped box

00:01:00.242 --> 00:01:03.357
that has an iron weight inside,
which we can move around,

00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:05.174
and you can feel where it's heavy.

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:07.976
We shift the gravitational center of it.

00:01:08.677 --> 00:01:12.749
For example, we can augment
digital content with physical mass.

00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:14.949
So you move around the content
on the display,

00:01:14.973 --> 00:01:18.322
but you can also feel where it is
just from the weight of the device.

00:01:19.488 --> 00:01:21.999
Another thing it's good for is navigation.

00:01:22.694 --> 00:01:24.676
It can guide you around in a city.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.367
It can tell you by its weight,

00:01:26.391 --> 00:01:29.368
"OK, move right. Walk ahead.
Make a left here."

00:01:29.392 --> 00:01:31.009
And the good thing about that is,
