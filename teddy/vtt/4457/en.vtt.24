swabbing up to the tip of their nose,

00:12:03.397 --> 00:12:06.683
the accuracy of that test

00:12:06.707 --> 00:12:10.334
is essentially the same
as having a health care worker do it.

00:12:10.358 --> 00:12:12.472
That helps a lot.

00:12:13.038 --> 00:12:14.633
We still have to do other things,

00:12:14.657 --> 00:12:19.045
but that means that you
don't have to change protective equipment,

00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:21.649
you just hand the patient that swab,

00:12:21.673 --> 00:12:23.545
they do it, put it in the test tube,

00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:26.458
and if the capacity is right,

00:12:26.482 --> 00:12:29.672
within 24 hours,
you should get that result back.
