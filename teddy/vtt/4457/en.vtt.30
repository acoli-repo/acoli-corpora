00:14:57.736 --> 00:15:01.087
that everybody should learn from.

00:15:01.524 --> 00:15:07.103
And so that is paired
with the isolation piece.

00:15:07.405 --> 00:15:10.603
Our goal here is to get to the point

00:15:10.627 --> 00:15:14.947
where a very small percentage
of the population is infected.

00:15:14.971 --> 00:15:19.439
You know, China, only 0.01 percent
of the population was infected.

00:15:19.773 --> 00:15:20.924
If you let it,

00:15:20.948 --> 00:15:22.426
if you don't do these things,

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.751
you're going to get
the majority of people infected

00:15:25.775 --> 00:15:29.680
and that huge overload
of the medical system.
