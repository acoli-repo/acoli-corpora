00:03:55.875 --> 00:04:02.331
but we could have a respiratory virus
whose case fatality rate was even higher,

00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:04.656
if this was something like smallpox,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.689
you know, that kills 30 percent of people.

00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:08.800
So this is horrific.

00:04:09.173 --> 00:04:11.765
But in fact,

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:15.998
most people, even who get
the COVID disease,

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:17.918
are able to survive.

00:04:17.942 --> 00:04:20.903
So it's quite infectious,

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:24.804

than MERS or SARS were.

00:04:25.632 --> 00:04:27.861
It's not as fatal as they were.

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:34.504
And yet, the disruption we're seeing,
in order to knock it down,
