00:09:57.903 --> 00:10:02.447
But the sooner you do it in a tough way,

00:10:02.471 --> 00:10:07.323
the sooner you can undo it
and go back to normal.

00:10:09.533 --> 00:10:12.045
CA: So we'll come
to the isolation part in a minute,

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:14.053
but just sticking with the testing thing,

00:10:14.077 --> 00:10:19.387
I'm just so confused as to why,
with more than a month's notice --

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:23.697
I mean, there are so many smart
epidemiologists in the US, for example,

00:10:23.721 --> 00:10:26.622
you plug numbers
about infectiousness and fatality

00:10:26.646 --> 00:10:27.864
into any simulation

00:10:27.888 --> 00:10:29.903
and you see that if you don't do anything,

00:10:29.927 --> 00:10:31.617
millions of people will die.
