that in the early stage
aren't stopping you from doing things,

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.807
that's kind of a worst case,

00:06:35.831 --> 00:06:40.768
and that's where, you know,
I did a flu simulation in the 2015 talk

00:06:40.792 --> 00:06:42.958
and showed how quickly it spread.

00:06:42.982 --> 00:06:45.164
You know, versus 1918,

00:06:45.188 --> 00:06:49.617
people move around a lot more now
than they used to,

00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:51.323
and so that works against us.

00:06:51.347 --> 00:06:54.528
Now the medical system
that steps up to treat people

00:06:54.552 --> 00:06:56.053
is also far, far better.

00:06:56.077 --> 00:06:58.029
CA: But when was it clear to you

00:06:58.053 --> 00:07:04.042
that unless we acted,
this could be a really deadly pandemic?
