There will be a website --

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.807
and if the federal
government doesn't do it,

00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:08.115
a lot of local governments
will have to do it --

00:13:08.139 --> 00:13:11.877
that you go to, you give your situation,
including your symptoms,

00:13:11.901 --> 00:13:16.012
you're told, based on your work
and your symptoms,

00:13:16.036 --> 00:13:17.211
are you a priority.

00:13:17.235 --> 00:13:21.815
If so, you're told where
there are kiosks you can go to

00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:25.078
and you'll do the self-swab
and just hand it over,

00:13:25.102 --> 00:13:30.712
or eventually, we'll send
the kits to you at home,
