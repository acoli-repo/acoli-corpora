of being certainly
more dangerous than flu --

00:05:32.403 --> 00:05:35.299
not as dangerous as something
like Ebola or SARS,

00:05:35.323 --> 00:05:40.109
but more dangerous than flu
by a factor, but infectious,

00:05:40.133 --> 00:05:44.188
and also infectious
before symptoms have started,

00:05:44.212 --> 00:05:48.370
is that part of why
it's been really hard to respond to?

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.450
BG: Right.

00:05:51.062 --> 00:05:53.149
Ebola,

00:05:53.173 --> 00:05:57.173
you're actually flat on your back
before you're very infectious.

00:05:57.197 --> 00:06:02.634
So you're not at church
or in a bus or at a store.
