CA: Some people are trying to argue now

00:14:00.569 --> 00:14:03.497
that, almost, the testing
should be dialed back,

00:14:03.521 --> 00:14:05.585
because the cat is out of the bag,

00:14:05.609 --> 00:14:08.926
testing is bringing people together
and risking infection,

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:11.577
you know, forget that,
let's just focus on treatment

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:14.386
and on isolation strategies.

00:14:15.101 --> 00:14:16.260
You disagree with that.

00:14:16.284 --> 00:14:19.776
Testing is still absolutely essential
and needs to be scaled dramatically.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.355
BG: The two that go together are testing,

00:14:22.379 --> 00:14:23.934
at very high volume,

00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:26.204
and the isolation piece.

00:14:26.228 --> 00:14:27.974
If you're a medical worker,

00:14:27.998 --> 00:14:30.124
you want to stay and do your job.
