00:08:57.887 --> 00:09:00.331
and now, where we should have done more.

00:09:00.355 --> 00:09:03.688
I think the most important thing
to discuss today

00:09:03.712 --> 00:09:07.403
is that in the area of testing,

00:09:07.427 --> 00:09:12.268
we're still not creating that capacity

00:09:12.292 --> 00:09:15.226
and applying it
to the people most in need.

00:09:15.546 --> 00:09:19.006
And so we have health workers
who are symptomatic,

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.251
who can't get a test

00:09:21.275 --> 00:09:24.299
and so they don't know
should they go in or not go in,

00:09:24.323 --> 00:09:25.760
and yet we have lots of tests

00:09:25.784 --> 00:09:28.464
being given to people
who aren't symptomatic.

00:09:28.488 --> 00:09:30.768
So the testing thing to me,
