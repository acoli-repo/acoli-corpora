00:00:27.792 --> 00:00:30.754
who offered us some tips
on how to really be our best selves

00:00:30.778 --> 00:00:32.611
in these trying times.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.654
And we're going to switch gears
a little bit today

00:00:35.678 --> 00:00:38.484
from thinking about
our own personal mental health

00:00:38.508 --> 00:00:41.299
to the state of our global
public health systems.

00:00:41.323 --> 00:00:42.990
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

00:00:43.014 --> 00:00:47.117
I guess we have a pretty
exciting guest to introduce.

00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:50.535
On the other side of the country,
let's bring in Bill Gates.

00:00:51.336 --> 00:00:54.486
Bill, they say
the better-known people are,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.768
the less you have to intro them.

00:00:56.792 --> 00:00:58.146
It's great to have you here.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.014
How are you doing?
