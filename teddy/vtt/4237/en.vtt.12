He uses tiny bottles, the glass is tinted,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And he actually -- once he releases a batch of it,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
so you can go online and look at your batch number

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and see how the phenolics are developing,


00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and, you know, gauge its freshness.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
It tasted fine. It tasted interesting.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
It was very green, it was very peppery.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
But in the blind taste test, it came in last.
