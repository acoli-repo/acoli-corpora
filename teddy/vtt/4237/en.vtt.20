00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I don't think it's that bad of a deal.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
(Laughter)

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
This was a fun one.


00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
This is the fastest street-legal car in the world

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and the most expensive production car. 



00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
a professional race car driver,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and down on the Pacific Coast Highway.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And, you know, when we pulled up to a stoplight

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And it was really amazing.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
It was such a smooth ride.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Most of the cars that I drive, if I get up to 80 they start to rattle.
