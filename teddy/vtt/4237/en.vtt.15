The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It's a cat that lives in trees,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations. 



00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And apparently it's a very picky eater and it, you know,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
then go through the forest collecting the, you know, results

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it
