00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
This was another one I could not get a loaner of.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
There's a little plaque on the end that, you know,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
each buyer gets their name engraved on it.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
(Laughter)

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
To try this one, the maker of it let me and my wife

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
spend the night in the Manhattan showroom. 


00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Lights glaring in off the street, 


00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and we had to hire a security guard and all these things.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
But anyway, we had a great night's sleep.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And you spend a third of your life in bed.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I don't think it's that bad of a deal.
