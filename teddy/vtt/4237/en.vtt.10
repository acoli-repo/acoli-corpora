00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
but I have to say that nobody here

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
(Laughter)

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
But then again, nobody has complimented me on the jeans I'm wearing.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
These ones GQ did spring for -- I own these -- but I will tell you, 



00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
not only did I not get a compliment from any of you,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I have not gotten a compliment from anybody 


00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
in the months that I have owned and worn these.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I don't think that whether or not you're getting a compliment

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
should be the test of something's value,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
but I think in the case of a fashion item, an article of clothing,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
that's a reasonable benchmark.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
That said, a lot of work goes into these.
