00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use, which I used.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
It's fully automated -- you walk towards it, and the seat lifts.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
The seat is preheated. 


00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
There's a water jet that cleans you.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
There's an air jet that dries you.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
You get up, it flushes by itself.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
The lid closes, it self-cleans.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Not only is it a technological leap forward,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
but I really do believe it's a bit of a cultural leap forward.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I mean, a no hands, no toilet paper toilet.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And I want to get one of these.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
(Laughter)

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
This was another one I could not get a loaner of.
