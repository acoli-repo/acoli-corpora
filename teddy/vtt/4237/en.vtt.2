00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and happened upon this hidden cache of wines --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
He wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
he would not reveal
exactly where the building was

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The mystery persisted for about 20 years.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy.


00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and he became suspicious.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this.
