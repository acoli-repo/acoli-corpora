00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
It was such a smooth ride.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Most of the cars that I drive, if I get up to 80 they start to rattle.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
I switched lanes on the highway and the driver, this chaperone, said,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
"You know, you were just going 110 miles an hour."

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious people

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
because it was just that smooth.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And if I was a billionaire, I would get one.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
(Laughter)

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
This is a completely gratuitous video I'm just going to show

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
This is Tom Cruise arriving at the "Mission: Impossible III" premiere.
