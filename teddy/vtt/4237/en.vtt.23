in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And 1947 was a legendary vintage,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
especially in the right bank of Bordeaux.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And just together, that vintage and that chateau took on this aura

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
But it's 60 years old.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
There's not much of it left.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
What there is of it left you don't know if it's real --

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
it's considered to be the most faked wine in the world.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Not that many people are looking to pop open

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
their one remaining bottle for a journalist.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So, I'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these.
