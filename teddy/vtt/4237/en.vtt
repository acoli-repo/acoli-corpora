I'm just going to play a brief video clip.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Video:

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
On the fifth of December 1985, a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was sold

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
for 105,000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The buyer

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
was Kip Forbes,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The original owner of the bottle turned out to be

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century.
