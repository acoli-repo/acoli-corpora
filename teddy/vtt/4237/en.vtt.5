00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
(Laughter)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This was the first one.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
It may come from Wagyu cattle,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but it's not from the original, Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
There are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, Cut, in Los Angeles.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I went there, and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And it arrived, and it was tiny. 



00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And I was outraged.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It was like, 160 dollars for this?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And then I took a bite,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and I wished that it was tinier, because Kobe beef is so rich.
