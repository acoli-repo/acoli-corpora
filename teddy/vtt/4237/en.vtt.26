00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And I wasn't that impressed.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And I don't -- call my palate a philistine palate --

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
so it doesn't necessarily mean something that I wasn't impressed,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
but I was not the only one there who had that reaction.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And it wasn't just to that wine.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Any one of the wines served at this tasting,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
if I'd been served it at a dinner party, it would have been, you know,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
the wine experience of my lifetime, and incredibly memorable.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
But drinking 60 great wines over three days,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
they all just blurred together,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
and it became almost a grueling experience.
