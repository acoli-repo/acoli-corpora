00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that he had made this incredible discovery.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and happened upon this hidden cache of wines --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson. 1787, 1784.
