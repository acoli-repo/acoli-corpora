00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I became increasingly, kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
you know, why do people spend these crazy amounts of money,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
not only on wine but on lots of things,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and are they living a better life than me?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So, I decided to embark on a quest. 



00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I decided to sample the very best, or most expensive, or most coveted item

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
in about a dozen categories,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
which was a very grueling quest, 
as you can imagine.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
(Laughter)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This was the first one.
