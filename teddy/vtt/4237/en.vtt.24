00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So, I'd about given up trying to get my hands on one of these.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I'd put out feelers to retailers, to auctioneers,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
and it was coming up empty.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Bipin Desai is a U.C. Riverside theoretical physicist

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and he said, "I've got a tasting coming up

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
where we're going to serve the '47 Cheval Blanc."

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And it was going to be a double vertical --

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
it was going to be 30 vintages of Cheval Blanc,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
and 30 vintages of Yquem.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And it was an invitation you do not refuse.


00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I went.
