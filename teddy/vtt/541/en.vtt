On Tuesday, January 16, 1996,

00:00:05.737 --> 00:00:09.150
I walked into the office of the president

00:00:09.174 --> 00:00:12.202
as head of state
of the Republic of Sierra Leone.

00:00:13.905 --> 00:00:15.633
I had not been elected.

00:00:16.906 --> 00:00:18.876
Four years earlier,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.300
I was one of 30 heavily armed
military officers,

00:00:23.324 --> 00:00:25.188
all in our 20s,

00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:27.587
who had driven from the war front

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:30.603
into the capital city, Freetown.
