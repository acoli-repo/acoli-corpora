fiery-hearted soul for companionship.

00:01:31.773 --> 00:01:34.403
Pandora brimmed with excitement 
at life on earth.

00:01:34.403 --> 00:01:37.743
She was also easily distracted 
and could be impatient,

00:01:37.743 --> 00:01:42.073
given her thirst for knowledge and desire
to question her surroundings.

00:01:42.073 --> 00:01:45.568
Often, her mind wandered to the contents 
of the sealed box.

00:01:45.568 --> 00:01:49.784
What treasure was so great it could never 
be seen by human eyes,

00:01:49.784 --> 00:01:51.864

Her fingers itched to pry it open.

00:01:54.244 --> 00:01:57.234
Sometimes she was convinced 
she heard voices whispering

00:01:57.234 --> 00:01:59.334
and the contents rattling around inside,

00:01:59.334 --> 00:02:00.944
as if straining to be free.
