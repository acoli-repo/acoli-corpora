00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:08.055
Curiosity:

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:09.863
a blessing, or a curse?

00:00:09.863 --> 00:00:11.603
The paradoxical nature of this trait

00:00:11.603 --> 00:00:13.553
was personified for the ancient Greeks

00:00:13.553 --> 00:00:15.913
in the mythical figure of Pandora.

00:00:15.913 --> 00:00:17.033
According to legend,

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:18.743
she was the first mortal woman,

00:00:18.743 --> 00:00:23.413
whose blazing curiosity set a chain 
of earth-shattering events in motion.

00:00:23.413 --> 00:00:27.076
Pandora was breathed into being 
by Hephaestus, God of fire,

00:00:27.076 --> 00:00:31.266
who enlisted the help of his divine 
companions to make her extraordinary.
