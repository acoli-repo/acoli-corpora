and screwed tightly shut.

00:01:00.792 --> 00:01:04.802
But the contents, Zeus told her, 
were not for mortal eyes.

00:01:04.802 --> 00:01:08.592
She was not to open the box 
under any circumstance.

00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:13.313
On earth, Pandora met and fell in love 
with Epimetheus, a talented titan

00:01:13.313 --> 00:01:17.093
who had been given the task 
of designing the natural world by Zeus.

00:01:17.093 --> 00:01:19.763
He had worked alongside 
his brother Prometheus,

00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:21.503
who created the first humans

00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:24.603
but was eternally punished 
for giving them fire.

00:01:24.603 --> 00:01:27.103
Epimetheus missed his brother desperately,

00:01:27.103 --> 00:01:31.773
but in Pandora he found another 
fiery-hearted soul for companionship.
