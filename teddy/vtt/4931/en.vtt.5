00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:30.339
But at the first crack of the lid, 
the box burst open.

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:32.309
Monstrous creatures and horrendous sounds

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:36.639
rushed out in a cloud of smoke and swirled
around her, screeching and cackling.

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:37.629
Filled with terror,

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.309
Pandora clawed desperately at the air 
to direct them back into their prison.

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:46.222
But the creatures surged out 
in a gruesome cloud.

00:02:46.226 --> 00:02:49.806
She felt a wave of foreboding 
as they billowed away.

00:02:49.806 --> 00:02:51.826
Zeus had used the box as a vessel

00:02:51.826 --> 00:02:55.176
for all the forces of evil 
and suffering he’d created –

00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:56.276
and once released,

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:58.196
they were uncontainable.

00:02:58.196 --> 00:02:59.296
As she wept,


00:02:59.296 --> 00:03:03.266
Pandora became aware of a sound echoing 
from within the box.
