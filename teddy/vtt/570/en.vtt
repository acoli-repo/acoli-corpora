00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.434
My first job out of college
was as an academic researcher

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:08.809
at one of the largest juvenile
detention centers in the country.

00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:10.934
And every day I would drive
to this building

00:00:10.958 --> 00:00:12.393
on the West Side of Chicago,

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:14.226
go through the security checkpoint

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.226
and walk down these brown, brick hallways
as I made my way down to the basement

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.768
to observe the intake process.

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:25.018
The kids coming in
were about 10 to 16 years old,

00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:27.143
usually always black and brown,

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:31.601
most likely from the same impoverished
South and West Sides of Chicago.
