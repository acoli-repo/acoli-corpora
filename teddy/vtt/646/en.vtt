00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:03.317
(Imitates fishing cat)

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:08.135
That's my impersonation of a fishing cat,

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:11.412
which actually sounds more like this.

00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:15.323
(Prerecorded fishing cat sounds)

00:00:17.228 --> 00:00:20.736
It's a cat that loves water,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.228
loves to fish,

00:00:22.252 --> 00:00:27.529
and lives in some of the most unique
and valuable ecosystems on earth:

00:00:27.553 --> 00:00:31.629
the wetlands and mangrove forests
of South and Southeast Asia.
