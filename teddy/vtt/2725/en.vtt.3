00:01:28.994 --> 00:01:31.427
We included heterosexual couples,

00:01:32.055 --> 00:01:35.927
where the man for some reason
did not have good-quality sperm,

00:01:36.435 --> 00:01:41.553
and lesbian couples who obviously
needed to find sperm elsewhere.

00:01:42.996 --> 00:01:45.194
We also included children.

00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:48.361
I wanted to know

00:01:48.385 --> 00:01:53.018
how those children define concepts
like parenthood and family.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.951
In fact, that is what I asked them,

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.698
only not in that way.
