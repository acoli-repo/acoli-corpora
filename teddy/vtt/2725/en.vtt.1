What words to use?

Sperm donors are often referred
to as "biological fathers,"

00:00:37.407 --> 00:00:40.406
but should we really
be using the word "father?"

00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:44.248
As a philosopher and social scientist,

00:00:44.272 --> 00:00:48.494
I have been studying these questions
about the concept of parenthood.

00:00:49.088 --> 00:00:52.116
But today, I will talk to you
about what I learned

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.280
from talking to parents and children.

00:00:55.377 --> 00:00:59.731
I will show you that they know
what matters most in a family,

00:00:59.755 --> 00:01:02.286
even though their family
looks a little different.
