We will say, "No, it comes from cows,"

00:09:06.969 --> 00:09:08.725

00:09:08.749 --> 00:09:10.972
and the way the milk ends up in the shop.

00:09:11.806 --> 00:09:13.353
We will not say,

00:09:14.102 --> 00:09:17.710
"No, milk is not made in a factory."

00:09:20.042 --> 00:09:22.472

00:09:27.445 --> 00:09:29.837
"I asked my parents loads of questions,

00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:31.670
but they acted really weird.
