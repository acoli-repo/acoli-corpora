00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:01.852
to watch a vet inseminate cows.

00:05:03.656 --> 00:05:05.027
And why not?

00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:07.491
It's their way of explaining;

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:10.541
their do-it-yourself
with family narratives.

00:05:10.981 --> 00:05:12.161
DIY.

00:05:12.533 --> 00:05:14.901
And we had another couple
who made books --

00:05:14.925 --> 00:05:16.380
a book for each child.

00:05:16.752 --> 00:05:18.274
They were really works of art

00:05:18.298 --> 00:05:21.774
containing their thoughts and feelings
throughout the treatment.

00:05:22.192 --> 00:05:24.806
They even had the hospital
parking tickets in there.

00:05:25.553 --> 00:05:27.174
So it is DIY:

00:05:27.198 --> 00:05:29.580
finding ways, words and images

00:05:29.604 --> 00:05:32.354
to tell your family story to your child.
