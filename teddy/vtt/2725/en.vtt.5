00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:30.551
because I want to hear that from them.

00:02:32.362 --> 00:02:33.694
I asked them:

00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:37.828
What would your family look like
if it were an apple tree?

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.489
And they could take a paper apple
for everyone who, in their view,

00:02:42.513 --> 00:02:44.120
was a member of the family,

00:02:44.144 --> 00:02:47.318
write a name on it
and hang it wherever they wanted.

00:02:47.342 --> 00:02:48.912
And I would ask questions.

00:02:50.153 --> 00:02:53.278
Most children started
with a parent or a sibling.

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.970
One started with "Boxer,"

00:02:56.667 --> 00:02:59.175
the dead dog of his grandparents.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.688
At this point, none of the children
started mentioning the donor.
