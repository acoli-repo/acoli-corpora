00:08:28.854 --> 00:08:30.653
and the advice they were given,

00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:31.840
we discussed that.

00:08:31.864 --> 00:08:35.428
And we saw one lesbian couple who said,

00:08:36.627 --> 00:08:38.231
"When our son asks us,

00:08:38.255 --> 00:08:40.304
'Do I have a dad?'

00:08:41.482 --> 00:08:44.294
we will say 'No, you do not have a dad.'

00:08:44.839 --> 00:08:47.907
But we will say nothing more,
not unless he asks,

00:08:48.287 --> 00:08:50.315
because he might not be ready for that.

00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:51.839
The counselor said so."

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.520
Well.

00:08:55.091 --> 00:08:56.993
I don't know; that's quite different

00:08:57.017 --> 00:08:59.710
from how we respond
to children's questions.
