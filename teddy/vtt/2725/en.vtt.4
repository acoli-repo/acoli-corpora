00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:04.096
I drew an apple tree instead.

00:02:05.056 --> 00:02:08.403
This way, I could ask abstract,
philosophical questions

00:02:08.427 --> 00:02:11.700
in a way that did not make them run off.

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:14.984
So as you can see,

00:02:15.008 --> 00:02:16.550
the apple tree is empty.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.243
And that illustrates my research approach.

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.942
By designing techniques like this,

00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:27.739
I can bring as little meaning and content
as possible to the interview,

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:30.551
because I want to hear that from them.
