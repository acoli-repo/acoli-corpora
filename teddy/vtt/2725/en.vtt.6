00:03:04.465 --> 00:03:08.803
So, I asked them about their birth story.

00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:11.183
I said, "Before you were born,

00:03:11.207 --> 00:03:13.570
it was just your mom and dad,

00:03:13.594 --> 00:03:14.872
or mom and mommy.

00:03:15.421 --> 00:03:18.478
Can you tell me how you came
into the family?"

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:20.721
And they explained.

00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:22.808
One said,

00:03:23.691 --> 00:03:26.164
"My parents did not have good seeds,

00:03:26.865 --> 00:03:30.887
but there are friendly men out there
who have spare seeds.
