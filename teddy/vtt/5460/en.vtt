00:00:00.141 --> 00:00:01.452
I was not one of those kids

00:00:01.476 --> 00:00:04.649
that knew exactly what they wanted to do
when they were growing up.

00:00:04.673 --> 00:00:06.307
In the last 15 years of my career,

00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:09.105
I've been an English teacher,
attorney, video game creator

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:10.717
and now, a toilet paper salesman,

00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:13.060
selling millions of rolls
of toilet paper a year.

00:00:16.428 --> 00:00:19.739
Life is about finding the intersection
of what you really, really love

00:00:19.763 --> 00:00:21.680
with what you're really, really good at.

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:24.546
As simple as it sounds,
it's really not that easy to find.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.575
After a brief stint as an English teacher,

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.134
I went to law school and ended up
becoming an attorney

00:00:29.158 --> 00:00:31.073
at a big law firm here in New York City.
