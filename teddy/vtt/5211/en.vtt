00:00:06.538 --> 00:00:10.621
Imagine you’re at a football game
when this obnoxious guy sits next to you.

00:00:10.663 --> 00:00:13.121
He’s loud, 
he spills his drink on you,

00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:14.788
and he makes fun of your team.

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.288
Days later, you're walking in the park

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.454
when suddenly it starts to pour rain.

00:00:20.496 --> 00:00:23.204
Who should show up at your side
to offer you an umbrella?

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:25.538
The same guy from the football game.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.996
Do you change your mind about him
based on this second encounter,

00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:31.913
or do you go with your first impression
and write him off?
