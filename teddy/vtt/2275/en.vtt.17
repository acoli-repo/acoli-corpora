WEBVTT

00:08:28.154 --> 00:08:30.882
is not dependent on the zeroes
at the ends of our checks

00:08:30.906 --> 00:08:33.898
but the capacity within our hearts
to show up for our families,

00:08:33.922 --> 00:08:36.286
for the people we love,
for our little ones.

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:39.776
Being a father is not only
a responsibility, it's an opportunity.

00:08:40.563 --> 00:08:44.326
This is for Dwain, this is for Kareem
"Buc" Drayton, this is for Biggs,

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.819
this is for Boola, this is for Tyron,

00:08:46.843 --> 00:08:50.432
this is for all the black fathers who
are showing up on a day-to-day basis.

00:08:50.456 --> 00:08:54.066
This is for Charles Lorenzo Daniels,
my father, who didn't have the language

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.737
or the tools to show up
in the ways that he wanted to.

00:08:58.245 --> 00:08:59.444
Thank you.

00:08:59.865 --> 00:09:01.245
My name is Joel.
