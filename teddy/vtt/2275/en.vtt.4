00:01:59.164 --> 00:02:03.310
a woman who would have benefited greatly
from having a secure and stable partner

00:02:03.334 --> 00:02:04.778
as a co-parent.

00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:07.861
So I vowed whenever I got married,

00:02:07.885 --> 00:02:10.341
my boo and I would be together forever.

00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:12.136
You know? (Laughs)

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.514
We'd share the same bed and home,

00:02:14.538 --> 00:02:18.048
we'd sleep under the same covers,
we'd argue at IKEA -- normal stuff.

00:02:18.072 --> 00:02:19.373
(Laughter)

00:02:19.963 --> 00:02:21.953
My partner would feel seen and loved,

00:02:21.977 --> 00:02:24.856
and our children would grow up
in a two-parent household.

00:02:25.784 --> 00:02:30.453
However, things rarely ever
end up how we plan them.
