That hood would be Creston Avenue,
188th in the Bronx.

00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:34.562
And for -- one person, that's what's up.

00:01:34.586 --> 00:01:35.978
(Laughter)

00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:38.195
Appreciate that.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.686
For a lot of us in that hood,

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.445
there was only one person
you could already turn to

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.105
for food, shelter, warmth,
love, discipline:

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:49.451
our mothers.

00:01:50.064 --> 00:01:52.170
My mother, who I playfully call "Linda T,"

00:01:52.194 --> 00:01:53.770
was my first example of real love

00:01:53.794 --> 00:01:56.788
and what showing up
as a healthy co-parent looked like.

00:01:56.812 --> 00:01:59.140
She was a strong,
determined single mother,

00:01:59.164 --> 00:02:03.310
a woman who would have benefited greatly
from having a secure and stable partner
