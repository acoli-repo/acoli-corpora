00:03:57.805 --> 00:04:00.835
and Lilah is now in pre-K.

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.269
She loves gummies,

00:04:02.293 --> 00:04:05.747
and she says things like,
"My heart is filled with love."

00:04:07.172 --> 00:04:10.387
She's the most loving, compassionate,
empathetic human being I know,

00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:13.037
and the reason I get to tell you
all of this is because

00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:15.163
she's back in the Bronx with her mother.

00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:18.398
You see, this is co-parenting,

00:04:18.422 --> 00:04:19.586
and in an ideal world,

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.208
my mother would have had a co-parent, too.

00:04:22.232 --> 00:04:23.598
She would have had support,

00:04:23.622 --> 00:04:26.147
someone to show up
and give her a break, a time off.

00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:29.006
In an ideal world,
every parent is a co-parent.
