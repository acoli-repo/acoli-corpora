(Applause)

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.007
Co-parenting makes the space
possible for everybody.

00:06:06.695 --> 00:06:08.210
As a co-parent,

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:10.565
the time I've gotten
to share and spend with Lilah

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:11.914
is time I appreciate,

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:15.967
the time that has allowed me
to be fully present for my child,

00:06:15.991 --> 00:06:19.348
removing the notion that the emotional
labor required to raise a child

00:06:19.372 --> 00:06:21.172
is a woman's work.

00:06:21.196 --> 00:06:23.780
As a co-parent, Lilah and I
have built snowmen,

00:06:23.804 --> 00:06:25.280
we've played with acorns,

00:06:25.304 --> 00:06:28.489
we've rapped to the soundtrack of "Moana,"
I know you have, too.

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:29.815
(Laughter)

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:33.109
She's sat with me while I've led workshops
at Columbia University,
