00:07:55.881 --> 00:08:00.076
I want more fathers to embrace
co-parenting as a model

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.784
for a better tomorrow,
a better today for ourselves,

00:08:02.808 --> 00:08:05.991
for our co-parenting partners,
for our families, for our community.

00:08:06.015 --> 00:08:08.505
I want more fathers talking
about fatherhood openly,

00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:10.732
candidly, honestly, lovingly.

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:11.907
Right?

00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:14.954
I want more people to recognize
that black fathers in particular

00:08:14.978 --> 00:08:17.592
are more than the court system,
more than child support

00:08:17.616 --> 00:08:20.067
and more than what the media
might portray us to be.

00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:22.908
(Applause)

00:08:24.843 --> 00:08:26.954
Our role as fathers, our role as parents,

00:08:26.978 --> 00:08:28.130
our value as parents

00:08:28.154 --> 00:08:30.882
is not dependent on the zeroes
at the ends of our checks
