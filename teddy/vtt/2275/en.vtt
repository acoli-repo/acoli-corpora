My name is Joel,

00:00:03.231 --> 00:00:05.167
and I'm a co-parent.

00:00:06.238 --> 00:00:08.852
So, growing up, I never heard
the term "co-parent."

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:11.687
I heard a lot of other things, though,

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:14.918
for starters, "absentee father,"

00:00:14.942 --> 00:00:17.089
"sperm donor" --

00:00:17.113 --> 00:00:19.278
that's a good one --

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:20.481
"deadbeat dad"

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:22.617
and, my personal favorite, "baby daddy."

00:00:24.126 --> 00:00:26.157
"Baby daddy," for those not in the know,

00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:29.369
refers to an individual
who helps to conceive a child

00:00:29.393 --> 00:00:31.005
but does little else.
