Co-parenting says that while parenting
may involve sacrifices, yes,

00:07:31.769 --> 00:07:35.942
the weight of that sacrifice
is not solely resting on one parent alone.

00:07:36.808 --> 00:07:38.477
No matter your relational dynamic,

00:07:38.501 --> 00:07:40.690
no matter how you identify
as a human being --

00:07:40.714 --> 00:07:42.089
he, she, they, ze --

00:07:42.113 --> 00:07:45.179
co-parenting says we can create
space and equity,

00:07:46.096 --> 00:07:49.003
better communication, empathy,
I hear you, I see you,

00:07:49.027 --> 00:07:51.866

in ways that benefits our family?

00:07:53.443 --> 00:07:54.619
My goal:

00:07:55.881 --> 00:08:00.076
I want more fathers to embrace
co-parenting as a model
