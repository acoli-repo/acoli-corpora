00:02:57.753 --> 00:03:00.322
I never wanted the stigma or label

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:03.864
of what some identified
as the stereotypical "black father."

00:03:03.888 --> 00:03:09.359
So: absentee, confrontational,
combative, not present.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.249
It took a lot of work, time,
energy and effort

00:03:14.273 --> 00:03:16.419
for us to finally realize

00:03:16.443 --> 00:03:20.675
that maybe co-parenting for us
didn't need to mean a shared household

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.071
and wedding bells,

00:03:22.095 --> 00:03:24.908
that maybe, just maybe,

00:03:24.932 --> 00:03:26.577
the way we showed up as co-parents

00:03:26.601 --> 00:03:30.453
lay not only in the layered nuances
of our partnership
