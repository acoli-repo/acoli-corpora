However, things rarely ever
end up how we plan them.

00:02:31.523 --> 00:02:35.299
Our daughter Lilah has never known
a household with both of her parents

00:02:35.323 --> 00:02:37.134
living together under one roof.

00:02:37.727 --> 00:02:40.157
Her mother and I were never married.

00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:43.830

Where was I going wrong?

00:02:57.753 --> 00:03:00.322
I never wanted the stigma or label
