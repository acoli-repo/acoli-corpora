00:05:28.048 --> 00:05:31.227
Far too often, those who identify
as mothers and as women

00:05:31.251 --> 00:05:34.970
have to sacrifice their dreams
in order to appease the standard.

00:05:35.644 --> 00:05:37.398
They have to sacrifice their dreams

00:05:37.422 --> 00:05:41.904
in order to ensure that motherhood
takes precedence over all else.

00:05:41.928 --> 00:05:45.276
And I'm not here to say that it doesn't,
but what I am here to say is,

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.538
as equal partners and co-parents,
it is our duty to ensure

00:05:49.562 --> 00:05:52.697
that our co-parenting partners
don't have to put their passions,

00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:54.240
their pursuits and their dreams

00:05:54.264 --> 00:05:55.430
to the back burner

00:05:55.454 --> 00:05:58.352
just because we're too self-absorbed
to show up as allies.

00:05:58.376 --> 00:06:01.606
