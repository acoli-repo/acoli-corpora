00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:33.109
She's sat with me while I've led workshops
at Columbia University,

00:06:33.133 --> 00:06:36.368
when I talk about the intersections
of poetry, hip-hop and theater.

00:06:36.392 --> 00:06:38.801
We get to talk about
her emotions and her feelings

00:06:38.825 --> 00:06:40.772
because we have exclusive time together,

00:06:40.796 --> 00:06:42.263
and that time is planned time,

00:06:42.287 --> 00:06:45.428
it's organized around not just
my schedule but her mother's.

00:06:45.452 --> 00:06:48.715
Both of us, as co-parents,
have unique parenting styles.

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:52.326
And we may argue at times,

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.450
but what we can always agree on
is how to raise a human --

00:06:57.361 --> 00:06:58.660
our human.
