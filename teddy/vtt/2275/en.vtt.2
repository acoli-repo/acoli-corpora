00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:02.389
was having complex conversations
about the role fathers played

00:01:02.413 --> 00:01:03.834
in that conversation, right?

00:01:03.858 --> 00:01:07.776
A more balanced, open,
loving approach to parenting

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.417
was not something we were discussing
within our social circles.

00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:13.487
A majority of the time,

00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:16.954
the fathers I knew of growing up
were barely present

00:01:16.978 --> 00:01:19.271
or just completely nonexistent.

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:22.223
"Co-parent" wasn't a term I heard or saw

00:01:22.247 --> 00:01:24.271
where I grew up, where I came from.

00:01:25.236 --> 00:01:26.423
I come from the hood.

00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:30.363
That hood would be Creston Avenue,
188th in the Bronx.
