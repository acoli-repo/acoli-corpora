A few years ago, I sailed on a ship
that comes from an earlier era,

00:00:04.542 --> 00:00:07.503
when moving goods by sea
didn't mean polluting the planet.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.048
Our voyage to the Caribbean
was eye-opening,

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:13.509
and not just because I learned
that apparently, Iâ€™m incurably seasick.

00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:14.594
(Laughter)

00:00:14.594 --> 00:00:15.845
I also saw what it's like

00:00:15.887 --> 00:00:18.473
when you take away the diesel fumes
and the black smoke

00:00:18.514 --> 00:00:20.600
that spew from today's
freighters and ports.

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:22.935
Instead, our vessel smelled
like fresh sea breeze

00:00:22.977 --> 00:00:24.812
and the bags of cardamom we carried

00:00:24.854 --> 00:00:27.648
and all that camomile tea I was chugging.

00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:31.611
Nearly every modern cargo ship
relies on highly polluting fossil fuels.
