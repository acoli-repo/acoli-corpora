00:03:58.783 --> 00:04:01.519
well, I was a little bit embarrassed

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.327
to bring people down into my studio

00:04:03.327 --> 00:04:06.387
and show them that I spent my days in a basement

00:04:06.387 --> 00:04:09.523
putting paint on toast.

00:04:09.523 --> 00:04:11.382
It just seemed like it made more sense

00:04:11.382 --> 00:04:14.611
to practice by painting on myself.

00:04:14.611 --> 00:04:17.537
One of my favorite models actually ended up being

00:04:17.537 --> 00:04:19.321

00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:21.600
who not only didn't mind sitting still

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.149
and getting the paint in his ears,

00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:26.798
but he also didn't really have much embarrassment

00:04:26.798 --> 00:04:28.789
about being taken out into very public places

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.401
for exhibition,
