00:01:28.696 --> 00:01:31.133
and it would be almost invisible

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.656
until the light changed, and all of a sudden

00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:36.817
my shadow would be brought to the light.

00:01:36.817 --> 00:01:39.880
I wanted to think about what else I could put shadows on,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.160
and I thought of my friend Bernie.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.390
But I didn't just want to paint the shadows.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.296
I also wanted to paint the highlights

00:01:47.296 --> 00:01:50.586
and create a mapping on his body in greyscale.

00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:54.307
I had a very specific vision of what this would look like,

00:01:54.307 --> 00:01:56.480
and as I was painting him,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.999
I made sure to follow that very closely.

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:01.880
But something kept on flickering before my eyes.
