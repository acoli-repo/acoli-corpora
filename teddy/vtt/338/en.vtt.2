00:00:57.617 --> 00:01:01.288
of one of my three-dimensional paintings.

00:01:01.288 --> 00:01:03.408
You might be wondering how I came up with this idea

00:01:03.408 --> 00:01:05.672
of turning people into paintings.

00:01:05.672 --> 00:01:08.466
But originally, this had nothing to do

00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.680
with either people or paint.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.072
It was about shadows.

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:15.692
I was fascinated with the absence of light,

00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:19.143
and I wanted to find a way that I could give it materiality

00:01:19.143 --> 00:01:21.876
and pin it down before it changed.

00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:24.401
I came up with the idea of painting shadows.

00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:26.592
I loved that I could hide within this shadow

00:01:26.592 --> 00:01:28.696
my own painted version,

00:01:28.696 --> 00:01:31.133
and it would be almost invisible
