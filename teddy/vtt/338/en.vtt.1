00:00:27.553 --> 00:00:31.636
because I need to paint your ear on your ear.

00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:34.252
Everything in this scene, the person, the clothes,

00:00:34.252 --> 00:00:37.925
chairs, wall, gets covered in a mask of paint

00:00:37.925 --> 00:00:40.686
that mimics what's directly below it,

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:44.400
and in this way, I'm able to take a three-dimensional scene

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.605
and make it look like a two-dimensional painting.

00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:49.819
I can photograph it from any angle,

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:52.842
and it will still look 2D.

00:00:52.842 --> 00:00:55.855
There's no Photoshop here.

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.617
This is just a photo

00:00:57.617 --> 00:01:01.288
of one of my three-dimensional paintings.
