00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.401
for exhibition,

00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:33.720
like the Metro.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.447
I was having so much fun with this process.

00:04:37.447 --> 00:04:41.691
I was teaching myself how to paint in all these different styles,

00:04:41.691 --> 00:04:44.856
and I wanted to see what else I could do with it.

00:04:44.856 --> 00:04:47.813
I came together with a collaborator, Sheila Vand,

00:04:47.813 --> 00:04:50.121
and we had the idea of creating paintings

00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:52.838
in a more unusual surface,

00:04:52.838 --> 00:04:55.795
and that was milk.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:58.214
We got a pool. We filled it with milk.

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:01.190
We filled it with Sheila. And I began painting.
