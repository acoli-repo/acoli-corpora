00:00:00.502 --> 00:00:02.708
You may want to take a closer look.

00:00:02.708 --> 00:00:05.942
There's more to this painting than meets the eye.

00:00:05.942 --> 00:00:09.932
And yes, it's an acrylic painting of a man,

00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:12.364
but I didn't paint it on canvas.

00:00:12.364 --> 00:00:15.652
I painted it directly on top of the man.

00:00:15.652 --> 00:00:18.386
What I do in my art is I skip the canvas altogether,

00:00:18.386 --> 00:00:20.252
and if I want to paint your portrait,

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:23.892
I'm painting it on you, physically on you.

00:00:23.892 --> 00:00:25.645
That also means you're probably going to end up

00:00:25.645 --> 00:00:27.553
with an earful of paint,

00:00:27.553 --> 00:00:31.636
because I need to paint your ear on your ear.
