00:03:28.482 --> 00:03:31.325
My early canvases ended up being

00:03:31.325 --> 00:03:34.602
things that you wouldn't expect to be used as canvas,

00:03:34.602 --> 00:03:36.760
like fried food.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.884
It's nearly impossible

00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:41.670
to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.746
(Laughter)

00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:46.228
Even harder was getting paint to stick

00:03:46.228 --> 00:03:48.494
to the acid in a grapefruit.

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:51.606
It just would erase my brush strokes

00:03:51.606 --> 00:03:53.037
like invisible ink.

00:03:53.037 --> 00:03:56.681
I'd put something down, and instantly it would be gone.

00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:58.783
And if I wanted to paint on people,

00:03:58.783 --> 00:04:01.519
well, I was a little bit embarrassed
