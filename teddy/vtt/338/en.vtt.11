00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.047
Sometimes, when Sheila would lay down in the milk,

00:05:30.047 --> 00:05:32.641
it would wash all the paint off of her arms,

00:05:32.641 --> 00:05:35.795
and it might seem a little bit clumsy,

00:05:35.795 --> 00:05:38.865
but our solution would be, okay, hide your arms.

00:05:38.865 --> 00:05:41.923
And one time, she got so much milk in her hair

00:05:41.923 --> 00:05:44.801
that it just smeared all the paint off of her face.

00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:47.076
All right, well, hide your face.

00:05:47.076 --> 00:05:50.487
And we ended up with something far more elegant

00:05:50.487 --> 00:05:52.332
than we could have imagined,

00:05:52.332 --> 00:05:54.547
even though this is essentially the same solution

00:05:54.547 --> 00:05:57.918
that a frustrated kid uses when he can't draw hands,

00:05:57.918 --> 00:06:01.075
just hiding them in the pockets.
