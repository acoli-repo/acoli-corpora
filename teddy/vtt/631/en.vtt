00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to talk about

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
what we learn from conservatives.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I'm at a stage in life where I'm yearning for my old days,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so I want to confess to you

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that when I was a kid,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
indeed, I was a conservative.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I was a Young Republican, a Teenage Republican,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
a leader in the Teenage Republicans.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Indeed, I was the youngest member

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
of any delegation

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in the 1980 convention that elected Ronald Reagan

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to be the Republican nominee for president.
