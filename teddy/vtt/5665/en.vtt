00:00:01.722 --> 00:00:03.874
My son was born in January 2020,

00:00:03.898 --> 00:00:06.145
shortly before the lockdown in Paris.

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:08.212
He was never scared
of people wearing masks,

00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:09.752
because that's all he knows.

00:00:10.306 --> 00:00:14.458
My three-year-old daughter knows
how to say "gel hydro-alcoolique."

00:00:14.482 --> 00:00:17.507
That's the French word
for hydroalcoholic gel.

00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:19.841
She actually pronounces it
better than I do.

00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:22.927
But no one wants to be wearing a mask

00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:26.605
or wash their hands
with hand sanitizer every 20 seconds.

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:31.567
We're all desperately looking at R and D
to find us a solution: a vaccine.
