00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.960
all touching each other.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.816
And people were scared.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.656
They were scared of population growth

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.016
and what they called
"the population bomb" in 1968.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.240
But then, if you look
at the end of the graph,

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.840
the growth began to slow.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.096
The decade --

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.576
the '70s, the '80s,
the '90s, the noughties,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.840
and in this decade, even faster --

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.216
our population growth is slowing.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.496
Our planet is stabilizing.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.536
We are heading towards nine,
10, or 11 billion people
