00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.456
We worry about how many people there are.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.640
We worry about how you can
get away from people.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.600
But this is the map of the world
changed again to make area large,

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.136
the further away
people are from each area.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.096
So if you want to know
where to go to get away from everybody,

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.696
here's the best places to go.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.536
And every year, these areas get bigger,

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.816
because every year,
we are coming off the land globally.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.296
We are moving into the cities.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.496
We are packing in more densely.
