00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.080
We are learning about ourselves
at an incredible speed.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.800
And we're changing.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.896
A lot of change is gradual.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.416
It's accretion.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.296
We don't notice the change

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.136
because we only have short lives,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.760
70, 80, if you're lucky 90 years.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.576
This graph is showing you

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.320
the annual rate of population
growth in the world.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.056
It was very low until around about 1850,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.696
and then the rate of population growth
