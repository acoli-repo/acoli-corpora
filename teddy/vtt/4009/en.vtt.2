00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.336
a cartographer called Waldo Tobler

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.896
was drawing new maps of the planet,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.416
and these maps have now spread,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.447
and I'm going to show you one of them now.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.680
This map is a map of the world,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.136
but it's a map which looks to you

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.600
a little bit strange.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.016
It's a map in which we stretched places,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.736
so that those areas which contain
many people are drawn larger,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.696
and those areas,
like the Sahara and the Himalayas,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.200
in which there are few people,
have been shrunk away.
