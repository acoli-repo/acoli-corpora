00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.856
but most of us didn't live in cities.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.016
This is Çatalhöyük,
one of the world's first cities.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.280
At its peak 9,000 years ago,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.360
people had to walk over the roofs
of others' houses to get to their home.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.376
If you look carefully
at the map of the city,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.320
you'll see it has no streets,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.960
because streets are something we invented.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.976
The world changes.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.880
It changes by trial and error.
