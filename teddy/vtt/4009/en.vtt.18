00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.696
But here, on this image of the world,

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.600
remember we've stretched the map again.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.680
Everywhere has the same density
of people on this map.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.656
If an area doesn't have people,

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.576
we've shrunk it away

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.136
to make it disappear.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.296
So we're showing everybody

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.760
with equal prominence.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.616
Now, the lights no longer show you
where people are,

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.080
because people are everywhere.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.056
Now the lights on the map,

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.056
the lights in London,
the lights in Cairo, the lights in Tokyo,
