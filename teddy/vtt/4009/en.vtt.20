00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.496
or areas where people do,

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:07.360
but they have learned to stop
shining the light up into the sky.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.496
And if I could show you this map
animated over time,

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.096
you would see that Tokyo
has actually become darker,

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.920
because ever since the tsunami in Japan,

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.296
Japan has had to rely
on a quarter less electricity

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.320
because it turned
the nuclear power stations off.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.640
And the world didn't end.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.576
You just shone less light

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.520
up into the sky.
