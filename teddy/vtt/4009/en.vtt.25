00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.216
to waste less and consume less.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.440
This is my last map.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.736
On this map, we have taken the seas

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.560
and the oceans out.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.496
Now you are just looking

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.376
at about 7.4 billion people

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.320
with the map drawn
in proportion to those people.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.296
You're looking at over a billion in China,

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.136
and you can see the largest
city in the world in China,

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.640
but you do not know its name.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.936
You can see that India

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.040
is in the center of this world.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.936
You can see that Europe is on the edge.
