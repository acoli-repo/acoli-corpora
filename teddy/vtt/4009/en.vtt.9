00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.696
and then the rate of population growth

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.960
began to rise

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.856
so that around the time I was born,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.600
when we first saw those images
from the moon of our planet,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.000
our global population
was growing at two percent a year.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.400
If it had carried on growing
at two percent a year

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.440
for just another couple of centuries,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.816
the entire planet would be covered

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.896
with a seething mass of human bodies

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.960
all touching each other.
