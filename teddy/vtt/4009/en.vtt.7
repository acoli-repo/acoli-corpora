Again, the underlying map
is the map of world population,

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.216
but over it, you're seeing arrows
showing how we spread out of Africa

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.016
with dates showing you
where we think we arrived

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.800
at particular times.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.536
I have to redraw this map
every few months,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.536
because somebody makes a discovery
that a particular date was wrong.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.080
We are learning about ourselves
at an incredible speed.
