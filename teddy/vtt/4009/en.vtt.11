00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.536
We are heading towards nine,
10, or 11 billion people

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.800
by the end of the century.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.736
Within that change, you can see tumult.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.576
You can see the Second World War.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.776
You can see the pandemic
in 1918 from influenza.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.680
You can see the great Chinese famine.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.696
These are the events
we tend to concentrate on.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.656
We tend to concentrate
on the terrible events in the news.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.336
We don't tend to concentrate
on the gradual change

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.000
and the good news stories.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.176
We worry about people.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.456
We worry about how many people there are.
