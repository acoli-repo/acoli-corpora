00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.296
a ship which was taking
so many containers of goods

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.176
that when they were unloaded,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.440
if the lorries had all gone in convoy,
they would have been 100 kilometers long.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.416
This is how our world is now connected.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.416
This is the quantity of stuff
we are now moving around the world,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.176
just on one ship, on one voyage,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.400
in five weeks.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.840
We've lived in cities
for a very long time,

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.856
but most of us didn't live in cities.
