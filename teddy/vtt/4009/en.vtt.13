00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.496
We are packing in more densely.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.136
There are wolves again in Europe,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.080
and the wolves are moving west
across the continent.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.600
Our world is changing.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.240
You have worries.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.576
This is a map showing
where the water falls on our planet.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.296
We now know that.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.096
And you can look at where Çatalhöyük was,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.696
where three continents meet,
Africa, Asia, and Europe,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.696
and you can see there are
a large number of people living there

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.296
in areas with very little water.
