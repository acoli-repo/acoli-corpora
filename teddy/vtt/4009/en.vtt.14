00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.296
in areas with very little water.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.016
And you can see areas in which
there is a great deal of rainfall as well.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.200
And we can get a bit more sophisticated.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.816
Instead of making
the map be shaped by people,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.056
we can shape the map by water,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.936
and then we can change it every month

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.616
to show the amount of water

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.840
falling on every small part of the globe.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.216
And you see the monsoons
moving around the planet,

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.840
and the planet almost appears
to have a heartbeat.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.240
And all of this only became possible
