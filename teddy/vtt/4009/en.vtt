I'd like you to imagine the world anew.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.016
I'd like to show you some maps,

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.776
which have been drawn by Ben Hennig,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.496
of the planet in a way

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.600
that most of you will never
have seen the planet depicted before.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.560
Here's an image
that you're very familiar with.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.536
I'm old enough that I was actually born
before we saw this image.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.136
Apparently some of my first words
were "moona, moona,"

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.256
but I think that's my mom
having a particular fantasy
