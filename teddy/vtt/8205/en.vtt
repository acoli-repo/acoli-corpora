00:00:07.128 --> 00:00:09.839
The year is 1656.

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.051
Your body is wracked 
by violent chills.

00:00:13.217 --> 00:00:17.096
Your head pounds,
your muscles are too weak to sit up,

00:00:17.096 --> 00:00:19.807
and you feel like rancid, hard-boiled eggs

00:00:19.807 --> 00:00:22.894
are squeezing out of your neck 
and armpits.

00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:27.607
In your feverish state, you see 
a strange-looking man approach,

00:00:27.607 --> 00:00:33.071
his face obscured by a beak-like mask,
his body covered from head to toe.
