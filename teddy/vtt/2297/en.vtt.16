to try and get some documents
from them, they went crazy

00:08:01.003 --> 00:08:03.350
because I had all this stuff
that they don't have,

00:08:03.374 --> 00:08:08.419
and NASA purchased 1,759 pages
of this stuff from me.

00:08:08.443 --> 00:08:11.126
So that's the state we're at;
it's not very good.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.412
(Laughter)

00:08:12.436 --> 00:08:14.436
(Applause)
