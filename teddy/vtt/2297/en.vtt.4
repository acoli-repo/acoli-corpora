00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.685
It would take two or three thousand bombs.

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.686
The people who worked on it
were a lot of the Los Alamos people

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.435
who had done the hydrogen bomb work.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.586
It was the first project funded by ARPA.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.473
That's the contract where ARPA
gave the first million dollars

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:11.744
to get this thing started.

00:02:11.768 --> 00:02:15.531
"Spaceship project officially begun.
Job waiting for you. Dyson."

00:02:15.555 --> 00:02:16.976
That's July '58.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.234
Two days later, the space traveler's
manifesto explaining why --

00:02:21.258 --> 00:02:24.136
just like we heard yesterday --
why we need to go into space:

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.327
"... trips to satellites
of the outer planets.

00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:28.071
August 20, 1958."

00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:32.452
These are the statistics of what would be
the good places to go and stop.
