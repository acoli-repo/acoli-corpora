That's my dad in the sport coat there,
holding the briefcase.

00:04:30.359 --> 00:04:32.487
So, they had a lot of fun doing this.

00:04:32.511 --> 00:04:33.996
But no children were allowed;

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.623
my dad could tell me he was building
a spaceship and going to go to Saturn,

00:04:37.647 --> 00:04:39.765
but he could not say
anything more about it.

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.397
So all my life I have wanted
to find this stuff out,

00:04:42.421 --> 00:04:45.373
and spent the last four years
tracking these old guys down.

00:04:45.397 --> 00:04:46.924
These are stills from the video.

00:04:46.948 --> 00:04:49.727
Jeff Bezos kindly, yesterday,
said he'll put this video up

00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:52.143
on the Amazon site --
some little clip of it.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:53.175
(Applause)

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:54.456
So, thanks to him.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.076
They got quite serious
about the engineering of this.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.121
The size of that mass, for us,

00:04:59.145 --> 00:05:03.073
is really large technology in a way
we're never going to go back to.
