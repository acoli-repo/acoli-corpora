The guys in La Jolla said,
"We've got to get started now."

00:04:01.126 --> 00:04:03.526
They built a high-explosive
propelled model.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.272
These are stills from
film footage that was saved

00:04:07.296 --> 00:04:09.851
by someone who was supposed
to destroy it but didn't,

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:12.313
and kept it in their basement
for the last 40 years.

00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:14.253
So, these are three-pound charges of C4;

00:04:14.277 --> 00:04:16.950
that's about 10 times
what the guy had in his shoes.

00:04:16.974 --> 00:04:18.154
(Laughter)

00:04:18.178 --> 00:04:19.600
This is Ed Day putting --

00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:22.873
So each of these coffee cans
has three pounds of C4 in it.

00:04:22.897 --> 00:04:27.033
They're building a system that ejects
these at quarter-second intervals.

00:04:27.057 --> 00:04:30.335
That's my dad in the sport coat there,
holding the briefcase.
