WEBVTT

00:04:59.145 --> 00:05:03.073
is really large technology in a way
we're never going to go back to.

00:05:03.097 --> 00:05:04.851
If you saw the 1959 --

00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:07.735
this is what it would feel
like in the passenger compartment;

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.132
that's acceleration profile.

00:05:09.156 --> 00:05:10.164
(Laughter)

00:05:10.188 --> 00:05:14.041
And pulse-system yield:
we're looking at 20-kiloton yield

00:05:14.065 --> 00:05:16.376
for an effective thrust
of 10 million newtons.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.037
Well, here we have a little problem,
the radiation doses at the crew station:

00:05:20.061 --> 00:05:22.808
700 rads per shot.

00:05:22.832 --> 00:05:24.539
(Laughter)

00:05:24.563 --> 00:05:26.316
Fission yields during development:

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.646
they were hoping to get
clean bombs; they didn't.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.926
Eyeburn: this is what happens
to the people in Miami who are looking up.
