00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:30.704
Ted Taylor, who led the project,
was going to take his children.

00:01:30.728 --> 00:01:32.855
My father was not going
to take his children,

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:36.518
that was one of the reasons we sort
of had a falling out for a few years.

00:01:36.542 --> 00:01:40.252
(Laughter)

00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:42.776
The project began in '57
at General Atomics there,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.742
that's right on the coast at La Jolla.

00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:47.839
Look at that central building
right in the middle of the picture.

00:01:47.863 --> 00:01:51.199
That's the 130-foot diameter library.

00:01:51.223 --> 00:01:54.176
That is exactly the size
of the base of the spaceship.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.622
So put that library
at the bottom of that ship --

00:01:56.646 --> 00:01:58.615
that's how big the thing was going to be.

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.685
It would take two or three thousand bombs.
