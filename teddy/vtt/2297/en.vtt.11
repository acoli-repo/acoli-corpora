00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.926
Eyeburn: this is what happens
to the people in Miami who are looking up.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.374
(Laughter)

00:05:35.398 --> 00:05:38.953
Personnel compartment noise: that's
not too bad; it's very low frequencies,

00:05:38.977 --> 00:05:40.795
it's basically like these sub-woofers.

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.453
And now we have ground-hazard assessments
when you have a blow-up on the pad.

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:47.405
Finally, at the very end in 1964,
NASA steps in and says,

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:50.998
"OK, we'll support a feasibility study
for a small version

00:05:51.022 --> 00:05:55.122
that could be launched with Saturn Vs
in sections and pieced together."

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:57.171
So this is what NASA did,

00:05:57.195 --> 00:06:02.146
getting an eight-man version
that would go to Mars.
