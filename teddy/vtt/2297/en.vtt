00:00:00.484 --> 00:00:01.635
I'm a historian.

00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:05.752
Steve told us about the future
of little technology;

00:00:05.776 --> 00:00:09.813
I'm going to show you some
of the past of big technology.

00:00:09.837 --> 00:00:15.273
This was a project to build a 4,000-ton
nuclear bomb-propelled spaceship

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:17.845
and go to Saturn and Jupiter.

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.540
This took place in my childhood, 1957-65.

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:23.843
It was deeply classified.

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:27.939
I'm going to show you some stuff
that not only has not been declassified,

00:00:27.963 --> 00:00:30.469
but has now been reclassified.
