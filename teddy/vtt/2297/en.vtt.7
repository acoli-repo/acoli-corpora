00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:33.532
There's another version there that sends
retaliatory strikes at the Soviet Union.

00:03:33.556 --> 00:03:35.088
This is the really secret stuff:

00:03:35.112 --> 00:03:37.224
how to get directed energy explosions.

00:03:37.248 --> 00:03:39.797
So you're sending the energy
of a nuclear explosion --

00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:43.183
not like just a stick of dynamite,
but you're directing it at the ship.

00:03:43.207 --> 00:03:45.471
And this is still a very active subject.

00:03:45.495 --> 00:03:46.701
It's quite dangerous,

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:49.678
but I believe it's better to have
dangerous things in the open

00:03:49.702 --> 00:03:51.758
than think you're going
to keep them secret.

00:03:51.782 --> 00:03:53.838
This is what happened
at 600 microseconds.

00:03:53.862 --> 00:03:56.637
The Air Force started
to build smaller models

00:03:56.661 --> 00:03:58.355
and actually started doing this.

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.102
The guys in La Jolla said,
"We've got to get started now."
