WEBVTT

00:00:27.963 --> 00:00:30.469
but has now been reclassified.

00:00:30.493 --> 00:00:34.185
(Laughter)

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:36.253
If all goes well, next year I'll be back,

00:00:36.277 --> 00:00:39.408
and I'll have a lot more to show you,
and if all doesn't go well,

00:00:39.432 --> 00:00:41.727
I'll be in jail, like Wen Ho Lee.

00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:45.497
(Laughter)

00:00:46.486 --> 00:00:50.269
So, this ship was basically
the size of the Marriott Hotel,

00:00:50.293 --> 00:00:52.576
a little taller and a little bigger.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.259
And one of the people
who worked on it at the beginning

00:00:55.283 --> 00:00:57.351
was my father, Freeman,
there in the middle.

00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:00.257
That's me and my sister, Esther,
who's a frequent TEDster.
