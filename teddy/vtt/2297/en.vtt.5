00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:32.452
These are the statistics of what would be
the good places to go and stop.

00:02:32.476 --> 00:02:33.965
Some of the sizes of the ships,

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.171
ranging all the way up
to ship mass of 8 million tons.

00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:39.628
So that was the outer extreme.

00:02:39.652 --> 00:02:43.513
Here was version two: 2,000 bombs.

00:02:43.537 --> 00:02:48.830
These are five-kiloton yield bombs,
about the size of small Volkswagens;

00:02:48.854 --> 00:02:51.313
it would take 800 to get into orbit.

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:55.757
Here we see a 10,000-ton ship
will deliver 1,300 tons

00:02:55.781 --> 00:02:58.595
to Saturn and back --
essentially, a five-year trip.

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:03.500
Possible departure dates:
October 1960 to February 1967.
