00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:03.500
Possible departure dates:
October 1960 to February 1967.

00:03:03.524 --> 00:03:06.143
These are trajectories going to Mars.

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:08.285
All this was done by hand,
with slide rules.

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:09.873
The little Orion ship,

00:03:09.897 --> 00:03:12.749
and what it would take
to do what Orion does with chemicals:

00:03:12.773 --> 00:03:15.310
you have a ship the size
of the Empire State Building.

00:03:15.334 --> 00:03:17.814
NASA had no interest;
they tried to kill the project.

00:03:17.838 --> 00:03:20.037
The people who supported it
were the Air Force,

00:03:20.061 --> 00:03:21.735
which meant that it was all secret.

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:25.439
And that's why when you get something
declassified, that's what it looks like.

00:03:25.463 --> 00:03:27.979
Military weapon versions
that carried hydrogen bombs

00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:29.684
that could destroy half the planet.

00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:33.532
There's another version there that sends
retaliatory strikes at the Soviet Union.
