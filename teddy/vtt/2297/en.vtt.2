00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:00.257
That's me and my sister, Esther,
who's a frequent TEDster.

00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:03.443
I didn't like nuclear
bomb-propelled spaceships.

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:06.732
I mean, I thought it was a great idea,
but I started building kayaks.

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:07.920
So we had a few kayaks.

00:01:07.944 --> 00:01:10.659
Just so you know
that I am not Dr. Strangelove.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.349
But all the time I was out there
doing these strange kayak voyages

00:01:15.373 --> 00:01:18.243
in odd, beautiful parts of this planet,

00:01:18.267 --> 00:01:21.576
I always thought in the back
of my mind about Project Orion,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.576
and how my father and his friends
were going to build these big ships.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.643
They were actually going to go --

00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:30.704
Ted Taylor, who led the project,
was going to take his children.
