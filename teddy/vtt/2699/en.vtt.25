00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:32.816
Now, that is a massive trust leap
that hasn't happened yet.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.896
(Applause)

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.376
But let's try to imagine this.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.096
So "The Economist"
eloquently described the blockchain

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.776
as the great chain
of being sure about things.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.856
The easiest way I can describe it
is imagine the blocks as spreadsheets,

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.856
and they are filled with assets.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.296
So that could be a property title.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.336
It could be a stock trade.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.320
It could be a creative asset,
such as the rights to a song.
