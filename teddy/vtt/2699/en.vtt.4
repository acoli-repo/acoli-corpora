(Laughter)

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.056
It's remarkable, right,
that this idea works at all,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.936
because it's counter to the lesson
most of us were taught as a child:

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.280
never get in a car with a stranger.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.816
And yet, BlaBlaCar transports
more than four million people

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.080
every single month.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.216
To put that in context,
that's more passengers

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.720
than the Eurostar
or JetBlue airlines carry.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.496
BlaBlaCar is a beautiful illustration
of how technology is enabling

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.120
millions of people across the world
to take a trust leap.
