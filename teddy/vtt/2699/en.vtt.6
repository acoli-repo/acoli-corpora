00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.496
And I want you to imagine
there exists a gap

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.080
between you and something unknown.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.616
That unknown can be
someone you've just met.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.736
It can be a place you've never been to.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.136
It can be something
you've never tried before.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.376
You got it?

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.496
OK. You can open your eyes now.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.856
For you to leap from a place of certainty,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.456
to take a chance on that someone
or something unknown,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.816
you need a force to pull you over the gap,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.680
and that remarkable force is trust.
