11 million rides taken every day.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.336
That's 127 rides per second,

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.176
showing that this is
a cross-cultural phenomenon.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.376
And the fascinating thing is
that both drivers and passengers report

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.896
that seeing a name

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.896
and seeing someone's photo
and their rating

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.176
makes them feel safer,

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.776
and as you may have experienced,

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.760
even behave a little more nicely
in the taxi cab.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.056
Uber and Didi are early
but powerful examples

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.056
of how technology
is creating trust between people
