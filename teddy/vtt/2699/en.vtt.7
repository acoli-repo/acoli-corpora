Trust is an elusive concept,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.576
and yet we depend on it
for our lives to function.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.856
I trust my children

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.736
when they say they're going
to turn the lights out at night.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.976
I trusted the pilot
who flew me here to keep me safe.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.816
It's a word we use a lot,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.256
without always thinking
about what it really means

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.656
and how it works in different
contexts of our lives.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.296
There are, in fact,
hundreds of definitions of trust,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.896
and most can be reduced
to some kind of risk assessment
