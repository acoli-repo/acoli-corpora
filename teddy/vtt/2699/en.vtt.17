I am constantly stunned
by major breaches of trust:

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.576
the News Corp phone hacking,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.416
the Volkswagen emissions scandal,

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.775
the widespread abuse
in the Catholic Church,

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:42.015
the fact that only one measly banker

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.336
went to jail after the great
financial crisis,

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.416
or more recently the Panama Papers

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.576
that revealed how the rich
can exploit offshore tax regimes.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.056
And the thing that really surprises me

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.096
is why do leaders find it so hard

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.296
to apologize, I mean sincerely apologize,
