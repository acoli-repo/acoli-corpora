Social profiles and reviews
help people make a choice.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.336
You can see if someone's a smoker,
you can see what kind of music they like,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.960
you can see if they're going to bring
their dog along for the ride.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.016
But it turns out
that the key social identifier

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.656
is how much you're going
to talk in the car.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.496
(Laughter)

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.136
Bla, not a lot,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.456
bla bla, you want a nice bit of chitchat,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.216
and bla bla bla, you're not going
to stop talking the entire way

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.696
from London to Paris.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.016
