00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.096
Conventions of how trust is built,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.456
managed, lost and repaired --

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.976
in brands, leaders and entire systems --

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
is being turned upside down.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.856
Now, this is exciting,

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.416
but it's frightening,

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.136
because it forces many of us
to have to rethink

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.856
how trust is built and destroyed
with our customers, with our employees,

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.360
even our loved ones.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:59.976
The other day, I was talking to the CEO
of a leading international hotel brand,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.240
and as is often the case,
we got onto the topic of Airbnb.
