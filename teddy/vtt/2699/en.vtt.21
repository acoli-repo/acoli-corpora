I don't always bother to hang my towels up

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.976
when I'm finished in the hotel,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.640
but I would never do this
as a guest on Airbnb.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.896
And the reason why I would never do this
as a guest on Airbnb

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.576
is because guests know
that they'll be rated by hosts,

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.336
and that those ratings
are likely to impact their ability

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.040
to transact in the future.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.896
It's a simple illustration of how
online trust will change our behaviors

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.216
in the real world,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.736
make us more accountable

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.200
in ways we cannot yet even imagine.
