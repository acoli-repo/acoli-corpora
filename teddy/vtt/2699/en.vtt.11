For instance, do men and women
trust differently in digital environments?

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.656
Does the way we build trust
face-to-face translate online?

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.616
Does trust transfer?

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.336
So if you trust finding a mate on Tinder,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.720
are you more likely
to trust finding a ride on BlaBlaCar?

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.696
But from studying hundreds
of networks and marketplaces,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.536
there is a common pattern
that people follow,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.216
and I call it "climbing the trust stack."

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.440
Let me use BlaBlaCar
as an example to bring it to life.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.376
On the first level,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.576
you have to trust the idea.
