It's the trust shift it creates,

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:36.976
and for my part, I want to help people
understand this new era of trust

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.656
so that we can get it right

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.576
and we can embrace
the opportunities to redesign systems

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.696
that are more transparent,
inclusive and accountable.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.976
Thank you very much.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.576

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.816
Thank you.
