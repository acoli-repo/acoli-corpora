So what's happening here,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.280
and who do you trust?

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.696
Let's start in France with a platform --
with a company, I should say --

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.856
with a rather funny-sounding name,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.136
BlaBlaCar.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.776
It's a platform that matches
drivers and passengers

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.816
who want to share
long-distance journeys together.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.056
The average ride taken is 320 kilometers.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.680
So it's a good idea
to choose your fellow travelers wisely.
