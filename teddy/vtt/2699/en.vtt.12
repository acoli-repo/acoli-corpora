00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.576
you have to trust the idea.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.816
So you have to trust

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.240
the idea of ride-sharing
is safe and worth trying.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.336
The second level is about having
confidence in the platform,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.496
that BlaBlaCar will help you
if something goes wrong.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.176
And the third level is about
using little bits of information

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.680
to decide whether
the other person is trustworthy.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.816
Now, the first time
we climb the trust stack,

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.096
it feels weird, even risky,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.096
but we get to a point
where these ideas seem totally normal.
