00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.200
in ways we cannot yet even imagine.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.936
I am not saying we do not need hotels

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.296
or traditional forms of authority.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.416
But what we cannot deny

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.696
is that the way trust
flows through society is changing,

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.016
and it's creating this big shift

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.896
away from the 20th century

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.736
that was defined by institutional trust

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.256
towards the 21st century

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.920
that will be fueled by distributed trust.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.656
Trust is no longer top-down.
