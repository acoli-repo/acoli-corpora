00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:00.176
Now, I've waited to the end
intentionally to mention Uber,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.656
because I recognize
that it is a contentious

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.296
and widely overused example,

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.560
but in the context of a new era of trust,
it's a great case study.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.656
Now, we will see cases of abuse
of distributed trust.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.336
We've already seen this,
and it can go horribly wrong.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:23.536
I am not surprised that we are seeing
protests from taxi associations

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.896
all around the world

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:29.800
trying to get governments to ban Uber
based on claims that it is unsafe.
