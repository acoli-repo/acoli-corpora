00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.216
that I wanted to buy a navy blue
secondhand Peugeot on eBay,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.896
and he rightfully pointed out

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.296
that the seller's name
was "Invisible Wizard"

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.416
and that this probably
was not such a good idea.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.136
(Laughter)

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.576
So my work, my research
focuses on how technology

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.256
is transforming
the social glue of society,

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.936
trust between people,

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.216
and it's a fascinating area to study,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.616
because there's still
so much we do not know.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.736
For instance, do men and women
trust differently in digital environments?
