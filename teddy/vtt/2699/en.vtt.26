00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.320
It could be a creative asset,
such as the rights to a song.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.976
Every time something moves

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.816
from one place on the register
to somewhere else,

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.936
that asset transfer is time-stamped

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.376
and publicly recorded on the blockchain.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.280
It's that simple. Right.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.816
So the real implication of the blockchain

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.976
is that it removes the need
for any kind of third party,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.336
such as a lawyer,

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.816
or a trusted intermediary,
or maybe not a government intermediary

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.656
to facilitate the exchange.
