00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
How do we know what to do with all the power we have

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
if we don't have a moral framework?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
We know more about mobile operating systems,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
but what we really need is a moral operating system.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
What's a moral operating system?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
We all know right and wrong, right?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
You feel good when you do something right,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
you feel bad when you do something wrong.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Our parents teach us that: praise with the good, scold with the bad.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
But how do we figure out what's right and wrong?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And from day to day, we have the techniques that we use.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Maybe we just follow our gut.
