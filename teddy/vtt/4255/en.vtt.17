00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
That sound familiar?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
That's a utilitarian moral framework.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
John Stuart Mill was a great advocate of this --

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
nice guy besides --

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and only been dead 200 years.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So basis of utilitarianism --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I'm sure you're familiar at least.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
The three people who voted for Mill before are familiar with this.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
But here's the way it works.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
What if morals, what if what makes something moral

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
is just a matter of if it maximizes pleasure

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and minimizes pain?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
It does something intrinsic to the act.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
It's not like its relation to some abstract form.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
It's just a matter of the consequences.
