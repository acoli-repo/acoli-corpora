00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
this wild music.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
♫ Dum da ta da dum ♫

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
♫ Dum da ta da dum ♫

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
♫ Da ta da da ♫

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
That's a lot of power.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That's the kind of power I feel in this room.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
That's the kind of power we have

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
because of all of the data that we have.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Let's take an example.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
What can we do

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
with just one person's data?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
What can we do

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
with that guy's data?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I can look at your financial records.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I can tell if you pay your bills on time.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I know if you're good to give a loan to.
