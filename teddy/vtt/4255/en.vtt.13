Favorite number. I love that number.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
There are truths about two.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
If you've got two of something,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
you add two more, you get four.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
That's true no matter what thing you're talking about.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It's an objective truth about the form of two,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
the abstract form.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
When you have two of anything -- two eyes, two ears, two noses,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
just two protrusions --

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
those all partake of the form of two.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
They all participate in the truths that two has.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
They all have two-ness in them.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And therefore, it's not a matter of opinion.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
What if, Plato thought,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
ethics was like math?
