What if, Plato thought,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
ethics was like math?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
What if there were a pure form of justice?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
What if there are truths about justice,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and you could just look around in this world

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and see which things participated,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
partook of that form of justice?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Then you would know what was really just and what wasn't.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
It wouldn't be a matter

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
of just opinion or just appearances.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
That's a stunning vision.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I mean, think about that. How grand. How ambitious.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
That's as ambitious as we are.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
He wants to solve ethics.
