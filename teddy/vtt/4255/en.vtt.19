00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I'm going to find that out, and when I find that out,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
I'm going to prevent a huge amount of damage that he could cause.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
That has a very high utility to prevent that damage.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And compared to the little pain that it's going to cause --

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
because it's going to be embarrassing when I'm looking on his phone

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and seeing that he has a Farmville problem and that whole bit --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
that's overwhelmed

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
by the value of looking at the phone.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
If you feel that way,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
that's a utilitarian choice.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
But maybe you don't feel that way either.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Maybe you think, it's his phone.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
It's wrong to take his phone
