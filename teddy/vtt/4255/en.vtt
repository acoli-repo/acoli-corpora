00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Power.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
That is the word that comes to mind.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We're the new technologists.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We have a lot of data, so we have a lot of power.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
How much power do we have?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Scene from a movie: "Apocalypse Now" -- great movie.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We've got to get our hero, Captain Willard, to the mouth of the Nung River

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
so he can go pursue Colonel Kurtz.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The way we're going to do this is fly him in and drop him off.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So the scene:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the sky is filled with this fleet of helicopters carrying him in.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And there's this loud, thrilling music in the background,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
this wild music.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
