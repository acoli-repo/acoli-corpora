00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
that could give us answers.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
But they can't.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
You can't just take human thinking

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and put it into a machine.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
We're the ones who have to do it.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Happily, we're not machines, and we can do it.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Not only can we think,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
we must.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Hannah Arendt said,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
"The sad truth

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
is that most evil done in this world

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
is not done by people

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
who choose to be evil.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
It arises from not thinking."
