00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
to figure out the rules by which we should guide our conduct,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and then it is our duty to follow those rules.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
It's not a matter of calculation.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
So let's stop.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
We're right in the thick of it, this philosophical thicket.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And this goes on for thousands of years,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
because these are hard questions,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and I've only got 15 minutes.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
So let's cut to the chase.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
How should we be making our decisions?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Is it Plato, is it Aristotle, is it Kant, is it Mill?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
What should we be doing? What's the answer?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
What's the formula that we can use in any situation
