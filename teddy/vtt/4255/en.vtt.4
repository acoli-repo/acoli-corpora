00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Fair enough.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But it brings me back.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I think about World War II --

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
some of our great technologists then,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
some of our great physicists,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
studying nuclear fission and fusion --

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
just nuclear stuff.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
We gather together these physicists in Los Alamos

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
to see what they'll build.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
We want the people building the technology

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
thinking about what we should be doing with the technology.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So what should we be doing with that guy's data?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Should we be collecting it, gathering it,
