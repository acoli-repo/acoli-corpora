Aristotle thought ethics wasn't a lot like math.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
He thought ethics was a matter of making decisions in the here-and-now

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
using our best judgment

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
to find the right path.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
If you think that, Plato's not your guy.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
But don't give up.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Maybe there's another way

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
that we can use numbers as the basis of our moral framework.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
How about this:

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
What if in any situation you could just calculate,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
look at the choices,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
measure out which one's better and know what to do?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
That sound familiar?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
That's a utilitarian moral framework.
