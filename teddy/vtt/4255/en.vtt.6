00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
let's start with an easy question --

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
something I'm sure everybody here has an opinion about:

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
iPhone versus Android.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Let's do a show of hands -- iPhone.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Uh huh.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Android.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
You'd think with a bunch of smart people

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
we wouldn't be such suckers just for the pretty phones.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
(Laughter)

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Next question,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
a little bit harder.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Should we be collecting all of that guy's data

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
to make his experiences better

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and to protect ourselves in case he's up to no good?
