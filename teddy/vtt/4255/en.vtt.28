Just a few days ago, right across the street from here,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
there was hundreds of people gathered together.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
It was technologists and humanists

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
at that big BiblioTech Conference.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And they gathered together

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
because the technologists wanted to learn

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
what it would be like to think from a humanities perspective.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
You have someone from Google

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
talking to someone who does comparative literature.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
You're thinking about the relevance of 17th century French theater --

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
how does that bear upon venture capital?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Well that's interesting. That's a different way of thinking.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And when you think in that way,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
you become more sensitive to the human considerations,
