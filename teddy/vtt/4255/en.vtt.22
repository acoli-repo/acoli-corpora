00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
What's the formula that we can use in any situation

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
to determine what we should do,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
whether we should use that guy's data or not?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
What's the formula?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
There's not a formula.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
There's not a simple answer.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Ethics requires thinking.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And that's uncomfortable.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I know; I spent a lot of my career

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
in artificial intelligence,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
trying to build machines that could do some of this thinking for us,
