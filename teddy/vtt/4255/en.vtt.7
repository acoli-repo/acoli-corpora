and to protect ourselves in case he's up to no good?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Or should we leave him alone?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Collect his data.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Leave him alone.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
You're safe. It's fine.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
(Laughter)

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Okay, last question --

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
harder question --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
when trying to evaluate

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
what we should do in this case,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
should we use a Kantian deontological moral framework,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
or should we use a Millian consequentialist one?
