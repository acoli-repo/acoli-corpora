00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
or your phone.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Those are the kinds of things we can do

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
with the data that we have.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But I'm not actually here to talk about what we can do.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I'm here to talk about what we should do.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
What's the right thing to do?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Now I see some puzzled looks

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
like, "Why are you asking us what's the right thing to do?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We're just building this stuff. Somebody else is using it."

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Fair enough.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But it brings me back.
