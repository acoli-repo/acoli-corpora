00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and how would we know in a given situation what to do.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So let's get a moral framework.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
We're numbers people, living by numbers.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
How can we use numbers

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
as the basis for a moral framework?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I know a guy who did exactly that.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
A brilliant guy --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
he's been dead 2,500 years.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Plato, that's right.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Remember him -- old philosopher?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
You were sleeping during that class.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And Plato, he had a lot of the same concerns that we did.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
He was worried about right and wrong.
