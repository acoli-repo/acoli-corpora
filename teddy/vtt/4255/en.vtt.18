00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
It's just a matter of the consequences.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
You just look at the consequences

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and see if, overall, it's for the good or for the worse.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
That would be simple. Then we know what to do.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Let's take an example.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Suppose I go up

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
and I say, "I'm going to take your phone."

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Not just because it rang earlier,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
but I'm going to take it because I made a little calculation.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I thought, that guy looks suspicious.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And what if he's been sending little messages to Bin Laden's hideout --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
or whoever took over after Bin Laden --

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and he's actually like a terrorist, a sleeper cell.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I'm going to find that out, and when I find that out,
