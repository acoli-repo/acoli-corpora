00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And from day to day, we have the techniques that we use.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Maybe we just follow our gut.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Maybe we take a vote -- we crowdsource.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Or maybe we punt --

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
ask the legal department, see what they say.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
In other words, it's kind of random,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
kind of ad hoc,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
how we figure out what we should do.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And maybe, if we want to be on surer footing,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
what we really want is a moral framework that will help guide us there,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
that will tell us what kinds of things are right and wrong in the first place,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and how would we know in a given situation what to do.
