00:00:00.196 --> 00:00:03.356
When we think about data,
we usually think about averages.

00:00:03.356 --> 00:00:05.156
Average height, average salary,

00:00:05.196 --> 00:00:07.596
average number of hours
spent on video calls.

00:00:07.636 --> 00:00:11.236
Itâ€™s tempting to focus on these neat
little summaries of our world.

00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:14.876
But the world is a lot messier
than these averages can make it out to be.

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:17.396
So instead, I look for the outliers.

00:00:17.436 --> 00:00:20.956
They can offer a better reflection
of this chaos we call life.

00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:23.036
And they can offer a different perspective

00:00:23.076 --> 00:00:25.076
on the things that we think we understand.

00:00:25.116 --> 00:00:27.596

Take, for instance, the stats
around teens and cigarettes.
