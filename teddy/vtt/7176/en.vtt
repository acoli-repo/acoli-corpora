From NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab
in Pasadena, California,

00:00:04.034 --> 00:00:06.470
right behind me is mission control.

00:00:06.503 --> 00:00:10.440
I'm going to let you take a look,
because on February 18th,

00:00:10.474 --> 00:00:14.344
we're going to attempt to land
NASA's next rover to Mars.

00:00:14.378 --> 00:00:17.881
It's going to be the most sophisticated
rover ever sent to the Red Planet.

00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:20.384
It's even going to have
a helicopter on it.

00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:24.354
So JPL is an amazing place,

00:00:24.388 --> 00:00:27.824
where people are creating robotic missions
to explore the universe.

00:00:27.858 --> 00:00:30.427
They also create satellites
that orbit the Earth
