00:03:23.018 --> 00:03:37.073
each rhythm played by 
a different instrument.

00:03:37.073 --> 00:03:39.009
We can then add an outermost layer

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:41.647
consisting of an additive 
rhythmic component,

00:03:41.647 --> 00:03:55.850
reinforcing the main beat
and increasing accuracy.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.678
Now let's remove everything
except for this combined rhythm

00:03:58.678 --> 00:04:00.877
and the basic two beat on top.
