Or a three beat rhythm with a main beat,
an off beat, and a secondary beat.

00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:42.162
And the spaces between each beat
can be divided into further sub-beats

00:01:42.162 --> 00:01:44.805
using multiples of either two or three.

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:47.433
Layering multiple patterns using
concentric wheels

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:49.961
lets us create more complex rhythms.

00:01:49.961 --> 00:01:53.577
For example, we can combine a basic 
two beat rhythm with off beats

00:01:53.577 --> 00:01:56.913
to get a four beat system.

00:01:56.913 --> 00:02:01.320
This is the recognizable backbone of
many genres popular around the world,
