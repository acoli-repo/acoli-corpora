00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:31.074
gives us a pattern often found
in Middle Eastern music,

00:04:31.074 --> 00:04:37.196
as well as Brazilian choro,

00:04:37.196 --> 00:04:43.695
and Argentinian tango.

00:04:43.695 --> 00:04:48.223
In all of these examples, the underlying
rhythm reinforces the basic one-two,

00:04:48.223 --> 00:04:52.223
but in different ways depending on 
arrangement and cultural context.

00:04:52.223 --> 00:04:55.440
So it turns out that the wheel method
is more than just a nifty way

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.670
of visualizing complex rhythms.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.996
By freeing us from the tyranny
of the bar line,

00:04:59.996 --> 00:05:02.511
we can visualize rhythm 
in terms of time,
