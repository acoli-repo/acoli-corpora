00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:09.660
We usually think of rhythm
as an element of music,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.615
but it's actually found everywhere in
the world around us,

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:15.060
from the ocean tides
to our own heartbeats,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.066
rhythm is essentially an event repeating
regularly over time.

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:22.091
Even the ticking of a clock itself
is a sort of rhythm.

00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:23.320
But for musical rhythm,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.826
a steady string of repeating single
beats is not enough.

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:30.790
For that, we need at least one opposing
beat with a different sound,
