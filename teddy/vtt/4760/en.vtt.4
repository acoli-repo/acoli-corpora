00:01:56.913 --> 00:02:01.320
This is the recognizable backbone of
many genres popular around the world,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.268
from rock,

00:02:04.268 --> 00:02:06.800
country,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.538
and jazz,

00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:12.810
to reggae

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.142
and cumbia.

00:02:15.142 --> 00:02:22.215
Or we can combine a two beat
rhythm with a three beat one.

00:02:22.215 --> 00:02:25.684
Eliminating the extra main beat
and rotating the inner wheel

00:02:25.684 --> 00:02:32.065
leaves us with a rhythm whose 
underlying feel is three-four.
