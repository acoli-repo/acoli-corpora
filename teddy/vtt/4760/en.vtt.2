00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.446
Just as its round face can trace the
linear passage of time,

00:01:02.446 --> 00:01:05.399
the flow of rhythm can be 
traced in a circle.

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.998
The continuity of a wheel can be
a more intuitive way to visualize rhythm

00:01:08.998 --> 00:01:13.016
than a linear score that requires moving
back and forth along the page.

00:01:13.016 --> 00:01:15.968
We can mark the beats at different
positions around the circle

00:01:15.968 --> 00:01:19.841
using blue dots for main beats,
orange ones for off beats,

00:01:19.841 --> 00:01:22.358
and white dots for secondary beats.

00:01:22.358 --> 00:01:29.987
Here is a basic two beat rhythm with
a main beat and an opposing off beat.

00:01:29.987 --> 00:01:38.195
Or a three beat rhythm with a main beat,
an off beat, and a secondary beat.
