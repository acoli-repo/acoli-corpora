00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:30.790
For that, we need at least one opposing
beat with a different sound,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.064
which can be the unstressed off beat
or the accented back beat.

00:00:35.064 --> 00:00:37.544
There are several ways to make
these beats distinct,

00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:43.419
whether by using high and low drums,
or long and short beats.

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:47.345
Which ends up being heard as the main
beat is not a precise rule,

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:52.334
but like the famous Rubin's vase, can be
reversed depending on cultural perception.

00:00:52.334 --> 00:00:56.411
In standard notation, rhythm is indicated
on a musical bar line,

00:00:56.411 --> 00:00:57.833
but there are other ways.

00:00:57.833 --> 00:00:59.440
Remember that ticking clock?

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.446
Just as its round face can trace the
linear passage of time,
