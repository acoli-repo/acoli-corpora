and even Bach's famous Chaconne.

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:04.769
Now if we remember Rubin's vase
and hear the off beats as the main beats,

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.566
this will give us a six-eight feel,

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:10.779
as found in genres such as Chacarera,

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:14.455
and Quechua,

00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:20.333
Persian music and more.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:23.018
In an eight beat system,
we have three layered circles,

00:03:23.018 --> 00:03:37.073
each rhythm played by 
a different instrument.
