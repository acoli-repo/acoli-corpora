00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.536
I was told, "Don't worry about it,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.440
just put down however
you identify yourself."

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.576
So I check "black,"

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.296
but I had no confidence
in the results of a study

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.520
that treated a critical variable
so unscientifically.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.696
That personal experience
with the use of race in genetic testing

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.296
got me thinking:

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.040
Where else in medicine is race used
to make false biological predictions?

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.976
Well, I found out that race runs deeply
throughout all of medical practice.
