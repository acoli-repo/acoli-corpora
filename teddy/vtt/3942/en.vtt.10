I have more muscle mass
than that female bodybuilder?

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.576
Wouldn't it be far more accurate
and evidence-based

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.616
to determine the muscle mass
of individual patients

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.680
just by looking at them?

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.776
Well, doctors tell me
they're using race as a shortcut.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.536
It's a crude but convenient proxy

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.816
for more important factors,
like muscle mass,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.216
enzyme level, genetic traits

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.520
they just don't have time to look for.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.376
But race is a bad proxy.
