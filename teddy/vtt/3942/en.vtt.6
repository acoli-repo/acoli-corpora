You remember when the map
of the human genome

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.016
was unveiled at a White House
ceremony in June 2000?

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.656
President Bill Clinton famously declared,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.856
"I believe one of the great truths

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.056
to emerge from this triumphant expedition

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.896
inside the human genome

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.776
is that in genetic terms,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.616
human beings, regardless of race,

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.160
are more than 99.9 percent the same."

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.496
And he might have added

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.216
that that less than one percent
of genetic difference
