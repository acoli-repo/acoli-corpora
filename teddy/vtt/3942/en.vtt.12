Race can't substitute
for these important clinical measures

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.400
without sacrificing patient well-being.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.456
Doctors also tell me
race is just one of many factors

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.016
they take into account,

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.176
but there are numerous medical tests,

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.936
like the GFR,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.216
that use race categorically

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.216
to treat black, white,
Asian patients differently

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.320
just because of their race.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.176
Race medicine also leaves
patients of color especially vulnerable
