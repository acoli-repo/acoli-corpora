00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.056
15 years ago, I volunteered
to participate in a research study

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.616
that involved a genetic test.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.647
When I arrived at the clinic to be tested,

00:00:10.672 --> 00:00:12.320
I was handed a questionnaire.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.296
One of the very first questions
asked me to check a box for my race:

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.920
White, black, Asian, or Native American.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.560
I wasn't quite sure
how to answer the question.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.576
Was it aimed at measuring the diversity

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.176
of research participants'
social backgrounds?
