00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.136
Cartwright argued in the 1850s

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.176
that slavery was beneficial
for black people

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.256
for medical reasons.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.176
He claimed that because black people
have lower lung capacity than whites,

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.760
forced labor was good for them.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.096
He wrote in a medical journal,

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.536
"It is the red vital blood
sent to the brain

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.896
that liberates their minds
when under the white man's control,

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.656
and it is the want of sufficiency
of red vital blood

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.080
that chains their minds to ignorance
and barbarism when in freedom."
