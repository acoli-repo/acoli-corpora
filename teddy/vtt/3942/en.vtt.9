00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.176
automatically produces
a different GFR estimate

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.680
depending on whether or not
the patient is African-American.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.320
Why?

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.536
I've been told it's based on an assumption

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.656
that African-Americans
have more muscle mass

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.880
than people of other races.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.696
But what sense does it make

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.176
for a doctor to automatically assume

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.080
I have more muscle mass
than that female bodybuilder?
