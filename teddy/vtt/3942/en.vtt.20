To support this theory,
Cartwright helped to perfect

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.160
a medical device for measuring breathing
called the spirometer

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.280
to show the presumed deficiency
in black people's lungs.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:25.416
Today, doctors still
uphold Cartwright's claim

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.056
the black people as a race

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.080
have lower lung capacity
than white people.
