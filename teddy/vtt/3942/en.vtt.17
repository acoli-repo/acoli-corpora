One elderly black woman stood up
in a community meeting and shouted,

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.496
"Give me what the white
people are taking!"

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.000
(Laughter)

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:39.360
And if you find race-specific
medicine surprising,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.135
wait until you learn

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.976
that many doctors in the United States

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.136
still use an updated version

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.056
of a diagnostic tool

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.536
that was developed by a physician
during the slavery era,

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.856
a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.240
to justifications for slavery.
