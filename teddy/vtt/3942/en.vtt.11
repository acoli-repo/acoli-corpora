00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.376
But race is a bad proxy.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.536
In many cases, race adds
no relevant information at all.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.440
It's just a distraction.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.480
But race also tends to overwhelm
the clinical measures.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.120
It blinds doctors to patients' symptoms,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.440
family illnesses,

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.776
their history, their own illnesses
they might have --

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.320
all more evidence-based
than the patient's race.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.696
Race can't substitute
for these important clinical measures
