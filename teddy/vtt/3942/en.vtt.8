00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.240
But their habit of treating patients
by race lags far behind.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.416
Take the estimate

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.696
of glomerular filtration rate, or GFR.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.256
Doctors routinely interpret GFR,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.520
this important indicator
of kidney function, by race.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.079
As you can see in this lab test,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.896
the exact same creatinine level,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.696
the concentration
in the blood of the patient,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.176
automatically produces
a different GFR estimate
