00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.176
of research participants'
social backgrounds?

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.816
In that case, I would answer
with my social identity,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.840
and check the box for "black."

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.016
But what if the researchers
were interested in investigating

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.136
some association between ancestry
and the risk for certain genetic traits?

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.696
In that case, wouldn't they want to know
something about my ancestry,

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.976
which is just as much European as African?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.616
And how could they make
scientific findings about my genes

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.680
if I put down my social identity
as a black woman?
