00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.920
doctors actually investigated
and addressed that more important factor?

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.856
What if doctors joined the forefront

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.616
of a movement to end
the structural inequities

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.856
caused by racism,

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.960
not by genetic difference?

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.520
Race medicine is bad medicine,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.296
it's poor science

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.680
and it's a false
interpretation of humanity.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.096
It is more urgent than ever
