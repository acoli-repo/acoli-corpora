00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.256
asking questions like,
"How can I make the world a better place?"

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.176
And part of what my group
likes to ask is, "What is better?"

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.296
What is better for you, for me,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.456
for a white woman, a gay man,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.976
a veteran, a child with a prosthetic?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.056
Technology is never neutral.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.736
It frames a reality

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.536
and reflects a context.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.296
Can you imagine what it would say
about the work-life balance at your office

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.496
if these were standard issue
on the first day?

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.936
(Laughter)

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.216
I believe it's the role
of artists and designers

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.376
to raise critical questions.
