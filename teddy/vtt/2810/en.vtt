00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.735
What if our plants

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.456
could sense the toxicity
levels in the soil

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.520
and express that toxicity
through the color of its leaves?

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.000
What if those plants could also
remove those toxins from the soil?

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.656
Instead, what if those plants

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.536
grew their own packaging,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.136
or were designed to only be harvested

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.416
by their owners' own patented machines?

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.336
What happens when biological design

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.896
is driven by the motivations
of mass-produced commodities?

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.520
What kind of world would that be?
