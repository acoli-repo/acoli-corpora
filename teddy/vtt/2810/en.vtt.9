00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.456
So I've been cataloging and collecting

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.656
bacteria from different sites of my body.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.656
After talking to a scientist, we thought,

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.376
maybe the perfect concoction of Ani

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.376
is like 10 percent collarbone,
30 percent underarm,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.696
40 percent bikini line and so forth,

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.776
and occasionally
I let researchers from other labs

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.456
take a sniff of my samples.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.656
And it's been interesting to hear
how smell of the body

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.496
is perceived outside
of the context of the body.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.096
I've gotten feedback such as,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.576
smells like flowers, like chicken,
