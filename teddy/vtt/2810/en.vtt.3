00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.376
to raise critical questions.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.816
Art is how you can see
and feel the future,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.296
and today is an exciting
time to be a designer,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.456
for all the new tools becoming accessible.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.056
For instance, synthetic biology

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.976
seeks to write biology
as a design problem.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.536
And through these developments,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.496
my lab asks, what are the roles
and responsibilities

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.856
of an artist, designer,
scientist or businessman?

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.416
What are the implications

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.176
of synthetic biology, genetic engineering,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.816
and how are they shaping our notions
of what it means to be a human?

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.136
What are the implications of this
on society, on evolution
