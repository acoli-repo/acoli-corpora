Funny enough, I found that this
was a 19th century Austrian tradition,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.656
where couples in courtship
would keep a slice of apple

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.256
crammed under their armpit during dances,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.816
and at the end of the evening,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.216
the girl would give the guy
she most fancied her used fruit,

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.416
and if the feeling was mutual,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.376
he would wolf down that stinky apple.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.520
(Laughter)

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.976
Famously, Napoleon wrote
many love letters to Josephine,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.256
but perhaps amongst the most memorable
is this brief and urgent note:

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.496
"Home in three days. Don't bathe."
