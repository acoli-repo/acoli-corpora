00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.256
which causes cell elongation
on the shady side.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.416
And right now I'm creating
a set of lipsticks

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.256
that are infused with these chemicals

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.936
that allow me to interact with a plant
on its own chemical signatures --

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.376
lipsticks that cause plants
to grow where I kiss it,

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.136
plants that blossom
where I kiss the bloom.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.936
And through these projects,

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.376
I'm asking questions like,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.096
how do we define nature?

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.656
How do we define nature
when we can reengineer its properties,

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.096
and when should we do it?

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.816
Should we do it for profit, for utility?

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.536
Can we do it for emotional ends?
