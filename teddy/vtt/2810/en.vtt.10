00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.576
smells like flowers, like chicken,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.816
like cornflakes,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.296
like beef carnitas.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.216
(Laughter)

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.856
At the same time, I cultivate
a set of carnivorous plants

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.536
for their ability to emit
fleshlike odors to attract prey,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.376
in an attempt to kind of create
this symbiotic relationship

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.320
between my bacteria and this organism.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.176
And as it so happens,
I'm at MIT and I'm in a bar,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.496
and I was talking to a scientist

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.896
who happens to be a chemist
and a plant scientist,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.816
and I was telling him about my project,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.976
and he was like, "Well, this sounds
like botany for lonely women."
