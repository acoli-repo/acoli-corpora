00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.976
and he was like, "Well, this sounds
like botany for lonely women."

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.016
(Laughter)

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.936
Unperturbed, I said, "OK."

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.176
I challenged him.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.496
"Can we engineer a plant
that can love me back?"

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.976
And for some reason,
he was like, "Sure, why not?"

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.936
So we started with,
can we get a plant to grow towards me

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.416
like I was the sun?

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.376
And so we're looking at mechanisms
in plants such as phototropism,

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.576
which causes the plant
to grow towards the sun

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.576
by producing hormones like auxin,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.256
which causes cell elongation
on the shady side.
