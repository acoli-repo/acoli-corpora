00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.496
"Home in three days. Don't bathe."

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.576
(Laughter)

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.760
Both Napoleon and Josephine
adored violets.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.456
Josephine wore violet-scented perfume,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.296
carried violets on their wedding day,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.335
and Napoleon sent her a bouquet of violets

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.896
every year on their anniversary.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.496
When Josephine passed away,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.096
he planted violets at her grave,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.936
and just before his exile,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.096
he went back to that tomb site,

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.776
picked some of those flowers,
entombed them in a locket

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.536
and wore them until the day he died.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.096
And I found this so moving,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.016
I thought, could I engineer that violet
to smell just like Josephine?
