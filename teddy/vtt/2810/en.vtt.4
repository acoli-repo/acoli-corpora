What are the implications of this
on society, on evolution

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.736
and what are the stakes in this game?

My own speculative design research
at the current moment

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.416

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.456
but for more emotionally driven output.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.256
I'm obsessed with olfaction
as a design space,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.096
and this project started with this idea

What if you could take
your own natural body odor

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.216
and send it to a lover?

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.016
Funny enough, I found that this
was a 19th century Austrian tradition,
