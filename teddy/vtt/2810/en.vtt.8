Can we harness these same technologies
for an emotionally sensitive output?

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.976
So currently in my lab,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.296
I'm researching questions like,
what makes a human smell like a human?

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.936
And it turns out it's fairly complicated.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.176
Factors such as your diet,
your medications, your lifestyle

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.216
all factor into the way you smell.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.776
And I found that our sweat
is mostly odorless,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.935
but it's our bacteria and microbiome

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.696
that's responsible for your smells,
your mood, your identity

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.336
and so much beyond.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.656
And there's all kinds
of molecules that you emit

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.960
but which we only perceive subconsciously.
