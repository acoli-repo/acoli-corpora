00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.520
What kind of world would that be?

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.256
My name is Ani, and I'm a designer
and researcher at MIT Media Lab,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.416
where I'm part of a relatively new
and unique group called Design Fiction,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.536
where we're wedged somewhere
between science fiction and science fact.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.696
And at MIT, I am lucky enough
to rub shoulders with scientists

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.696
studying all kinds of cutting edge fields

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.096
like synthetic neurobiology,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.136
artificial intelligence, artificial life

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.896
and everything in between.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.736
And across campus,
there's truly brilliant scientists

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.256
asking questions like,
"How can I make the world a better place?"
