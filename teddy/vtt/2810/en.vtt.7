00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.016
I thought, could I engineer that violet
to smell just like Josephine?

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.696
What if, for the rest of eternity,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.296
when you went to visit her site,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.576
you could smell Josephine
just as Napoleon loved her?

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.016
Could we engineer new ways of mourning,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.136
new rituals for remembering?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.856
After all, we've engineered
transgenic crops

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.016
to be maximized for profit,

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.176
crops that stand up to transport,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.136
crops that have a long shelf life,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.616
crops that taste sugary sweet
but resist pests,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.056
sometimes at the expense
of nutritional value.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.656
Can we harness these same technologies
for an emotionally sensitive output?
