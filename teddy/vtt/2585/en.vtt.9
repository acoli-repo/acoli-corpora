00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.736
So I think it has something
to do with the myths,

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.976
the fables that we all carry around
in our collective consciousness.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.576
Do you remember the Grimm's fairy tale
about the magic porridge pot?

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.976
If you said to the pot,
"Boil, little pot, boil,"

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.296
it would fill up with sweet porridge.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.416
And if you said, "Stop, little pot, stop,"

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.640
it would stop.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.616
But if you got the words wrong,
it wouldn't listen,

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.400
and things could go terribly awry.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.376
So I think when it comes to markets,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.896
we have a little bit
of a similar fable in our heads.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.256
We believe that the markets
is this magic pot
