00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.336
the nearly 290 trillion dollars
of stocks and bonds in the world,

that that may be one
of our most powerful forces

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.816
for positive social change
at our disposal,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.080
if we ask it to be.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.776
Now, I know some of you are thinking,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.296

It's a vast, impersonal,
uncaring force of nature

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.336
that is not affected
by our wishes or desires.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.696
So the best that our
little savings accounts
