So the best that our
little savings accounts

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.416
or retirement accounts can do

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.016
is to try to catch some waves
in the good cycles

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.801
and hope that we don't get
inundated in the turbulent ones,

00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:13.056
but certainly our decisions on how
to steer our little retirement accounts

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.576
don't affect the tides,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.000
don't change the shape or size
or direction of the waves.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.016
But why is that?

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.376
Because actually,
one third of this ocean of capital

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.016
actually belongs to individuals like us,

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.096
and most of the rest
of the capital markets
