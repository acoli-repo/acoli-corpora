00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.816
or Ben &amp; Jerry's wouldn't say so.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.816
Right? Both of those started out
as small, socially conscious companies

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.976
that ended up becoming
so popular with consumers

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.056
that the giants Unilever
and Clorox bought them

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.240
for hundreds of millions of dollars

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.080
each.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.376
But here's the important thing.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.736
Those corporations realized

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.696
that if they wanted to protect
the value of their investments,

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.216
they had to preserve
that socially conscious mission.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.456
If they didn't keep adding in
those extra words

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.896
of environmentally friendly
and socially conscious,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.000
those brands wouldn't make more money.
