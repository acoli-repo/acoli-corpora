00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.494
For me, it goes back to the inspiration
that I received from my mother.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.776
She knew that she wanted a life

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.440
where she would have the freedom
to make her own choices

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.496
and to have her voice heard
and write her own story.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.976
She was passionate about that goal

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.616
and she was clear that she would let
no army, no obstacle,

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.160
no big institution stand in her way.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.896
She made it to the States,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.656
and she became a teacher,

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.376
an award-winning author

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.656
and a mother,

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.376
and ended up sending
her daughters to Harvard.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.496
And these days, you can tell
that she is amply comfortable
