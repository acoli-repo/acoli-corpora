00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.296
would have grown
to 14 dollars and 46 cents.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.576
That's not bad until you consider

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.616
that if instead
you'd invested that same dollar

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.296
in a portfolio of companies

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.130
that focused on growing their business

00:07:42.154 --> 00:07:45.394
and on the most important
environmental and social issues,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.216
that one dollar would have grown

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.680
to 28 dollars and 36 cents.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.136
almost twice as much sweet porridge.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.136
Now, let's be clear, they didn't make
that outperformance

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.056
by giving away money
to seem like a nice corporate citizen.
