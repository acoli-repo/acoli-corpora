00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.496
And these days, you can tell
that she is amply comfortable

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.576
holding court in the most powerful
institutions in the world.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.496
It seems almost too prophetic

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.816
that her name in Korean means

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.120
"passionate clarity."

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.936
Passionate clarity:

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.736
that's what I think we need
to drive change.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.096
Passion about the change
we want to see in the world,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.760
and clarity that we are able
to help chart the course.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.496
We have more opportunity today
than ever before

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.760
to make choices.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:03.040
We have more power than ever before
to make our voices heard.
