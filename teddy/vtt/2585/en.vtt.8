00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.216
So why do we think that our choice

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.056
of a four dollar shade-grown
fair trade artisanal cup of coffee

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.256
in a reusable mug matters,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.042
but what we do with 4,000 dollars
in our investment account

00:04:09.066 --> 00:04:10.466
for our IRA doesn't?

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.896
Why can't we tell the supermarket
and the capital markets

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.336
that we care,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.616
that we care about fair labor standards,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.976
that we care about sustainable
production methods

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.856
and about healthy communities?

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.896
Why aren't we voting
with our investment dollars,

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.560
but we would vote with our lattes?

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.736
So I think it has something
to do with the myths,
