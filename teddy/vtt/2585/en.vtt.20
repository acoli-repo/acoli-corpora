00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.760
to make sustainable investing
the new normal.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.776
First, the proof points
are coming out all the time

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.816
that sustainable investing done right,

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.056
preserving all the same
good principles of investing,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.040
the traditional sphere, can pay.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.336
It makes sense.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.776
Secondly,

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.936
the biggest obstacle standing in our way

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.000
may actually just be in our heads.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.576
We just need to let go of that myth

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.856
that if you add your values
into your investment thinking,

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.496
that you get less sweet porridge.
