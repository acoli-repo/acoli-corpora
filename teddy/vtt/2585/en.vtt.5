00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.096
and most of the rest
of the capital markets

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.336
is controlled by the institutions
that get their power and authority

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.136
and their capital from us,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.296
as members, participants,
beneficiaries, shareholders or citizens.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.160

the last time you were
at a supermarket or at Starbucks?

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.216
OK. Do any of you go to the restaurant

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.896
and order the sustainably farmed trout
