00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.056
I believe big institutions

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.696
have unique potential to create change,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.696
and I believe that we as individuals

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.016
have unique power

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.760
to influence the direction
that those institutions take.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.056
Now, these beliefs did not
come naturally to me,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.656
because trusting big institutions,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.480
not really part of my family legacy.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.736
My mother escaped North Korea

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.616
when she was 10 years old.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.656
To do so, she had to elude
every big institution in her life:

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.536
repressive governments, occupying armies
