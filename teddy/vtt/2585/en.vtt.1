repressive governments, occupying armies

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.480
and even armed border patrols.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.416
Later, when she decided she wanted
to emigrate to the United States,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.496
she had to defy an entire culture

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.040
that said the girls would never
be the best and brightest.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.616
Only because her name
happens to sound like a boy's

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.896
was she able to finagle her way
into the government immigration exam

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.520
to come to the United States.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.976
Because of her bravery and passion,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.856
I've had all the opportunities
that she never did,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.400
and that has made my story so different.
