00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.000
those brands wouldn't make more money.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.776
But maybe this is just the exception
the proves the rule, right?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.336
The serious companies
that fund our economy

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.656
and that fund our retirements
and that really make the world go round,

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.120
they need to stick to making more money.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.656
So, Harvard Business School
actually researched this,

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.442
and they found something fascinating.

00:07:19.466 --> 00:07:22.096
If you had invested a dollar 20 years ago

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.776
in a portfolio of companies

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.016
that focused narrowly on making more money

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.976
quarter by quarter,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.416
that one dollar

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.296
would have grown
to 14 dollars and 46 cents.
