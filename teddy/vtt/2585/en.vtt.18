Post-White House, he opened
an investment firm called Generation,

00:09:01.112 --> 00:09:04.376
where he baked environmental
sustainability and other things

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.280
right into the core investment process.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.496
And at the time there was
a good bit of skepticism about his views.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.256
Ten years later, his track record
is one more proof point

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.976

can be sound investing.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.856
Far from making less sweet porridge

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.256

sustainability into the mix,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.960
he actually significantly
outperformed the benchmark.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.096
Now, sustainable investing,

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.000
the good news is
it doesn't require a magic spell
