00:07:58.571 --> 00:08:00.423
I think it's important to keep in mind

00:08:00.447 --> 00:08:04.922
that the prevailing notions
of man and woman as static genders

00:08:04.946 --> 00:08:07.887
anchored strictly on biological sex

00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:09.355
are social constructs.

00:08:10.126 --> 00:08:14.965
In my people's case,
this social construct is an imposition.

00:08:16.266 --> 00:08:20.979
It was hammered into their heads
over hundreds of years

00:08:21.003 --> 00:08:25.082
until they were convinced that their way
of thinking was erroneous.

00:08:26.836 --> 00:08:30.081
But the good thing about social constructs
