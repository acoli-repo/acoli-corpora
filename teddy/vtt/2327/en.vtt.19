As I stand here today,
on the shoulders of people like Lenie,

00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:41.514
I feel incredibly grateful for all
who have come before me,

00:09:42.501 --> 00:09:46.528
the ones courageous enough
to put themselves out there,

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:50.568
who lived a life that was theirs

00:09:50.592 --> 00:09:54.704
and in the process, made it a little
easier for us to live our lives now.

00:09:55.685 --> 00:09:58.991
Because being yourself is revolutionary.
