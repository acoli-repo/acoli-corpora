00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.572
I was an eight-year-old kid
in the mid-1990s.

00:00:03.596 --> 00:00:05.983
I grew up in southern Philippines.

00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:08.300
At that age, you're young enough
to be oblivious

00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:10.389
about what society expects
from each of us

00:00:10.413 --> 00:00:13.705
but old enough to be aware
of what's going on around you.

00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:16.376
We lived in a one-bedroom house,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.790
all five of us.

00:00:17.814 --> 00:00:20.010
Our house was amongst clusters of houses

00:00:20.034 --> 00:00:23.960
made mostly of wood
and corrugated metal sheets.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.242
These houses were built
very close to each other

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.971
along unpaved roads.

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:32.146
There was little to no
expectation of privacy.
