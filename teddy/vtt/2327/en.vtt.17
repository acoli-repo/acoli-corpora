But the good thing about social constructs

00:08:30.105 --> 00:08:31.603
is they can be reconstructed

00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:34.502

00:08:35.646 --> 00:08:37.041
They can be reconstructed

00:08:37.065 --> 00:08:40.339
to respond to communities
that are becoming more diverse.

00:08:41.356 --> 00:08:43.553
And they can be reconstructed

00:08:43.577 --> 00:08:46.254
for a world that's starting to realize

00:08:46.278 --> 00:08:51.556

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.549

00:08:56.573 --> 00:09:00.142
and an almost forgotten
but important legacy
