00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.076
Not all cultures are as rigid.

00:02:35.727 --> 00:02:38.557
Many cultures don't look
at genitalia primarily

00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:40.790
as basis for gender construction,

00:02:40.814 --> 00:02:46.575
and some communities in North America,
Africa, the Indian subcontinent

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.799
and the Pacific Islands,
including the Philippines,

00:02:49.823 --> 00:02:53.037
have a long history
of cultural permissiveness

00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:55.458
and accommodation of gender variances.

00:02:56.307 --> 00:02:57.496

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.967
the people of the Philippines were under
Spanish rule for over 300 years.
