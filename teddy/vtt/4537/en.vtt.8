00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Well, Big Chemical

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
is what we're dealing with here.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And they're allowed to keep trade secrets,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
so they don't even give the ingredients out.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Plus they don't give health and safety data,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
so, consequently, they cannot be regulated

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
before they go to market.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So it's a case of innocent until proven guilty.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The burden of proof is not on the producer.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So I then was invited to go

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
to the Gulf in May.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I went down there on

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
a preliminary investigation

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
to look into dispersants
