00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
But I was the recipient

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
of a lot of flame retardant material for some reason.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And just to point out the levels --

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Americans have 10 to 40 times higher

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
levels of these compounds in our bodies

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
than the Europeans.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Why? Because we are flame-retarding everything,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and we have weak regulations

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
for toxic chemicals.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
But lo and behold, I'm one of the high-end individuals.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Lucky me.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
But then I thought,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
well, in case of a fire, I might be the last one to ignite.
