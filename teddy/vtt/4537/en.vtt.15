00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and they used the most toxic one, the 9527,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
until they ran out of supplies.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Now they're on 9500.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
9527 had 2-butoxyethanol in it

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
that causes internal bleeding.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
We know that from the Exxon Valdez spill, by the way.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
So what we're doing, we're putting compounds

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
with petroleum solvents onto a petroleum spill.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Does this make sense?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So this is the way it works.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And I want to show you this cute little thing that happens here.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
It's a micelle.
