WEBVTT

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
of these chemicals, most of which we don't know,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and what are their byproducts,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
which are usually more toxic than the parent compound.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
So we did find that Corexit 9500

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
contains heavy metals, arsenic and chromium --

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
arsenic at high enough levels

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
to have cancer-causing effects.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
So this is what we have to look at,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
these, you know, ridiculous safety data sheets,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
which have nothing on them much.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And now they were forced to release the ultimate list

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
of everything that's in Corexit.
