00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
as a trade-off, they say,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
between the wetlands versus the ocean depth.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And I didn't agree with that

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
decision at the time; I still don't.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
The decision was to protect the marshes.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
When the oil gets into the marshes, you can't get it out.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And as you know, there's been a very weak response,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
up until recently,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
to actually collect the oil.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
It's gotten much more aggressive.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
This is an Exxon slide showing what happens,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
the scenario and the trade-off.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So this shows oil on the surface.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
You can see it getting up into the mangrove,
