It's a micelle.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Micelles form around the oil.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And what happens first

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
is the solvents break into the oil,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
the lipid membrane,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
they let the surfactants in there.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
The surfactants -- which are like things

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
we use on fast food wrappers --

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
they grab around the droplets of oil,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and they make little, tiny droplets

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
with nice, little

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
surfactant edges to them.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
The thing to remember about the micelles --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
these little floating

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
globules of toxin --
