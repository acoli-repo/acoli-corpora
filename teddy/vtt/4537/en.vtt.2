00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
about a third of them --

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
within about 30 years.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So my project is along the Northwest Atlantic.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's called Seals as Sentinels.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We're tracking pollution

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
at the top of the food web, in marine mammals and fish.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It's a region-wide,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
eco-toxicological investigation.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We're looking at a lot of compounds,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but recently been quite interested in

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
the flame retardants, the brominated flame retardants

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
that are in many, many things

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that we use in our everyday life,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
from the cushions in the chairs
