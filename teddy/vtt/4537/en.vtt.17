00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
globules of toxin --

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
is they are there to deliver.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
They're like the FedEx guys.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And if you're a fish,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and you haven't gotten your glob in the morning,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
you're going to get it in the afternoon,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
because they've got your number.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
So from a toxicology perspective,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
this is really awful

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
because Corexit and the dispersed oil

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
are much more toxic together

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
than either alone.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And usually the exposure

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
is a combined exposure.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The dispersants -- as I was saying --
