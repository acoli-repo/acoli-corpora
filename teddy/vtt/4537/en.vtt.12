00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
You can see it getting up into the mangrove,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
but it is not harming the corals

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
or the sea grass, right.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So here we have the other scenario.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
If you disperse, the sea grass and the corals

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
are getting hit pretty hard,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
but you're saving the mangrove.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So this, to me, is like going to the eye doctor, okay?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Is it better with one or two?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
(Laughter)

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
The problem is that we have

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
released so darn much of this stuff,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
we're climbing up to two million gallons
