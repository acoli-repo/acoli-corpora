00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Having been in that water

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
just for the short time I was there,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I can tell you, it is not heat stress.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
There are volumes of volatile

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
petroleum fumes coming off that water,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
plus the Corexit,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
which has solvent in it.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So it is not at all rational.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
So what do we have? The BP show is going on.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Our officials complained about Corexit,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
which is the most toxic

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
line of dispersants.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
But heck, they're still using it,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and they used the most toxic one, the 9527,
