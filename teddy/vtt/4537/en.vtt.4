00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
As you all know, we throw out billions

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
of computers and TVs every year.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And those go to e-waste dumps.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And all that gets into surface waters,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
eventually reaching the ocean, the final sink.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So, in our study,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
we did find quite high levels, as we expected,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
of these flame retardants in the harbor seals' bodies.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And we reported this.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It led to a ban of this neuro-toxic flame retardant

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
called Deca in Maine, where I am based,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and also then a phase-out,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
U.S.-wide, at the end of last year.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But we said, well, on the bright side,
