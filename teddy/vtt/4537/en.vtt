00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I am a marine toxicologist,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and I've been very, very concerned about the Gulf,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
particularly about the massive applications

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of the toxic dispersants,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the Corexits.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I've been working on ocean pollution

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
for quite a long time --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the impacts on marine life and particularly the impacts

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
on marine mammals.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
As it turns out, marine mammals

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
are at the top of this food chain

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that we're pouring millions of tons

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of toxic substances into

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
every year.
