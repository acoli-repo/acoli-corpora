00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
the impacts of this spill

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
on the wildlife of the Gulf.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
We started hypothesizing:

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
what do we know?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
what do with think would be a trophic cascade?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
which means that somebody gets wiped out,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and then everything above

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
that's eating those guys will crash.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
So our thought was --

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
this is a simple thinking process, but ...

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
obviously the plankton, the planktivores,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and that's about as far as we got.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And then it turns out we're not very good at figuring this stuff out.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
This is what the Exxon Valdez scientists thought would happen,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
this trophic cascade
