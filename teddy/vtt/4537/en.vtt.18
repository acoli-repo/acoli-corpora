The dispersants -- as I was saying --

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
their job is to break down

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
the lipid membrane.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
The solvents in them do that very efficiently.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
So they break down

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
lipid membranes in our body,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
starting with cells of the skin,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
the cells of organs.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So it actually hastens

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
oil getting into the body

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
easily and readily.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Oil contains hundreds of hydrocarbon compounds

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and other compounds

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
that are toxic to every organ in the body.
