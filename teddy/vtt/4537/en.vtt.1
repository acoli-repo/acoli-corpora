of toxic substances into

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
every year.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And they are showing the signs of this.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm sorry to have a sad slide like this,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but not everything is all that happy,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
especially in my work.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
They are loaded

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
with toxic chemicals in their body,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
hundreds of compounds,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
all kinds of compounds -- it's staggering.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And they're dying off rather regularly,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
tens of thousands around the world.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's predicted they may go extinct --

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
about a third of them --
