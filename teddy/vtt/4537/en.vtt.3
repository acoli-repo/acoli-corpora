00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
from the cushions in the chairs

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
we're all sitting on

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to the plastic casings of our computers,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
our television sets and so on.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So we are tracking

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
how do these things get from

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the products into the ocean,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
which is the final sink for them.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And there's quite a complicated pathway for that

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
because, as these products age,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
they get concentrated in dust,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and then they also get thrown out, so they go to the landfills.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
They wind up in waste water treatment plants.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
As you all know, we throw out billions
