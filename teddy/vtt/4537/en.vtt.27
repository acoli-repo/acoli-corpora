00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And what does happen with that eventually

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
is pneumonia sets in

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
and liver, kidney, brain damage.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
The Corexit

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
is transporting the oil

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
into every membrane

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and every system of the body.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And you're having

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
a lot of different unpleasant effects,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
but burns to the eyes and mouth,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
skin ulcers, lesions.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And I think, personally,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
that we have not begun to see

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
the impacts of this spill

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
on the wildlife of the Gulf.
