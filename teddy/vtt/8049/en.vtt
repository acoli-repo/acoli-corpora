00:00:00.997 --> 00:00:06.294
Let's imagine together
we've gone on an eight-month journey

00:00:06.335 --> 00:00:08.963
and arrived to the planet Mars.

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.090
Yes, Mars.

00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:13.926
Somehow we'll have to figure out

00:00:13.968 --> 00:00:17.138
how to build protective
and durable structures

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.224
to shield us against solar radiation,

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:25.021
galactic cosmic rays
and extreme temperatures swings.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.650
On a Mars mission, there's only so much
that we can bring with us from Earth.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.986
And it's prohibitively expensive
