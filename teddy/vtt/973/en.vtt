00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I think the future of this planet depends on humans,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
not technology, and we already have the knowledge --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we’re kind of at the endgame with knowledge.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But we’re nowhere near the endgame

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
when it comes to our perception.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We still have one foot in the dark ages.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And when you listen to some of the presentations here --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and the extraordinary range of human capability, our understandings --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and then you contrast it with the fact
