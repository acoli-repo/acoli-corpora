00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So this is a story

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
of a place that I now call home.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's a story of public education

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and of rural communities

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and of what design might do to improve both.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So this is Bertie County,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
North Carolina, USA.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
To give you an idea of the "where:"

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So here's North Carolina, and if we zoom in,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Bertie County is in the eastern part of the state.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It's about two hours east

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
driving-time from Raleigh.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And it's very flat. It's very swampy.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's mostly farmland.
