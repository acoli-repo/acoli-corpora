One important effect of noise
is that it disturbs communication.

00:03:01.053 --> 00:03:03.850
You may have to raise your voice
to be understood.

00:03:03.874 --> 00:03:07.348
In extreme cases, you may even
have to pause the conversation.

00:03:07.756 --> 00:03:11.633
It's also more likely to be misunderstood
in a noisy environment.

00:03:11.657 --> 00:03:14.994
These are all likely reasons
why studies have found

00:03:15.018 --> 00:03:18.496
that children who attend
schools in noisy areas

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.452
are more likely to lag behind their peers
in academic performance.

00:03:23.821 --> 00:03:26.312
Another very important
health effect of noise

00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:29.325
is the increased risk
for cardiovascular disease

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.648
in those who are exposed
to relevant noise levels
