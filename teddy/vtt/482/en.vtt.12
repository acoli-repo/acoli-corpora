00:06:08.254 --> 00:06:11.145
and to remember them
during the next morning,

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.253
but they may nevertheless
have a profound impact

00:06:14.277 --> 00:06:16.464
on how restful our sleep is.

00:06:18.273 --> 00:06:20.186
So when is loud too loud?

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.758
A good sign of too loud is
once you start changing your behavior.

00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:28.153
You may have to raise your voice
to be understood,

00:06:28.177 --> 00:06:30.405
or you increase the volume of your TV.
