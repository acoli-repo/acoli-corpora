00:03:58.354 --> 00:04:01.799
and an increased risk
for high blood pressure,

00:04:01.823 --> 00:04:03.844
heart attacks and stroke,

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:07.475
and although the overall risk increases
are relatively small,

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:10.889
this still constitutes
a major public health problem

00:04:10.913 --> 00:04:13.177
because noise is so ubiquitous,

00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:16.306
and so many people are exposed
to relevant noise levels.

00:04:17.376 --> 00:04:20.382
A recent study found that US society

00:04:20.406 --> 00:04:24.922
could save 3.9 billion dollars each year

00:04:24.946 --> 00:04:28.891
by lowering environmental
noise exposure by five decibels,

00:04:28.915 --> 00:04:32.428
just by saving costs for treating
cardiovascular disease.
