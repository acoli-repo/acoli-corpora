For example, many owners of movie theaters

00:07:01.336 --> 00:07:05.761
seem to think that only people hard
of hearing are still going to the movies.

00:07:06.296 --> 00:07:09.004
If you complain about the noise
and nothing happens,

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:11.114
demand a refund and leave.

00:07:11.138 --> 00:07:14.348
That's the language that managers
typically do understand.

00:07:15.329 --> 00:07:18.360
Also, talk to your children
about the health effects of noise

00:07:18.384 --> 00:07:22.885
and that listening to loud music today
will have consequences when they're older.

00:07:23.461 --> 00:07:26.454
You can also move your bedroom
to the quiet side of the house,

00:07:26.478 --> 00:07:29.486
where your own building shields you
from road traffic noise.
