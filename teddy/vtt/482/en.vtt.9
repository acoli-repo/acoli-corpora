just by saving costs for treating
cardiovascular disease.

00:04:33.184 --> 00:04:36.737
There are other diseases
like cancer, diabetes and obesity

00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:39.092
that have been linked to noise exposure,

00:04:39.116 --> 00:04:41.283
but we do not have enough evidence yet

00:04:41.307 --> 00:04:45.832
to, in fact, conclude that these diseases
are caused by the noise.

00:04:47.062 --> 00:04:50.553
Yet another important effect of noise
is sleep disturbance.

00:04:50.577 --> 00:04:53.615
Sleep is a very active mechanism
that recuperates us

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.052
and prepares us for the next wake period.

00:04:56.555 --> 00:05:00.698
A quiet bedroom is a cornerstone
of what sleep researchers call
