00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.648
in those who are exposed
to relevant noise levels

00:03:32.672 --> 00:03:34.803
for prolonged periods of time.

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:36.861
Noise is stress,

00:03:36.885 --> 00:03:39.956
especially if we have little
or no control over it.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.919
Our body excretes stress hormones
like adrenaline and cortisol

00:03:43.943 --> 00:03:46.831
that lead to changes
in the composition of our blood

00:03:46.855 --> 00:03:49.151
and in the structure of our blood vessels,

00:03:49.175 --> 00:03:53.380
which have been shown to be stiffer
after a single night of noise exposure.

00:03:54.103 --> 00:03:58.330
Epidemiological studies show associations
between the noise exposure

00:03:58.354 --> 00:04:01.799
and an increased risk
for high blood pressure,
