Use that information.

00:09:02.014 --> 00:09:05.985
Many people think that stronger noise
regulation and enforcement are good ideas,

00:09:06.009 --> 00:09:08.134
even obvious solutions, perhaps,

00:09:08.158 --> 00:09:10.210
but it's not as easy as you may think,

00:09:10.234 --> 00:09:13.073
because many of the activities
that generate noise

00:09:13.097 --> 00:09:14.759
also generate revenue.

00:09:15.274 --> 00:09:20.229
Think about an airport and all
the business that is associated with it.

00:09:20.801 --> 00:09:24.423
Our research tells politicians
at what noise level

00:09:24.447 --> 00:09:26.612
they can expect a certain health effect,

00:09:26.636 --> 00:09:29.210
and that helps inform better noise policy.
