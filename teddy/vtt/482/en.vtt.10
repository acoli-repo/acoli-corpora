A quiet bedroom is a cornerstone
of what sleep researchers call

00:05:00.722 --> 00:05:02.426
"a good sleep hygiene."

00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:05.908
And our auditory system
has a watchman function.

00:05:05.932 --> 00:05:09.122
It's constantly monitoring
our environment for threats,

00:05:09.146 --> 00:05:10.712
even while we're sleeping.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:16.708
So noise in the bedroom can cause a delay
in the time it takes us to fall asleep,

00:05:16.732 --> 00:05:19.154
it can wake us up during the night,

00:05:19.178 --> 00:05:22.893
and it can prevent our blood pressure
from going down during the night.

00:05:23.266 --> 00:05:26.655
We have the hypothesis that
if these noise-induced sleep disturbances

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:28.689
continue for months and years,

00:05:28.713 --> 00:05:33.310
then an increased risk for cardiovascular
disease is likely the consequence.
