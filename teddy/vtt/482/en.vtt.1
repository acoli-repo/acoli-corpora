00:00:27.142 --> 00:00:30.046
a surprisingly big price, as it turns out.

00:00:30.836 --> 00:00:34.609
Luckily, there are things
we can do right now,

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:37.515
both individually and as a society,

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:39.420
to better protect our health

00:00:39.444 --> 00:00:43.506
and give us more of the benefits
of the sounds of silence.

00:00:44.727 --> 00:00:48.735
I assume that most of you know that
too much noise is bad for your hearing.

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:52.627
Whenever you leave a concert or a bar
and you have that ringing in your ears,

00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:55.892
you can be certain that you have done
some damage to your hearing,

00:00:55.916 --> 00:00:57.066
likely permanent.

00:00:57.632 --> 00:00:59.163
And that's very important.

00:00:59.801 --> 00:01:04.413
However, noise affects our health
in many different ways beyond hearing.
