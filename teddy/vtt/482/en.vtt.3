00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:33.310
A person attending the rock concert,
being exposed to 100 decibels,

00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:35.487
does not think of the music as noise.

00:01:36.043 --> 00:01:39.985
This person likes the band, and even
paid a hundred dollars for the ticket,

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.977
so no matter how loud the music,
this person doesn't think of it as noise.

00:01:44.752 --> 00:01:49.370
In contrast, think of a person living
three blocks away from the concert hall.

00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:52.105
That person is trying to read a book,

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:55.071
but cannot concentrate
because of the music.

00:01:55.095 --> 00:01:58.809
And although the sound pressure levels
are much lower in this situation,

00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:01.649
this person still thinks
of the music as noise,
