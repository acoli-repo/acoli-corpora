I, very appropriately for this talk,

00:08:00.894 --> 00:08:03.979
attended a noise conference
in Japan four years ago.

00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:08.064
When I returned to the United States
and entered the airport,

00:08:08.088 --> 00:08:10.109
a wall of sound hit me.

00:08:10.547 --> 00:08:12.651
This tells you that
we don't realize anymore

00:08:12.675 --> 00:08:15.457
the constant degree
of noise pollution we're exposed to

00:08:15.481 --> 00:08:19.108
and how much we could profit
from more quiet spaces.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.451
What else can we do about noise?

00:08:22.975 --> 00:08:26.971
Well, very much like a carbon footprint,
we all have a noise footprint,

00:08:26.995 --> 00:08:30.346
and there are things we can do
to make that noise footprint smaller.
