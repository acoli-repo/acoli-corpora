Robert Koch supposedly once said,

00:09:32.981 --> 00:09:37.851
"One day, mankind will fight noise
as relentlessly as cholera and the pest."

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.582
I think we're there,

00:09:40.606 --> 00:09:42.957
and I hope that we will win this fight,

00:09:42.981 --> 00:09:47.207
and when we do, we can all have
a nice, quiet celebration.

00:09:47.231 --> 00:09:48.318
(Laughter)

00:09:48.342 --> 00:09:49.515
Thank you.

00:09:49.539 --> 00:09:51.736
(Applause)
