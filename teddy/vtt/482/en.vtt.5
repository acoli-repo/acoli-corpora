construction sites,

00:02:31.187 --> 00:02:33.155

In 2011, the World Health
Organization estimated

00:02:44.463 --> 00:02:50.347
that 1.6 million healthy life years
are lost every year

00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:52.920
due to exposure to environmental noise

00:02:52.944 --> 00:02:55.483

member states alone.

00:02:57.086 --> 00:03:00.653
