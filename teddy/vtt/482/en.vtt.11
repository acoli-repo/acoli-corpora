00:05:28.713 --> 00:05:33.310
then an increased risk for cardiovascular
disease is likely the consequence.

00:05:34.107 --> 00:05:38.146
However, we are often not aware
of these noise-induced sleep disturbances,

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.709
because we are unconscious
while we're sleeping.

00:05:41.137 --> 00:05:45.016
In the past, we've done studies
on the effects of traffic noise on sleep,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.139
and research subjects would often
wake up in the morning and say,

00:05:48.163 --> 00:05:50.760
"Ah, I had a wonderful night,
I fell asleep right away,

00:05:50.784 --> 00:05:52.517
never really woke up."

00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:55.344
When we would go back
to the physiological signals

00:05:55.368 --> 00:05:57.290
we had recorded during the night,

00:05:57.314 --> 00:05:59.623
we would often see numerous awakenings

00:05:59.647 --> 00:06:02.693
and a severely fragmented sleep structure.
