00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:02.770
So, well, I do applied math,

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.294
and this is a peculiar problem

00:00:04.294 --> 00:00:06.467
for anyone who does applied math, is that

00:00:06.467 --> 00:00:08.400
we are like management consultants.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.346
No one knows what the hell we do.

00:00:10.346 --> 00:00:12.620
So I am going to give you some -- attempt today

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.913
to try and explain to you what I do.

00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:18.234
So, dancing is one of the most human of activities.

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:21.916
We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers

00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:23.064
you will see later on.

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:25.754
Now, ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise

00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:28.668
and a high level of skill,

00:00:28.668 --> 00:00:31.199
and probably a level of initial suitability
