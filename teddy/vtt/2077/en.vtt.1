And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay, and finally into the Gulf of Mexico.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And I remember my first real contact with octopus

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
was probably at age five or six.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and started flashing colors,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
just pulsing all of these colors.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And as I looked at it, it kind of tucked its arms under it,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
raised into a spherical shape
