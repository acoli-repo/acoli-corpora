00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
are masters at camouflage.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
As a matter of fact,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
there's one right there.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So our first challenge was to find these things,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and that was a challenge, indeed.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
But the idea is, we were there for a month

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and I wanted to acclimate the animals to us

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So the first week was pretty much spent

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
just getting as close as we could,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
every day a little closer, a little closer, a little closer.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And you knew what the limit was: they would start getting twitchy

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and you'd back up, come back in a few hours.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And after the first week, they ignored us.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It was like, "I don't know what that thing is, but he's no threat to me."
