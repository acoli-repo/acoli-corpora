00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
could change the world.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And a small group of thoughtful people

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
changed that bay.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
I'm a big fan of grassroots organizations.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I've been to a lot of lectures

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
where, at the end of it, inevitably,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
one of the first questions that comes up is,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
"But, but what can I do?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I'm an individual. I'm one person.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And these problems are so large and global, and it's just overwhelming."

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Fair enough question.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
My answer to that is don't look

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
at the big, overwhelming issues of the world.
