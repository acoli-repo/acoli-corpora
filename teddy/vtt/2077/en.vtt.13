And I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it, or imagined that one might be,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
but whatever the case, they would leap off the bottom

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and then the web between the arms

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
would completely engulf the coral head,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and they would fish out, swim for crabs.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And as soon as the crabs touched the arm, it was lights out.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And I always wondered what happened under that web.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So we created a way to find out, (Laughter)

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and I got my first look at that famous beak in action.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
It was fantastic.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
If you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals,
