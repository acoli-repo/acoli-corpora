If you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
you might as well pick one that's fairly common.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And octopus are, they live in all the oceans.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
They also live deep.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And I can't say octopus are responsible

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
for my really strong interest

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
in getting in subs and going deep,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
but whatever the case, I like that.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
It's like nothing you've ever done.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
If you ever really want to get away from it all

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and see something that you have never seen,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and have an excellent chance of seeing something

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
no one has ever seen, get in a sub.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
You climb in, seal the hatch, turn on a little oxygen,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
turn on the scrubber,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
which removes the CO2 in the air you breathe, and they chuck you overboard.
