It was like, "I don't know what that thing is, but he's no threat to me."

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
So they went on about their business

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and from a foot away, we're watching mating

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and courting and fighting

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and it is just an unbelievable experience.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And one of the most fantastic displays

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
that I remember, or at least visually,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
was a foraging behavior.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And they had a lot of different techniques

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
that they would use for foraging,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
but this particular one used vision.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And they would see a coral head,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
maybe 10 feet away,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and start moving over toward that coral head.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it, or imagined that one might be,
