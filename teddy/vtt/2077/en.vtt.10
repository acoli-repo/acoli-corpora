00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And apparently, evolution had occurred

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
at a pretty rapid rate on One Tree,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
between the time they named it and the time I arrived,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
because I'm sure there were at least three trees

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
on that island when we were there.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Anyway, one tree is situated right next to

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
a beautiful coral reef.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
In fact, there's a surge channel

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
where the tide is moving back and forth, twice a day, pretty rapidly.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And there's a beautiful reef,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
very complex reef, with lots of animals,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
including a lot of octopus.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And not uniquely

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
but certainly, the octopus in Australia

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
are masters at camouflage.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
As a matter of fact,
