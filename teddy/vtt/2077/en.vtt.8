00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and off we went. And we did, we made a movie,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
which had to be the worst movie ever made

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
in the history of movie making,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
but it was a blast. I had so much fun.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
thinking, "Wait a minute.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Maybe I can do this all the time.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Yeah, I'll be a filmmaker."

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So I literally came back from that job,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
quit school, hung my filmmaking shingle

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
It's been a good ride.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And what I learned in school though was really beneficial.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
If you're a wildlife filmmaker

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and you're going out into the field to film animals,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
especially behavior,
