00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and he had little horns come up above his eyes.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So I went right up to the front of the tank --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I was three or four inches from the front glass --

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and the octopus was sitting on a perch, a little rock,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Anyway, there we were, staring at each other,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
from the filtration system,
