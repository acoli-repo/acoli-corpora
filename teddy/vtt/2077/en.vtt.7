00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
was that this octopus was playing,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So, about three years into my degree,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
a funny thing happened on the way to the office,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
which actually changed the course of my life.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
A man came into the aquarium. It's a long story, but essentially

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacific

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
to collect animals for him,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and as we left, he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
He said, "Make a movie about this expedition."

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
"OK, a couple of biologists making a movie --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
this'll be interesting,"

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and off we went. And we did, we made a movie,
