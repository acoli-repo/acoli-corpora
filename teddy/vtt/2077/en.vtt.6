00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
from the filtration system,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
He reaches up, takes another armful of gravel, releases it --

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
chk chk chk chk chk! -- same thing.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And then I realize the octopus won the arms race,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
because I was out and he had six left. (Laughter)

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
was that this octopus was playing,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate.
