00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and you're going out into the field to film animals,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
especially behavior,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
it helps to have a fundamental background

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
on who these animals are,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
how they work and, you know, a bit about their behaviors.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
But where I really learned about octopus

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
was in the field, as a filmmaker

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
making films with them,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
where you're allowed to spend large periods of time

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
with the animals, seeing octopus being octopus

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
in their ocean homes.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I remember I took a trip to Australia,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
went to an island called One Tree Island.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And apparently, evolution had occurred

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
at a pretty rapid rate on One Tree,
