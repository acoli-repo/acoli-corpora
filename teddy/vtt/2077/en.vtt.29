it's not isolated points on a map anymore,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
it's a network we've created.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And maybe these healing zones can start growing,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
and possibly even overlap, and good things can happen.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
So that's how I answer that question.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Look in your own backyard, in fact, look in the mirror.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
What can you do that is more responsible

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
than what you're doing now?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And do that, and spread the word.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
The vent community animals

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
can't really do much

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
about the life and death

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
that's going on where they live, but up here we can.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
In theory, we're thinking, rational human beings.
