that's going on where they live, but up here we can.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
In theory, we're thinking, rational human beings.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And we can make changes to our behavior

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
that will influence and affect the environment,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
like those people changed the health of that bay.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Now, Sylvia's TED Prize wish

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
was to beseech us to do anything we could,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
everything we could,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
to set aside not pin pricks,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
but significant expanses

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
of the ocean for preservation,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
"hope spots," she calls them.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And I applaud that. I loudly applaud that.
