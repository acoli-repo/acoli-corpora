00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
The mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
40,000 miles long, snaking around the entire globe.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And they're big mountains, thousands of feet tall,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
some of which are tens of thousands of feet

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and bust through the surface,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
creating islands like Hawaii.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And the top of this mountain range

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
is splitting apart, creating a rift valley.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And when you dive into that rift valley, that's where the action is

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
because literally thousands of active volcanoes

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
are going off at any point in time

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
all along this 40,000 mile range.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
magma, lava is coming up and filling those gaps,
