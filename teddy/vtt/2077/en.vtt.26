00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Well, how it happened is

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
the local community galvanized.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it;

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
enacted laws and made permits required

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
to do responsible construction

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
and golf course maintenance

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and the bay recovered.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
The ocean has an amazing ability

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
to recover, if we'll just leave it alone.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
I think Margaret Mead

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
said it best.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
She said that a small group of thoughtful people

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
could change the world.
