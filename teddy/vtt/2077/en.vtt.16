00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
of the mid-water community.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
You could give an entire talk

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
about the creatures that live in the mid-water.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Suffice to say though, as far as I'm concerned,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
without question, the most bizarre designs

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and outrageous behaviors

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
are in the animals that live in the mid-water community.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
But we're just going to zip right past this area,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
this area that includes about 95 percent

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
of the living space on our planet

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and go to the mid-ocean ridge, which I think is even more extraordinary.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
The mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
40,000 miles long, snaking around the entire globe.
