00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I grew up in Mobile, Alabama --

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
somebody's got to be from Mobile, right? --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
forming this beautiful delta.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And the delta has alligators crawling

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
in and out of rivers filled with fish

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and cypress trees dripping with snakes,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
birds of every flavor.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's an absolute magical wonderland to live in --

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
if you're a kid interested in animals, to grow up in.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay, and finally into the Gulf of Mexico.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And I remember my first real contact with octopus
