00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
There's no coral, algae growing on it, and the water's pea soup.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
You think, "Well, what happened?"

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And you turn around,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
and there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And over here

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
there's a golf course going in.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And this is the tropics.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
It's raining like crazy here.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
carrying with it sediments from the construction site,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
smothering the coral and killing it.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
And fertilizers and pesticides

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
are flowing into the bay from the golf course --
