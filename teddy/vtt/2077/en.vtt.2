00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And as I looked at it, it kind of tucked its arms under it,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
raised into a spherical shape

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I'm going, "My gosh!" I had never seen anything like this in my life!

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So I marveled for a moment, and then decided it was time to release him,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It landed on the bottom in the rubble

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and -- fwoosh! -- vanished

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
right before my eyes.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And I knew, right then, at age six,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that is an animal that I want to learn more about. So I did.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology,
