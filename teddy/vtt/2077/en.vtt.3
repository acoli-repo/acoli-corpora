00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate school

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
at the University of Hawaii.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And while a student at Hawaii, I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but not a lot of invertebrate displays,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and being the spineless guy, I thought, well

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I had been learning about as a student

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Now, the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
but they didn't really interact with people.
