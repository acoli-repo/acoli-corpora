00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
but they didn't really interact with people.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But the octopus did.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
If you walked up to an octopus tank,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
especially early in the morning before anyone arrived,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the octopus would rise up and look at you

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and you're thinking, "Is that guy really looking at me? He is looking at me!"

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And you walk up to the front of the tank. Then you realize

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
that these animals all have different personalities:

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Some of them would hold their ground,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and one in particular, this amazing animal ...

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I went up to the front of the tank, and he's just staring at me,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and he had little horns come up above his eyes.
