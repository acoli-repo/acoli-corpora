00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
is going on every 30 or 40 years

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
all along the ridge.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And that ephemeral nature

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
of the hydrothermal vent community

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
isn't really different from some of the

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
areas that I've seen

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
in 35 years of traveling around, making films.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And you go back, and I'm at home,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and I'm thinking, "Okay, what can I shoot ...

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Ah! I know where I can shoot that.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
There's this beautiful bay, lots of soft corals and stomatopods."

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And you show up, and it's dead.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
There's no coral, algae growing on it, and the water's pea soup.
