00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and chimneys that have tube worms

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
that might be eight to 10 feet long.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And out of the tops of these tube worms

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
are these beautiful red plumes.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And living amongst the tangle of tube worms

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
is an entire community of animals:

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
shrimp, fish, lobsters, crab,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
clams and swarms of arthropods

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
that are playing that dangerous game

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And this whole ecosystem

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
wasn't even known about

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
until 33 years ago.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And it completely threw science on its head.
