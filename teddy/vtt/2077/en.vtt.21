00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And it completely threw science on its head.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
It made scientists rethink

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
where life on Earth might have actually begun.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And before the discovery of these vents,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
all life on Earth, the key to life on Earth,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
But down there, there is no sun,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
there is no photosynthesis;

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
it's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and it's all so ephemeral.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
You might film this

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
unbelievable hydrothermal vent,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
which you think at the time has to be on another planet.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth;

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
it looks like aliens in an alien environment.
