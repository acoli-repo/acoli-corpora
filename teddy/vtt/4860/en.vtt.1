00:00:28.073 --> 00:00:31.240
and 4 million times colder
than outer space.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.901
Temperatures this low give scientists a
window into the inner workings of matter,

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:39.437
and allow engineers to build 
incredibly sensitive instruments

00:00:39.437 --> 00:00:41.292
that tell us more about everything

00:00:41.292 --> 00:00:43.130
from our exact position on the planet

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.135
to what’s happening in 
the farthest reaches of the universe.

00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:48.928
How do we create such 
extreme temperatures?

00:00:48.928 --> 00:00:51.989
In short, by slowing down 
moving particles.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.951
When we’re talking about temperature,
what we’re really talking about is motion.

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:57.716
The atoms that make up solids,

00:00:57.716 --> 00:00:58.458
liquids,

00:00:58.458 --> 00:00:59.338
and gases

00:00:59.338 --> 00:01:00.869
are moving all the time.
