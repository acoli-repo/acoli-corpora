00:02:29.924 --> 00:02:32.315
A magneto-optical trap like this

00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:35.405
can cool atoms down 
to just a few microkelvins —

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:38.785
about -273 degrees Celsius.

00:02:38.785 --> 00:02:41.609
This technique was developed in the 1980s,

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.913
and the scientists 
who'd contributed to it

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:47.931
won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997
for the discovery.

00:02:47.931 --> 00:02:52.751
Since then, laser cooling has been 
improved to reach even lower temperatures.

00:02:52.751 --> 00:02:55.990
But why would you want 
to cool atoms down that much?

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.786
First of all, cold atoms can make
very good detectors.

00:02:59.786 --> 00:03:01.530
With so little energy,
