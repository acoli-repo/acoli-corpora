00:01:27.865 --> 00:01:32.823
So instead, scientists figured out a way 
to slow the atoms down directly –

00:01:32.823 --> 00:01:34.204
with a laser beam.

00:01:34.204 --> 00:01:35.751
Under most circumstances,

00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:38.464
the energy in a laser beam 
heats things up.

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:40.533
But used in a very precise way,

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:44.813
the beam’s momentum can stall 
moving atoms, cooling them down.

00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:49.403
That’s what happens in a device 
called a magneto-optical trap.

00:01:49.403 --> 00:01:51.954
Atoms are injected into a vacuum chamber,

00:01:51.954 --> 00:01:55.415
and a magnetic field 
draws them towards the center.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:58.090
A laser beam aimed 
at the middle of the chamber

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.623
is tuned to just the right frequency
