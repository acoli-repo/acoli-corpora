00:00:06.716 --> 00:00:10.397
The coldest materials in the world 
aren’t in Antarctica.

00:00:10.397 --> 00:00:12.521
They’re not at the top of Mount Everest

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:14.376
or buried in a glacier.

00:00:14.376 --> 00:00:15.897
They’re in physics labs:

00:00:15.897 --> 00:00:20.382
clouds of gases held just fractions
of a degree above absolute zero.

00:00:20.382 --> 00:00:25.367
That’s 395 million times colder 
than your refrigerator,

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:28.073
100 million times colder 
than liquid nitrogen,

00:00:28.073 --> 00:00:31.240
and 4 million times colder
than outer space.
