00:02:59.786 --> 00:03:01.530
With so little energy,

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.961
they’re incredibly sensitive 
to fluctuations in the environment.

00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:09.562
So they’re used in devices that find 
underground oil and mineral deposits,

00:03:09.562 --> 00:03:12.203
and they also make 
highly accurate atomic clocks,

00:03:12.203 --> 00:03:15.093
like the ones used 
in global positioning satellites.

00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:18.152
Secondly, cold atoms hold 
enormous potential

00:03:18.152 --> 00:03:20.243
for probing the frontiers of physics.

00:03:20.243 --> 00:03:22.662
Their extreme sensitivity 
makes them candidates

00:03:22.662 --> 00:03:27.300
to be used to detect gravitational waves 
in future space-based detectors.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.624
They’re also useful for the study 
of atomic and subatomic phenomena,
