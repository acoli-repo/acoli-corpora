00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.623
is tuned to just the right frequency

00:02:00.623 --> 00:02:06.170
that an atom moving towards it will absorb
a photon of the laser beam and slow down.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.089
The slow down effect comes from
the transfer of momentum

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:11.108
between the atom and the photon.

00:02:11.108 --> 00:02:14.208
A total of six beams, 
in a perpendicular arrangement,

00:02:14.208 --> 00:02:18.375
ensure that atoms traveling 
in all directions will be intercepted.

00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:21.018
At the center, where the beams intersect,

00:02:21.018 --> 00:02:24.840
the atoms move sluggishly, 
as if trapped in a thick liquid —

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.924
an effect the researchers who invented it 
described as “optical molasses.”

00:02:29.924 --> 00:02:32.315
A magneto-optical trap like this
