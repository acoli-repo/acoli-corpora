00:00:59.338 --> 00:01:00.869
are moving all the time.

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:05.616
When atoms are moving more rapidly,
we perceive that matter as hot.

00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:09.147
When they’re moving more
slowly, we perceive it as cold.

00:01:09.147 --> 00:01:12.563
To make a hot object 
or gas cold in everyday life,

00:01:12.563 --> 00:01:15.960
we place it in a colder environment, 
like a refrigerator.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.498
Some of the atomic motion in the hot
object is transferred to the surroundings,

00:01:20.498 --> 00:01:22.251
and it cools down.

00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:23.788
But there’s a limit to this:

00:01:23.788 --> 00:01:27.865
even outer space is too warm
to create ultra-low temperatures.

00:01:27.865 --> 00:01:32.823
So instead, scientists figured out a way 
to slow the atoms down directly –
