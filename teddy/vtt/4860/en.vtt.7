00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.624
They’re also useful for the study 
of atomic and subatomic phenomena,

00:03:31.624 --> 00:03:35.894
which requires measuring incredibly 
tiny fluctuations in the energy of atoms.

00:03:35.894 --> 00:03:38.046
Those are drowned out 
at normal temperatures,

00:03:38.046 --> 00:03:41.090
when atoms speed around 
at hundreds of meters per second.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.265
Laser cooling can slow atoms to just 
a few centimeters per second—

00:03:45.265 --> 00:03:49.122
enough for the motion caused by
atomic quantum effects to become obvious.

00:03:49.122 --> 00:03:53.599
Ultracold atoms have already 
allowed scientists to study phenomena

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.150
like Bose-Einstein condensation,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.631
in which atoms are cooled almost 
to absolute zero

00:03:59.631 --> 00:04:02.200
and become a rare new state of matter.
