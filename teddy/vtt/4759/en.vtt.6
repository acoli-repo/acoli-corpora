00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.104
With time, the new tissue 
can reach from 50-80%

00:03:02.104 --> 00:03:04.566
of some of its original healthy function,

00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:08.818
depending on the severity of the initial 
wound and on the function itself.

00:03:08.818 --> 00:03:11.098
But because the skin
does not fully recover,

00:03:11.098 --> 00:03:15.751
scarring continues to be a major clinical
issue for doctors around the world.

00:03:15.751 --> 00:03:18.592
And even though researchers have made
significant strides

00:03:18.592 --> 00:03:20.693
in understanding the healing process,

00:03:20.693 --> 00:03:23.871
many fundamental mysteries
remain unresolved.

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:27.453
For instance, do fibroblast cells arrive
from the blood vessels

00:03:27.453 --> 00:03:30.039
or from skin tissue adjacent to the wound?
