00:01:28.952 --> 00:01:33.140
A special protein known as fibrin forms
cross-links on the top of the skin,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.449
preventing blood from flowing out
and bacteria or pathogens from getting in.

00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:41.902
After about three hours of this,
the skin begins to turn red,

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:44.828
signaling the next stage, inflammation.

00:01:44.828 --> 00:01:47.726
With bleeding under control
and the barrier secured,

00:01:47.726 --> 00:01:52.079
the body sends special cells to fight any
pathogens that may have gotten through.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.963
Among the most important of these
are white blood cells,

00:01:54.963 --> 00:01:56.732
known as macrophages,

00:01:56.732 --> 00:02:02.004
which devour bacteria and damage tissue
through a process known as phagocytosis,
