or from skin tissue adjacent to the wound?

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:32.619
And why do some other mammals, 
such as deer,

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:37.296
heal their wounds much more efficiently
and completely than humans?

00:03:37.296 --> 00:03:39.831
By finding the answers to these questions
and others,

00:03:39.831 --> 00:03:44.794
we may one day be able to heal ourselves
so well that scars will be just a memory.
