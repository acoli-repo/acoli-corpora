00:01:56.732 --> 00:02:02.004
which devour bacteria and damage tissue
through a process known as phagocytosis,

00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:05.718
in addition to producing growth factors
to spur healing.

00:02:05.718 --> 00:02:08.082
And because these tiny soldiers 
need to travel

00:02:08.082 --> 00:02:10.187
through the blood to 
get to the wound site,

00:02:10.187 --> 00:02:13.597
the previously constricted 
blood vessels now expand

00:02:13.597 --> 00:02:16.253
in a process called vasodilation.

00:02:16.253 --> 00:02:18.443
About two to three days after the wound,

00:02:18.443 --> 00:02:23.238
the proliferative stage occurs, when 
fibroblast cells begin to enter the wound.

00:02:23.238 --> 00:02:25.681
In the process of collagen deposition,

00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:29.749
they produce a fibrous protein 
called collagen in the wound site,

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.934
forming connective skin tissue
to replace the fibrin from before.
