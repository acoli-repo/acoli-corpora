00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.934
forming connective skin tissue
to replace the fibrin from before.

00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:37.717
As epidermal cells divide to reform
the outer layer of skin,

00:02:37.717 --> 00:02:40.610
the dermis contracts to close the wound.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.217
Finally, in the fourth stage 
of remodeling,

00:02:43.217 --> 00:02:47.601
the wound matures as the newly deposited
collagen is rearranged and converted

00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:49.428
into specific types.

00:02:49.428 --> 00:02:52.116
Through this process,
which can take over a year,

00:02:52.116 --> 00:02:55.231
the tensile strength of the new skin
is improved,

00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:58.639
and blood vessels and other connections
are strengthened.

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.104
With time, the new tissue 
can reach from 50-80%
