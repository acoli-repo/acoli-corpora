00:00:57.244 --> 00:01:00.664
which contains blood vessels
and the various glands and nerve endings

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:03.565
that enable the skin's many functions.

00:01:03.565 --> 00:01:06.753
And when that happens, it triggers the
four overlapping stages

00:01:06.753 --> 00:01:09.798
of the regenerative process.

00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:14.840
The first stage, hemostasis, is the skin's
response to two immediate threats:

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.446
that you're now losing blood

00:01:16.446 --> 00:01:20.256
and that the physical barrier of 
the epidermis has been compromised.

00:01:20.256 --> 00:01:23.007
As the blood vessels tighten to minimize
the bleeding,

00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:25.258
in a process known as 
vasoconstriction,

00:01:25.258 --> 00:01:28.952
both threats are averted by forming
a blood clot.

00:01:28.952 --> 00:01:33.140
A special protein known as fibrin forms
cross-links on the top of the skin,
