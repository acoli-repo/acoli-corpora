the newly healed skin will look different
from the surrounding area,

00:00:31.746 --> 00:00:36.481
and may not fully regain all 
its abilities for a while, or at all.

00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:41.097
To understand why this happens, we need to
look at the structure of the human skin.

00:00:41.097 --> 00:00:43.045
The top layer, called the epidermis,

00:00:43.045 --> 00:00:47.219
consists mostly of hardened cells,
called keratinocytes,

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.135
and provides protection.

00:00:49.135 --> 00:00:52.192
Since its outer layer is constantly being
shed and renewed,

00:00:52.192 --> 00:00:54.085
it's pretty easy to repair.

00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:57.244
But sometimes a wound penetrates
into the dermis,

00:00:57.244 --> 00:01:00.664
which contains blood vessels
and the various glands and nerve endings
