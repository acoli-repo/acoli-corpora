♫ It's nine o' clock on a Saturday ♫

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
♫ The record store's closed for the night ♫

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
♫ So I fire up the old iTunes music store ♫

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
♫ And soon I am feelin' all right ♫

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
♫ I know Steve Jobs can find me a melody ♫
