00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.518
the easier it became for them
to continue taking risks.

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:04.559
Now this confused me,

00:01:04.583 --> 00:01:07.125
but it also made me incredibly curious.

00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:09.643
So, as someone with a name

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:12.601
that literally means
"to explore knowledge,"

00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:15.292
I started searching
for a scientific explanation.

00:01:16.458 --> 00:01:19.518
Now, it's no secret
that teens ages 13 to 18

00:01:19.542 --> 00:01:23.226
are more prone to risk-taking
than children or adults,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.625
but what makes them so daring?

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.309
Do they suddenly become reckless,

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:31.893
or is this just a natural phase
that they're going through?
