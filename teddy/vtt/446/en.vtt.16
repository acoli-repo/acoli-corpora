and cause greater risk-taking.

00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:04.309
So it's the combination

00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:06.309
and the impact of habituation

00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:09.708
that is like a perfect storm
to create more damaging effects.

00:08:10.917 --> 00:08:14.518
And this research can help parents
and the general public

00:08:14.542 --> 00:08:17.684

and emotional functional changes
