00:02:58.375 --> 00:03:00.934
to answer one big question:

00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.559
Why do teens keep making
outrageous choices

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:06.375
that are harmful
to their health and well-being?

00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:10.059
But there was one big obstacle in my way.

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:12.018
To investigate this problem,

00:03:12.042 --> 00:03:14.726
I needed teenagers to experiment on,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.476
laboratories and devices
to measure their brain activity,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.059
and teachers or professors to supervise me
and guide me along the way.

00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:24.625
I needed resources.

00:03:25.417 --> 00:03:28.434
But, you see, I attended
a high school in South Dakota

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:32.184
with limited opportunity
for scientific exploration.
