00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:31.893
or is this just a natural phase
that they're going through?

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:34.226
Well neuroscientists
have already found evidence

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.184
that the teen brain
is still in the process of maturation --

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:40.684
and that this makes them
exceptionally poor at decision-making,

00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:43.208
causing them to fall prey
to risky behaviors.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.684
But in that case,
if the maturing brain is to blame,

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:50.393
then why are teens
more vulnerable than children,

00:01:50.417 --> 00:01:53.601
even though their brains
are more developed than those of children?

00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:57.476
Also, not all teens in the world
take risks at the same level.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.976
Are there some other underlying
or unintentional causes
