00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.309
Using the computer cubicles
in my school library,

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:36.893
I had them complete a computerized
decision-making simulation

00:05:36.917 --> 00:05:41.101
to measure their risk-taking behaviors
comparable to ones in the real world,

00:05:41.125 --> 00:05:44.893
like alcohol use, drug use and gambling.

00:05:44.917 --> 00:05:46.726
Wearing the EEG headset,

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.684
the students completed the test
12 times over three days

00:05:50.708 --> 00:05:53.559
to mimic repeated risk exposures.

00:05:53.583 --> 00:05:56.059
A control panel on the EEG headset

00:05:56.083 --> 00:05:58.726
measured their various
emotional responses:

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.976
like attention, interest,
excitement, frustration,
