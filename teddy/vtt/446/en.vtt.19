00:09:26.125 --> 00:09:31.268
There, I was able to present my research
to experts in neuroscience and psychology

00:09:31.292 --> 00:09:33.809
and garner valuable feedback.

00:09:33.833 --> 00:09:36.809
But perhaps the most
memorable moment of the week

00:09:36.833 --> 00:09:39.976
was when the booming speakers
suddenly uttered my name

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.542
during the awards ceremony.

00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:45.434
I was in such disbelief
that I questioned myself:

00:09:45.458 --> 00:09:48.101
Was this just another "La La Land" blunder

00:09:48.125 --> 00:09:49.393
like at the Oscars?

00:09:49.417 --> 00:09:50.851
(Laughter)

00:09:50.875 --> 00:09:53.143
Luckily, it wasn't.

00:09:53.167 --> 00:09:55.101
I really had won first place

00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:57.643
in the category "Behavioral
and Social Sciences."

00:09:57.667 --> 00:10:02.375
(Applause)
