Have you ever tried
to understand a teenager?

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:06.976
It's exhausting, right?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.518
You must be puzzled by the fact
that some teens do well in school,

00:00:11.542 --> 00:00:13.434
lead clubs and teams

00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:15.809
and volunteer in their communities,

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:19.768
but they eat Tide Pods
for an online challenge,

00:00:19.792 --> 00:00:22.226
speed and text while driving,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.250
binge drink and experiment
with illicit drugs.

00:00:26.083 --> 00:00:31.476
How can so many teens
be so smart, skilled and responsible --
