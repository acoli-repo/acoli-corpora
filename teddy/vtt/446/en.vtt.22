00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:01.768
for completing my project.

00:11:01.792 --> 00:11:04.851
And these lessons
have led me to new ideas

00:11:04.875 --> 00:11:08.434
like: Is the opposite
of negative risk-taking also true?

00:11:08.458 --> 00:11:12.434
Can positive risk-taking
escalate with repeated exposures?

00:11:12.458 --> 00:11:16.643
Does positive action
build positive brain functioning?

00:11:16.667 --> 00:11:20.226
I think I just might have
my next research idea.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:26.458
