How can so many teens
be so smart, skilled and responsible --

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.101
and careless risk-takers at the same time?

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:36.809
When I was 16,

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:39.518
while frequently observing
my peers in person

00:00:39.542 --> 00:00:41.684
as well as on social media,

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:45.750
I began to wonder why so many teens
took such crazy risks.

00:00:46.583 --> 00:00:50.434
It seems like getting a certificate
from DARE class in the fifth grade

00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:51.768
can't stop them.

00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:52.851
(Laughter)

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:54.476
What was even more alarming to me

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.226
was that the more they exposed
themselves to these harmful risks,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.518
the easier it became for them
to continue taking risks.
