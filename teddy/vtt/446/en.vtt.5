could be applied to the relentless
rise of risk-taking in teenagers.

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:37.434
So I predicted that
habituation to risk-taking

may have the potential to change
the already-vulnerable teenage brain

00:02:41.417 --> 00:02:43.559
by blunting or even eradicating

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:46.268
the negative emotions
associated with risk,

00:02:46.292 --> 00:02:47.625
like fear or guilt.

00:02:48.292 --> 00:02:51.643
I also thought because they
would feel less fearful and guilty,

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:55.167
this desensitization would lead them
to even more risk-taking.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.351
In short, I wanted to conduct
a research study

00:02:58.375 --> 00:03:00.934
to answer one big question:
