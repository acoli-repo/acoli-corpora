00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.976
Are there some other underlying
or unintentional causes

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.458
driving them to risk-taking?

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:06.875
Well, this is exactly
what I decided to research.

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:11.559
So, I founded my research
on the basis of a psychological process

00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:13.518
known as "habituation,"

00:02:13.542 --> 00:02:16.625
or simply what we refer to
as "getting used to it."

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:21.143
Habituation explains how our brains
adapt to some behaviors,

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:24.476
like lying, with repeated exposures.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.768
And this concept inspired me
to design a project

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:29.184
to determine if the same principle

00:02:29.208 --> 00:02:34.101
could be applied to the relentless
rise of risk-taking in teenagers.
