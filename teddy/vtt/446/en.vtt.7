00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:32.184
with limited opportunity
for scientific exploration.

00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:34.309
My school had athletics,

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:38.101
band, choir, debate and other clubs,

00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:41.434
but there were no STEM programs
or research mentors.

00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:43.059
And the notion of high schoolers

00:03:43.083 --> 00:03:47.792
doing research or participating
in a science fair was completely foreign.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.643
Simply put, I didn't exactly
have the ingredients

00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:53.875
to make a chef-worthy dish.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.184
And these obstacles were frustrating,

00:03:57.208 --> 00:04:00.184
but I was also a stubborn teenager.
