00:03:57.208 --> 00:04:00.184
but I was also a stubborn teenager.

00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:02.726
And as the daughter
of Bangladeshi immigrants

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.851
and one of just a handful
of Muslim students

00:04:04.875 --> 00:04:07.059
in my high school in South Dakota,

00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:09.309
I often struggled to fit in.

00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:13.768
And I wanted to be someone
with something to contribute to society,

00:04:13.792 --> 00:04:16.559
not just be deemed
the scarf-wearing brown girl

00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:18.791
who was an anomaly
in my homogenous hometown.

00:04:19.708 --> 00:04:21.434
I hoped that by doing this research,

00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:22.893
I could establish this

00:04:22.917 --> 00:04:27.309
and how valuable scientific exploration
could be for kids like me

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:29.833
who didn't necessarily
find their niche elsewhere.
