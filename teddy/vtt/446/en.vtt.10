00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.726
ended up as my cheerleader,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.309
becoming my mentor
to sign necessary paperwork.

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:07.393
And when it became logistically impossible

00:05:07.417 --> 00:05:10.518
to use a laboratory
electroencephalography,

00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:11.851
or EEG,

00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:16.101
which are those electrode devices
used to measure emotional responses,

00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:19.268
I bought a portable EEG headset
with my own money,

00:05:19.292 --> 00:05:20.934
instead of buying the new iPhone X

00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:23.250
that a lot of kids my age
were saving up for.

00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:26.434
So finally I started the research

00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:29.792
with 86 students,
ages 13 to 18, from my high school.
