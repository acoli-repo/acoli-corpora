00:08:31.292 --> 00:08:35.625
that drive and control and influence
their over-the-top risk-taking.

00:08:36.667 --> 00:08:40.393
So yes, we need policies
that provide safer environments

00:08:40.417 --> 00:08:43.018
and limit exposures to high risks,

00:08:43.042 --> 00:08:46.292
but we also need policies
that reflect this insight.

00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:50.476
These results are
a wake-up call for teens, too.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.976
It shows them that the natural
and necessary fear and guilt

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.851
that protect them from unsafe situations

00:08:56.875 --> 00:09:00.667
actually become numb when they
repeatedly choose risky behaviors.
