Does this influence habitability?

00:08:03.175 --> 00:08:04.477
Well, how might it?

00:08:05.024 --> 00:08:07.628
Many scientists think
that a magnetic field of a planet

00:08:07.652 --> 00:08:10.047
serves as a shield for the atmosphere,

00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:13.426
deflecting solar wind particles
around the planet

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.265
in a bit of a force field-type effect

00:08:15.289 --> 00:08:17.989
having to do with electric charge
of those particles.

00:08:18.362 --> 00:08:21.989
I like to think of it instead
as a salad bar sneeze guard for planets.

00:08:22.013 --> 00:08:24.292
(Laughter)

00:08:24.962 --> 00:08:28.343
And yes, my colleagues
who watch this later will realize

00:08:28.367 --> 00:08:30.911
this is the first time in the history
