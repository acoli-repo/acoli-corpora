00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.904
riverbeds carved by flowing, liquid water;

00:04:33.515 --> 00:04:38.401
riverbeds that take hundreds or thousands
or tens of thousands of years to form.

00:04:38.425 --> 00:04:40.043
This can't happen on Mars today.

00:04:40.067 --> 00:04:42.548
The atmosphere of Mars today
is too thin and too cold

00:04:42.572 --> 00:04:44.713
for water to be stable as a liquid.

00:04:44.737 --> 00:04:49.085
This one image tells you
that the atmosphere of Mars changed,

00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:51.141
and it changed in big ways.

00:04:51.714 --> 00:04:56.523
And it changed from a state
that we would define as habitable,

00:04:56.547 --> 00:05:00.137
because the three requirements
for life were present long ago.
