00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.838
and that you're going to be able
to determine the best candidates

00:13:00.862 --> 00:13:03.261
for habitable planets,
and those that are not.

00:13:04.139 --> 00:13:06.854
In the end, and for now, at least,

00:13:06.878 --> 00:13:09.665
this is our red spot, right here.

00:13:10.376 --> 00:13:13.712
This is the only planet
that we know of that's habitable,

00:13:13.736 --> 00:13:16.927
although very soon we may
come to know of more.

00:13:16.951 --> 00:13:19.687
But for now, this is
the only habitable planet,

00:13:19.711 --> 00:13:21.013
and this is our red spot.

00:13:21.976 --> 00:13:23.396
I'm really glad we're here.

00:13:24.507 --> 00:13:25.682
Thanks.

00:13:25.706 --> 00:13:28.937
