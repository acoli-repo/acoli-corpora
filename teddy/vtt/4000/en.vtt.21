00:10:29.714 --> 00:10:30.872
or not.

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:33.161
Once we have that answer,
why should you care?

00:10:33.185 --> 00:10:34.485
I mean, I care deeply ...

00:10:36.128 --> 00:10:38.134
And financially as well, but deeply.

00:10:38.158 --> 00:10:40.000
(Laughter)

00:10:40.763 --> 00:10:42.681
First of all, an answer to this question

00:10:42.705 --> 00:10:44.808
will teach us more
about these three planets,

00:10:44.832 --> 00:10:45.992
Venus, Earth and Mars,

00:10:46.016 --> 00:10:48.927
not only about how they interact
with their environment today,

00:10:48.951 --> 00:10:50.878
but how they were billions of years ago,

00:10:50.902 --> 00:10:52.964
whether they were habitable
long ago or not.

00:10:52.988 --> 00:10:54.632
It will teach us about atmospheres

00:10:54.656 --> 00:10:56.651
that surround us and that are close.

00:10:57.127 --> 00:10:59.311
But moreover, what we learn
from these planets

00:10:59.335 --> 00:11:01.356
can be applied to atmospheres everywhere,
