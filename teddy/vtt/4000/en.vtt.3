Complex life like us derives
our energy from the sun,

00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:33.518
but life deep underground
can get its energy

00:01:33.542 --> 00:01:35.264
from things like chemical reactions.

00:01:35.288 --> 00:01:37.439
There are a number
of different energy sources

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:38.706
available on all planets.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.556
On the other side,

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.285
all life needs food or nourishment.

00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:48.215
And this seems like a tall order,
especially if you want a succulent tomato.

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:49.955
(Laughter)

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.045
However, all life on Earth
derives its nourishment

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.099
from only six chemical elements,

00:01:55.123 --> 00:01:58.127
and these elements can be found
on any planetary body

00:01:58.151 --> 00:01:59.487
in our solar system.
