00:10:59.335 --> 00:11:01.356
can be applied to atmospheres everywhere,

00:11:02.485 --> 00:11:05.398
including planets that we're now
observing around other stars.

00:11:05.422 --> 00:11:07.177
For example, the Kepler spacecraft,

00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:10.409
which is built and controlled
here in Boulder,

00:11:10.433 --> 00:11:13.718
has been observing
a postage stamp-sized region of the sky

00:11:13.742 --> 00:11:14.989
for a couple years now,

00:11:15.013 --> 00:11:17.241
and it's found thousands of planets --

00:11:17.265 --> 00:11:20.178
in one postage stamp-sized
region of the sky

00:11:20.202 --> 00:11:24.291
that we don't think is any different
from any other part of the sky.

00:11:24.815 --> 00:11:26.625
We've gone, in 20 years,

00:11:26.649 --> 00:11:30.686
from knowing of zero planets
outside of our solar system,
