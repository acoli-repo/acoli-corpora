00:05:59.145 --> 00:06:02.148
They get enough energy
to escape and break free

00:06:02.172 --> 00:06:04.672
from the gravity of the planet
just by warming.

00:06:04.696 --> 00:06:07.858
A second way they can get energy
is from the solar wind.

00:06:07.882 --> 00:06:12.908
These are particles, mass, material,
spit out from the surface of the sun,

00:06:12.932 --> 00:06:15.336
and they go screaming
through the solar system

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.145
at 400 kilometers per second,

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.763
sometimes faster during solar storms,

00:06:19.787 --> 00:06:22.509
and they go hurtling
through interplanetary space

00:06:22.533 --> 00:06:24.979
towards planets and their atmospheres,

00:06:25.003 --> 00:06:26.628
and they may provide energy

00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:28.780
for atmospheric particles
to escape as well.

00:06:29.182 --> 00:06:31.151
This is something that I'm interested in,
