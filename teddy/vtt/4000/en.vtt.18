00:08:59.059 --> 00:09:02.048
Other scientists think
that magnetic fields

00:09:02.072 --> 00:09:04.235
may act more like the sails on a ship,

00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:09.995
enabling the planet to interact
with more energy from the solar wind

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:13.291
than the planet would have been able
to interact with by itself.

00:09:13.315 --> 00:09:15.806
The sails may gather energy
from the solar wind.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.496
The magnetic field may gather
energy from the solar wind

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.764
that allows even more
atmospheric escape to happen.

00:09:21.788 --> 00:09:24.042
It's an idea that has to be tested,

00:09:24.066 --> 00:09:25.951
but the effect and how it works

00:09:25.975 --> 00:09:27.126
seems apparent.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.301
That's because we know

00:09:28.325 --> 00:09:31.400
energy from the solar wind
is being deposited into our atmosphere
