00:04:56.547 --> 00:05:00.137
because the three requirements
for life were present long ago.

00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:03.117
Where did that atmosphere go

00:05:03.141 --> 00:05:05.961
that allowed water
to be liquid at the surface?

00:05:05.985 --> 00:05:09.332
Well, one idea is it escaped
away to space.

00:05:09.356 --> 00:05:12.023
Atmospheric particles
got enough energy to break free

00:05:12.047 --> 00:05:13.700
from the gravity of the planet,

00:05:13.724 --> 00:05:16.413
escaping away to space, never to return.

00:05:16.437 --> 00:05:19.125
And this happens with all bodies
with atmospheres.

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:20.321
Comets have tails

00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:23.602
that are incredibly visible reminders
of atmospheric escape.

00:05:23.626 --> 00:05:27.035
But Venus also has an atmosphere
that escapes with time,

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:28.719
and Mars and Earth as well.

00:05:28.743 --> 00:05:31.711
It's just a matter of degree
and a matter of scale.
