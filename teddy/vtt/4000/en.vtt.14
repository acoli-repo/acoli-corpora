This thing that you've accepted
your entire life,

00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:03.601
when you think about it a little bit more,
may not be so simple.

00:07:04.513 --> 00:07:08.541
And of course, distance of a planet
from the sun determines its temperature.

00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:10.831
This has to play into habitability.

00:07:10.855 --> 00:07:13.785
But maybe there are other things

00:07:13.809 --> 00:07:15.425
Maybe it's the bowls themselves

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.505

00:07:20.765 --> 00:07:23.630
I could talk to you about a lot
of different characteristics

00:07:23.654 --> 00:07:24.805
of these three planets

00:07:24.829 --> 00:07:26.398
that may influence habitability,

00:07:26.422 --> 00:07:29.016
but for selfish reasons related
to my own research

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.628
and the fact that I'm standing up here
holding the clicker and you're not --
