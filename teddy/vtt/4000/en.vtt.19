00:09:28.325 --> 00:09:31.400
energy from the solar wind
is being deposited into our atmosphere

00:09:31.424 --> 00:09:32.575
here on Earth.

00:09:32.599 --> 00:09:35.004
That energy is conducted
along magnetic field lines

00:09:35.028 --> 00:09:36.376
down into the polar regions,

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.536
resulting in incredibly beautiful aurora.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.216
If you've ever experienced them,
it's magnificent.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.246
We know the energy is getting in.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.303
We're trying to measure
how many particles are getting out

00:09:46.327 --> 00:09:49.365
and if the magnetic field
is influencing this in any way.

00:09:50.722 --> 00:09:53.102
So I've posed a problem for you here,

00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:54.672
but I don't have a solution yet.

00:09:54.696 --> 00:09:55.972
We don't have a solution.

00:09:56.702 --> 00:09:59.059
But we're working on it.
How are we working on it?

00:09:59.083 --> 00:10:01.381
Well, we've sent spacecraft
to all three planets.
