from knowing of zero planets
outside of our solar system,

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.463

which ones to investigate first.

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:38.729
Any lever will help.

00:11:40.539 --> 00:11:44.123
In fact, based on observations
that Kepler's taken

00:11:44.147 --> 00:11:46.276
and other similar observations,

In addition to that,
