00:05:28.743 --> 00:05:31.711
It's just a matter of degree
and a matter of scale.

00:05:32.092 --> 00:05:34.768
So we'd like to figure out
how much escaped over time

00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:36.908
so we can explain this transition.

00:05:36.932 --> 00:05:39.543
How do atmospheres
get their energy for escape?

00:05:39.567 --> 00:05:41.698
How do particles get
enough energy to escape?

00:05:41.722 --> 00:05:44.907
There are two ways, if we're going
to reduce things a little bit.

00:05:44.931 --> 00:05:46.082
Number one, sunlight.

00:05:46.106 --> 00:05:49.518
Light emitted from the sun can be absorbed
by atmospheric particles

00:05:49.542 --> 00:05:51.256
and warm the particles.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.388
Yes, I'm dancing, but they --

00:05:53.412 --> 00:05:54.883
(Laughter)

00:05:55.693 --> 00:05:57.605
Oh my God, not even at my wedding.

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:59.121
(Laughter)

00:05:59.145 --> 00:06:02.148
They get enough energy
to escape and break free
