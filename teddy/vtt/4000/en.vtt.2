00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:02.045
This is a question I've wanted
to know the answer to

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:03.323
since I was a small child,

00:01:03.347 --> 00:01:05.379
and I suspect 80 percent
of this auditorium

00:01:05.403 --> 00:01:08.411
has thought the same thing
and also wanted to know the answer.

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:11.046
To understand whether
there are any planets --

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.348
out there in our solar system or beyond --

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:14.830
that can support life,

00:01:14.854 --> 00:01:18.051
the first step is to understand
what life here requires.

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:22.138
It turns out, of all of those
8.7 million species,

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:24.360
life only needs three things.

00:01:25.032 --> 00:01:27.884
On one side, all life
on Earth needs energy.

00:01:27.908 --> 00:01:31.393
Complex life like us derives
our energy from the sun,
