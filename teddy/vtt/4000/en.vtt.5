00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.693
Other solar system bodies
might have abundant liquid water,

00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:33.052
even more than Earth,

00:02:33.076 --> 00:02:35.526
but it's trapped beneath an icy shell,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.811
and so it's hard to access,
it's hard to get to,

00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:40.554
it's hard to even find out
if there's any life there.

00:02:41.475 --> 00:02:44.470
So that leaves a few bodies
that we should think about.

00:02:44.494 --> 00:02:46.923
So let's make the problem
simpler for ourselves.

00:02:46.947 --> 00:02:50.288
Let's think only about liquid water
on the surface of a planet.

00:02:50.312 --> 00:02:53.268
There are only three bodies
to think about in our solar system,

00:02:53.292 --> 00:02:55.874
with regard to liquid water
on the surface of a planet,

00:02:55.898 --> 00:03:00.724
and in order of distance from the sun,
it's: Venus, Earth and Mars.
