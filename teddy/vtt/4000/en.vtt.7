00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:31.648
where life can survive
in our solar system.

00:03:32.296 --> 00:03:33.896
It's a Goldilocks-type problem,

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.410
and it's so simple
that a child could understand it.

00:03:37.452 --> 00:03:38.632
However,

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.378
I'd like to remind you of two things

00:03:42.402 --> 00:03:45.356
from the Goldilocks story
that we may not think about so often

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.476
but that I think are really relevant here.

00:03:48.056 --> 00:03:49.206
Number one:

00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:53.103
if Mama Bear's bowl is too cold

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:55.841
when Goldilocks walks into the room,

00:03:56.642 --> 00:03:58.785
does that mean it's always been too cold?

00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:03.093
Or could it have been just right
at some other time?
