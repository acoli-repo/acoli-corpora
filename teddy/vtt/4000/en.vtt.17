00:08:28.367 --> 00:08:30.911
this is the first time in the history
of our community

00:08:30.935 --> 00:08:33.214
that the solar wind has been
equated with mucus.

00:08:33.238 --> 00:08:34.888
(Laughter)

00:08:36.978 --> 00:08:40.453
OK, so the effect, then, is that Earth
may have been protected

00:08:40.477 --> 00:08:41.646
for billions of years,

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:43.520
because we've had a magnetic field.

00:08:43.544 --> 00:08:45.723
Atmosphere hasn't been able to escape.

00:08:45.747 --> 00:08:47.854
Mars, on the other hand,
has been unprotected

00:08:47.878 --> 00:08:49.720
because of its lack of magnetic field,

00:08:49.744 --> 00:08:51.696
and over billions of years,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.900
maybe enough atmosphere
has been stripped away

00:08:53.924 --> 00:08:56.517
to account for a transition
from a habitable planet

00:08:56.541 --> 00:08:58.207
to the planet that we see today.

00:08:59.059 --> 00:09:02.048
Other scientists think
that magnetic fields
