00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:03.093
Or could it have been just right
at some other time?

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.331
When Goldilocks walks into the room
determines the answer

00:04:07.355 --> 00:04:08.687
that we get in the story.

00:04:09.114 --> 00:04:10.844
And the same is true with planets.

00:04:10.868 --> 00:04:12.894
They're not static things. They change.

00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:14.660
They vary. They evolve.

00:04:14.684 --> 00:04:16.727
And atmospheres do the same.

00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:18.453
So let me give you an example.

00:04:18.477 --> 00:04:20.479
Here's one of my favorite
pictures of Mars.

00:04:20.503 --> 00:04:23.634
It's not the highest resolution image,
it's not the sexiest image,

00:04:23.658 --> 00:04:25.161
it's not the most recent image,

00:04:25.185 --> 00:04:28.679
but it's an image that shows riverbeds
cut into the surface of the planet;

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.904
riverbeds carved by flowing, liquid water;
