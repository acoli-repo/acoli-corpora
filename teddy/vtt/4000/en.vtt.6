00:02:55.898 --> 00:03:00.724
and in order of distance from the sun,
it's: Venus, Earth and Mars.

00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:04.637
You want to have an atmosphere
for water to be liquid.

00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:07.039
You have to be very careful
with that atmosphere.

00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:10.475
You can't have too much atmosphere,
too thick or too warm an atmosphere,

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:13.404
because then you end up
too hot like Venus,

00:03:13.428 --> 00:03:15.165
and you can't have liquid water.

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.142
But if you have too little atmosphere
and it's too thin and too cold,

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:21.190
you end up like Mars, too cold.

00:03:21.865 --> 00:03:24.340
So Venus is too hot, Mars is too cold,

00:03:24.364 --> 00:03:25.528
and Earth is just right.

00:03:25.552 --> 00:03:29.027
You can look at these images behind me
and you can see automatically

00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:31.648
where life can survive
in our solar system.
