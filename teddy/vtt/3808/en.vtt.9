00:04:28.407 --> 00:04:30.015
We were very grateful.

00:04:30.015 --> 00:04:31.678
We settled and we liked it.

00:04:31.678 --> 00:04:33.937
We were like, "We're home, we're here."

00:04:33.937 --> 00:04:36.571
Then somebody took us to Rundle Mall.

00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:37.880
Adelaide has only one mall.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.946
It's this small place.

00:04:41.106 --> 00:04:43.028
And we saw a lot of Asian people.

00:04:43.028 --> 00:04:45.230
My mom said all of a sudden, panicking,

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.496
"You brought us to the wrong place.
You must take us back to Australia."

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.851
Yeah. It had to be explained to her that 
there were a lot of Asians in Australia

00:04:56.851 --> 00:04:58.509
and we were in the right place.

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.411
So fine, it's all good.
