00:00:26.888 --> 00:00:30.096
I don't have any diamonds 
on me, by the way.

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:33.355
If you have heard of Ebola,
well, that's in Sierra Leone as well.

00:00:33.355 --> 00:00:35.113
I don't have Ebola. You're all safe.

00:00:35.113 --> 00:00:36.527
Don't rush to the door.

00:00:36.527 --> 00:00:40.437
Be seated. You're fine.
I was checked before I got here.

00:00:41.397 --> 00:00:44.246
My grandfather had three wives.

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:46.575
Don't ask me why a man
needs more than one wife.

00:00:46.575 --> 00:00:48.584
Men, do you need more than one wife?

00:00:48.584 --> 00:00:50.292
I don't think so. There you go.

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:53.926
He was looking for a heart attack,
that's what I say.

00:00:53.926 --> 00:00:55.559
Oh yeah, he was.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.452
When I was three, war broke out
in Sierra Leone in 1991.
