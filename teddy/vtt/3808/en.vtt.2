When I was three, war broke out
in Sierra Leone in 1991.

00:01:00.452 --> 00:01:04.428
I remember literally going to bed
one night, everything was good.

00:01:04.428 --> 00:01:06.140
The next day, I woke up,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.081
bombs were dropping everywhere,

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:10.662
and people were trying
to kill me and my family.

00:01:10.662 --> 00:01:15.465
We escaped the war and ended up
in Gambia, in West Africa.

00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:18.335
Ebola is there as well. Stay away from it.

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:20.868
While we were there as refugees,

00:01:20.868 --> 00:01:24.684
we didn't know what
was going to become of us.

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:26.573
My mom applied for refugee status.

00:01:26.573 --> 00:01:29.304
She's a wonderful, smart woman, that one,

00:01:29.304 --> 00:01:30.583
and we were lucky.
