00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.463
so they went unanswered.

00:12:31.463 --> 00:12:34.092
When I started having my period
around the age of 14,

00:12:34.092 --> 00:12:37.973
I realized I didn't have 
normal periods because of FGM.

00:12:37.973 --> 00:12:43.719
My periods were heavy, they were long,
and they were very painful.

00:12:43.726 --> 00:12:45.709
Then they told me I had fibroids.

00:12:45.709 --> 00:12:48.336
They're like these little balls
sitting there.

00:12:48.336 --> 00:12:51.080
One was covering one of my ovaries.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.165
And there came then the big news.

00:12:54.165 --> 00:12:57.416
"We don't think you can
have children, Khadija."

00:12:57.416 --> 00:13:02.138
And once again, I was
an angry black woman.
