00:01:29.304 --> 00:01:30.583
and we were lucky.

00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:33.393
Australia said, we will take you in.

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:35.129
Good job, Aussies.

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:39.350
Before we were meant to travel,

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.192
my mom came home one day, and said,

00:01:41.192 --> 00:01:44.370
"We're going on 
a little holiday, a little trip."

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.668
She put us in a car,

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:49.273
and we drove for hours
and ended up in a bush

00:01:49.273 --> 00:01:51.928
in a remote area in Gambia.

00:01:53.568 --> 00:01:55.677
In this bush, we found two huts.

00:01:56.447 --> 00:01:59.899
An old lady came towards us.

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.646
She was ethnic-looking, very old.
