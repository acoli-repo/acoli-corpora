00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:33.684
It wasn't the same as my chocolate,
though. Not the same.

00:05:33.684 --> 00:05:36.382
Settling in Australia was quite hard,

00:05:36.382 --> 00:05:39.700
but it became harder when I started
volunteering for an organization

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.212
called Women's Health Statewide,

00:05:43.552 --> 00:05:46.411
and I joined their
female genital mutilation program

00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:50.161
without any awareness of what
this program was actually about,

00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:52.616
or that it related to me in any way.

00:05:52.616 --> 00:05:55.566
I spent months educating
nurses and doctors

00:05:55.566 --> 00:05:58.103
about what female genital mutilation was

00:05:58.103 --> 00:05:59.592
and where it was practiced:

00:05:59.592 --> 00:06:04.866
Africa, the Middle East, Asia,
and now, Australia and London and America,
