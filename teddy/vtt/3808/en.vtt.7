00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:31.460
as if it was the most disgusting thing
she's ever touched.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.966
They both got off me,
and left me there bleeding,

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:40.811
crying, and confused
as to what just happened.

00:03:41.703 --> 00:03:43.805
We never talked about this again.

00:03:43.805 --> 00:03:47.280
Very soon, we found
that we were coming to Australia,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.015
and this is when you had
the Sydney Olympics at the time,

00:03:50.015 --> 00:03:52.572
and people said we were going
to the end of the world,

00:03:52.572 --> 00:03:54.669
there was nowhere else
to go after Australia.

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.294
Yeah, that comforted us a bit.

00:03:57.294 --> 00:03:59.607
It took us three days to get here.

00:03:59.607 --> 00:04:04.335
We went to Senegal, then France,
and then Singapore.
