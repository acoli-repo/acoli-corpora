00:09:59.151 --> 00:10:01.969
And we're going to put
ourselves in a position

00:10:01.969 --> 00:10:04.853
to search for an amazing coincidence.

00:10:04.853 --> 00:10:06.793
Do you mind, can you help me with this?

00:10:06.793 --> 00:10:09.447
Go ahead and take some cards and shuffle.

00:10:09.447 --> 00:10:11.993
And do you mind, can you
take some cards and shuffle?

00:10:11.993 --> 00:10:14.024
You can take some cards and shuffle.

00:10:14.024 --> 00:10:16.102
You can shuffle cards
in a variety of ways.

00:10:16.102 --> 00:10:17.634
You can shuffle cards like this.

00:10:17.634 --> 00:10:19.815
You can shuffle cards
in a more messed up way,

00:10:19.815 --> 00:10:20.870
something like this.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.913
You can shuffle cards in the American way.

00:10:22.913 --> 00:10:26.246
As a Portuguese, I don't feel entitled
to teach you guys how to do it.

00:10:26.246 --> 00:10:28.698
But the important part is
after shuffling the cards,

00:10:28.698 --> 00:10:30.951
always remember
to cut and complete the cards.
