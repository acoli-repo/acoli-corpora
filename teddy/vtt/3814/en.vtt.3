00:01:26.828 --> 00:01:31.011
And my answer is: I think we stop
thinking too soon.

00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:33.031
I'll give you a clear little example,

00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:37.164
something that people used to do
around the turn of the century --

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:39.570
not this century, the other one.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.574
The idea was to take a piece of paper

00:01:42.574 --> 00:01:47.802
and fold it inside out
using only your weaker hand,

00:01:47.802 --> 00:01:49.657
in my case, the left hand.

00:01:49.657 --> 00:01:54.113
Something that would look like this.
