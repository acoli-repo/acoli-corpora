00:11:59.242 --> 00:12:02.485
What is the first number after the letter?

00:12:02.485 --> 00:12:03.985
Audience member 4: Seven.

00:12:03.985 --> 00:12:05.884
HG: Seven.

00:12:05.884 --> 00:12:07.286
Seven.

00:12:08.529 --> 00:12:11.509
But, that's maybe just one coincidence.

00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:14.131
What is the second number?
Audience member 4: Nine.

00:12:14.131 --> 00:12:17.921
So after the seven, we have a nine.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:20.506
And after the nine?

00:12:20.506 --> 00:12:21.613
Audience member 4: Two.

00:12:21.613 --> 00:12:23.633

00:12:23.633 --> 00:12:24.875
Audience member 4: Three.

00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:26.518
HG: Three, and after?

00:12:26.518 --> 00:12:28.484
Audience member 4: Three.
HG: Three.

00:12:28.484 --> 00:12:30.540
Audience member 4: Seven.
HG: Seven.
