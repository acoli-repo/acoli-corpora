00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.231
Now -- no, no, no.

00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:45.698
Sturgeon may be correct.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:47.996
But he doesn't have to be correct forever.

00:02:47.996 --> 00:02:49.214
Things can always change.

00:02:49.214 --> 00:02:51.291
Sir, what was the card?

00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:53.410
The 10 of hearts?

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.573
There's this to prove that things
can always change --

00:02:58.573 --> 00:03:00.839
the 10 of hearts.
