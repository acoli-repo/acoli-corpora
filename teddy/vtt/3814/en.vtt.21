00:10:28.698 --> 00:10:30.951
always remember
to cut and complete the cards.

00:10:30.951 --> 00:10:32.663
Do you mind doing that for me, sir?

00:10:32.663 --> 00:10:33.859
Please cut and complete.

00:10:33.859 --> 00:10:36.521
And when you have it,
place the cards up in the air.

00:10:36.521 --> 00:10:38.760
And you too, cut and complete
and up in the air.

00:10:38.784 --> 00:10:40.025
Up in the air.

00:10:40.025 --> 00:10:44.403
A deck of cards cut and shuffled
by one, two, three, four and five people.

00:10:44.403 --> 00:10:48.964
Now, very clearly, I'm going
to gather the deck together.

00:10:50.494 --> 00:10:53.233
And just like that.

00:10:54.163 --> 00:11:00.345
I'm going to search for a coincidence
in front of everyone.
