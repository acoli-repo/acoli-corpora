00:06:25.607 --> 00:06:30.362
that later, I would realize
was actually a secret.

00:06:31.903 --> 00:06:34.743
The old man stood up, he left.

00:06:34.743 --> 00:06:36.103
I never saw him again.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:40.462
But he left his notebook

00:06:40.462 --> 00:06:42.373
that was there from the beginning.

00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:45.566
And when I picked it up,

00:06:45.566 --> 00:06:51.150
that was the best secret
I've ever experienced.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.401
We are defined by the secrets we keep

00:06:56.401 --> 00:06:58.552
and by the secrets we share.

00:06:58.552 --> 00:07:03.417
And this was his way
of sharing a secret with me.
