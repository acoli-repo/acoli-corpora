00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:31.961
I have a playing card in my hand.

00:00:32.806 --> 00:00:36.776
Freely name any card in the deck.

00:00:37.577 --> 00:00:39.229
Audience member: 10 of hearts.

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:40.916
Helder Guimarães: 10 of hearts.

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:43.019
You could have named any card in the deck,

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.295
but you said the 10 of hearts.

00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:47.830
Ninety percent of everything is crap,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.703
so there's this to prove that
Sturgeon was correct.

00:00:51.703 --> 00:00:53.218
(Laughter)

00:00:53.218 --> 00:00:57.011
(Applause)

00:00:57.011 --> 00:01:00.804
(Laughter)
