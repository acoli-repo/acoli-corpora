He said, "It could be a high spade
or a low spade."

00:04:30.954 --> 00:04:32.819
And my answer was ...

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:34.517
Audience member 2: A high spade.

00:04:34.517 --> 00:04:37.197
HG: Indeed! It was a high spade.

00:04:37.197 --> 00:04:39.650
Since it's a high spade,
it could be a nine, a 10,

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.573
a jack, king, queen or the ace of spades.

00:04:42.573 --> 00:04:44.418
And my answer was ...

00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:46.159
Audience member 2: The king.

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:49.211
HG: The king of spades, indeed.

00:04:50.275 --> 00:04:51.417
Now sir, let's be fair.

00:04:51.417 --> 00:04:54.421
You selected black, you selected spade,

00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:57.011
you selected the high spade,
and you selected -- sorry?

00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:59.130
Audience member 2: King.
HG: King of spades.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.334
Did you feel I influenced you
in any decision?
