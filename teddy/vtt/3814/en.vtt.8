00:04:03.025 --> 00:04:07.157
Perfect. Sir, you're going to play
my role in this story.

00:04:07.157 --> 00:04:09.281
The old man turned to me and he said,

00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:11.678
"You could pick a red card
or a black card."

00:04:11.678 --> 00:04:13.069
My answer was ...

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.719
Audience member 2: The black card.

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:16.030
HG: Indeed!

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.638
It was a black card.

00:04:18.194 --> 00:04:20.707
He said, "It could be a club or a spade,"

00:04:20.707 --> 00:04:22.460
and my answer was ...

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.067
Audience member 2: Spade.

00:04:24.384 --> 00:04:27.819
HG: Indeed! It was a spade.

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.954
He said, "It could be a high spade
or a low spade."
