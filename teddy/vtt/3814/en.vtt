00:00:00.747 --> 00:00:06.923
I'd like to start my performance by saying
90 percent of everything is crap.

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:08.149
(Laughter)

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:10.426
It's called Sturgeon's law,
and what that means

00:00:10.426 --> 00:00:15.264
is that the majority of anything
is always bad.

00:00:17.447 --> 00:00:19.226
I have a giraffe here.

00:00:19.226 --> 00:00:21.510
I'm going to throw the giraffe
behind my back

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.714
and whoever catches it is going
to help me on this next thing.

00:00:26.474 --> 00:00:29.655
Sir, you caught the giraffe.

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:31.961
I have a playing card in my hand.
