Before we start,
sir, you gave me a dollar bill.

00:11:31.766 --> 00:11:33.649
Is that your signature?

00:11:33.649 --> 00:11:35.069
Audience member 3: Yes it is.

00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:39.174
HG: I want you to see very clearly

00:11:39.174 --> 00:11:42.431
that I'm going to open your bill

00:11:42.431 --> 00:11:47.228
and reveal a small secret that we created.

00:11:47.228 --> 00:11:53.357
And the secret of this dollar bill
is the serial number.

00:11:53.357 --> 00:11:56.280
Madam, can you take the dollar bill?

00:11:57.296 --> 00:11:59.242
In the serial number, there is a letter.

00:11:59.242 --> 00:12:02.485
What is the first number after the letter?
