00:08:58.692 --> 00:09:02.149
First of all, take the marker
and go ahead and sign the bill.

00:09:02.149 --> 00:09:03.875
And this is the reason why:

00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:06.506
later, I'm going to be doing
a bunch of stuff on stage

00:09:06.506 --> 00:09:08.024
and I don't want you to think,

00:09:08.024 --> 00:09:10.479
oh, while I was distracted by Helder,

00:09:10.479 --> 00:09:12.558
someone came onstage and swapped the bill.

00:09:12.558 --> 00:09:15.033
So I want to make sure
it's exactly the same bill.

00:09:15.033 --> 00:09:17.532
Now not only that, I want you
to take the paper clip

00:09:17.532 --> 00:09:19.732
and put it around the bill.

00:09:19.732 --> 00:09:22.338
So even if nobody comes onstage
and switches the bill,

00:09:22.338 --> 00:09:25.617
I don't have enough time
to go open the bill and close it

00:09:25.617 --> 00:09:27.256
and see what I don't want to see.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.441
Is that fair?

00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:30.228
Now you can give me the marker back.
