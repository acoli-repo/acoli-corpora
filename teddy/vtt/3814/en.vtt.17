00:08:28.579 --> 00:08:32.535
Now, I want you to take the bill
and fold it like this, lengthwise,

00:08:32.535 --> 00:08:34.054
so it becomes like a rectangle,

00:08:34.054 --> 00:08:36.573
and then again --
really fold it, really crease it --

00:08:36.573 --> 00:08:38.057
and when you have it,

00:08:38.057 --> 00:08:41.533
please fold the bill again
into a little square like this

00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:43.861
and let me know when you have it.

00:08:44.708 --> 00:08:45.936
Do you have it? Perfect.

00:08:45.936 --> 00:08:48.301
Now, I'm going to approach,

00:08:48.301 --> 00:08:49.800
and before we start,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.097
I want to make sure that we do this
in very, very serious conditions.

00:08:53.097 --> 00:08:58.692
First of all, I want to ensure that we
have a marker and we have a paper clip.

00:08:58.692 --> 00:09:02.149
First of all, take the marker
and go ahead and sign the bill.
