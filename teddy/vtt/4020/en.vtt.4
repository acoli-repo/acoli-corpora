00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.096
And imagine international roadways
all cluttered with broken down vehicles

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.976
that are just getting in the way
of other traffic.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.896
And imagine the debris
that would be strewn everywhere

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.376
if a collision actually happened,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.776
thousands of smaller pieces of debris

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.720
becoming new obstacles.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.256
This is the paradigm
of the satellite industry.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.416
Satellites that are no longer working

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.256
are often left to deorbit
over many, many years,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.816
or only moved out of the way
as a temporary solution.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.096
And there are no
international laws in space
