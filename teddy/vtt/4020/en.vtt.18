00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.616
are what we as humans do,

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.136
and in space exploration,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.416
we're literally moving
beyond the boundaries of Earth.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.096
But as we push thresholds
in the name of learning and innovation,

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:15.600
we must remember that accountability
for our environments never goes away.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.696
There is without doubt congestion
in the low Earth and geostationary orbits,

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.056
and we cannot keep
launching new satellites

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.376
to replace the ones that have broken down

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.456
without doing something about them first,

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.936
just like we would never
leave a broken down car

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.360
in the middle of the highway.
