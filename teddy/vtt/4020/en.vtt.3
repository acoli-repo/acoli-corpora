00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.560
right in the middle of the highway.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.456
So now you have no choice
but to abandon your car

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.920
where it is on the highway.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.536
Maybe you were lucky enough

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.456
to be able to move it out of the way
and into a shoulder lane

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.616
so that it's out of the way
of other traffic.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.896
A couple of hours ago,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.400
your car was a useful machine
that you relied on in your everyday life.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.536
Now, it's a useless hunk of metal

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.240
taking up space in a valuable
transportation network.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.096
And imagine international roadways
all cluttered with broken down vehicles
