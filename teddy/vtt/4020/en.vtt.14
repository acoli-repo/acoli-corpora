00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.896
regardless of what country
they were built in,

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.816
had to be standardized in some way

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.376
for recycling, servicing

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.880
or active deorbiting?

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.096
What if there actually were
international laws with teeth

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.896
that enforced end-of-life
disposal of satellites

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.056
instead of moving them out of the way

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.680
as a temporary solution?

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.496
Or maybe satellite manufacturers
need to be charged a deposit

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.816
to even launch a satellite into orbit,

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.296
and that deposit would only be returned

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.856
if the satellite was disposed of properly

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.600
or if they cleaned up
some quota of debris.
