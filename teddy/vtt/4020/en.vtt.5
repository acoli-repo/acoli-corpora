00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.096
And there are no
international laws in space

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.760
to enforce us to clean up after ourselves.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.936
So the world's first satellite, Sputnik I,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.216
was launched in 1957,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.880
and in that year, there were
only a total of three launch attempts.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.056
Decades later and dozens of countries
from all around the world

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.456
have launched thousands
of more satellites into orbit,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.216
and the frequency of launches
is only going to increase in the future,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.816
especially if you consider
things like the possibility

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.440
of 900-plus satellite
constellations being launched.
