00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.840
at about 35,000 kilometers altitude.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.496
Satellites there remain in the same place
above Earth as the Earth rotates,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.800
which enables things like communications
or television broadcast, for example.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.760
Satellites in high orbits like these
could remain there for centuries.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.136
And then there's the orbit
coined "the graveyard,"

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.776
the ominous junk or disposal orbits,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.656
where some satellites
are intentionally placed

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.896
at the end of their life

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.680
so that they're out of the way
of common operational orbits.
