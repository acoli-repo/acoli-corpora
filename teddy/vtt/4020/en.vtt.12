00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.136
so maybe local not-for-profits will pay
climbers who bring down extra waste,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.640
or expeditions might organize
voluntary cleanup trips.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.376
And yet still many climbers feel

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.640
that independent groups
should police themselves.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.936
There's no simple or easy answer,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.016
and even well-intentioned
efforts at conservation

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.880
often run into problems.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.416
But that doesn't mean
we shouldn't do everything in our power

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.760
to protect the environments
that we rely and depend on,

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.456
and like Everest, the remote location
and inadequate infrastructure
