00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.376
Of the nearly 7,000 satellites
launched since the late 1950s,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.760
only about one in seven
is currently operational,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.256
and in addition to the satellites
that are no longer working,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.776
there's also hundreds of thousands
of marble-sized debris

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.216
and millions of paint chip-sized debris

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.240
that are also orbiting around the Earth.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.656
Space debris is a major risk
to space missions,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.680
but also to the satellites
that we rely on each and every day.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.936
Now, because space debris and junk
has become increasingly worrisome,
