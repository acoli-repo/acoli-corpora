00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.936
Now, because space debris and junk
has become increasingly worrisome,

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.576
there have been some national
and international efforts

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.096
to develop technical standards

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.040
to help us limit the generation
of additional debris.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.736
So for example, there are recommendations

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.856
for those low-Earth orbiting spacecraft

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.296
to be made to deorbit in under 25 years,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.416
but that's still a really long time,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.760
especially if a satellite
hasn't been working for years.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.376
There's also mandates
for those dead geostationary spacecraft

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.640
to be moved into a graveyard orbit.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.176
But neither of these guidelines
is binding under international law,
