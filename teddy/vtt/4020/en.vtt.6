00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.440
of 900-plus satellite
constellations being launched.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.616
Now, we send satellites
to different orbits

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.696
depending on what they're needed for.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.056
One of the most common places
we send satellites

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.656
is the low Earth orbit,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.656
possibly to image the surface of Earth

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.080
at up to about 2,000 kilometers altitude.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.176
Satellites there are naturally buffeted
by Earth's atmosphere,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.136
so their orbits naturally decay,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.696
and they'll eventually burn up,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.680
probably within a couple of decades.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.536
Another common place we send satellites

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.216
is the geostationary orbit

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.840
at about 35,000 kilometers altitude.
