00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.256
will require other disposal options.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.256
So maybe you get into things
like high-powered lasers

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.096
or tugging using nets or tethers,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.440
as crazy as those sound in the short term.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.056
And then one really cool possibility

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.400
is the idea of orbital tow trucks
or space mechanics.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.456
Imagine if a robotic arm

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.336
on some sort of space tow truck

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.656
could fix the broken components
on a satellite,

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.520
making them usable again.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.176
Or what if that very same robotic arm

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.536
could refuel the propellant tank
on a spacecraft

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.536
that relies on chemical propulsion

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.039
just like you or I would refuel
the fuel tanks on our cars?
