00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.456
and like Everest, the remote location
and inadequate infrastructure

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.896
of the orbital environment

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.280
make waste disposal a challenging problem.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.456
But we simply cannot reach new heights

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.536
and create an even higher garbage dump,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.720
one that's out of this world.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.496
The reality of space

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.096
is that if a component
on a satellite breaks down,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.016
there really are limited
opportunities for repairs,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.080
and only at great cost.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.256
But what if we were smarter
about how we designed satellites?

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.576
What if all satellites,

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.896
regardless of what country
they were built in,
