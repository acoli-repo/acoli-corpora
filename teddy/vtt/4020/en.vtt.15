00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.600
or if they cleaned up
some quota of debris.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.016
Or maybe a satellite
needs to have technology on board

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.800
to help accelerate deorbit.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.976
There are some encouraging signs.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.696
The UK's TechDemoSat-1,
launched in 2014, for example,

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.656
was designed for end-of-life disposal

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.616
via a small drag sail.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.216
This works for the satellite
because it's small,

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.936
but satellites that are higher
or in larger orbits

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.816
or are larger altogether,
like the size of school buses,

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.256
will require other disposal options.
