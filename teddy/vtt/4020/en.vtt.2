00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.856
they could malfunction,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.575
or they may just naturally
reach the end of their mission life.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.736
At this point, these satellites
effectively become space junk,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.080
cluttering the orbital environment.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.456
So imagine you're driving down the highway
on a beautiful, sunny day

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.896
out running errands.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.576
You've got your music cranked,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.056
your windows rolled down,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.776
with the cool breeze
blowing through your hair.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.000
Feels nice, right?

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.016
Everything is going smoothly

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.696
until suddenly
your car stutters and stalls

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.560
right in the middle of the highway.
