00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.360
in the middle of the highway.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.336
Next time you use your phone,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.856
check the weather or use your GPS,

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.136
think about the satellite technologies
that make those activities possible.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.016
But also think about the very impact

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.336
that the satellites have
on the environment surrounding Earth,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:50.056
and help spread the message
that together we must reduce our impact.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.616
Earth orbit is breathtakingly beautiful

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.216
and our gateway to exploration.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.760
It's up to us to keep it that way.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.376
Thank you.
