00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.256
Our lives depend

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.040
on a world we can't see.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.936
Think about your week so far.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.176
Have you watched TV, used GPS,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.160
checked the weather or even ate a meal?

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.416
These many things
that enable our daily lives

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.296
rely either directly or indirectly

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.016
on satellites.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.976
And while we often take for granted

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.536
the services that satellites provide us,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.376
the satellites themselves
deserve our attention

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.376
as they are leaving a lasting mark
