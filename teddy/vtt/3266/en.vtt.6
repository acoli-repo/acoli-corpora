00:02:58.022 --> 00:03:01.206
but to me, they slip through the shadows,
crawl through the sewers,

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.660
skip across the rooftops,

00:03:02.684 --> 00:03:04.696
and before you know it,
they're behind you.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.971
They don't turn up
with an army or complain,

00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:08.757
and they're laser-focused on a plan.

00:03:08.781 --> 00:03:10.584
So when I lay in my hospital bed,

00:03:10.608 --> 00:03:13.633
I thought of my plan
to help reduce the chances

00:03:13.657 --> 00:03:15.506
of them doing this to somebody else,

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.592
by using the system as is, and paying
the price of sacrificing my privacy.

00:03:20.616 --> 00:03:24.503
What they told one million people,
I will tell 10 million people.

00:03:24.887 --> 00:03:27.361
Because when you're angry,
people defend themselves.

00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:28.745
So I didn't attack them,

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.273
and they were defenseless.
