00:02:28.871 --> 00:02:30.022
(Applause)

00:02:30.046 --> 00:02:31.245
When I last spoke here --

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.434
(Applause)

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:35.168
at TED, I didn't talk about it,
because it's boring.

00:02:35.727 --> 00:02:38.806
And one Scottish newspaper
ran with the headline:

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.393
"Sex Swap Scientist Gored by Stag."

00:02:41.417 --> 00:02:43.640
And five others did similar things.

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:45.418
And for a minute, I was angry.

00:02:45.442 --> 00:02:47.649
But then I found my calm place.

00:02:47.673 --> 00:02:50.839
And what ran through my head was,
"They've crossed the wrong woman,

00:02:50.863 --> 00:02:53.132
and they're not going to know
what's hit them."

00:02:53.156 --> 00:02:54.898
(Laughter)

00:02:54.922 --> 00:02:56.129
I'm a kindness ninja.

00:02:56.153 --> 00:02:57.998
I don't really know what a ninja does,

00:02:58.022 --> 00:03:01.206
but to me, they slip through the shadows,
crawl through the sewers,
