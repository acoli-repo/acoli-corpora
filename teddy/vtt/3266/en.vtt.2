00:00:59.137 --> 00:01:00.781
Somehow, I was content with this,

00:01:00.805 --> 00:01:03.918
because I've always tried
to do my best in life whenever I can.

00:01:03.942 --> 00:01:07.141
So I just continued to enjoy each breath
as one more moment --

00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:09.241
one breath in and one breath out.

00:01:09.813 --> 00:01:12.162
An ambulance came,
I was still fully conscious,

00:01:12.186 --> 00:01:15.415
and I analyzed everything on the journey,
because I'm a scientist:

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.788
the sound of the tires on the road,
the frequency of the street lights

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.751
and eventually, the city street lights.

00:01:20.775 --> 00:01:23.030
And I thought, "Maybe I will survive."

00:01:23.054 --> 00:01:24.799
And then I passed out.

00:01:26.046 --> 00:01:30.268
I was stabilized at a local hospital
and then airlifted to Glasgow,
