I've even had a few glasses of wine
with Philippa from The Sun since then.

00:04:03.273 --> 00:04:05.637
And after three months, they all agreed,

00:04:05.661 --> 00:04:07.813
and the statements
were published on a Friday,

00:04:07.837 --> 00:04:09.225
and that was the end of that.

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.496
Or so they thought.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.597
On the Saturday,
I went on the evening news,

00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:17.858
with the headline "Six National
Newspapers Admit They Were Wrong."

00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:19.386
And the anchor said to me,

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.781
"But don't you think
it's our job as journalists

00:04:21.805 --> 00:04:23.595
to sensationalize a story?"

00:04:23.619 --> 00:04:28.389
And I said, "I was laying
on a forest floor, gored by a stag.

00:04:28.413 --> 00:04:29.976
Is that not sensational enough?"

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.722
(Laughter)
