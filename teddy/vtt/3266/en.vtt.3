00:01:26.046 --> 00:01:30.268
I was stabilized at a local hospital
and then airlifted to Glasgow,

00:01:30.292 --> 00:01:33.711
where they reconstructed my throat
and put me in a coma.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.960
And while I was in the coma,
I had many alternate realities.

00:01:37.984 --> 00:01:41.617
It was like a crazy mix
of "Westworld" and "Black Mirror."

00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:43.707
But that's a whole other story.

00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:47.819
My local TV station reported live
from outside the hospital

00:01:47.843 --> 00:01:51.288
of a Cambridge scientist
who was in a coma,

00:01:51.312 --> 00:01:55.071
and they didn't know
if she would live or die or walk or talk.

00:01:55.855 --> 00:01:58.874
And a week later,
I woke up from that coma.
