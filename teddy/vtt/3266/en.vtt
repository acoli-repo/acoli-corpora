Five years ago, I stood on the TED stage,
and I spoke about my work.

00:00:05.373 --> 00:00:06.676
But one year later,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.393
I had a terrible accident as I left a pub
one dark night with friends,

00:00:10.417 --> 00:00:11.846
in Scotland.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.568
As we followed the path through a forest,
I suddenly felt a massive thud,

00:00:16.592 --> 00:00:17.972
then a second thud,

00:00:17.996 --> 00:00:19.663
and I fell to the ground.

00:00:19.687 --> 00:00:21.671
I had no idea what had hit me.

00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:26.633
I later found out that when
the gate was opened on a garden,

00:00:26.657 --> 00:00:31.422
a wild stag stampeded along the path
and ran straight into me.
