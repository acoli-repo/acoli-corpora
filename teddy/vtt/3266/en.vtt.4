00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:02.069
And that was the first gift.

00:02:02.093 --> 00:02:05.244
Then I had the gift to think,
the gift to move,

00:02:05.268 --> 00:02:07.310
the gift to breathe

00:02:07.334 --> 00:02:09.457
and the gift to eat and to drink.

00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:11.769
That took three and a half months.

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:14.887
But there was one thing
that I never got back, though,

00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:16.640
and that was my privacy.

00:02:16.664 --> 00:02:19.474
The tabloid press
made the story about gender.

00:02:19.498 --> 00:02:22.617
Look -- I'm transgender,
it's not that big a deal.

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:26.714
Like, my hair color or my shoe size
is way more interesting.

00:02:27.393 --> 00:02:28.847
When I last spoke here --

00:02:28.871 --> 00:02:30.022
(Applause)
