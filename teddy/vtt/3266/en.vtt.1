a wild stag stampeded along the path
and ran straight into me.

00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:35.447
Its antler penetrated my trachea
and my esophagus

00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:38.366

and fractured my neck.

00:00:39.502 --> 00:00:41.751
My best friend found me

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.283

00:00:49.387 --> 00:00:52.080
And she told me, "Just breathe."

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.720
And so, whilst focusing on my breath,
I had a strong sense of calmness,

00:00:56.744 --> 00:00:59.113
but I was certain that I was going to die.

00:00:59.137 --> 00:01:00.781
Somehow, I was content with this,
