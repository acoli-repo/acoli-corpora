00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.722
(Laughter)

00:04:32.746 --> 00:04:34.514
And I was now writing the headlines.

00:04:34.538 --> 00:04:36.164
My favorite one was,

00:04:36.188 --> 00:04:40.418
"The stag trampled on my throat,
and the press trampled on my privacy."

00:04:40.442 --> 00:04:43.712
It was the most read piece
of BBC News online that day.

00:04:43.736 --> 00:04:45.489
And I was kind of having fun.

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:48.157
And by the end of my week of media,

00:04:48.181 --> 00:04:51.061
I started to use my newfound
voice and platform

00:04:51.085 --> 00:04:53.243
to spread a message of love and kindness.

00:04:53.608 --> 00:04:56.672
And when I had the minute
of anger and hatred

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:58.522
towards those press and journalists,

00:04:58.546 --> 00:05:02.500
I had to identify my inner
bigotry towards them.
