00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.273
and they were defenseless.

00:03:30.297 --> 00:03:34.258
I wrote kind and calm letters
to these newspapers.

00:03:34.282 --> 00:03:37.536
And The Sun newspaper,
the kind of "Fox News" of the UK,

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.196
thanked me for my "reasoned approach."

00:03:40.696 --> 00:03:44.569
I asked for no apology,
no retraction, no money,

00:03:44.593 --> 00:03:47.172
just an acknowledgment
that they broke their own rules,

00:03:47.196 --> 00:03:49.579
and what they did was just wrong.

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:54.646
And on this journey,
I started to learn who they are,

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.939
and they began to learn who I am.

00:03:56.963 --> 00:03:58.773
And we actually became friends.

00:03:58.797 --> 00:04:02.582
I've even had a few glasses of wine
with Philippa from The Sun since then.
