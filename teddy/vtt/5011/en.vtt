Chris Anderson: Welcome
to The TED Interview.

00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:08.799
I’m Chris Anderson,

00:00:08.823 --> 00:00:12.374
and this is the podcast series
where I sit down with a TED speaker,

00:00:12.398 --> 00:00:17.262
and we dive much deeper into their ideas
than was possible during their TED Talk.

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:20.026
Today on the show,

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.216
one of the world’s
most famous introverts, Susan Cain.

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.230
Seven years ago, Susan called for
something of a revolution

00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:32.229
in how the world should
think about introverts.
