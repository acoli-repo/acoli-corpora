We call our treatment approach
"inner-directed therapy,"

00:10:03.599 --> 00:10:07.869
in that we support the patient
to experience whatever's emerging

00:10:07.893 --> 00:10:10.069
within their minds or their bodies.

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:13.561
Even with MDMA, this is hard work.

00:10:14.077 --> 00:10:16.099
And a lot of our subjects have said,

00:10:16.123 --> 00:10:18.418
"I don't know why they call this Ecstasy."

00:10:18.442 --> 00:10:19.994

During Tony's first MDMA session,

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:25.514
he lay on the couch, he had eyeshades on,

00:10:25.538 --> 00:10:27.705
he listened to music,

00:10:27.729 --> 00:10:29.545
and he would speak to the therapists,

00:10:29.569 --> 00:10:31.470
who were a male-female co-therapy team,
