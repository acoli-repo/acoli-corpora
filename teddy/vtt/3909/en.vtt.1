00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.926
Today, I'd like to share with you
how psychedelics, when used wisely,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.633
have the potential to help heal us,

00:00:34.657 --> 00:00:36.799
help inspire us,

00:00:36.823 --> 00:00:39.371
and perhaps even to help save us.

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:41.170
In the 1950s and 60s,

00:00:41.194 --> 00:00:44.156
psychedelic research flourished
all over the world

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.871
and showed great promise
for the fields of psychiatry,

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:49.895
psychology and psychotherapy,

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:53.553
neuroscience and the study
of mystical experiences.

00:00:53.577 --> 00:00:56.881
But psychedelics leaked out
of the research settings

00:00:56.905 --> 00:00:59.421
and began to be used
by the counterculture,

00:00:59.445 --> 00:01:02.151
and by the anti-Vietnam War movement.
