00:10:34.022 --> 00:10:35.331
After several hours,

00:10:35.355 --> 00:10:38.418
in a moment of calmness and clarity,

00:10:38.442 --> 00:10:41.990
Tony shared that he had realized

00:10:42.014 --> 00:10:47.664
his PTSD was a way
of connecting him to his friends.

00:10:47.688 --> 00:10:51.513
It was a way of honoring the memory
of his friends who had died.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.585

00:10:56.609 --> 00:10:59.361
And he realized that they
would not want him to suffer,

00:10:59.385 --> 00:11:00.633
to squander his life.
