00:05:56.838 --> 00:06:00.115
it can reduce the fear
of difficult emotions,

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:03.551
and she could help move forward
past her trauma.

00:06:03.575 --> 00:06:06.642
I asked her to promise
not to commit suicide

00:06:07.642 --> 00:06:09.593
if we were to work together.

00:06:09.617 --> 00:06:12.755
She agreed and made that promise.

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.308
During her therapeutic sessions,

00:06:15.332 --> 00:06:20.775
Marcela was able to process
her trauma more fluidly, more easily.

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.371
And yet, she was able to tell

00:06:24.395 --> 00:06:27.979
that the rapist had told her
that if she ever shared her story,

00:06:28.003 --> 00:06:29.203
he would kill her.

00:06:29.823 --> 00:06:33.923
And she realized that that was
keeping her a prisoner in her own mind.
