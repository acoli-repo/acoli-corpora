00:03:58.656 --> 00:04:02.171
and showing long-term benefits
and brain changes.

00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:04.926
Now, how do these drugs work?

00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:07.869
Modern neuroscience research
has demonstrated

00:04:07.893 --> 00:04:10.371
that psychedelics reduce activity

00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:12.918
in what's known as the brain's
default mode network.

00:04:12.942 --> 00:04:15.436
This is where we create our sense of self.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.072
It's our equivalent to the ego,

00:04:18.096 --> 00:04:20.721
and it filters all incoming information

00:04:20.745 --> 00:04:24.310
according to our personal
needs and priorities.

00:04:24.334 --> 00:04:27.852
When activity is reduced
in the default mode network,

00:04:27.876 --> 00:04:32.154
our ego shifts from the foreground
to the background,
