00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.688
And I felt that these experiences
had the potential

00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:34.313
to help be an antidote

00:02:34.337 --> 00:02:39.424
to tribalism, to fundamentalism,
to genocide and environmental destruction.

00:02:39.448 --> 00:02:41.582
And so I decided to focus my life

00:02:42.432 --> 00:02:44.363
on changing the laws

00:02:44.387 --> 00:02:48.045
and becoming a legal
psychedelic psychotherapist.

00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:52.466

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.522
Now, half a century after the ban,

00:02:54.546 --> 00:02:58.513
we're in the midst of a global renaissance
of psychedelic research.

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:01.937
Psychedelic psychotherapy
is showing great promise
