00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:00.339
And they helped me have
a spiritual connection

00:02:00.363 --> 00:02:04.373
that unfortunately,
my bar mitzvah did not produce.

00:02:04.397 --> 00:02:06.310
(Laughter)

00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:08.612
When I wanted to tease my parents,

00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:11.325
I would tell them
that they drove me to psychedelics

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.019
because my bar mitzvah had failed
to turn me into a man.

00:02:15.043 --> 00:02:16.979
(Laughter)

00:02:17.892 --> 00:02:19.067
But most importantly,

00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:22.233
psychedelics gave me this feeling
of our shared humanity,

00:02:22.257 --> 00:02:24.542
of our unity with all life.

00:02:25.125 --> 00:02:27.934
And other people reported
that same thing as well.

00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:31.688
And I felt that these experiences
had the potential
