00:06:41.032 --> 00:06:42.182
freed her,

00:06:42.206 --> 00:06:43.500
and she was able to decide

00:06:43.524 --> 00:06:46.143
that she wanted
to move forward with her life.

00:06:46.167 --> 00:06:47.376
And in that moment,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.973
I realized that MDMA could be very

after Marcela's treatment,

00:06:56.495 --> 00:06:59.091
she's actually a therapist,

00:06:59.115 --> 00:07:03.615
training other therapists to help people
overcome PTSD with MDMA.
