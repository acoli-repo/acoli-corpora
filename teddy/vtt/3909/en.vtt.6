Psychedelic psychotherapy
is showing great promise

00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:06.612
for the treatment of post-traumatic
stress disorder, or PTSD,

00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:11.152
depression, social anxiety,
substance abuse and alcoholism

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.347
and suicide.

00:03:13.371 --> 00:03:17.315
Psychedelic psychotherapy is an attempt
to go after the root causes

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:18.490
of the problems,

00:03:18.514 --> 00:03:20.985
with just relatively few administrations,

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:25.509
as contrasted to most
of the psychiatric drugs used today

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:28.707
that are mostly just reducing symptoms

00:03:28.731 --> 00:03:32.238
and are meant to be taken
on a daily basis.
