00:11:58.238 --> 00:12:01.347
This is really pretty good
for this patient population.

00:12:01.371 --> 00:12:03.672
However, when you add MDMA,

00:12:03.696 --> 00:12:08.292
the results more than double,
to 56 percent no longer having PTSD.

00:12:09.175 --> 00:12:12.611
(Applause)

00:12:12.635 --> 00:12:13.873
But most importantly,

00:12:13.897 --> 00:12:17.045
once people learn that if they don't need
to suppress their trauma,

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:18.704
but they can process it,

00:12:18.728 --> 00:12:20.807
they keep getting better on their own.

00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:24.782
So at the 12-month follow-up
one year after the last treatment session,

00:12:24.806 --> 00:12:27.871
two-thirds no longer have PTSD.

00:12:27.895 --> 00:12:29.656
And of the one-third that do,

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.974
many have clinically significant
reductions in symptoms.
