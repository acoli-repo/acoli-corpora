00:15:26.918 --> 00:15:30.312
And it also does have
a mood-elevation lift.

00:15:30.336 --> 00:15:31.958
But I think for serious illnesses,

00:15:31.982 --> 00:15:35.037
we'd rather not get people thinking
that they need a daily drug,

00:15:35.061 --> 00:15:37.434
but do more deeper, intense work.

00:15:37.458 --> 00:15:41.333
CH: And what about outside
the United States and North America,

00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:43.037
is this research being done there?

00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:45.288
RD: Oh yeah, we're globalizing.

00:15:45.974 --> 00:15:48.260
Our Phase 3 studies
are actually being done

00:15:48.284 --> 00:15:50.697
in Israel, Canada and the United States.

00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:52.349
So once we get approval in FDA,

00:15:52.373 --> 00:15:55.705
it will also become approved
in Israel and in Canada.

00:15:55.729 --> 00:15:58.903
We're just starting research in Europe.

00:15:58.927 --> 00:16:03.010
And we're actually going to be training
some therapists from China.
