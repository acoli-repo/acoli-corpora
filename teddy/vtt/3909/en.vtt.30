So what about some more common
mental illnesses

00:15:02.038 --> 00:15:03.776
like anxiety and depression,

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.403
and is that where microdosing comes in?

00:15:06.427 --> 00:15:09.180
RD: Well, microdosing
can be helpful for depression,

00:15:09.204 --> 00:15:11.561
I do know someone that has been using it.

00:15:11.585 --> 00:15:14.712
But in general, for therapeutic purposes,

00:15:14.736 --> 00:15:17.799
we prefer macro-dosing
rather than microdosing,

00:15:17.823 --> 00:15:20.577
in order to really help people
deal with the root causes.

00:15:20.601 --> 00:15:23.109
Microdosing is more for creativity,

00:15:23.133 --> 00:15:25.127
for artistic inspiration,

00:15:25.151 --> 00:15:26.463
for focus ...

00:15:26.918 --> 00:15:30.312
And it also does have
a mood-elevation lift.
