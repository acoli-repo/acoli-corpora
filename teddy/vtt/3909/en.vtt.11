Marcela and I were introduced in 1984,

00:05:32.397 --> 00:05:34.627
when MDMA was still legal,

00:05:34.651 --> 00:05:38.635
but it was beginning also
to leak out of therapeutic circles.

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:42.640
Marcela had tried MDMA
in a recreational setting,

00:05:42.664 --> 00:05:46.315
and during that, her past trauma
flooded her awareness

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:50.373
and it intensified her suicidal feelings.

00:05:51.006 --> 00:05:52.672
During our first conversation,

00:05:52.696 --> 00:05:56.814
I shared that when MDMA
is taken therapeutically,

00:05:56.838 --> 00:06:00.115
it can reduce the fear
of difficult emotions,
