00:09:29.006 --> 00:09:32.133
there's over a million veterans now
disabled with PTSD.

00:09:32.546 --> 00:09:36.077
And at least 20 veterans a day
are committing suicide,

00:09:36.101 --> 00:09:38.864
many of them from PTSD.

00:09:39.555 --> 00:09:44.435
The treatment that Tony was to receive
was three and a half months long.

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:45.952
But during that period of time,

00:09:45.976 --> 00:09:48.760
he would only get MDMA on three occasions,

00:09:48.784 --> 00:09:52.664
separated by 12, 90-minute
non-drug psychotherapy sessions,

00:09:52.688 --> 00:09:55.625
three before the first
MDMA session for preparation

00:09:55.649 --> 00:09:59.776
and three after each
MDMA session for integration.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.575
We call our treatment approach
"inner-directed therapy,"
