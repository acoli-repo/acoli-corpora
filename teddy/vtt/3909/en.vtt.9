00:04:27.876 --> 00:04:32.154
our ego shifts from the foreground
to the background,

00:04:32.178 --> 00:04:37.779
and we see that it's just part
of a larger field of awareness.

00:04:37.803 --> 00:04:39.041
It's similar to the shift

00:04:39.065 --> 00:04:42.564
that Copernicus and Galileo were
able to produce in humanity

00:04:42.588 --> 00:04:43.770
using the telescope

00:04:43.794 --> 00:04:48.458
to show that the earth was no
longer the center of the universe,

00:04:48.482 --> 00:04:51.784
but was actually something
that revolved around the sun,

00:04:51.808 --> 00:04:53.961
something bigger than itself.

00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:57.244
For some people, this shift in awareness

00:04:57.268 --> 00:04:59.312
is the most important

00:04:59.336 --> 00:05:02.545
and among the most important
experiences of their lives.
