00:09:59.713 --> 00:10:01.586
that spot in the world only they stand,

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.712
we're not talking
about a generation anymore.

00:10:03.736 --> 00:10:06.900
We're talking about Jim or Jen or Candice.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.493
And so here's my challenge to us.

00:10:09.855 --> 00:10:13.343
Pick a person, just one,
and explore their onlyness.

00:10:13.744 --> 00:10:14.895
And then learn.

00:10:14.919 --> 00:10:17.450
And then in the moments
where it's appropriate, teach.

00:10:17.474 --> 00:10:20.989
And figure out what they bring to work
that no one else can bring to work,

00:10:21.013 --> 00:10:22.871
because that's what makes work richer.

00:10:22.895 --> 00:10:24.296
And then do it again.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.496
And do it again.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.441
And then some day, we're not
working with generations anymore.

00:10:28.465 --> 00:10:30.148
We're working with people.
