00:00:57.045 --> 00:01:00.934
They also were the first generation
to tell us about work-life balance,

00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.022
and the first to really
ask for that in the workplace.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:08.251
And then millennials -- you know,
the everybody-gets-a-ribbon generation --

00:01:08.275 --> 00:01:10.950
born between 1981 and 2000.

00:01:10.974 --> 00:01:14.422
Never knew a time where technology
wasn't present in the home.

00:01:14.831 --> 00:01:18.094
They're incredibly pragmatic,
they're hopeful and they're determined.

00:01:18.118 --> 00:01:20.236
They think they're going
to change the world,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.275
in fact, I believe they're going to do it.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.696
They might be a little bit
idealistic sometimes,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.748
but in just the last several years,

00:01:26.772 --> 00:01:29.601
we've seen millennials
overtake Generation X

00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:32.482
to be the most represented
generation in the workforce.
