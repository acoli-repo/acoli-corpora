00:02:28.057 --> 00:02:30.191
that these generations are real.

00:02:30.702 --> 00:02:34.064
And in fact, if we can agree
that these groups even exist,

00:02:34.088 --> 00:02:36.942
we certainly don't agree
who belongs in them.

00:02:37.468 --> 00:02:40.175
And they span something like 20 years.

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:41.887
So at whatever point in history,

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:46.093
a one-year-old and a 20-year-old
are said to share the same value system,

00:02:46.117 --> 00:02:48.276
to want the same things at work,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.133
to have the same stereotypes
working for and against them.

00:02:52.157 --> 00:02:55.887
And in fact, different areas of the world
define these generations differently.

00:02:55.911 --> 00:03:00.053
So we can't even compare generations
across various areas of the world.
