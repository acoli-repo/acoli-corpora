00:04:28.117 --> 00:04:30.545
We're lazy, we're sensitive, we're fired,

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.770
we're also hated,
and we think we're important.

00:04:32.794 --> 00:04:35.982
And perhaps the most terrifying
search result on the internet --

00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:38.252
Generation Z is screwed.

00:04:38.276 --> 00:04:41.426
(Laughter)

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.121
OK, so, for five years,
I've been talking to leaders and followers

00:04:46.145 --> 00:04:48.640
across a wide variety of organizations.

00:04:48.664 --> 00:04:50.958
And this is what I've come to realize.

00:04:50.982 --> 00:04:53.577
Generations haven't become
part of the conversation --

00:04:53.601 --> 00:04:57.353
generations have become
the conversation at work.

00:04:57.377 --> 00:04:58.527
What I've learned

00:04:58.551 --> 00:05:02.624
is that we're working under the assumption
that those Google results are true.
