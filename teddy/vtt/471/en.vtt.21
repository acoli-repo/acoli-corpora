00:10:28.465 --> 00:10:30.148
We're working with people.

00:10:30.172 --> 00:10:33.664
And so to really understand the beauty
of the multigenerational workplace,

00:10:33.688 --> 00:10:36.379
I think we just have to meet
people where they are.

00:10:36.403 --> 00:10:40.236
And that doesn't require
that we unpack and live there with them.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.743
But we might find, at least on occasion,
it's a beautiful place to visit.

00:10:44.331 --> 00:10:46.586
And so I think there's just no need

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.386
to argue about which generation
is the most angry

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.404
or the most entitled
or the most so obsessed with food.

00:10:52.966 --> 00:10:55.910
We all come to the classroom,
to work, back to our homes,

00:10:55.934 --> 00:10:58.686
a little bit tired and a little bit
tattered sometimes.

00:10:59.093 --> 00:11:02.202
Maybe let's just do our best
to humbly meet people where they are,
