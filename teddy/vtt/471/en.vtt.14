This young woman had two graduate degrees.

00:07:01.117 --> 00:07:02.717
This young woman was me.

00:07:04.268 --> 00:07:06.530
And this is the best we came up with?

00:07:06.554 --> 00:07:10.712
How to navigate the multigenerational
workplace ... is shoulder pads?

00:07:10.736 --> 00:07:12.561
(Laughter)

00:07:12.585 --> 00:07:15.665
So, this is also what I've learned
talking to organizations

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:19.164
that employ a wide range
of people of various ages.

00:07:19.498 --> 00:07:22.167
We are so much more similar
than we are different.

00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:24.611
And we're hearing this consistently.

00:07:24.635 --> 00:07:27.373
People want work that matters,
they want flexibility,

00:07:27.397 --> 00:07:29.405
they want support, they want appreciation,

00:07:29.429 --> 00:07:30.595
they want better coffee.
