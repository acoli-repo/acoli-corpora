00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:32.910
that every red-blooded American
and pre-tenure academic does

00:03:32.934 --> 00:03:34.180
when they have a question.

00:03:34.204 --> 00:03:35.410
I Googled some stuff.

00:03:35.434 --> 00:03:37.752
And this is what I learned.

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:39.475
Google is based on algorithms,

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:41.918
and they provide you
with commonly searched terms,

00:03:41.942 --> 00:03:44.799
or suggested hits, based
on what other people are searching

00:03:44.823 --> 00:03:46.141
surrounding the same topic.

00:03:46.165 --> 00:03:48.744
And it gave me a really good sense
of what people think

00:03:48.768 --> 00:03:50.299
about each of these generations.

00:03:50.323 --> 00:03:51.553
Take a look.

00:03:51.577 --> 00:03:54.924
I learned that baby boomers
are conservative,

00:03:54.948 --> 00:03:56.797
that Americans think they're stupid.

00:03:56.821 --> 00:03:58.640
The worst generation, they're angry,

00:03:58.664 --> 00:04:02.000
apparently they're racist
and they're so important.
