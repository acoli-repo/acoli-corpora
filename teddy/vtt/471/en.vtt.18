00:08:58.104 --> 00:09:00.262
only the spot in the world
that they stand,

00:09:00.286 --> 00:09:05.212
we learn that that boomer who is just
acting "angry" at work all the time

00:09:05.236 --> 00:09:06.847
is scared.

00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:10.950
Because he's worked every day
since he was 16 years old,

00:09:10.974 --> 00:09:13.768
and on a Monday,
sooner than he can imagine,

00:09:13.792 --> 00:09:15.537
he'll never go to work again.

00:09:15.895 --> 00:09:17.061
He's got plans.

00:09:17.085 --> 00:09:19.061
It's going to take like a week and a half

00:09:19.085 --> 00:09:21.362
to do all the things
on that retirement list.

00:09:21.736 --> 00:09:23.085
But then what?

00:09:23.109 --> 00:09:24.918
What if we give a little bit of grace

00:09:24.942 --> 00:09:27.024
to the person that might be
a little scared?

00:09:28.175 --> 00:09:30.445
Or that Generation X-er
