00:02:55.911 --> 00:03:00.053
So we can't even compare generations
across various areas of the world.

00:03:00.077 --> 00:03:02.094
And these stereotypes
about each generation

00:03:02.118 --> 00:03:05.426
have, in a lot of ways,
created this self-fulfilling prophecy,

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.696
that people begin to act
as if they're part of that generation

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.712
because we've said out loud
that generation is real.

00:03:11.736 --> 00:03:13.283
I'm not so sure that it is.

00:03:13.307 --> 00:03:15.636
And in fact, this idea of generations

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.784
has become deeply embedded
in United States culture.

00:03:18.808 --> 00:03:20.237
When we talk generations,

00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:22.990
people know exactly
what we're talking about.

00:03:23.014 --> 00:03:25.532
In fact, people have
a lot of thoughts and feelings

00:03:25.556 --> 00:03:27.095
about each of these generations.

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:28.768
And I'll tell you how I know this.

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:29.951
I did the thing

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:32.910
that every red-blooded American
and pre-tenure academic does
