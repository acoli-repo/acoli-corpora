00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:02.960
So, for the first time
in America's modern history,

00:00:02.984 --> 00:00:05.555
we have five generations
interacting at work.

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:09.166
The veterans, born between 1922 and 1943,

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.125
are known as the Greatest Generation,
the matures, the silents.

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:15.426
They're known for their self-sacrifice,

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.784
respect for authority
and work as its own reward.

00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:24.557
The boomers came shortly after,
born between 1944 and 1960.

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:27.638
This is a generation
characterized by hard work.

00:00:27.662 --> 00:00:30.906
In fact, we can thank this generation
for the term "workaholic."
