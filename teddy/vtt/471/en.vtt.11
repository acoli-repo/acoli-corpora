I've talked to these organizations,

00:05:30.344 --> 00:05:32.951
and I've heard amazing things
that they're doing

00:05:32.975 --> 00:05:35.707
to create a workspace
for everybody to get along

00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:39.045
and to have autonomy
and to feel like they're thriving.

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:41.943
But I've also heard some
really incredibly harebrained ideas

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:44.506
about how to navigate
the multigenerational workplace.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.681
Are you ready?

00:05:45.705 --> 00:05:46.870
This is what I saw.

00:05:46.894 --> 00:05:48.147
I visited an organization,

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:52.244
and they adopted this idea
that if you can see it, you can be it.

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:54.141
A really important concept.

00:05:54.165 --> 00:05:55.506
But I think they blew it.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.403
The put pictures on the walls
of the ideal multigenerational workplace,

00:05:59.427 --> 00:06:02.160
because if you can see it, you can be it.
