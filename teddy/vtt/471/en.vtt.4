"Seventeen reasons why millennials
are the worst generation."

00:02:00.228 --> 00:02:02.791
And "Why baby boomers
have ruined it for everybody."

00:02:02.815 --> 00:02:05.101
Or "Bridging the great
generational divide."

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.283
It's like turning into this
"West Side Story,"

00:02:07.307 --> 00:02:08.800
like, boomers come in one door,

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:10.911
millennials come in
another door, the lobby,

00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:14.348
they just fight with each other all day,
complain, go home, do the same,

00:02:14.372 --> 00:02:15.572
come back to work, right?

00:02:16.157 --> 00:02:21.723
Well, so what if I told you
these generations may not exist?

00:02:22.406 --> 00:02:25.716
I've been spending some time
thinking about this and researching this,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.033
and fellow researchers and I
aren't exactly sure

00:02:28.057 --> 00:02:30.191
that these generations are real.
