Maybe let's just do our best
to humbly meet people where they are,

00:11:02.226 --> 00:11:03.863
how they show up that day,

00:11:03.887 --> 00:11:05.154
generation and all.

00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:06.815
And in those moments

00:11:06.839 --> 00:11:10.585
where it can feel a little bit
like intergenerational warfare,

00:11:10.609 --> 00:11:13.270
I think we can at least all agree

00:11:13.294 --> 00:11:15.532
that shoulder pads aren't the solution.

00:11:15.556 --> 00:11:17.095
(Laughter)

00:11:17.119 --> 00:11:18.278
Thank you.

00:11:18.302 --> 00:11:22.031
(Applause)
