I have a question for you.

00:00:04.078 --> 00:00:06.538
How would you have coped
with the COVID-19 pandemic

00:00:06.558 --> 00:00:08.758
if you'd had no access to the internet?

00:00:10.818 --> 00:00:12.838

00:00:13.278 --> 00:00:14.918

we were doing what we always do,

00:00:21.698 --> 00:00:24.058
going about our daily business,

00:00:24.078 --> 00:00:29.018

one eye on a virus that was over there.

00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:31.638
And then the next day, boom,
