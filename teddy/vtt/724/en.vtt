I want to talk a little bit today
about labor and work.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.222
When we think about how people work,

00:00:09.246 --> 00:00:11.615
the naive intuition we have

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.003
is that people are like rats in a maze --

00:00:14.027 --> 00:00:15.996
that all people care about is money,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.672
and the moment we give them money,

00:00:17.696 --> 00:00:19.394
we can direct them to work one way,

00:00:19.418 --> 00:00:21.398
we can direct them to work another way.

00:00:21.422 --> 00:00:25.033
This is why we give bonuses to bankers
and pay in all kinds of ways.

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:28.525
And we really have
this incredibly simplistic view

00:00:28.549 --> 00:00:32.819
of why people work, and what
the labor market looks like.
