Hello, everyone.

00:00:03.204 --> 00:00:06.913
It is a tremendous pleasure to be here

00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:08.746
to share with you my story.

00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:12.246
Youâ€™ve all heard of brainwaves.

00:00:13.204 --> 00:00:17.954
For a long time, neuroscientists
didn't know what they meant.

00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:22.621
But we slowly come
to understand their purpose.

00:00:23.663 --> 00:00:29.371
The brain generates waves
with different paces or frequencies

00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:32.996
to transmit information and thoughts
