00:07:59.891 --> 00:08:01.063
walk faster,

00:08:01.087 --> 00:08:02.674
they do better on memory tests,

00:08:02.698 --> 00:08:05.331
they heal quicker, and they live longer.

00:08:06.014 --> 00:08:08.631
Even with brains
full of plaques and tangles,

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.635
some people stayed sharp to the end.

00:08:11.175 --> 00:08:12.829
What did they have in common?

00:08:12.853 --> 00:08:14.159
A sense of purpose.

00:08:14.183 --> 00:08:17.661
And what's the biggest obstacle
to having a sense of purpose in late life?

00:08:17.685 --> 00:08:21.803
A culture that tells us that getting older
means shuffling offstage.

00:08:21.827 --> 00:08:24.598
That's why the World Health
Organization is developing

00:08:24.622 --> 00:08:26.210
a global anti-ageism initiative

00:08:26.234 --> 00:08:29.553
to extend not just
life span but health span.
