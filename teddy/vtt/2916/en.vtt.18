00:08:59.835 --> 00:09:01.826
than the woman she once was?

00:09:02.434 --> 00:09:04.318
This discrimination affects our health,

00:09:04.342 --> 00:09:06.071
our well-being and our income,

00:09:06.095 --> 00:09:08.283
and the effects add up over time.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.231
They are further compounded
by race and by class,

00:09:11.255 --> 00:09:13.467
which is why, everywhere in the world,

00:09:13.491 --> 00:09:16.194
the poorest of the poor
are old women of color.

00:09:17.488 --> 00:09:19.485
What's the takeaway from that map?

00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:21.917
By 2050, one out of five of us,

00:09:21.941 --> 00:09:23.687
almost two billion people,

00:09:23.711 --> 00:09:25.733
will be age 60 and up.

00:09:25.757 --> 00:09:29.228
Longevity is a fundamental hallmark
of human progress.

00:09:29.252 --> 00:09:34.486
All these older people represent a vast
unprecedented and untapped market.
