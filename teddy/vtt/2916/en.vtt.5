00:02:27.824 --> 00:02:30.738
or when we believe in anti-aging products,

00:02:30.762 --> 00:02:33.574
or when we feel like our bodies
are betraying us,

00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:35.528
simply because they are changing.

00:02:36.227 --> 00:02:40.169
Why on earth do we stop celebrating
the ability to adapt and grow

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:41.739
as we move through life?

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.344
Why should aging well mean
struggling to look and move

00:02:45.368 --> 00:02:47.452
like younger versions of ourselves?

00:02:47.877 --> 00:02:50.000
It's embarrassing
to be called out as older

00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:52.095
until we quit being embarrassed about it,

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:55.253
and it's not healthy to go through life
dreading our futures.

00:02:55.277 --> 00:02:58.713
The sooner we get off
this hamster wheel of age denial,

00:02:58.737 --> 00:03:00.585
the better off we are.
