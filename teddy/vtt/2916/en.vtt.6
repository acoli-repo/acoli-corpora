00:02:58.737 --> 00:03:00.585
the better off we are.

00:03:01.641 --> 00:03:03.719
Stereotypes are always
a mistake, of course,

00:03:03.743 --> 00:03:05.469
but especially when it comes to age,

00:03:05.493 --> 00:03:06.830
because the longer we live,

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:08.998
the more different
from one another we become.

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.399
Right? Think about it.

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:13.149
And yet, we tend to think of everyone
in a retirement home

00:03:13.173 --> 00:03:15.043
as the same age: old --

00:03:15.067 --> 00:03:16.584
(Laughter)

00:03:16.608 --> 00:03:19.038
when they can span four decades.

00:03:19.062 --> 00:03:21.729
Can you imagine thinking that way
about a group of people

00:03:21.753 --> 00:03:23.895
between the ages of 20 and 60?

00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:27.861
When you get to a party, do you head
for people your own age?

00:03:27.885 --> 00:03:30.971
Have you ever grumbled
about entitled millennials?
