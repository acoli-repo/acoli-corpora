or the incredible strides
that the gay rights movement

00:06:30.758 --> 00:06:32.820
has made in just a few decades, right?

00:06:32.844 --> 00:06:33.868

00:06:33.892 --> 00:06:35.359
Look at gender.

00:06:35.383 --> 00:06:38.040
We used to think of it
as a binary, male or female,

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:40.230

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:58.218
like in the workforce,
where age discrimination is rampant.

00:06:58.646 --> 00:07:02.091
In Silicon Valley, engineers
