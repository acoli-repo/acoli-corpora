00:10:26.718 --> 00:10:30.112
And that makes it a perfect target
for collective advocacy.

00:10:31.295 --> 00:10:35.304
Why add another -ism to the list
when so many, racism in particular,

00:10:35.328 --> 00:10:37.116

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.373

00:10:38.397 --> 00:10:40.167
we don't have to choose.

00:10:40.191 --> 00:10:42.886

00:10:51.289 --> 00:10:55.686
And when we show up at all ages
for whatever cause matters most to us --

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.435
save the whales, save the democracy --

00:10:58.459 --> 00:11:00.989
we not only make
that effort more effective,
