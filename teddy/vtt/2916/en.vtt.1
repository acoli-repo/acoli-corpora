00:00:29.704 --> 00:00:32.849
Turns out that most of us
can think just fine to the end.

00:00:32.873 --> 00:00:34.782
Dementia rates are dropping, too.

00:00:34.806 --> 00:00:37.711
The real epidemic is anxiety
over memory loss.

00:00:37.735 --> 00:00:39.595
(Laughter)

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:42.135
I also figured that old people
were depressed

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:45.608
because they were old
and they were going to die soon.

00:00:45.632 --> 00:00:47.381
(Laughter)

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:49.359
It turns out that the longer people live,

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:50.882
the less they fear dying,

00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:54.635
and that people are happiest at
the beginnings and the end of their lives.

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:56.656
It's called the U-curve of happiness,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.985
and it's been borne out
by dozens of studies around the world.
