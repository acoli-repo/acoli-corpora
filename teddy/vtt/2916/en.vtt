00:00:01.058 --> 00:00:05.150
What's one thing that every person
in this room is going to become?

00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:06.351
Older.

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:08.941
And most of us are scared stiff
at the prospect.

00:00:08.965 --> 00:00:10.637
How does that word make you feel?

00:00:11.813 --> 00:00:13.290
I used to feel the same way.

00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:15.610
What was I most worried about?

00:00:15.634 --> 00:00:18.935
Ending up drooling
in some grim institutional hallway.

00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:22.494
And then I learned that only
four percent of older Americans

00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:23.907
are living in nursing homes,

00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:25.495
and the percentage is dropping.

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.246
What else was I worried about?

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.680
Dementia.

00:00:29.704 --> 00:00:32.849
Turns out that most of us
can think just fine to the end.
