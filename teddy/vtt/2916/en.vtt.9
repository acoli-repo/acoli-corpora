"Senior moment" quips, for example:

00:04:30.348 --> 00:04:32.372
I stopped making them when it dawned on me

00:04:32.396 --> 00:04:34.514
that when I lost
the car keys in high school,

00:04:34.538 --> 00:04:36.274

00:04:51.293 --> 00:04:52.881
whether running out of money,

00:04:52.905 --> 00:04:55.282
getting sick, ending up alone,

00:04:55.306 --> 00:04:57.769
and those fears are legitimate and real.

00:04:58.264 --> 00:04:59.976
