We know it's not OK to allocate
resources by race or by sex.

00:02:00.398 --> 00:02:03.751
Why should it be OK to weigh
the needs of the young against the old?

00:02:04.587 --> 00:02:08.223
All prejudice relies on "othering" --
seeing a group of people

00:02:08.247 --> 00:02:09.671

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:12.786
other race, other religion,
other nationality.

00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:15.494
The strange thing about ageism:

00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:17.505

00:02:18.226 --> 00:02:21.192
Ageism feeds on denial --
our reluctance to acknowledge

00:02:21.216 --> 00:02:24.166

that older person.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.800
It's denial when we try
to pass for younger

00:02:27.824 --> 00:02:30.738
or when we believe in anti-aging products,
