00:01:29.907 --> 00:01:31.756
Ageism cuts both ways.

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:37.570
All -isms are socially constructed
ideas -- racism, sexism, homophobia --

00:01:37.594 --> 00:01:39.774
and that means we make them up,

00:01:39.798 --> 00:01:41.582
and they can change over time.

00:01:42.128 --> 00:01:45.127
All these prejudices
pit us against each other

00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:47.293
to maintain the status quo,

00:01:47.317 --> 00:01:51.439
like auto workers in the US competing
against auto workers in Mexico

00:01:51.463 --> 00:01:54.046
instead of organizing for better wages.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.959
(Applause)

00:01:55.983 --> 00:02:00.374
We know it's not OK to allocate
resources by race or by sex.
