00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:02.585
You don't have to be a Buddhist
or a billionaire.

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.598
The curve is a function of the way
aging itself affects the brain.

00:01:07.128 --> 00:01:10.410
So I started feeling a lot better
about getting older,

00:01:10.434 --> 00:01:15.335
and I started obsessing about why
so few people know these things.

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:17.005
The reason is ageism:

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:20.533
discrimination and stereotyping
on the basis of age.

00:01:21.175 --> 00:01:25.062
We experience it anytime someone assumes
we're too old for something,

00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:28.386
instead of finding out who we are
and what we're capable of,

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.883
or too young.

00:01:29.907 --> 00:01:31.756
Ageism cuts both ways.
