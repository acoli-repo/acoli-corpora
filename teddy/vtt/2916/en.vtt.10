00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.110
is that the experience of reaching old age

00:05:02.134 --> 00:05:04.745
can be better or worse
depending on the culture

00:05:04.769 --> 00:05:06.276
in which it takes place.

00:05:06.755 --> 00:05:10.031
It is not having a vagina
that makes life harder for women.

00:05:10.055 --> 00:05:11.269
It's sexism.

00:05:11.293 --> 00:05:13.188
(Applause)

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:15.961
It's not loving a man that makes
life harder for gay guys.

00:05:15.985 --> 00:05:17.284
It's homophobia.

00:05:17.308 --> 00:05:20.896
And it is not the passage of time
that makes getting older

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.509
so much harder than it has to be.

00:05:22.533 --> 00:05:23.862
It is ageism.

00:05:23.886 --> 00:05:25.468
When labels are hard to read

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:26.833
or there's no handrail

00:05:26.857 --> 00:05:28.517
or we can't open the damn jar,

00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:29.915
we blame ourselves,

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:32.303
our failure to age successfully,
