00:09:57.596 --> 00:10:00.430
Almost two-thirds of people
over 60 around the world

00:10:00.454 --> 00:10:03.029
say they have trouble
accessing healthcare.

00:10:03.053 --> 00:10:06.860
Almost three-quarters say their income
doesn't cover basic services

00:10:06.884 --> 00:10:10.641
like food, water, electricity,
and decent housing.

00:10:11.214 --> 00:10:15.245
Is this the world we want our children,
who may well live to be a hundred,

00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:16.530
to inherit?

00:10:16.554 --> 00:10:20.569
Everyone -- all ages,
all genders, all nationalities --

00:10:20.593 --> 00:10:22.805
is old or future-old,

00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:26.694
and unless we put an end to it,
ageism will oppress us all.

00:10:26.718 --> 00:10:30.112
And that makes it a perfect target
for collective advocacy.
