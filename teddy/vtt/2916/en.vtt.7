Have you ever grumbled
about entitled millennials?

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.141
Have you ever rejected a haircut
or a relationship or an outing

00:03:35.165 --> 00:03:37.515
because it's not age-appropriate?

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:39.347
For adults, there's no such thing.

00:03:39.783 --> 00:03:41.818
All these behaviors are ageist.

00:03:41.842 --> 00:03:43.513
We all do them,

00:03:43.537 --> 00:03:46.674
and we can't challenge bias
unless we're aware of it.

00:03:46.698 --> 00:03:48.034
Nobody's born ageist,

00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:49.724
but it starts at early childhood,

00:03:49.748 --> 00:03:53.198
around the same time attitudes
towards race and gender start to form,

00:03:53.222 --> 00:03:56.654
because negative messages
about late life bombard us

00:03:56.678 --> 00:04:00.030
from the media and popular
culture at every turn.
