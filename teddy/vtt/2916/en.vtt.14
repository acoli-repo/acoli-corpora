In Silicon Valley, engineers
are getting Botoxed and hair-plugged

00:07:02.115 --> 00:07:03.443
before key interviews --

00:07:03.467 --> 00:07:05.948
and these are skilled
white men in their 30s,

00:07:05.972 --> 00:07:08.444
so imagine the effects
further down the food chain.

00:07:08.468 --> 00:07:10.630
(Laughter)

00:07:10.654 --> 00:07:14.025
The personal and economic
consequences are devastating.

00:07:14.049 --> 00:07:18.195
Not one stereotype about older workers
holds up under scrutiny.

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:22.297
Companies aren't adaptable and creative
because their employees are young;

00:07:22.321 --> 00:07:24.593
they're adaptable and creative despite it.

00:07:25.294 --> 00:07:26.449
Companies --

00:07:26.473 --> 00:07:27.537
(Laughter)

00:07:27.561 --> 00:07:30.153
(Applause)
