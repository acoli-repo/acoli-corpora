00:03:58.082 --> 00:04:00.514
a gift for you to do
something for someone,

00:04:00.538 --> 00:04:04.058
especially when it's coming
from their place of vulnerability.

00:04:04.082 --> 00:04:06.130
With everything I learned
from kindergarten,

00:04:06.154 --> 00:04:08.115
or in "teaching" kindergarten,

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.006
I went to conquer other things in life.

00:04:10.508 --> 00:04:11.829
Fast-forward nine years,

00:04:11.853 --> 00:04:15.401
and I landed in an association
for project management professionals

00:04:15.425 --> 00:04:18.305
in a role that works
extensively with volunteers.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.464
Working with volunteers
is a wonderful experience,

00:04:21.488 --> 00:04:24.155
but there are some things
I wish had a been warned about,

00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:26.011
like how to set boundaries.

00:04:26.416 --> 00:04:28.655
It's very easy to fall
into the rabbit hole

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:30.917
of "because they're volunteers."
