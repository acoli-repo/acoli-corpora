00:00:58.343 --> 00:01:00.697
because he would clean it after his lunch.

00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:03.708
And if something happened
and he needed a change of clothes,

00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:06.818
he would do so very quietly
and discreetly by himself.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.417
He didn't ask for help much himself,

00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:12.353
but he was the one
that his classmates went to for help --

00:01:12.377 --> 00:01:13.528
help on things like,

00:01:13.552 --> 00:01:16.410
can he help them finish their kimchi?
Because it's too spicy.

00:01:16.933 --> 00:01:19.554
He didn't like showing
any type of affection to teachers

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:21.902
and came across as "the cool kid."

00:01:21.926 --> 00:01:23.594
If you gave him a good-morning hug,

00:01:23.618 --> 00:01:24.864
he would roll his eyes

00:01:24.888 --> 00:01:27.124
and make a funny face
as to show discontent,

00:01:27.148 --> 00:01:30.426
but also stand there and wait
if he didn't get his morning hug.
