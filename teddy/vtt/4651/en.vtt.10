00:04:57.768 --> 00:05:00.484
and we talked about what we wanted
to be in the next year,

00:05:00.508 --> 00:05:02.784
my keywords were always
"help" or "helpful."

00:05:02.808 --> 00:05:05.426
The problem was that I wasn't
being just helpful.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:08.388
Over time, I put more and more
pressure on myself

00:05:08.412 --> 00:05:09.732
to always be busy

00:05:09.756 --> 00:05:11.714
and to always do a good job.

00:05:11.738 --> 00:05:15.755

00:05:21.344 --> 00:05:23.035

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:24.537
distraction with even more work

00:05:24.561 --> 00:05:25.968
and drinking --

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.337
and lots of it.

00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:29.967
I was so busy being helpful

00:05:29.991 --> 00:05:31.354
and being a great Sam
