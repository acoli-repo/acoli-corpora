00:05:29.991 --> 00:05:31.354
and being a great Sam

00:05:31.378 --> 00:05:34.159
that I forgot how to ask
for help when I needed it.

00:05:34.183 --> 00:05:36.014
All I had to do was ask,

00:05:36.038 --> 00:05:38.981
and if I truly believed
that asking for help was a gift,

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.179
then I should have been
doing it more, right?

00:05:41.565 --> 00:05:43.723
Well, we don't always practice
what we preach,

00:05:43.747 --> 00:05:44.924
but about two years ago,

00:05:44.948 --> 00:05:47.293
I was slapped with a big, fat reminder.

00:05:47.317 --> 00:05:50.775
To say that I was burned-out
at the time was an understatement,

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:53.022
but thanks to my coping
mechanism, drinking,

00:05:53.046 --> 00:05:55.478
it looked like I was
just having a great time.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.159
But one day,

00:05:57.183 --> 00:05:58.986
just like Sam in the playground,

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.949
I tripped over my own two feet.
