00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.949
I tripped over my own two feet.

00:06:01.691 --> 00:06:02.937
I blacked out

00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:06.316
and woke up with a big cut
on my foot from broken pieces of glass,

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.066
eyes swollen from crying

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.238
and a voice so hoarse
that I'd most likely been wailing.

00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:14.839
I don't have much recollection
of what actually happened,

00:06:14.863 --> 00:06:17.757
but I remember feeling
frustrated, sad and afraid.

00:06:18.596 --> 00:06:20.753
Now you've known me
for only about 10 minutes,

00:06:20.777 --> 00:06:23.593
but you can probably tell
that this was really not like me,

00:06:23.617 --> 00:06:26.299
so when I came to my senses
about what had happened,

00:06:26.323 --> 00:06:27.540
I was in shock.

00:06:28.216 --> 00:06:31.356
There was no other way of saying it
other than that I needed help,
