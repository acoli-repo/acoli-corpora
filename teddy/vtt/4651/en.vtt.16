00:07:58.607 --> 00:08:00.188
And more importantly,

00:08:00.212 --> 00:08:02.877
why wouldn't I want others
to feel the happiness and joy

00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:05.115
that comes from helping
the Sams of the world?

00:08:05.944 --> 00:08:08.139
We all want to be the best Sams in life:

00:08:08.163 --> 00:08:10.990
to be strong, independent
and self-reliant,

00:08:11.014 --> 00:08:13.238
but we don't always have to be.

00:08:13.262 --> 00:08:15.572
So let's start asking for help more often,

00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:18.586
because helping Sams
is a privilege and a gift.

00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:20.567
Thank you.
