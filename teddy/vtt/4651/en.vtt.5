00:02:29.093 --> 00:02:31.435
but I really wanted
that moment of validation

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.195
that yes, I had earned a kid's trust
enough to be the one to help them.

00:02:35.817 --> 00:02:37.547
Then, it finally happened.

00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:39.040
It was a beautiful day.

00:02:39.064 --> 00:02:41.971
It was during recess
at the indoor playground.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.251
The kids were playing

00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:45.275
and I was getting some things laminated --

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.561
because teachers
are forever laminating stuff --

00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:49.415
in the teacher's room next door.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.081
Then I heard a kid yell,
"Teacher, teacher, Sam fell down."

00:02:53.515 --> 00:02:55.117
So I went out to peak,

00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:56.385
looked around for Sam,

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.070
and there he was, looking very puzzled,

00:02:59.094 --> 00:03:01.676
as if he was trying to add double digits.
