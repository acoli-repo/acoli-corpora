Usually kids will be OK
until they lock eyes with an adult:

00:02:00.984 --> 00:02:03.773
one that they trust
and know can do something for them.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.582
Eyes lock, and then,
they burst out in tears.

00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:10.622
When I noticed this,
I so wanted it to happen to me,

00:02:10.646 --> 00:02:13.821
because to me, that meant
that you had earned a kid's trust

00:02:13.845 --> 00:02:16.878
and had proven that you're capable
to help them with anything.

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:18.415
You were a hero to them.

00:02:19.118 --> 00:02:21.742
Weeks went by of me
just watching other teachers

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:23.378
have kids run to them in tears,

00:02:23.402 --> 00:02:25.179
and I'd watch in jealousy.

00:02:25.203 --> 00:02:26.460
Oh, was I jealous.

00:02:26.484 --> 00:02:29.069
I mean, of course
I didn't want the kids to fall,

00:02:29.093 --> 00:02:31.435
but I really wanted
that moment of validation
