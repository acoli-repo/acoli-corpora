00:00:01.646 --> 00:00:04.906
What can we learn from children
about being better humans?

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.836
They're fiercely loyal to their friends,

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.802
fast to defend, quick to apologize

00:00:08.826 --> 00:00:10.273
and swift to forgive.

00:00:10.297 --> 00:00:12.222
But as a past kindergarten teacher --

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:14.266
always a kindergarten teacher at heart --

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.539
I want to share with you

00:00:15.563 --> 00:00:19.373
a surprising lesson I learned from them
about being asked for help.

00:00:19.397 --> 00:00:20.934
I love human behaviors --

00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:24.348
how we act differently in different
situations and environments --

00:00:24.372 --> 00:00:27.095
and these cute five-year-olds
with their adorable cheeks

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.800
and the perfect height
to give warm, morning hugs to

00:00:29.824 --> 00:00:32.314
and almost a competitive
love for high fives,
