00:02:59.094 --> 00:03:01.676
as if he was trying to add double digits.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.070
Then he looked at me,

00:03:03.094 --> 00:03:04.616
our eyes locked,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.284
and then it happened.

00:03:06.308 --> 00:03:08.245
His lower lip started to tremble

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.118
and his tiny eyes
started to fill with tears.

00:03:11.142 --> 00:03:13.793
Then he burst out in tears
running towards me,

00:03:13.817 --> 00:03:14.984
and it was glorious.

00:03:15.008 --> 00:03:16.857
I'll never forget that moment.

00:03:16.881 --> 00:03:20.384
He let me give him a big hug
to help him calm down,

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:23.308
and it turns out that yes,
he did trip over his own two feet

00:03:23.332 --> 00:03:26.144
so there was no one
other than the floor to reprimand.

00:03:26.168 --> 00:03:28.174
We checked to make sure
that he wasn't hurt

00:03:28.198 --> 00:03:30.524
and he overcame
that with not even a bruise.
