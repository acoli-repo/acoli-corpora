00:00:29.824 --> 00:00:32.314
and almost a competitive
love for high fives,

00:00:32.338 --> 00:00:33.636
were so interesting.

00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:36.329
My first class was called a Mars class.

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:38.102
I had 10 students,

00:00:38.126 --> 00:00:40.475
and each were so full of character.

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:42.949
But there was this one kid
I'll never forget.

00:00:42.973 --> 00:00:44.757
Let's call him Sam.

00:00:45.398 --> 00:00:48.104
Sam behaved like he forgot
he was only five.

00:00:48.555 --> 00:00:50.169
He was so independent.

00:00:50.193 --> 00:00:52.807
Not only did he know
how to tie his own shoelaces,

00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:55.454
but he knew how to tie
other kids' shoelaces too.

00:00:55.825 --> 00:00:58.319
He also never took home a dirty thermos,

00:00:58.343 --> 00:01:00.697
because he would clean it after his lunch.
