00:03:28.198 --> 00:03:30.524
and he overcame
that with not even a bruise.

00:03:30.548 --> 00:03:32.506
It was in that moment, oddly --

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.837
it didn't feel like
I was there to help Sam,

00:03:34.861 --> 00:03:37.308
but rather he was giving me this gift,

00:03:37.332 --> 00:03:39.442
this opportunity to help him.

00:03:39.466 --> 00:03:42.863
And it's something very weird
that I struggle putting down in words.

00:03:42.887 --> 00:03:44.055
With his vulnerability

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.483
in coming to me for help
as if I could do something about it,

00:03:47.507 --> 00:03:49.774
you would think that gives me the power,

00:03:49.798 --> 00:03:50.982
but in that moment,

00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:52.872
no, it was quite the opposite,

00:03:52.896 --> 00:03:55.122
and the power shifted even more so to him.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.058
Being asked for help is a privilege:

00:03:58.082 --> 00:04:00.514
a gift for you to do
something for someone,
