00:00:05.375 --> 00:00:09.000
but chances are
you use them every single day.

00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:12.893
By 2050, researchers estimate

00:00:12.917 --> 00:00:15.958
that there will be more plastic
in the ocean than fish.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.893
Despite our best efforts,

00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:24.625
only nine percent of all plastic we use
winds up being recycled.

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:26.934
And even worse,

00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.851
plastic is incredibly tough and durable
