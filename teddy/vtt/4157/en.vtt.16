00:07:57.708 --> 00:08:00.643
And we just haven't invested
in robust systems.

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:03.476
One of the interesting things
about this outbreak

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.309
is that it has created an environment

00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:08.643
in which we're now dependent
on telemedicine,

00:08:08.667 --> 00:08:10.572
which has been around for several years,

00:08:10.596 --> 00:08:12.643
but we weren't quite into it.

00:08:12.667 --> 00:08:15.208
But now, it's probably
going to be the new standard.

00:08:16.083 --> 00:08:17.351
DB: But it also seems --

00:08:17.375 --> 00:08:18.643
So, obviously,

00:08:18.667 --> 00:08:22.893
those countries with an incredibly
robust health care system,

00:08:22.917 --> 00:08:24.809
like Taiwan, have done well,

00:08:24.833 --> 00:08:28.559
but it seems like even countries
that perhaps would be considered

00:08:28.583 --> 00:08:33.726
to have a less robust health care system,
like a Ghana in Africa,
