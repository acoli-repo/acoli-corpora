00:04:59.375 --> 00:05:01.684
But I think that wearing masks

00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:04.208
is probably going to be
part of our culture.

00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:08.434
We've already seen it probably will not be
part of our beach culture,

00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:10.476
although it probably should be for now.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.476
But I do think that we're going to see
more and more people wearing masks

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.476
in a variety of settings.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.893
And I think that makes sense.

00:05:18.917 --> 00:05:22.518
DB: Yeah, wear your mask
to show that you care about others.

00:05:22.542 --> 00:05:25.809
And that you have this,
kind of, public health spirit.

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:27.601
So speaking of Asia,

00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:30.643
who has done well?
