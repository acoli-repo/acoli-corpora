00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:00.934
have implemented that.

00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.018
Now we're a big country,
we're a complex country.

00:09:04.042 --> 00:09:07.809
And yes, we didn't get
the testing right to begin with.

00:09:07.833 --> 00:09:12.518
But we should not repeat the mistakes
that we had over the last three months,

00:09:12.542 --> 00:09:15.184
because we've still got
several months to go.

00:09:15.208 --> 00:09:17.101
And now that we know what we did wrong,

00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:20.143
I'm encouraging us
to do it right the next time.

00:09:20.167 --> 00:09:21.601
DB: That seems smart.

00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:23.726
GB: And the next time is tomorrow.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.268
DB: That's right.

00:09:25.292 --> 00:09:26.726
It's already started.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.226
I mean, it almost seems to me,

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.559
if I can use this metaphor,

00:09:29.583 --> 00:09:30.976
that some of these countries
