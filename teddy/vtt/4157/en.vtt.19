00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.809

00:09:33.833 --> 00:09:38.000
because they had experience
with maybe Ebola or the first SARS.

00:09:39.292 --> 00:09:41.809
Is that the key, previous exposure

00:09:41.833 --> 00:09:44.893
to these kind of public health crises?

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:47.226

And while there may be some early evidence

00:09:50.042 --> 00:09:53.518

00:09:53.542 --> 00:09:57.184
we may have some
early protection from that,

00:09:57.208 --> 00:10:00.018
there's some early,
early studies looking at that,
