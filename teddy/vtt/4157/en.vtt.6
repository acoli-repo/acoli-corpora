00:02:56.708 --> 00:03:00.184
that people are going to be doing
a lot more of the public health things,

00:03:00.208 --> 00:03:02.101
in terms of handwashing

00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:06.684

You know, it was not too long ago

00:03:09.208 --> 00:03:12.113
when you got in your car
and you didn't put your seat belt on.

00:03:12.137 --> 00:03:13.393
Today we do it,

00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:15.851

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:18.309
Most of us don't smoke,

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:20.684
because we know that that's bad for us.

00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:24.851
Most of us look both ways
before we cross a street.

00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:27.684
Most of us, you know,

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:31.018
do things in our house,
that are -- fix trip hazards.
