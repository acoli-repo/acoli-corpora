00:09:57.208 --> 00:10:00.018
there's some early,
early studies looking at that,

00:10:00.042 --> 00:10:01.309
that's not the solution.

00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:06.268
The secret sauce here

00:10:06.292 --> 00:10:08.101

00:10:22.542 --> 00:10:24.809

We think this one was bad,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.476
