00:11:59.708 --> 00:12:01.851
and contain them.

00:12:01.875 --> 00:12:03.643
But we're now in an environment

00:12:03.667 --> 00:12:06.476
where people can, by the way,
make some of these things up.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:11.184
Now, this one did not happen,
as best we can tell, it's not man-made.

00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:13.643
It did not probably come
out of a leak in the lab.

00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:18.976
But we know that, when I was in school,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.184
to grow a bug, you had to be
pretty sophisticated.

00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:23.851
That's not the case today.

00:12:23.875 --> 00:12:28.351
And we need to protect ourselves
from both naturally occurring infections

00:12:28.375 --> 00:12:31.750
and from those that are created by humans.
