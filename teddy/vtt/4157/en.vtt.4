00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:09.643
that now that everybody really knows
what public health is,

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:13.851
that everybody should always recognize
that their second job is public health,

00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:17.601
whether you're picking up the garbage
or working in a grocery store,

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:20.226
or you are a bus driver,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.226

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.643

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:28.476
everybody needs to put
the public health mantle

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.958
into what they do each and every day.
