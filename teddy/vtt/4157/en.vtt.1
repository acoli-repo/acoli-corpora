GB: I'm here. (Laughs)

00:00:30.542 --> 00:00:32.059
DB: Hanging in there. Good.

00:00:32.083 --> 00:00:33.768
GB: Hanging in.

00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:39.708
DB: We know that the theme of the moment
is reopening, I would say.

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:43.018
We just heard one possibility for that,

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:44.643
but obviously,

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:47.934
a lot of countries have already
reopened in one form or another,

00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.268
and I believe, as of today,

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:55.083
all 50 states here in the US
have reopened in one form or another.

00:00:56.958 --> 00:01:01.208
How do we do that smartly,
how do we do that safely?
