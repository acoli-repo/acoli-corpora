00:08:28.583 --> 00:08:33.726
to have a less robust health care system,
like a Ghana in Africa,

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.059
have actually done well.

00:08:35.083 --> 00:08:38.684
What has been the, I guess,
the secret sauce

00:08:38.708 --> 00:08:40.726
for those kinds of countries?

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.226
GB: Yeah, it's still pretty early
in some of their exposures,

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:48.934
and hopefully, they might not
have a wave that comes later,

00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.934
that's still a possibility,

00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.268
but at the end of the day,

00:08:52.292 --> 00:08:57.226
I think, to the extent you have done
good, sound public health practices,

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.643
all of the countries that have done well

00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:00.934
have implemented that.
