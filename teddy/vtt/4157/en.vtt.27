"How do we deal with people
who don't believe this is serious?"

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:40.000
GB: You know, you just have to continue
to communicate the truth to folks.

00:13:40.917 --> 00:13:43.393
One of the things
about this particular disease

00:13:43.417 --> 00:13:45.226
is that it does not spare anyone.

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.143
It does not recognize political parties,

00:13:48.167 --> 00:13:50.934
it does not recognize geography,

00:13:50.958 --> 00:13:53.851
and we had lots of people,
particularly in rural communities,

00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:56.976
that were not seeing it,
because it had not yet come to them,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.851
and they didn't believe it was real.

00:13:58.875 --> 00:14:03.643
And now many of those communities
are being ravaged by this disease.
