00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.476
imagine what would have happened
had Ebola been aerosolized,

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.601
or MERS had been aerosolized.

00:10:35.625 --> 00:10:37.417
You know, pick a TV movie.

00:10:38.875 --> 00:10:40.643
Even though this was a bad one,

00:10:40.667 --> 00:10:44.417
we still dodged a really,
really bad one this time.

00:10:45.375 --> 00:10:48.934
DB: Yeah, Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome is no joke,

00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:52.018
and we should be thankful
that it doesn't spread more easily,

00:10:52.042 --> 00:10:53.351
like SARS-CoV.

00:10:53.375 --> 00:10:54.643
Is this, though --

00:10:54.667 --> 00:10:56.393
So all these diseases are zoonotic,

00:10:56.417 --> 00:11:00.559
that means they jumped to us
from the animals that are out there.
