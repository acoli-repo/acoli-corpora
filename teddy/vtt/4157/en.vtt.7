WEBVTT

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:31.018
do things in our house,
that are -- fix trip hazards.

00:03:31.042 --> 00:03:33.851
So as we go forward with this outbreak,

00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:36.309
I'm hoping that people will pay
a lot more attention

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:39.809
to things that can cause us
to get an infection.

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:43.958
So you know, cleaning things,
disinfecting things.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.726
More importantly,
not coming to work if you're sick.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.268
I'm hoping that employers
will put in paid sick leave for everybody,

00:03:53.292 --> 00:03:55.059
so people can stay home.

00:03:55.083 --> 00:03:57.101
Yeah, it’s an additional cost,

00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:59.476
but I can tell you that we've now learned

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.351
that the cost of not doing
something like that
