00:01:28.583 --> 00:01:30.893
Thinking about everything we do,

00:01:30.917 --> 00:01:33.726
you know, before we go to work
in the morning,

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.643
while we're at work.

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:39.893
And being as careful
as many of us have been

00:01:39.917 --> 00:01:41.476
in the last two months,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.643
as we go into the next three months,

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:45.208
because this thing is not over.

00:01:45.917 --> 00:01:47.184
DB: Right.

00:01:47.208 --> 00:01:52.458
There is the chance of more waves,
as Uri [Alon] mentioned.

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:56.893
It seems like it's kind of
incumbent on all of us then

00:01:56.917 --> 00:02:00.393
to take public health
as kind of a second job.
