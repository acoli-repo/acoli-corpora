00:14:59.583 --> 00:15:02.750
resources, training,
staffing on the table.

00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:06.351
And by the way,
our next public health crisis

00:15:06.375 --> 00:15:10.476
is not 10 years from now,
it's not 20 years from now,

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.976
it's the potential co-occurrence

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.143
of influenza, which we know
is going to happen this fall,

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:18.893
because it comes every year,

00:15:18.917 --> 00:15:23.726
with either continued COVID
or a spike in COVID.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.768
And we're going to have a disease process

00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:29.476
which presents very much the same,

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.833
and we're going to have to differentiate
COVID from influenza.
