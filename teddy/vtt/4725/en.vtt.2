00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:02.091
Similar to a domino effect,
one person's yawn triggers a yawn

00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:04.974
in a person nearby
that has observed the act.

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:08.506
Once this reflex is triggered,
it must run its course.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.519
Have you ever tried to stop
a yawn once it has begun?

00:01:11.543 --> 00:01:14.531
Basically impossible!

00:01:15.268 --> 00:01:17.154
Another physiological hypothesis

00:01:17.178 --> 00:01:20.276
is known as non-conscious mimicry,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.988
or the chameleon effect.

00:01:22.012 --> 00:01:24.560
This occurs when you
imitate someone's behavior

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:25.919
without knowing it,

00:01:25.943 --> 00:01:28.289
a subtle and unintentional
copycat maneuver.

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:31.139
People tend to mimic
each other's postures.
