00:01:58.147 --> 00:02:01.213
as when we see someone else
perform the same action.

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:04.747
These neurons are important
for learning and self-awareness.

00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:07.898
For example, watching someone
do something physical,

00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:10.627
like knitting or putting on lipstick,

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:14.566
can help you do those same
actions more accurately.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.677
Neuroimaging studies using fMRI,
functional magnetic resonance imaging,

00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:23.897
show us that when we seem someone yawn
or even hear their yawn,

00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:27.368
a specific area of the brain
housing these mirror neurons

00:02:27.392 --> 00:02:28.563
tends to light up,

00:02:28.587 --> 00:02:32.555
which, in turn, causes us to respond
with the same action:
