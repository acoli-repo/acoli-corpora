00:02:28.587 --> 00:02:32.555
which, in turn, causes us to respond
with the same action:

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:33.601
a yawn!

00:02:34.227 --> 00:02:38.942
Our psychological hypothesis also involves
the work of these mirror neurons.

00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:41.434
We will call it the empathy yawn.

00:02:42.227 --> 00:02:45.346
Empathy is the ability to understand
what someone else is feeling

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.818
and partake in their emotion,

00:02:46.842 --> 00:02:49.035
a crucial ability
for social animals like us.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.067
Recently, neuroscientists have found
that a subset of mirror neurons

00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:56.385
allows us to empathize
with others' feelings

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:57.573
at a deeper level.

00:02:57.597 --> 00:02:58.598
(Yawn)

00:02:58.622 --> 00:03:01.338
Scientists discovered
this empathetic response to yawning
