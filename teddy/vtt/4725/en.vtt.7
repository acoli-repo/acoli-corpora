00:03:29.248 --> 00:03:32.218
occurs more frequently
among friends than strangers.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.684
In fact, contagious
yawning starts occurring

00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:38.315
when we are about four or five years old,

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:39.711
at the point when children

00:03:39.735 --> 00:03:42.574
develop the ability to identify
others' emotions properly.

00:03:43.513 --> 00:03:47.409
Still, while newer scientific studies aim
to prove that contagious yawning

00:03:47.433 --> 00:03:49.389
is based on this capacity for empathy,

00:03:49.413 --> 00:03:52.861
more research is needed to shed light
on what exactly is going on.

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:56.888
It's possible that the answer lies
in another hypothesis altogether.

00:03:57.498 --> 00:03:59.440
The next time you get caught in a yawn,

00:03:59.464 --> 00:04:01.787
take a second to think
about what just happened.
