00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:30.615
why it happens,

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:33.123
there are many hypotheses
currently being researched.

00:00:33.782 --> 00:00:36.557
Let's take a look at a few
of the most prevalent ones,

00:00:36.581 --> 00:00:38.975
beginning with two
physiological hypotheses

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:41.189
before moving to a psychological one.

00:00:42.436 --> 00:00:44.730
Our first physiological hypothesis

00:00:44.754 --> 00:00:48.501
states that contagious yawning
is triggered by a specific stimulus,

00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:49.988
an initial yawn.

00:00:50.012 --> 00:00:52.617
This is called fixed action pattern.

00:00:53.228 --> 00:00:55.919
Think of fixed action pattern
like a reflex.

00:00:55.943 --> 00:00:58.668
Your yawn makes me yawn.

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:02.091
Similar to a domino effect,
one person's yawn triggers a yawn
