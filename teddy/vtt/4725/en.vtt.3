00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:31.139
People tend to mimic
each other's postures.

00:01:31.163 --> 00:01:34.695
If you are seated across from someone
that has their legs crossed,

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.584
you might cross your own legs.

00:01:37.458 --> 00:01:38.891
This hypothesis suggests

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:41.372
that we yawn when we see someone else yawn

00:01:41.396 --> 00:01:44.248
because we are unconsciously copying
his or her behavior.

00:01:45.148 --> 00:01:48.306
Scientists believe that this chameleon
effect is possible

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.215
because of a special set of neurons
known as mirror neurons.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.562
Mirror neurons are a type of brain cell

00:01:55.586 --> 00:01:58.123
that responds equally
when we perform an action

00:01:58.147 --> 00:02:01.213
as when we see someone else
perform the same action.
