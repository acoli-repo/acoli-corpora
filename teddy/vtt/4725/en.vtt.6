Scientists discovered
this empathetic response to yawning

00:03:01.362 --> 00:03:03.616
while testing the first
hypothesis we mentioned,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.125
fixed action pattern.

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:08.942
This study was set up to show
that dogs would enact a yawn reflex

00:03:08.966 --> 00:03:11.597
at the mere sound of a human yawn.

00:03:12.127 --> 00:03:15.971
While their study showed this to be true,
they found something else interesting.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.773
Dogs yawned more frequently
at familiar yawns,

00:03:19.797 --> 00:03:21.273
such as from their owners,

00:03:21.297 --> 00:03:23.698
than at unfamiliar yawns from strangers.

00:03:24.397 --> 00:03:27.318
Following this research,
other studies on humans and primates

00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:29.224
have also shown that contagious yawning

00:03:29.248 --> 00:03:32.218
occurs more frequently
among friends than strangers.
