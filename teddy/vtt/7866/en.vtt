00:00:00.455 --> 00:00:03.875
I was on a date, just about to eat dinner,

00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:05.585
and I hear a growling sound.

00:00:05.585 --> 00:00:07.462
And I look at the guy,

00:00:07.503 --> 00:00:10.506
he says to me, "That's your
stomach, not mine."

00:00:10.506 --> 00:00:11.924
(Laughs)

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:16.179
How do I not recognize the sounds
coming from my own body,

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.972
not to mention my own voice?

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:22.602
I love the sound of my voice
on a microphone,

00:00:22.643 --> 00:00:24.228
but it didn't start out that way.

00:00:24.771 --> 00:00:26.147
When I was younger,

00:00:26.147 --> 00:00:28.483
I was in love with other people's voices.

00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:29.692
And like so many of us,

00:00:29.692 --> 00:00:32.528
the first time I ever heard
my voice on a recording,
