00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to talk today about saving more,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but not today, tomorrow.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm going to talk about Save More Tomorrow.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's a program that Richard Thaler

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
from the University of Chicago and I

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
devised maybe 15 years ago.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The program, in a sense,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
is an example of behavioral finance

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
on steroids --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
how we could really use behavioral finance.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now you might ask, what is behavioral finance?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So let's think about how we manage our money.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Let's start with mortgages.
