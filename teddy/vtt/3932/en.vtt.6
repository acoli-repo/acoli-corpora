00:02:58.013 --> 00:03:01.705
Sighted astronomers
depend on this kind of plot

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:06.401
in order to interpret how
this light intensity changes over time.

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:12.449
On the left, you will be seeing
the light intensity without a burst,

00:03:12.473 --> 00:03:16.628
and on the right, you will be seeing
the light intensity with the burst.

00:03:18.381 --> 00:03:22.082
Early during my career,
I could also see this kind of plot.

00:03:22.562 --> 00:03:25.290
But then, I lost my sight.

00:03:25.314 --> 00:03:28.466
I completely lost my sight
because of extended illness,

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.175
and with it, I lost
the opportunity to see this plot
