00:04:59.854 --> 00:05:01.088
and it's mapped in pitch.

00:05:01.112 --> 00:05:03.531
The process is called sonification.

00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.268
So listening to this
brought something to the ear

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:10.641
besides the obvious burst.

00:05:10.665 --> 00:05:15.186
When I examine the very strong
low-frequency regions,

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.082
or bass line -- I'm zooming
into the bass line now.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.019
We noted resonances characteristic
of electrically charged gasses

00:05:27.043 --> 00:05:28.645
like the solar wind.

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.172
And I want you to hear what I heard.
