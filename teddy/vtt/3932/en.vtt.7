and with it, I lost
the opportunity to see this plot

00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:35.965
and the opportunity to do my physics.

00:03:37.672 --> 00:03:40.127
It was a very strong transition
for me in many ways.

00:03:41.295 --> 00:03:45.540
And professionally, it left me
without a way to do my science.

00:03:45.564 --> 00:03:50.179
I longed to access and scrutinize
this energetic light

00:03:50.203 --> 00:03:52.889
and figure out the astrophysical cause.

00:03:52.913 --> 00:03:56.375
I wanted to experience
the spacious wonder, the excitement,

00:03:56.399 --> 00:04:00.848
the joy produced by the detection
of such a titanic celestial event.
