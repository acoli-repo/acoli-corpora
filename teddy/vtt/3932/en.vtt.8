00:03:56.399 --> 00:04:00.848
the joy produced by the detection
of such a titanic celestial event.

00:04:01.352 --> 00:04:04.652
I thought long and hard about it,

00:04:04.676 --> 00:04:08.361
when I suddenly realized
that all a light curve is,

00:04:08.385 --> 00:04:12.226
is a table of numbers
converted into a visual plot.

00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:14.762
So along with my collaborators,

00:04:14.786 --> 00:04:18.994
we worked really hard and we translated
the numbers into sound.

00:04:19.765 --> 00:04:21.769
I achieved access to the data,

00:04:21.793 --> 00:04:26.806
and today I'm able to do physics
at the level of the best astronomer,

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.981
using sound.

00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:30.633
And what people have been able to do,
