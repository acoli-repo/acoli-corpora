00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:30.633
And what people have been able to do,

00:04:30.657 --> 00:04:31.810
mainly visually,

00:04:31.834 --> 00:04:33.178
for hundreds of years,

00:04:33.202 --> 00:04:35.544
now I do it using sound.

00:04:35.892 --> 00:04:36.929
(Applause)

00:04:36.953 --> 00:04:38.655
Listening to this gamma-ray burst

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:40.999
that you're seeing on the --
(Applause continues)

00:04:41.023 --> 00:04:42.174
Thank you.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:44.906
Listening to this burst
that you're seeing on the screen

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.525
brought something to the ear
beyond the obvious burst.

00:04:47.973 --> 00:04:49.908
Now I'm going to play the burst for you.

00:04:49.932 --> 00:04:51.986
It's not music, it's sound.

00:04:53.264 --> 00:04:56.515
(Digital beeping sounds)

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.830
This is scientific data
converted into sound,

00:04:59.854 --> 00:05:01.088
and it's mapped in pitch.
