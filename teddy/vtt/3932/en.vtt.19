00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:32.089
These students will be learning
radio astronomy,

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:35.351
and they will be learning
the sonification methods

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:39.846
in order to study astronomical events
like huge ejections of energy

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.306
from the sun, known as
coronal mass ejections.

00:09:43.194 --> 00:09:44.953
What we learn with these students --

00:09:44.977 --> 00:09:48.774
these students have multiple disabilities
and coping strategies

00:09:48.798 --> 00:09:50.674
that will be accommodated --

00:09:50.698 --> 00:09:53.537
what we learn with these students
will directly impact

00:09:53.561 --> 00:09:56.718
the way things are being done
at the professional level.

00:09:56.742 --> 00:09:58.801
I humbly call this development.

00:09:58.825 --> 00:10:01.081
And this is happening right now.
