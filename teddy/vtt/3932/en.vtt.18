While other countries told me
that the study of perception techniques

00:09:00.675 --> 00:09:04.252
in order to study astronomy data
is not relevant to astronomy

00:09:04.276 --> 00:09:07.476
because there are no blind
astronomers in the field,

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.904
South Africa said, "We want
people with disabilities

00:09:10.928 --> 00:09:12.904
to contribute to the field."

00:09:12.928 --> 00:09:14.254
Right now, I'm working

00:09:14.278 --> 00:09:17.010
at the South African
Astronomical Observatory,

00:09:17.034 --> 00:09:20.119
at the Office of Astronomy
for Development.

00:09:20.436 --> 00:09:25.177
There, we are working on sonification
techniques and analysis methods

00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:28.647
to impact the students
of the Athlone School for the Blind.

00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:32.089
These students will be learning
radio astronomy,
