00:07:28.346 --> 00:07:33.019
in order to include anyone with interest
in understanding what lies in the heavens

00:07:33.043 --> 00:07:34.552
is a spirit-lifter.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.279
When I lost my sight,

00:07:37.303 --> 00:07:39.379
I noticed that I didn't have access

00:07:39.403 --> 00:07:42.029
to the same amount
and quality of information

00:07:42.053 --> 00:07:43.449
a sighted astronomer had.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.700
It was not until we innovated
with the sonification process

00:07:47.724 --> 00:07:51.676
that I regained the hope
to be a productive member of the field

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.310
that I had worked so hard to be part of.

00:07:55.429 --> 00:07:59.880
Yet, information access
is not the only area in astronomy

00:07:59.904 --> 00:08:02.088
where this is important.
