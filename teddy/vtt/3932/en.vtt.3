00:01:25.477 --> 00:01:31.239
In that way, our star had extra energy
to outshine the rest of the galaxy

00:01:31.263 --> 00:01:33.566
in brightness and gamma ray emission.

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.608
My star, the one in my story,

00:01:36.632 --> 00:01:39.280
became what is known as a magnetar.

00:01:39.304 --> 00:01:40.985
And just for your information,

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.890
the magnetic field of a magnetar
is 1,000 trillion times

00:01:44.914 --> 00:01:46.683
the magnetic field of Earth.

00:01:47.953 --> 00:01:50.609
The most energetic events
ever measured by astronomers

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:52.888
carry the name gamma-ray bursts

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:56.519
because we observe them
as bursts most or explosions,

00:01:56.543 --> 00:01:59.076
most strongly measured as gamma-ray light.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:04.091
Our star, like the one in our story
that became a magnetar,
