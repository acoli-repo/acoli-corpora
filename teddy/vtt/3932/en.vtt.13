00:06:28.408 --> 00:06:31.576
that became a very strong
magnetic field magnetar.

00:06:32.264 --> 00:06:36.637
If this is the case, then outflows
from the exploding star

00:06:36.661 --> 00:06:39.144
may be associated
with this gamma-ray burst.

00:06:39.168 --> 00:06:40.736
What does that mean?

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.727
That star formation
may be a very important part

00:06:43.751 --> 00:06:45.265
of these supernova explosions.

00:06:46.047 --> 00:06:50.434
Listening to this very gamma-ray burst
brought us to the notion

00:06:50.458 --> 00:06:53.257
that the use of sound
as an adjunctive visual display

00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:55.506
may also support sighted astronomers

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.980
in the search for more
information in the data.

00:06:58.562 --> 00:07:03.880
Simultaneously, I worked on analyzing
measurements from other telescopes,
