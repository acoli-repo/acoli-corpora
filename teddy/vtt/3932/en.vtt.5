00:02:27.302 --> 00:02:30.372
We can only see
an itty bitty, tiny portion

00:02:30.396 --> 00:02:34.122
of the electromagnetic spectrum
that we call visible light.

00:02:34.146 --> 00:02:36.418
And beyond that, we rely on other methods.

00:02:36.442 --> 00:02:41.702
Yet as astronomers,
we study a wider range of light

00:02:41.726 --> 00:02:44.490
and we depend on other methods to do that.

00:02:44.514 --> 00:02:47.090
On the screen, it may look like this.

00:02:47.812 --> 00:02:49.544
You're seeing a plot.

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:51.493
That is a light curve.

00:02:51.517 --> 00:02:55.066
It's a plot of intensity
of light over time.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.554
It is a gamma-ray light curve.

00:02:58.013 --> 00:03:01.705
Sighted astronomers
depend on this kind of plot
