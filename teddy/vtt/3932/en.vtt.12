00:05:59.503 --> 00:06:00.780
So what we found

00:06:00.804 --> 00:06:05.718
is that the bursts last long enough
in order to support wave resonances,

00:06:05.742 --> 00:06:09.959
which are things caused by exchanges
of energy between particles

00:06:09.983 --> 00:06:11.301
that may have been excited,

00:06:11.325 --> 00:06:12.706
that depend on the volume.

00:06:13.151 --> 00:06:16.241
You may remember that I said
that the matter around the star

00:06:16.265 --> 00:06:17.921
is dragged around?

00:06:17.945 --> 00:06:21.759
It transmits power with frequency
and field distribution

00:06:21.783 --> 00:06:23.505
determined by the dimensions.

00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:28.384
You may remember that we were talking
about a super-massive star

00:06:28.408 --> 00:06:31.576
that became a very strong
magnetic field magnetar.
