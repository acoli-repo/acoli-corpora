00:06:58.562 --> 00:07:03.880
Simultaneously, I worked on analyzing
measurements from other telescopes,

00:07:03.904 --> 00:07:06.107
and my experiments demonstrated

00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:10.345
that when you use sound
as an adjunctive visual display,

00:07:10.369 --> 00:07:13.285
astronomers can find more information

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:16.176
in this now more accessible data set.

00:07:17.086 --> 00:07:20.830
This ability to transform data into sound

00:07:20.854 --> 00:07:23.931
gives astronomy a tremendous
power of transformation.

00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:28.322
And the fact that a field
that is so visual may be improved

00:07:28.346 --> 00:07:33.019
in order to include anyone with interest
in understanding what lies in the heavens
