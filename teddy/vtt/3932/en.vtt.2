00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.153
the interior of the star collapses
under its own weight

00:01:01.177 --> 00:01:04.065
and it starts rotating ever faster,

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.954
like an ice skater when pulling
their arms in close to their body.

00:01:08.592 --> 00:01:13.050
In that way, it starts rotating very fast
and it increases, powerfully,

00:01:13.074 --> 00:01:14.634
its magnetic field.

00:01:15.011 --> 00:01:18.100
The matter around the star
is dragged around,

00:01:18.124 --> 00:01:21.442
and some energy from that rotation
is transferred to that matter

00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:24.874
and the magnetic field
is increased even further.

00:01:25.477 --> 00:01:31.239
In that way, our star had extra energy
to outshine the rest of the galaxy
