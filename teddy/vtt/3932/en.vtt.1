WEBVTT

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:31.762
She transformed into a supernova,
and in the process

00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:34.440
releasing a tremendous amount of energy,

00:00:34.464 --> 00:00:37.172
outshining the rest of the galaxy

00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:39.530
and emitting, in one second,

00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:43.627
the same amount of energy
our sun will release in 10 days.

00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:46.922
And she evolved
into another role in our galaxy.

00:00:47.783 --> 00:00:50.257
Supernova explosions are very extreme.

00:00:50.638 --> 00:00:54.858
But the ones that emit gamma rays
are even more extreme.

00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:57.706
In the process of becoming a supernova,

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.153
the interior of the star collapses
under its own weight
