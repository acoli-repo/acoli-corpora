00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:04.091
Our star, like the one in our story
that became a magnetar,

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:06.186
is detected as a gamma-ray burst

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.770
during the most energetic
portion of the explosion.

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:15.468
Yet, even though gamma-ray bursts
are the strongest events

00:02:15.492 --> 00:02:17.581
ever measured by astronomers,

00:02:17.605 --> 00:02:20.242
we cannot see them with our naked eye.

00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:22.594
We depend, we rely on other methods

00:02:22.618 --> 00:02:25.407
in order to study this gamma-ray light.

00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:27.278
We cannot see them with our naked eye.

00:02:27.302 --> 00:02:30.372
We can only see
an itty bitty, tiny portion
