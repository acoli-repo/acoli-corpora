00:00:01.436 --> 00:00:05.476
I spend most of my time
talking and thinking and writing

00:00:05.476 --> 00:00:09.476
about women's experiences
in UK and US workplaces,

00:00:09.516 --> 00:00:12.036
particularly, Black women's experiences.

00:00:13.116 --> 00:00:15.956
And so for me, understanding
the glass cliff --

00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:19.876
the situation that underrepresented
leaders find themselves in

00:00:19.876 --> 00:00:21.836
when they take on leadership positions,

00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:24.076
only to find that their chances of success

00:00:24.116 --> 00:00:26.676
have been limited
before they even begin --

00:00:26.716 --> 00:00:28.676
really was an eye-opener.
