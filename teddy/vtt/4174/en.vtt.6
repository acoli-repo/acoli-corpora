00:02:58.038 --> 00:03:01.468
took me to MIT Media Labs, 
where I found myself

00:03:01.468 --> 00:03:06.704
at the crossroads of design, engineering,
architecture and sometimes magic.

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:13.144
During my time there, I realized that you
can innovate technology while in America,

00:03:13.168 --> 00:03:16.824
but these inventions will not 
be effective in the eastern world.

00:03:16.848 --> 00:03:19.984
To solve the problems, 
one needs to go to their source.

00:03:20.008 --> 00:03:21.828
And then I returned to India.

00:03:22.478 --> 00:03:29.064
When I returned to India, some of
my researcher friends came along too.

00:03:29.088 --> 00:03:33.104
They told me that this was a great idea
and should definitely be worked upon.
