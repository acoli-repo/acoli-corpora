There is a lot of pollution in the world.

00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:08.144
If we are able to contain even 
30 percent of the pollution,

00:06:08.168 --> 00:06:11.073
that would have otherwise gone into
your lungs and recycle it,

00:06:11.097 --> 00:06:14.344
then we can replace the ink
supply of the world with Air-Ink.

00:06:14.368 --> 00:06:15.518
Thank you.

00:06:15.566 --> 00:06:22.346

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:27.386
SRK: Very well done, Anirudh.

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:29.704
This was a very good talk.

00:06:29.728 --> 00:06:34.424
What I also liked about you is that you
were studying abroad, working there,
