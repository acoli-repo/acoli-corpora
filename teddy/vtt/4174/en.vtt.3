Anirudh Sharma: In the last 100 years, we have made
a lot of progress in the field of science,

00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:41.264
but it is now we are realizing that 
all this progress is not completely right.

00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:44.544
Our rivers, lakes and ponds 
have become polluted,

00:01:44.568 --> 00:01:48.944
and the air we breathe
is turning into a gas chamber.

00:01:48.968 --> 00:01:53.208
A famous scientist,
Buckminster Fuller, said,

00:01:53.258 --> 00:01:57.208
“Pollution is nothing but the resources
that we are not harvesting yet."

00:01:57.268 --> 00:02:01.608
Which means pollution is the resource
which we are not using.
