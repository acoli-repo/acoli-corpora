Their size is measured in nano microns.

00:04:33.328 --> 00:04:36.304
They are also called PM2.5 or PM10.

00:04:36.328 --> 00:04:41.128
If not treated on time, they can result
in asthma, cancer and many such diseases.

00:04:41.888 --> 00:04:44.504
Let’s try understanding
how this technology works.

00:04:44.528 --> 00:04:47.384
We create a retrofit device
which is called "Kaalink."

00:04:47.408 --> 00:04:50.144
This device can be
attached to any exhaust.

00:04:50.168 --> 00:04:53.498
The particles of smoke coming out of 
the exhaust get absorbed in it,

00:04:53.498 --> 00:04:55.528
only air passes through.

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:58.704
This raw carbon is then taken out.

00:04:58.728 --> 00:05:06.368
From the carbon we remove toxins, such as
heavy metals and other unwanted compounds.
