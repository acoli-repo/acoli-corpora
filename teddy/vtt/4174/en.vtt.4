00:02:07.948 --> 00:02:11.824
a triangular shape,
which looks like it’s been painted.

00:02:11.848 --> 00:02:15.144
This is the very idea
behind recycling pollution into ink,

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:16.664
that is Air-Ink.

00:02:16.688 --> 00:02:21.464

that would absorb the particles of
pollution from one side
