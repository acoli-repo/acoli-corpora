They told me that this was a great idea
and should definitely be worked upon.

00:03:33.128 --> 00:03:36.824
I took the experiments more seriously now
and established Graviky.

00:03:36.848 --> 00:03:42.304
We decided to advance the prototype
that was developed as a weekend hack.

00:03:42.328 --> 00:03:44.264
So we rented an office.

00:03:44.288 --> 00:03:47.304
In the initial phase, 
we would use engines, fire and fuel

00:03:47.328 --> 00:03:51.504
to conduct experiments in the office,

00:03:51.528 --> 00:03:53.728
which sometimes 
caused a fire in the office.

00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:56.304
This is what happened to our office.

00:03:56.328 --> 00:03:58.900
Then we realized we weren’t
just burning up the office

00:03:58.924 --> 00:04:03.004
but also getting our faces black,
while experimenting with this pollution.
