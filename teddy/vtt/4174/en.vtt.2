Shah Rukh Khan: Is it possible to see something new
in something as dangerous as pollution?

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:03.697
If you look at it from a lay person’s
point of view, the answer is no.

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:09.464
But innovator Anirudh Sharma
sees pollution from a very special angle,

00:01:09.488 --> 00:01:12.304
he sees its hidden potential.

00:01:12.328 --> 00:01:17.038
Today on TED Talks India,
the world will see the connoisseur's eye.

00:01:17.038 --> 00:01:20.108
Please welcome on stage,
Anirudh Sharma.
