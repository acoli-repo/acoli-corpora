From the carbon we remove toxins, such as
heavy metals and other unwanted compounds.

00:05:06.608 --> 00:05:09.704
What is left is purified
carbon based pigment.

00:05:09.728 --> 00:05:12.064
Like you all know,
carbon is the source of life.

00:05:12.088 --> 00:05:14.984
It is the raw material for many things.

00:05:15.008 --> 00:05:18.184
So we extract carbon 
from pollution to create ink.

00:05:18.208 --> 00:05:24.184
Today Air-Ink is the perfect choice of
more than thousand international artists.

00:05:24.208 --> 00:05:28.600
Those artists want to experiment with this
new material and create a new community.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.400
