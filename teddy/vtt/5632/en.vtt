00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.060
In the center of Colchis 
in an enchanted garden,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.050
the hide of a mystical flying ram 
hung from the tallest oak,

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.290
guarded by a dragon who never slept.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.246
Jason would have to tread carefully 
to pry it from King Aeetes’ clutches

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:25.976
and win back his promised throne.

00:00:25.976 --> 00:00:29.922
But diplomacy was hardly 
one of the Argonauts’ strengths.

00:00:29.922 --> 00:00:34.221
Jason would have to navigate 
this difficult task alone.
