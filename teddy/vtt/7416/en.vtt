00:00:02.956 --> 00:00:06.596
Why is it so hard

00:00:06.636 --> 00:00:10.196
to change the direction
of our civilization?

00:00:12.156 --> 00:00:15.876
I'd like to suggest
that what's missing at this point

00:00:15.876 --> 00:00:20.996
is not more facts and information
or even technology.

00:00:21.316 --> 00:00:23.596
We have more than enough.

00:00:24.956 --> 00:00:27.756
What's missing is insight.
