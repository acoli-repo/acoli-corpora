00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to talk about two stories today.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
One is how we need to use market-based pricing to affect demand

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and use wireless technologies to dramatically reduce our emissions

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
in the transportation sector.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And the other is that there is an incredible opportunity

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
if we choose the right wireless technologies;

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
how we can generate a new engine for economic growth

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and dramatically reduce C02 in the other sectors.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm really scared.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We need to reduce C02 emissions in ten to fifteen years by 80 percent
