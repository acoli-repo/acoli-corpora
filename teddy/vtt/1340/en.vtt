00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
First place I'd like to take you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is what many believe will be the world's deepest natural abyss.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I say believe because this process is still ongoing.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that I'll talk a little bit about.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
One of the things that's changed here,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
in the last 150 years since Jules Verne

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
had great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is that technology has enabled us to go to these places

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that were previously completely unknown and speculated about.
