00:00:00.413 --> 00:00:05.460
I was the CEO of a large
religious nonprofit,

00:00:05.501 --> 00:00:08.046
the host of a national television show.

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:10.548
I preached in mega churches.

00:00:10.923 --> 00:00:13.843
I was a successful, well-educated,

00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:16.429
white American

00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:17.597
male.

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:22.393
I knew from the time I was three
or four years of age I was transgender.

00:00:22.393 --> 00:00:25.521
In my naivete,
I thought I got to choose.

00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:30.151
I thought a gender fairy would arrive
and say, “OK, the time has come.”
