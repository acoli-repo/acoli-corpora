00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.459
We live in a time-pressed culture.

00:00:05.043 --> 00:00:07.086
There is never enough time.

00:00:07.628 --> 00:00:08.921
And we see it,

00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:11.090
we feel it around us every day.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.678
We live in a world that valorizes work,

00:00:15.678 --> 00:00:17.346
accomplishment,

00:00:17.346 --> 00:00:18.556
busyness.

00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:20.475
And there’s real upside to that;

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:21.642
there’s real value.

00:00:21.851 --> 00:00:22.852
We’re pushed,

00:00:22.852 --> 00:00:27.356
we’re driven toward
achievement and action and creation.

00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:29.233
And that’s great,

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:31.152
but there’s also a downside.
