When analysts and financial people
look at companies,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.536
they think about
a lot of different statistics.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.976
I want to talk about
two of the most important ones.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.896
I'm going to talk about
the overall value of a company --

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.696
its valuation --

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.600
and I'm going to talk about its margin.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.816
Basically the difference
between all of its earnings

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.240
and all of its costs.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.776
So in our study,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.096
we looked at oil and gas companies,

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.656
and the oil and gas companies

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.256
that are performing
most strongly on TSI --
