00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.456
this is core to their corporate strategy

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.496
and core to their growth

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:37.656
because they grow by increasing
the number of hosts and guests

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.160
using their platform.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.536
But if they'd only
been thinking exclusively

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.056
about the return side of things,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.256
I'm not sure they would have ever
figured out this route to growth,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.560
because they're not
charging transaction fees.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.816
So it's a pretty exciting way,

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.736
when they were thinking
about how to bring their capabilities

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.376
to a need in society

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.240
and at the same time
drive their own growth.
