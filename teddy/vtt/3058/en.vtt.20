00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.416
Because in my decades
of strategy consulting

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:05.520
with businesses and NGOs
and governments around the world,

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.776
I find that many businesspeople

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.976
are hesitant to talk
or even sometimes think about

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.920
the business benefits of doing good.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.736
They somehow think
it's going to negate the value

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.456
of the benefits
they're creating for society.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.560
Or that they'll be perceived
as heartless or even mercenary.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.840
But we really do need
to think differently.
