00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.680
And why is that?

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.136
It's because they partner
with NGOs around the world

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.040
that are working
with small shareholder farmers.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.896
And those certification agency's NGOs

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.456
are working to help farmers
improve crop yields,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.800
they're making sure that they get
a fair, premium, livable wage

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.496
and they're helping them address
any human rights potential issues

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.856
in supply chains,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.096
and they're helping minimize
the effects on the environment,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.440
like deforestation.
