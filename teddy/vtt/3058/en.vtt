00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.456
A few years ago,

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.096
all the developed
countries in the world --

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.376
the wealthier ones --

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.135
and all of the charities

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.696
together donated about 200 billion dollars

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.896
to developing countries in the world --

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.896
the ones that bear most of the burden,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.816
the heaviest burden
of the world's biggest problems:

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.880
poverty, hunger,
climate change and inequality.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.616
That same year,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.000
businesses invested in those same
countries 3.7 trillion dollars.
