00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.736
All else equal --

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.376
we didn't confuse
the analysis with anything.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.336
All else being equal,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:41.015
companies that perform strongly
on social and environmental areas

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.559
achieve higher margins

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.240
and higher valuations.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.896
Now, I do understand

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.080
that companies are under
a lot of short-term earnings pressures.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.896
But fortunately,

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.416
the investors who create
some of this pressure

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.096
are actually more and more themselves
starting to think longer-term
