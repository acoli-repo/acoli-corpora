But what if you're trying to find
new customer segments?

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.096
Let's move to South Africa,

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.120
and let's talk about Standard Bank.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.376
In South Africa,

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.976
the government has a regulation

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.696
that requires all banks
to donate 0.2 percent of their profits

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.720

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.376
And many banks just donate

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.776
but Standard Bank thought creatively.
