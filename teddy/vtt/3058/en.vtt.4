00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.360
CSR just isn't designed to scale.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.976
And then of course in a downturn,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.479
it's one of the first programs to be cut.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.976
So no,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.216
CSR --

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.256
corporate social responsibility --

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.336
isn't the answer,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.416
but TSI --

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.080
total societal impact, is.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.016
TSI is the sum of all of the ways

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.936
business can affect society
