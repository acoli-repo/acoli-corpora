Mars is the sixth-largest private company
in the United States.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.416
If you're like me,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.656
they make some important products,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.240
like coffee and chocolate.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.976
So not surprisingly,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.960
one of their most important
ingredients is cocoa.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.576
And some of their competitors
are actually really worried

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.240
about the sustainability
and the availability of cocoa supplies.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.456
But not Mars.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.080
They're confident in the stable supply
of that crop for the long term.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.680
And why is that?
