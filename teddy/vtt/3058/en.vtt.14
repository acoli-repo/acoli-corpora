00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.816
For the retail banks
that are strongest on TSI,

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.896
they see a three percentage point
premium on their valuation,

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.616
and then for those that differentially
provide financial inclusion --

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.536
access to financial products
for people who need it --

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.040
they see a 0.5 percentage point premium
in their net income margin.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.216
Now, these numbers for banks
may not seem very big,

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.776
but in highly competitive industries,

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.360
even really small differences
in margin matter a lot.
