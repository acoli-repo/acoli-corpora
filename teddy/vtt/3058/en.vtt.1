00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.000
businesses invested in those same
countries 3.7 trillion dollars.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.336
Now, I get to travel a lot in my work

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.896
and I'm privileged
to see the amazing things

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.496
that NGOs and some governments are doing

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.640
with some of that 200 billion dollars:

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.416
helping malnourished children

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.216
or families that don't
have access to clean water,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.480
children who wouldn't
be educated otherwise.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.096
But it's not enough

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.856
because the biggest problems
in our world need trillions

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.320
not just billions.
