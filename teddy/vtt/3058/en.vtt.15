Now, what about those
consumer goods companies --

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.360
the ones who make those products we love
like coffee and chocolate?

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.136
Consumer goods companies
that perform best on total societal impact

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.440
see an 11 percent valuation premium.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.096
And then if they do those smart
things with their supply chain --

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.776
inclusive and responsibly
sourcing their product --

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:00.080
they see a 4.8 percentage point premium
on their gross margins.
