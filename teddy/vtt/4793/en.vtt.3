00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:30.869
Vertebrates like us have a rigid skeleton
to support our bodies,

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.841
with joints that allow us to move.

00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:35.413
But not all types of movement are allowed.

00:01:35.413 --> 00:01:37.245
You can't bend your knee backwards,

00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:40.136
or bend your forearm in the middle,
for example.

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:43.665
Cephalopods, on the other hand,
have no bones at all,

00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:48.339
allowing them to bend their limbs
at any point and in any direction.

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:49.638
So shaping their tentacles

00:01:49.638 --> 00:01:53.785
into any one of the virtually 
limitless number of possible arrangements

00:01:53.785 --> 00:01:56.739
is unlike anything we are used to.

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:00.694
Consider a simple task,
like grabbing and eating an apple.
