00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:00.694
Consider a simple task,
like grabbing and eating an apple.

00:02:00.694 --> 00:02:04.348
The human brain contains a neurological
map of our body.

00:02:04.348 --> 00:02:05.473
When you see the apple,

00:02:05.473 --> 00:02:09.226
your brain's motor center activates
the appropriate muscles,

00:02:09.226 --> 00:02:11.310
allowing you to reach out with your arm,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.852
grab it with your hand,

00:02:12.852 --> 00:02:14.265
bend your elbow joint,

00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:15.870
and bring it to your mouth.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.666
For an octopus, 
the process is quite different.

00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:20.465
Rather than a body map,

00:02:20.465 --> 00:02:23.898
the cephalopod brain 
has a behavior library.

00:02:23.898 --> 00:02:26.013
So when an octopus sees food,

00:02:26.013 --> 00:02:28.905
its brain doesn't activate 
a specific body part,

00:02:28.905 --> 00:02:32.473
but rather a behavioral response to grab.
