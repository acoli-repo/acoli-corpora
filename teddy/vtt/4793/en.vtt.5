but rather a behavioral response to grab.

00:02:32.473 --> 00:02:34.556
As the signal travels through the network,

00:02:34.556 --> 00:02:36.990
the arm neurons pick up the message

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.724
and jump into action 
to command the movement.

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:41.877
As soon as the arm touches the food,

00:02:41.877 --> 00:02:46.535
a muscle activation wave travels
all the way through the arm to its base,

00:02:46.535 --> 00:02:50.709
while the arm sends back another wave
from the base to the tip.

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.400
The signals meet halfway
between the food and the base of the arm,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.343
letting it know to bend at that spot.

00:02:57.343 --> 00:03:01.591
What all this means is that each
