00:02:57.343 --> 00:03:01.591
What all this means is that each
of an octopus's eight arms

00:03:01.591 --> 00:03:04.092
can essentially think for itself.

00:03:04.092 --> 00:03:06.825
This gives it amazing flexibility 
and creativity

00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:09.644
when facing a new situation or problem,

00:03:09.644 --> 00:03:11.702
whether its opening 
a bottle to reach food,

00:03:11.702 --> 00:03:13.436
escaping through a maze,

00:03:13.436 --> 00:03:15.359
moving around in a new environment,

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.601
changing the texture and the color
of its skin to blend into the scenery,

00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:23.648
or even mimicking other creatures
to scare away enemies.

00:03:23.648 --> 00:03:26.477
Cephalopods may have evolved 
complex brains

00:03:26.477 --> 00:03:29.170
long before our vertebrate relatives.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.959
And octopus intelligence isn't just useful
for octopuses.
