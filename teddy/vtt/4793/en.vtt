00:00:11.074 --> 00:00:17.014
After all, they don't have lungs, spines,
or even a plural noun we can all agree on.

00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:20.162
But what they do have is the ability
to solve puzzles,

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:21.998
learn through observation,

00:00:21.998 --> 00:00:23.634

00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:29.131
