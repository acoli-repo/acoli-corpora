00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.959
And octopus intelligence isn't just useful
for octopuses.

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.774
Their radically different nervous system
and autonomously thinking appendages

00:03:37.774 --> 00:03:39.572
have inspired new research

00:03:39.572 --> 00:03:43.944
in developing flexible robots
made of soft materials.

00:03:43.944 --> 00:03:48.882
And studying how intelligence can arise
along such a divergent evolutionary path

00:03:48.882 --> 00:03:54.056
can help us understand more about
intelligence and consciousness in general.

00:03:54.056 --> 00:03:57.483
Who knows what other forms 
of intelligent life are possible,

00:03:57.483 --> 00:04:00.791
or how they process the world around them.
