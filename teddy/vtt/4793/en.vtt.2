00:00:58.136 --> 00:01:04.171
these 500 million neurons are spread out
in a network of interconnected ganglia

00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:07.580
organized into three basic structures.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.888
The central brain only contains
about 10% of the neurons,

00:01:11.888 --> 00:01:16.670
while the two huge optic lobes
contain about 30%.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.398
The other 60% are in the tentacles,

00:01:19.398 --> 00:01:24.366
which for humans would be like
our arms having minds of their own.

00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.999
This is where things 
get even more interesting.

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:30.869
Vertebrates like us have a rigid skeleton
to support our bodies,
