00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:31.509
is that it comes 
from a biological structure

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.430
completely different from ours.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.074
The 200 or so species of octopuses

00:00:37.074 --> 00:00:40.731
are mollusks 
belonging to the order cephalopoda,

00:00:40.731 --> 00:00:42.722
Greek for head-feet.

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:45.707
Those heads contain impressively
large brains,

00:00:45.707 --> 00:00:50.458
with a brain to body ratio similar
to that of other intelligent animals,

00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:55.850
and a complex nervous system with
about as many neurons as that of a dog.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.136
But instead of being 
centralized in the brain,

00:00:58.136 --> 00:01:04.171
these 500 million neurons are spread out
in a network of interconnected ganglia
