00:00:57.765 --> 00:01:00.854
And while many examples of true irony can be funny,

00:01:00.854 --> 00:01:04.082
that is not the driving factor of being ironic.

00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:07.303
A situation is only ironic if what happens

00:01:07.303 --> 00:01:10.662
is the exact opposite of what was expected.

00:01:10.662 --> 00:01:13.247
If you expect A, but get B,

00:01:13.247 --> 00:01:15.015
then you have irony.

00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:17.862
Let's take the slap-stick cake situation as an example.

00:01:17.862 --> 00:01:20.941
When someone walks in precariously balancing something

00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:22.584
that shouldn't be carried alone,

00:01:22.584 --> 00:01:25.100
trips, falls, and makes a mess,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.637
it is funny, but it's not ironic.

00:01:27.637 --> 00:01:29.513
In fact, you probably expect someone

00:01:29.513 --> 00:01:32.743
who is single-handedly carrying a huge cake to trip.
