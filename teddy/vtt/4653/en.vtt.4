00:01:57.954 --> 00:02:02.683
Then, when that reasonable expectation was not met by the tripping sidekick,

00:02:02.683 --> 00:02:05.039
irony would have been exemplified.

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.286
Another example.

00:02:06.286 --> 00:02:09.089
A senior citizen texting and blogging.

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:10.590
The common and reasonable expectation

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.253
of more mature men and women

00:02:13.253 --> 00:02:16.826
is that they don't like or know technology,

00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:19.105
that they have a hard time turning on a computer,

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:22.879
or that they have the old brick cell phones from the 1980s.

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.031
One should not expect them to be connected,

00:02:25.031 --> 00:02:26.160
high-tech,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.895
or savvy enough to text

00:02:27.895 --> 00:02:29.231
or to be blogging,

00:02:29.231 --> 00:02:31.832
which must seem like some sort of newfangled thing
