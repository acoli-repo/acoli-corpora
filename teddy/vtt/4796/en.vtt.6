00:02:58.693 --> 00:03:00.426
But as someone becomes anesthetized,

00:03:00.426 --> 00:03:03.549
those signals become calmer
and more organized,

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.657
suggesting that different 
parts of the brain

00:03:05.657 --> 00:03:08.164
aren't talking to each other anymore.

00:03:08.164 --> 00:03:12.800
There's a lot we still don't know
about exactly how this happens.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.771
Several common anesthetics bind to
the GABA-A receptor in the brain's neurons.

00:03:18.771 --> 00:03:20.598
They hold the gateway open,

00:03:20.598 --> 00:03:25.030
letting negatively charged particles
flow into the cell.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.241
Negative charge builds up
and acts like a log jam,

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:31.842
keeping the neuron from transmitting
electrical signals.
