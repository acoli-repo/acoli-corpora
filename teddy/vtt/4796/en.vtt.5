Inhalational anesthesia is usually 
supplemented with intravenous anesthesia,

00:02:30.138 --> 00:02:32.996
which was developed in the 1870s.

00:02:32.996 --> 00:02:36.150
Common intravenous agents include
sedatives, like propofol,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.884
which induce unconsciousness,

00:02:37.884 --> 00:02:42.188
and opioids, like fentanyl, 
which reduce pain.

00:02:42.188 --> 00:02:44.836
These general anesthetics 
also seem to work

00:02:44.836 --> 00:02:47.907
by affecting electrical signals
in the nervous system.

00:02:47.907 --> 00:02:51.754
Normally, the brain's electrical signals
are a chaotic chorus

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:55.126
as different parts of the brain
communicate with each other.

00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:58.693
That connectivity keeps you awake
and aware.

00:02:58.693 --> 00:03:00.426
But as someone becomes anesthetized,
