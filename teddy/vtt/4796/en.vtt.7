00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:31.842
keeping the neuron from transmitting
electrical signals.

00:03:31.842 --> 00:03:35.444
The nervous system has lots
of these gated channels,

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:37.349
controlling pathways for movement,

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.419
memory,

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:39.779
and consciousness.

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:42.864
Most anesthetics probably 
act on more than one,

00:03:42.864 --> 00:03:45.276
and they don't act on 
just the nervous system.

00:03:45.276 --> 00:03:47.461
Many anesthetics also affect the heart,

00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:48.386
lungs,

00:03:48.386 --> 00:03:50.417
and other vital organs.

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:52.022
Just like early anesthetics,

00:03:52.022 --> 00:03:55.586
which included familiar poisons like
hemlock and aconite,

00:03:55.586 --> 00:03:58.155
modern drugs can 
have serious side effects.

00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:02.298
So an anesthesiologist has to mix
just the right balance of drugs
