00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:02.298
So an anesthesiologist has to mix
just the right balance of drugs

00:04:02.298 --> 00:04:04.997
to create all the features of anesthesia,

00:04:04.997 --> 00:04:08.019
while carefully monitoring
the patient's vital signs,

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.876
and adjusting the drug mixture as needed.

00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:13.031
Anesthesia is complicated,

00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:14.607
but figuring out how to use it

00:04:14.607 --> 00:04:18.849
allowed for the development 
of new and better surgical techniques.

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:23.460
Surgeons could learn how to routinely
and safely perform C-sections,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.167
reopen blocked arteries,

00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:27.550
replace damaged livers and kidneys,

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.407
and many other life-saving operations.
