00:00:29.622 --> 00:00:32.225
or, hopefully, feel pain.

00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:35.180
Without being able to block all those
processes at once,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.060
many surgeries would be 
way too traumatic to perform.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.397
Ancient medical texts from Egypt,
Asia and the Middle East

00:00:42.397 --> 00:00:44.810
all describe early anesthetics

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.927
containing things like opium poppy,

00:00:46.927 --> 00:00:48.309
mandrake fruit,

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:49.977
and alcohol.

00:00:49.977 --> 00:00:52.188
Today, anesthesiologists often combine

00:00:52.188 --> 00:00:56.142
regional, inhalational 
and intravenous agents

00:00:56.142 --> 00:00:58.831
to get the right balance for a surgery.

00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:03.111
Regional anesthesia blocks pain signals
from a specific part of the body
