Regional anesthesia blocks pain signals
from a specific part of the body

00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:04.908
from getting to the brain.

00:01:04.908 --> 00:01:10.139
Pain and other messages travel through
the nervous system as electrical impulses.

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:14.388
Regional anesthetics work by setting up
an electrical barricade.

00:01:14.388 --> 00:01:18.271
They bind to the proteins 
in neurons' cell membranes

00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:20.906
that let charged particles in and out,

00:01:20.906 --> 00:01:23.987
and lock out positively charged particles.

00:01:23.987 --> 00:01:26.973
One compound that does this is cocaine,

00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:29.896
whose painkilling effects 
were discovered by accident

00:01:29.896 --> 00:01:33.999
when an ophthalmology intern
got some on his tongue.
