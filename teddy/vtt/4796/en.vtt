00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:07.883
If you've had surgery,

00:00:07.883 --> 00:00:11.116
you might remember starting to count
backwards from ten,

00:00:11.116 --> 00:00:12.368
nine,

00:00:12.368 --> 00:00:13.461
eight,

00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:18.853
and then waking up with the surgery
already over before you even got to five.

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:21.968
And it might seem like you were asleep,
but you weren't.

00:00:21.968 --> 00:00:23.844
You were under anesthesia,

00:00:23.844 --> 00:00:25.636
which is much more complicated.

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:26.665
You were unconscious,


00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:28.399
but you also couldn't move,

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:29.622
form memories,

00:00:29.622 --> 00:00:32.225
or, hopefully, feel pain.
