00:00:01.617 --> 00:00:05.293
In December of 2010,

00:00:05.293 --> 00:00:07.110
the city of Apatzingán

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.262
in the coastal state of Michoacán, in Mexico,

00:00:10.262 --> 00:00:12.632
awoke to gunfire.

00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:14.208
For two straight days,

00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:16.626
the city became an open battlefield

00:00:16.626 --> 00:00:18.410
between the federal forces

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.079
and a well-organized group,

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.862
presumably from the local criminal organization,

00:00:22.862 --> 00:00:26.234
La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoacán family.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:29.384
The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire

00:00:29.384 --> 00:00:31.804
but also explosions
