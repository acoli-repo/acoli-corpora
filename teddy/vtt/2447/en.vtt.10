00:04:57.038 --> 00:05:00.593
vaccines cause adults, OK?

00:05:00.617 --> 00:05:01.783
That's what they cause.

00:05:01.807 --> 00:05:06.713
And the other thing that they cause
is for elderly individuals to live longer.

00:05:06.737 --> 00:05:09.137
Because they are shielded
against influenza

00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:11.361
and other killers of the elderly.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.729
Now, let's talk a little bit

00:05:13.753 --> 00:05:16.204
about how we can improve
vaccines even further.

00:05:16.228 --> 00:05:20.656
We can create vaccines that can immunize
the most vulnerable among us

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.045
and perhaps even vaccines
that protect with single shots.

00:05:24.363 --> 00:05:26.879
Let me go over a little bit
of the immunology.

00:05:26.903 --> 00:05:30.315
In the top panel, what you see
is a simple vaccine.
