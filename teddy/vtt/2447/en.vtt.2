00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:00.712
because vaccines have been so effective.

00:01:00.736 --> 00:01:02.806
You could see in the graph on the right

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.997
that since the introduction of vaccines,

00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:07.926
the incidence of Haemophilus
bacterial infections

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.386
has plummeted like a rock,
and it's nearly vanished.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.736
So vaccines are generally a success story.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.627
But we also face challenges.

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:21.240
For one, for most vaccines,
we need to give multiple doses

00:01:21.264 --> 00:01:23.685
to achieve or maintain protection.

00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:29.050
The scientific community is working
on developing single-shot vaccines.

00:01:29.074 --> 00:01:32.832
Imagine being able to get only one
influenza shot your whole life
