00:01:58.657 --> 00:02:01.257
And this is an active area of research.

00:02:01.982 --> 00:02:06.204
Finally, one of the biggest challenges
we unfortunately face right now

00:02:06.228 --> 00:02:08.355
are anti-vax attitudes.

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:15.014
In fact, it's alarming that over 100,000
infants and children in the United States

00:02:15.038 --> 00:02:16.998
have not received any vaccines,

00:02:17.022 --> 00:02:18.822
and that number is growing.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.545
In fact, the World Health
Organization, or WHO,

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.181
has declared anti-vax attitudes

00:02:25.205 --> 00:02:29.403
as one of the 10 most important
threats to human health

00:02:29.427 --> 00:02:31.022
in the world today.
