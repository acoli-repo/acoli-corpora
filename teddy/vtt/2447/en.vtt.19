WEBVTT

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:31.861
and we can compare after the vaccine

00:09:31.885 --> 00:09:34.363
to before the vaccine in that same baby

00:09:34.387 --> 00:09:36.252
and understand in a deep way

00:09:36.276 --> 00:09:39.355
exactly how that successful
vaccine protects.

00:09:39.745 --> 00:09:44.537
And those lessons we can use
to build the next vaccines in the future.

00:09:44.561 --> 00:09:47.966
So this diagram is really illustrating
a tiny drop of blood

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.307
yielding huge amounts of information,

00:09:50.331 --> 00:09:52.180
tens of thousands of analytes,

00:09:52.204 --> 00:09:56.708
and that hairball is meant to depict
the gene pathways that are turned on

00:09:56.732 --> 00:09:59.112
and the molecular pathways
that are turned on.

00:09:59.136 --> 00:10:02.295
So much more to come on that,
and very exciting science.
