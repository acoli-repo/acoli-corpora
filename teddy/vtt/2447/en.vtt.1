00:00:25.863 --> 00:00:30.807
with the societal cost savings
of nearly 1.4 trillion dollars.

00:00:31.362 --> 00:00:32.831
Those are big numbers.

00:00:32.855 --> 00:00:35.406
But let's zoom in
and look at a particular example.

00:00:35.976 --> 00:00:38.135
Vaccines have nearly eliminated

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.539
a bacterial infection
called Haemophilus influenzae.

00:00:41.563 --> 00:00:44.826
This bacterium
used to infect young infants

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.379
causing bloodstream infections,

00:00:46.403 --> 00:00:49.355
pneumonia, meningitis, death

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.979
or permanent disability.

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:54.696
As a young pediatrician,
I saw a few cases.

00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:58.045
You folks probably have never
heard of this disease,

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:00.712
because vaccines have been so effective.
