00:08:29.139 --> 00:08:32.879
it's going to be impossible to do
large, phase III clinical trials

00:08:32.903 --> 00:08:34.466
for every combination.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.712
This is where we think being able
to test vaccines outside the body

00:08:38.736 --> 00:08:42.187
can make a big difference
to accelerate vaccine development.

00:08:42.497 --> 00:08:45.394
And finally, this whole effort
is to drive an immune response

00:08:45.418 --> 00:08:48.671
that will protect against
that particular pathogen,

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:52.575
getting antibodies and other cells
to defend the body.

00:08:53.273 --> 00:08:55.900
We are also using additional
innovative approaches

00:08:55.924 --> 00:08:59.329
to bring the most cutting-edge science
to vaccine development.

00:08:59.353 --> 00:09:03.450
We're taking a deeper dive
as to how current vaccines protect.
