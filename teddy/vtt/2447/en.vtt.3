Imagine being able to get only one
influenza shot your whole life

00:01:32.856 --> 00:01:35.657
and not having to get
a seasonal flu vaccine.

00:01:36.197 --> 00:01:39.943
Certain microbes
are difficult to immunize against.

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:44.191
A classic example is human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.

00:01:44.215 --> 00:01:47.372
The need is urgent,
progress is being made;

00:01:47.396 --> 00:01:48.572
we're not there yet.

00:01:49.588 --> 00:01:53.069
Another critical element
in vaccine research right now

00:01:53.093 --> 00:01:56.514
is optimizing vaccines
for the most vulnerable among us,

00:01:56.538 --> 00:01:58.633
the very young and the elderly.

00:01:58.657 --> 00:02:01.257
And this is an active area of research.
