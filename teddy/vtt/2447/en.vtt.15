00:07:28.142 --> 00:07:31.363
Then, as I just described to you,
vaccines have components.

00:07:31.387 --> 00:07:33.299
All vaccines have an antigen,

00:07:33.323 --> 00:07:36.077
that's the part of the microbe
that your body remembers,

00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:39.990
that you might make antibodies
or cell-mediated immunity against.

00:07:40.014 --> 00:07:42.300
And we might add an adjuvant,
as we talked about,

00:07:42.324 --> 00:07:43.918
to boost an immune response.

00:07:43.942 --> 00:07:45.100
But guess what?

00:07:45.124 --> 00:07:47.425
There are many different
antigens to choose from

00:07:47.449 --> 00:07:48.839
and many different adjuvants.

00:07:48.863 --> 00:07:50.728
How are we going to make that decision?

00:07:50.752 --> 00:07:52.831
And the menu of these keeps growing.

00:07:52.855 --> 00:07:54.006
So on our team,

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:57.514
we've developed ways
to test vaccines outside the body --

00:07:57.538 --> 00:07:59.180
in Latin, that's "in vitro" --

00:07:59.204 --> 00:08:00.823
in a tissue culture dish.
