00:07:59.204 --> 00:08:00.823
in a tissue culture dish.

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:04.125
So we use tissue engineering
with blood cells

00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:06.252
to immunize outside the body

00:08:06.276 --> 00:08:08.332
and study the effect of the vaccine

00:08:08.356 --> 00:08:12.696
against, for example, infants
or elderly individuals or others.

00:08:13.347 --> 00:08:15.564
And if you think about it,
this is critical,

00:08:15.588 --> 00:08:19.185
because if you look at all the infections
we want to build vaccines against,

00:08:19.209 --> 00:08:23.170
like Zika virus and Ebola virus
and HIV and others,

00:08:23.194 --> 00:08:24.988
all the candidate antigens,

00:08:25.012 --> 00:08:27.115
all the candidate adjuvants,

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:29.115
all the different populations,

00:08:29.139 --> 00:08:32.879
it's going to be impossible to do
large, phase III clinical trials
