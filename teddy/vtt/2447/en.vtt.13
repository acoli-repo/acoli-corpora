Interestingly, these adjuvants
have different effects

00:06:31.585 --> 00:06:35.212
depending on the age or other demographic
factors of the individual.

00:06:35.665 --> 00:06:38.861
Which brings me to the notion
of precision vaccines.

00:06:39.211 --> 00:06:43.187
This is the idea that we will take
precision medicine --

00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:45.227
you know what precision
medicine is, right,

00:06:45.251 --> 00:06:47.775
that's the idea that populations may vary

00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:50.244
in their response

00:06:50.268 --> 00:06:52.370
and apply that to vaccines.

00:06:52.784 --> 00:06:53.934
Right?

00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.142
And here in Boston Children's Hospital

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.775
at the Precision Vaccines
Program I direct,

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:02.061
we have five approaches,
stepwise approaches we take,
