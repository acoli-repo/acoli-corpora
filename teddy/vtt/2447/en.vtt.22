00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:02.276
Vaccines protect you and your loved ones

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.712
and the people around you.

00:11:03.736 --> 00:11:05.942
Not only do they protect you
against infection,

00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:08.395
they prevent you
from spreading it to others.

00:11:08.419 --> 00:11:09.815
Get immunized.

00:11:09.839 --> 00:11:13.283
Scientific progress is fragile
and can be lost.

00:11:13.307 --> 00:11:17.089
We must foster accurate
and respectful public dialogue.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:19.688
And finally, we're on the verge
of great things,

00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:21.841
a new era of vaccination.

00:11:21.865 --> 00:11:24.825
We've just scratched the surface
of what can be accomplished.

00:11:24.849 --> 00:11:26.834
Please advocate for this research.

00:11:26.858 --> 00:11:28.039
Thank you.

00:11:28.063 --> 00:11:30.951
