00:05:58.035 --> 00:06:01.336
are finding molecules
that can boost a vaccine response.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.296
Those are called adjuvants,

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.212
from the Latin "adjuvare," to help or aid.

00:06:06.236 --> 00:06:09.323
Adjuvants are molecules
we might add to a vaccine

00:06:09.347 --> 00:06:11.045
to get a stronger response.

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:14.364
And in the presence of the adjuvant,
depicted here in red,

00:06:14.388 --> 00:06:17.744
you have a much more profound
activation of the white blood cells

00:06:17.768 --> 00:06:19.037
of your immune system,

00:06:19.061 --> 00:06:21.950
and generate a much more
profound immune response,

00:06:21.974 --> 00:06:24.735
with much higher antibody
levels, more rapidly,

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.775
and that lasts a long time
for durable immunity.

00:06:28.093 --> 00:06:31.561
Interestingly, these adjuvants
have different effects
