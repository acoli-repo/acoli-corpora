00:08:59.353 --> 00:09:03.450
We're taking a deeper dive
as to how current vaccines protect.

00:09:03.474 --> 00:09:05.823
We've formed an international consortium

00:09:05.847 --> 00:09:09.586
to study how hepatitis B vaccine
protects newborns

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.500
from hepatitis B infection.

00:09:11.524 --> 00:09:12.675
And to do this,

00:09:12.699 --> 00:09:16.103
we've developed a technique
called small sample, big data.

00:09:16.127 --> 00:09:20.191
We can get a tiny little drop
of baby blood before immunization,

00:09:20.215 --> 00:09:23.313
and take a tiny little drop
after immunization,

00:09:23.337 --> 00:09:26.225
and we can measure the inventory
of all the cells,

00:09:26.249 --> 00:09:29.615
and all the genes and all the molecules
in that drop of blood,

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:31.861
and we can compare after the vaccine
