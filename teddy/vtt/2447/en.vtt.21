00:10:29.132 --> 00:10:31.062
but it requires multiple doses,

00:10:31.086 --> 00:10:32.617
and the immunity keeps dropping.

00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:35.387
We want to develop a single-shot
pertussis vaccine.

00:10:35.411 --> 00:10:38.315
We're working on a vaccine
for respiratory syncytial virus,

00:10:38.339 --> 00:10:42.006
the number one cause of infant
hospitalization in the United States.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.710
A better vaccine against influenza,

00:10:44.734 --> 00:10:47.029
and, of course, HIV.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:51.371
We're also looking at vaccines
against cancer, allergy

00:10:51.395 --> 00:10:54.553
and, interestingly, opioid overdose.

00:10:55.815 --> 00:10:58.609
So, this is my final message to you.

00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:02.276
Vaccines protect you and your loved ones
