00:04:29.117 --> 00:04:32.561
the number of individuals
dying of infection in the world.

00:04:32.585 --> 00:04:34.079
And on the X axis,

00:04:34.103 --> 00:04:36.617
the age of the individuals who are dying.

00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:40.061
And as you can see,
it's very much a U-shaped distribution,

00:04:40.085 --> 00:04:43.291
and it's particularly stark
in the very young ages.

00:04:43.855 --> 00:04:47.901
So vaccines shield
the very young from infection.

00:04:48.528 --> 00:04:51.591
And if we want to talk, my friends,
about what vaccines cause,

00:04:51.615 --> 00:04:53.385
because there's a lot of speculation,

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:57.014
unfounded speculation on the internet,
of what vaccines cause,

00:04:57.038 --> 00:05:00.593
vaccines cause adults, OK?
