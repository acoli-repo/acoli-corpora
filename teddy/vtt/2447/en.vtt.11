00:05:26.903 --> 00:05:30.315
In the top panel, what you see
is a simple vaccine.

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:33.237
All vaccines contain
something called an antigen.

00:05:33.261 --> 00:05:36.499
The antigen is like a piece
of a germ, of a microbe,

00:05:36.523 --> 00:05:38.412
that your body remembers, right?

00:05:38.436 --> 00:05:41.888
It forms antibodies
and those antibodies can protect you.

00:05:41.912 --> 00:05:45.307
So those kind of vaccines
can induce an immune response,

00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:46.664
but as you see here,

00:05:46.688 --> 00:05:49.608
that immune response
tends to go up and back down,

00:05:49.632 --> 00:05:52.339
and you need to get another dose
and another dose

00:05:52.363 --> 00:05:54.172
to maintain protection.

00:05:54.196 --> 00:05:55.346
What can we do?

00:05:55.836 --> 00:05:58.011
We and other scientists around the world

00:05:58.035 --> 00:06:01.336
are finding molecules
that can boost a vaccine response.
