00:01:54.489 --> 00:02:00.445
special channels that enable blood
to absorb and retain more water,

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:03.050
leading to concentrated, dark urine.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.555
Increased dehydration can cause
notable drops in energy,

00:02:06.555 --> 00:02:07.586
mood,

00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:08.774
skin moisture,

00:02:08.774 --> 00:02:10.198
and blood pressure,

00:02:10.198 --> 00:02:13.252
as well as signs of cognitive impairment.

00:02:13.252 --> 00:02:17.210
A dehydrated brain works harder 
to accomplish the same amount

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.696
as a normal brain,

00:02:18.696 --> 00:02:22.618
and it even temporarily shrinks
because of its lack of water.

00:02:22.618 --> 00:02:25.614
Over-hydration, or hyponatremia,

00:02:25.614 --> 00:02:30.669
is usually caused by overconsumption
of water in a short amount of time.
