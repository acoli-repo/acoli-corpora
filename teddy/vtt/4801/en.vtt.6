00:02:59.768 --> 00:03:01.923
Water intoxication then occurs,

00:03:01.923 --> 00:03:03.559
possibly causing headache,

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:04.688
vomiting,

00:03:04.688 --> 00:03:08.162
and, in rare instances, seizures
or death.

00:03:08.162 --> 00:03:10.295
But that's a pretty extreme situation.

00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:12.062
On a normal, day-to-day basis,

00:03:12.062 --> 00:03:15.632
maintaining a well-hydrated system
is easy to manage

00:03:15.632 --> 00:03:19.528
for those of us fortunate enough 
to have access to clean drinking water.

00:03:19.528 --> 00:03:23.808
For a long time, conventional wisdom said
that we should drink eight glasses a day.

00:03:23.808 --> 00:03:26.453
That estimate has since been fine-tuned.

00:03:26.453 --> 00:03:30.245
Now, the consensus is that the amount
of water we need to imbibe
