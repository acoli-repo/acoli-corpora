00:02:25.614 --> 00:02:30.669
is usually caused by overconsumption
of water in a short amount of time.

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.242
Athletes are often the victims 
of over-hydration

00:02:33.242 --> 00:02:36.585
because of complications 
in regulating water levels

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:39.263
in extreme physical conditions.

00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:43.769
Whereas the dehydrated brain amps
up the production of antidiuretic hormone,

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.174
the over-hydrated brain slows,
or even stops, releasing it into the blood.

00:02:49.174 --> 00:02:51.980
Sodium electrolytes in the body
become diluted,

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.133
causing cells to swell.

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:55.584
In severe cases,

00:02:55.584 --> 00:02:59.768
the kidneys can't keep up with 
the resulting volumes of dilute urine.

00:02:59.768 --> 00:03:01.923
Water intoxication then occurs,
