00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:30.859
While these functions 
are essential to our survival,

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:33.306
we need to compensate for the fluid loss.

00:01:33.306 --> 00:01:37.848
Maintaining a balanced water level
is essential to avoid dehydration

00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:39.710
or over-hydration,

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.279
both of which can have devastating
effects on overall health.

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:45.404
At first detection of low water levels,

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:48.367
sensory receptors 
in the brain's hypothalamus

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:51.399
signal the release 
of antidiuretic hormone.

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.489
When it reached the kidneys, 
it creates aquaporins,

00:01:54.489 --> 00:02:00.445
special channels that enable blood
to absorb and retain more water,
