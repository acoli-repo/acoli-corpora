00:00:56.062 --> 00:01:00.510
An adult's brain and heart are almost
three quarters water.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.367
That's roughly equivalent to the amount
of moisture in a banana.

00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:08.487
Lungs are more similar to an apple at 83%.

00:01:08.487 --> 00:01:14.310
And even seemingly dry human bones
are 31% water.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.051
If we are essentially made of water,

00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:17.634
and surrounded by water,

00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:20.492
why do we still need to drink so much?

00:01:20.492 --> 00:01:24.293
Well, each day we lose two to three liters
through our sweat,

00:01:24.293 --> 00:01:25.227
urine,

00:01:25.227 --> 00:01:26.707
and bowel movements,

00:01:26.707 --> 00:01:28.371
and even just from breathing.

00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:30.859
While these functions 
are essential to our survival,
