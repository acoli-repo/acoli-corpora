00:03:26.453 --> 00:03:30.245
Now, the consensus is that the amount
of water we need to imbibe

00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:33.116
depends largely on our weight
and environment.

00:03:33.116 --> 00:03:39.616
The recommended daily intake varies from
between 2.5-3.7 liters of water for men,

00:03:39.616 --> 00:03:42.802
and about 2-2.7 liters for women,

00:03:42.802 --> 00:03:46.148
a range that is pushed up 
or down if we are healthy,

00:03:46.148 --> 00:03:46.987
active,

00:03:46.987 --> 00:03:47.950
old,

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.663
or overheating.

00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:51.522
While water is the healthiest hydrator,

00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:52.617
other beverages,

00:03:52.617 --> 00:03:55.230
even those with caffeine 
like coffee or tea,

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.323
replenish fluids as well.

00:03:57.323 --> 00:04:02.306
And water within food makes up 
about a fifth of our daily H20 intake.
