00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.987
and I said, "Hi, Jeannie! How are you?"

00:00:30.987 --> 00:00:32.557
And she looked at me, and I could tell

00:00:32.557 --> 00:00:34.284
that she recognized me,

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:37.369
but she couldn't quite place me,
and she looked at me and she said,

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:40.130
"Stephen Krosoczka?"

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.272
And I was amazed that she knew I was a Krosoczka,

00:00:42.272 --> 00:00:45.703
but Stephen is my uncle who
is 20 years older than I am,

00:00:45.703 --> 00:00:48.840
and she had been his lunch lady when he was a kid.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.345
And she started telling me about her grandkids,

00:00:51.345 --> 00:00:54.050
and that blew my mind.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.844
My lunch lady had grandkids,

00:00:55.844 --> 00:00:56.808
and therefore kids,

00:00:56.808 --> 00:01:00.063
and therefore left school at the end of the day?
