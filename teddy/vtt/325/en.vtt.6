00:02:59.798 --> 00:03:01.305
made every school year.

00:03:01.305 --> 00:03:03.691
And the stories of heroism go well beyond

00:03:03.691 --> 00:03:05.678
just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets

00:03:05.678 --> 00:03:06.843
on their lunch tray.

00:03:06.843 --> 00:03:08.552
There is Ms. Brenda in California,

00:03:08.552 --> 00:03:11.341
who keeps a close eye on every
student that comes through her line

00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:13.826
and then reports back to the guidance counselor

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:15.176
if anything is amiss.

00:03:15.176 --> 00:03:16.600
There are the lunch ladies in Kentucky

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.235
who realized that 67 percent of their students

00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:21.208
relied on those meals every day,

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:23.324
and they were going without food over the summer,

00:03:23.324 --> 00:03:25.348
so they retrofitted a school bus

00:03:25.348 --> 00:03:27.100
to create a mobile feeding unit,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.335
and they traveled around the neighborhoods

00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:31.134
feedings 500 kids a day during the summer.
