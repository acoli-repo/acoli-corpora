00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.570
When my first children's book was published

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.293
in 2001,

00:00:04.293 --> 00:00:06.506
I returned to my old elementary school

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.446
to talk to the students about being an author

00:00:08.446 --> 00:00:10.162
and an illustrator,

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:12.895
and when I was setting up my slide projector

00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:16.100
in the cafetorium,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.148
I looked across the room,

00:00:18.148 --> 00:00:20.759
and there she was:

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.603
my old lunch lady.

00:00:22.603 --> 00:00:24.570
She was still there at the school

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.456
and she was busily preparing lunches for the day.

00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:29.100
So I approached her to say hello,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.987
and I said, "Hi, Jeannie! How are you?"
