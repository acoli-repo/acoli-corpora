00:02:28.774 --> 00:02:32.340
and her husband told me it meant so much to her

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.758
that I had acknowledged her hard work,

00:02:34.758 --> 00:02:37.624
I had validated what she did.

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:39.516
And that inspired me to create a day

00:02:39.516 --> 00:02:41.766
where we could recreate that feeling

00:02:41.766 --> 00:02:44.781
in cafeterias across the country:

00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:46.434
School Lunch Hero Day, a day where kids

00:02:46.434 --> 00:02:49.292
can make creative projects for their lunch staff.

00:02:49.292 --> 00:02:51.496
And I partnered with the
School Nutrition Association,

00:02:51.496 --> 00:02:54.624
and did you know that a little over 30 million kids

00:02:54.624 --> 00:02:56.446
participate in school lunch programs every day.

00:02:56.446 --> 00:02:59.798
That equals up to a little over five billion lunches

00:02:59.798 --> 00:03:01.305
made every school year.
