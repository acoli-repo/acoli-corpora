feedings 500 kids a day during the summer.

00:03:31.134 --> 00:03:33.729
And kids made the most amazing projects.

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:34.779
I knew they would.

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:36.391
Kids made hamburger cards

00:03:36.391 --> 00:03:38.385
that were made out of construction paper.

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:40.286
They took photos of their lunch lady's head

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:42.094
and plastered it onto my cartoon lunch lady

00:03:42.094 --> 00:03:43.887
and fixed that to a milk carton

00:03:43.887 --> 00:03:46.373
and presented them with flowers.

00:03:46.373 --> 00:03:48.376
And they made their own comics,

00:03:48.376 --> 00:03:49.737
starring the cartoon lunch lady

00:03:49.737 --> 00:03:51.960
alongside their actual lunch ladies.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.896
And they made thank you pizzas,

00:03:53.896 --> 00:03:55.811
where every kid signed a different topping

00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:58.770
of a construction paper pizza.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.370
For me, I was so moved by the response
