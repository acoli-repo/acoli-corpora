00:00:56.808 --> 00:01:00.063
and therefore left school at the end of the day?

00:01:00.063 --> 00:01:01.806
I thought she lived in the cafeteria

00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:02.679
with the serving spoons.

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.622
I had never thought about any of that before.

00:01:04.622 --> 00:01:08.354
Well, that chance encounter inspired my imagination,

00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:11.905
and I created the Lunch Lady graphic novel series,

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:14.082
a series of comics about a lunch lady

00:01:14.082 --> 00:01:16.680
who uses her fish stick nunchucks

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.582
to fight off evil cyborg substitutes,

00:01:19.582 --> 00:01:22.889
a school bus monster, and mutant mathletes,

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:24.356
and the end of every book,

00:01:24.356 --> 00:01:25.862
they get the bad guy with their hairnet,

00:01:25.862 --> 00:01:29.616
and they proclaim, "Justice is served!"

00:01:29.616 --> 00:01:33.869
