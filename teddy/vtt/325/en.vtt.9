00:04:28.777 --> 00:04:31.236
and before a child can learn,

00:04:31.236 --> 00:04:33.766
their belly needs to be full,

00:04:33.766 --> 00:04:35.544
and these women and men

00:04:35.544 --> 00:04:37.467
are working on the front lines to create

00:04:37.467 --> 00:04:39.670
an educated society.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.440
So I hope that

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.341
you don't wait for School Lunch Hero Day

00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:46.376
to say thank you to your lunch staff,

00:04:46.376 --> 00:04:48.424
and I hope that you remember

00:04:48.424 --> 00:04:51.270
how powerful a thank you can be.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.265
A thank you can change a life.

00:04:53.265 --> 00:04:56.467
It changes the life of the person who receives it,

00:04:56.467 --> 00:04:58.751
and it changes the life of the person

00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:00.377
who expresses it.
