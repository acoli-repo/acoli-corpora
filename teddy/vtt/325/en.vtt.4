00:01:58.675 --> 00:02:01.444
Because the lunch lady has not been treated

00:02:01.444 --> 00:02:04.966
very kindly in popular culture over time.

00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:07.138
But it meant the most to Jeannie.

00:02:07.138 --> 00:02:08.828
When the books were first published,

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:10.932
I invited her to the book launch party,

00:02:10.932 --> 00:02:12.743
and in front of everyone there,

00:02:12.743 --> 00:02:14.040
everyone she had fed over the years,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.980

And two years after this photo was taken,

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.360
she passed away,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.447
and I attended her wake,

00:02:22.447 --> 00:02:25.286
and nothing could have prepared
me for what I saw there,

00:02:25.286 --> 00:02:28.774
because next to her casket was this painting,

00:02:28.774 --> 00:02:32.340
and her husband told me it meant so much to her
