00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.819
And then came this revolution in 1967.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.686
A man named
Alan Frank invented a lid

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.696
that you could peel a tab off,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.476
like in the shape of a guitar pick,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.866
and drink it from there.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.316
In 1975, another big advance:

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.946
you could peel back a tab
and attach it to the lid itself.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.540
So, more and more people
started drinking coffee on the go.

00:01:48.564 --> 00:01:54.126
In 1984, a watershed moment
in the history of coffee cup lids:

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.067
the birth of the traveler lid.

00:01:57.091 --> 00:01:59.856
And it is iconic --
you've seen it a million times.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.486
And it solved a whole host of problems.
