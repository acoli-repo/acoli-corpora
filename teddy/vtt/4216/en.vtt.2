00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.606
The bad part is, it's
harder to savor a coffee

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.256
when you're taking it on the road.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.891
The first patent for a lid on a cup

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:07.196
was in 1934,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.846
but it was for cold beverages.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.206
And in 1950, this guy
named James Reifsnyder

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.146
invented the first snap-on lid.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.906
But it didn't have
an opening for drinking.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.386
In the '60s there was
this huge cultural shift,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.936
where people started
drinking coffee on the move.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.526
And 7-Eleven was the first
to sell coffee to go.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.819
And then came this revolution in 1967.
