00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.486
And it solved a whole host of problems.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.406
It's designed so that you
don't splash your face,

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.332
because it's higher than
any of the other ones.

00:02:09.356 --> 00:02:11.576
And it's got this protruding rim,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.686
so it slightly cools the coffee
before it hits your lips.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.326
It's got a small depression
in the center for your nose,

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.546
so you can really get in there
and get maximum aroma.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.586
It's got this tiny air hole
that lets the steam out

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.336
and stops it from creating a vacuum.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.186
This is one of those objects
where you just don't notice it
