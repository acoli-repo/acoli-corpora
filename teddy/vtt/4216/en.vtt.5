This is one of those objects
where you just don't notice it

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.726
until it dribbles on your lap.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.007
So I think the coffee cup lid
will just continue to evolve,

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:39.078
and you're going to see a move
away from single-use plastic lids

00:02:39.102 --> 00:02:41.820
to lids that are
a little more sustainable.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.314
We're not going to stop moving.

00:02:43.314 --> 00:02:45.246
We're not going to stop drinking coffee.

00:02:45.246 --> 00:02:49.202
And I think that's what these coffee
lid engineers are trying to do,

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:53.988
is to make it so that
the experience of taking it on the road

00:02:53.988 --> 00:02:58.284
is as good as sitting in a restaurant,
drinking from a ceramic cup.

00:02:58.284 --> 00:03:01.192
Because, you know,
coffee is serious business.
