00:13:57.914 --> 00:14:01.436
And I think all of these things
make understanding possible.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.839
I think this actually is the essence
of understanding something.

00:14:04.863 --> 00:14:06.157
I truly believe this.

00:14:06.181 --> 00:14:08.608
So this thing about changing
your perspective --

00:14:08.608 --> 00:14:11.341
it's absolutely fundamental for humans.

00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:13.450
Let's play around with the Earth.

00:14:13.474 --> 00:14:15.983
Let's zoom into the ocean,
have a look at the ocean.

00:14:16.007 --> 00:14:17.949
We can do this with anything.

00:14:17.973 --> 00:14:20.433
We can take the ocean
and view it up close.

00:14:20.457 --> 00:14:22.391
We can look at the waves.

00:14:22.415 --> 00:14:23.627
We can go to the beach.

00:14:23.651 --> 00:14:25.914
We can view the ocean
from another perspective.

00:14:25.938 --> 00:14:29.128
Every time we do this, we learn
a little bit more about the ocean.

00:14:29.152 --> 00:14:31.741
If we go to the shore,
we can kind of smell it, right?
