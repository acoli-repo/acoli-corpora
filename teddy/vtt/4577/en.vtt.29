00:14:29.152 --> 00:14:31.741
If we go to the shore,
we can kind of smell it, right?

00:14:31.765 --> 00:14:33.475
We can hear the sound of the waves.

00:14:33.499 --> 00:14:35.545
We can feel salt on our tongues.

00:14:35.569 --> 00:14:38.459
So all of these
are different perspectives.

00:14:38.483 --> 00:14:39.747
And this is the best one.

00:14:39.771 --> 00:14:41.414
We can go into the water.

00:14:41.438 --> 00:14:43.447
We can see the water from the inside.

00:14:43.471 --> 00:14:44.649
And you know what?

00:14:44.673 --> 00:14:47.754
This is absolutely essential
in mathematics and computer science.

00:14:47.778 --> 00:14:50.733
If you're able to view
a structure from the inside,

00:14:50.757 --> 00:14:53.327
then you really learn something about it.

00:14:53.351 --> 00:14:55.372
That's somehow the essence of something.

00:14:55.883 --> 00:14:59.526
So when we do this,
and we've taken this journey

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:00.723
into the ocean,
