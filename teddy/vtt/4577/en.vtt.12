00:05:59.715 --> 00:06:02.087
On the other hand, it's a multiplication,

00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:04.554
and those are two different perspectives.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.888
And I would go as far as to say
that every equation is like this,

00:06:08.912 --> 00:06:13.028
every mathematical equation
where you use that equality sign

00:06:13.052 --> 00:06:14.471
is actually a metaphor.

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:16.925
It's an analogy between two things.

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:20.444
You're just viewing something
and taking two different points of view,

00:06:20.468 --> 00:06:22.861
and you're expressing that in a language.

00:06:22.885 --> 00:06:24.449
Have a look at this equation.

00:06:24.473 --> 00:06:26.728
This is one of the most
beautiful equations.

00:06:26.752 --> 00:06:29.120
It simply says that, well,

00:06:29.902 --> 00:06:31.795
two things, they're both -1.
