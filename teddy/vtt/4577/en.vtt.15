00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:32.203
And this number expresses
a relation between two numbers.

00:07:32.227 --> 00:07:35.191
You have four on the one hand
and three on the other.

00:07:35.215 --> 00:07:37.293
And you can visualize this in many ways.

00:07:37.317 --> 00:07:41.364
What I'm doing now is viewing that number
from different perspectives.

00:07:41.388 --> 00:07:42.539
I'm playing around.

00:07:42.563 --> 00:07:45.107
I'm playing around with
how we view something,

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.843
and I'm doing it very deliberately.

00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:48.050
We can take a grid.

00:07:48.074 --> 00:07:52.752
If it's four across and three up,
this line equals five, always.

00:07:52.776 --> 00:07:55.464
It has to be like this.
This is a beautiful pattern.

00:07:55.488 --> 00:07:56.742
Four and three and five.

00:07:57.177 --> 00:07:59.888
And this rectangle, which is 4 x 3,

00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:01.503
you've seen a lot of times.
