00:08:57.906 --> 00:09:01.690
(Applause)

00:09:04.556 --> 00:09:05.707
This is not new.

00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:07.765
This has been known
for a long time, but --

00:09:07.789 --> 00:09:09.398
(Laughter)

00:09:09.422 --> 00:09:11.106
But this is four-thirds.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.689
Let's do another experiment.

00:09:12.713 --> 00:09:16.822
Let's now take a sound, this sound: (Beep)

00:09:16.846 --> 00:09:19.835
This is a perfect A, 440Hz.

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:21.545
Let's multiply it by two.

00:09:21.569 --> 00:09:22.928
We get this sound. (Beep)

00:09:22.952 --> 00:09:25.207
When we play them together,
it sounds like this.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:26.444
This is an octave, right?

00:09:26.468 --> 00:09:29.233
We can do this game. We can play
a sound, play the same A.

00:09:29.257 --> 00:09:30.958
We can multiply it by three-halves.
