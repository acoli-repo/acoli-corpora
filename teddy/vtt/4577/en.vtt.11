00:05:29.472 --> 00:05:33.262
And I think this is a really important
thing that we do all the time.

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:37.814
So let's just look at
this simple equation,

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:40.387
x + x = 2 • x.

00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:42.483
This is a very nice pattern,
and it's true,

00:05:42.507 --> 00:05:45.336
because 5 + 5 = 2 • 5, etc.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.461
We've seen this over and over,
and we represent it like this.

00:05:48.485 --> 00:05:50.669
But think about it: this is an equation.

00:05:51.025 --> 00:05:53.587
It says that something
is equal to something else,

00:05:53.611 --> 00:05:55.898
and that's two different perspectives.

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:57.821
One perspective is, it's a sum.

00:05:57.845 --> 00:05:59.691
It's something you plus together.

00:05:59.715 --> 00:06:02.087
On the other hand, it's a multiplication,
