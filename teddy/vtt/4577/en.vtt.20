00:09:58.793 --> 00:10:00.758
I can even do this with rhythms, right?

00:10:00.782 --> 00:10:04.454
I can take a rhythm and play
three beats at one time (Drumbeats)

00:10:04.478 --> 00:10:06.029
in a period of time,

00:10:06.053 --> 00:10:10.395
and I can play another sound
four times in that same space.

00:10:10.419 --> 00:10:11.461
(Clanking sounds)

00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:13.866
Sounds kind of boring,
but listen to them together.

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.676
(Drumbeats and clanking sounds)

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.990
(Laughter)

00:10:18.014 --> 00:10:19.435
Hey! So.

00:10:19.459 --> 00:10:21.347
(Laughter)

00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:23.530
I can even make a little hi-hat.

00:10:23.554 --> 00:10:25.395
(Drumbeats and cymbals)

00:10:25.419 --> 00:10:26.570
Can you hear this?

00:10:26.594 --> 00:10:28.707
So, this is the sound of four-thirds.

00:10:28.731 --> 00:10:30.581
Again, this is as a rhythm.
