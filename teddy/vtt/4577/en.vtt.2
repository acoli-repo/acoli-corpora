00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.858
First of all, it's about finding patterns.

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:09.496
And by "pattern," I mean a connection,
a structure, some regularity,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.513
some rules that govern what we see.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.325
Second of all,

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:16.989
I think it is about representing
these patterns with a language.

00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:19.805
We make up language if we don't have it,

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.198
and in mathematics, this is essential.

00:01:23.013 --> 00:01:24.813
It's also about making assumptions

00:01:24.837 --> 00:01:28.450
and playing around with these assumptions
and just seeing what happens.

00:01:28.474 --> 00:01:30.556
We're going to do that very soon.
