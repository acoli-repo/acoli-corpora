00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:01.503
you've seen a lot of times.

00:08:01.527 --> 00:08:03.340
This is your average computer screen.

00:08:03.364 --> 00:08:06.743
800 x 600 or 1,600 x 1,200

00:08:06.767 --> 00:08:09.255
is a television or a computer screen.

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:11.896
So these are all nice representations,

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.842
but I want to go a little bit further
and just play more with this number.

00:08:15.866 --> 00:08:19.114
Here you see two circles.
I'm going to rotate them like this.

00:08:19.138 --> 00:08:20.926
Observe the upper-left one.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.723
It goes a little bit faster, right?

00:08:23.137 --> 00:08:24.295
You can see this.

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:27.693
It actually goes exactly
four-thirds as fast.

00:08:27.717 --> 00:08:30.117
That means that when it goes
around four times,
