00:03:29.966 --> 00:03:35.583
So I want to talk about
that magic that happens

00:03:35.607 --> 00:03:37.578
when we actually represent something.

00:03:37.602 --> 00:03:40.618
Here you see just lines
with different widths.

00:03:40.642 --> 00:03:43.267
They stand for numbers
for a particular book.

00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:46.284
And I can actually recommend
this book, it's a very nice book.

00:03:46.308 --> 00:03:47.330
(Laughter)

00:03:47.354 --> 00:03:48.635
Just trust me.

00:03:49.475 --> 00:03:51.798
OK, so let's just do an experiment,

00:03:51.822 --> 00:03:53.990
just to play around
with some straight lines.

00:03:54.014 --> 00:03:55.181
This is a straight line.

00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:56.359
Let's make another one.

00:03:56.383 --> 00:03:59.192
So every time we move,
we move one down and one across,

00:03:59.216 --> 00:04:01.790
and we draw a new straight line, right?
