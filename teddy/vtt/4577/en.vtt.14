00:06:58.435 --> 00:07:00.245
that's called the binary system.

00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:01.972
It's written like this.

00:07:01.996 --> 00:07:03.958
So we're now talking about the number.

00:07:03.982 --> 00:07:05.528
The number is four-thirds.

00:07:05.964 --> 00:07:07.307
We can write it like this,

00:07:07.331 --> 00:07:10.336
and we can change the base,
change the number of digits,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.148
and we can write it differently.

00:07:12.172 --> 00:07:16.339
So these are all representations
of the same number.

00:07:16.363 --> 00:07:19.911
We can even write it simply,
like 1.3 or 1.6.

00:07:19.935 --> 00:07:22.135
It all depends on
how many digits you have.

00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:25.903
Or perhaps we just simplify
and write it like this.

00:07:25.927 --> 00:07:29.142
I like this one, because this says
four divided by three.

00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:32.203
And this number expresses
a relation between two numbers.
