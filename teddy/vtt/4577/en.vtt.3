00:01:28.474 --> 00:01:30.556
We're going to do that very soon.

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:33.841
And finally, it's about doing cool stuff.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.775
Mathematics enables us
to do so many things.

00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:40.848
So let's have a look at these patterns.

00:01:40.872 --> 00:01:43.094
If you want to tie a tie knot,

00:01:43.118 --> 00:01:44.428
there are patterns.

00:01:44.452 --> 00:01:45.923
Tie knots have names.

00:01:46.453 --> 00:01:48.800
And you can also do
the mathematics of tie knots.

00:01:48.824 --> 00:01:51.402
This is a left-out, right-in,
center-out and tie.

00:01:52.073 --> 00:01:55.616
This is a left-in, right-out,
left-in, center-out and tie.

00:01:56.005 --> 00:02:00.115
This is a language we made up
for the patterns of tie knots,
