00:02:29.255 --> 00:02:30.445
it falls down.

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.620
Why?

00:02:31.644 --> 00:02:35.714
We're not sure, but we can represent
this with mathematics in a pattern.

00:02:36.285 --> 00:02:37.888
This is also a pattern.

00:02:37.912 --> 00:02:40.612
This is also an invented language.

00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:42.180
Can you guess for what?

00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:46.857
It is actually a notation system
for dancing, for tap dancing.

00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:52.788
That enables him as a choreographer
to do cool stuff, to do new things,

00:02:52.812 --> 00:02:54.765
because he has represented it.

00:02:55.232 --> 00:03:00.034
I want you to think about how amazing
representing something actually is.
