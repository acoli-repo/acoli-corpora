00:03:59.216 --> 00:04:01.790
and we draw a new straight line, right?

00:04:01.814 --> 00:04:03.839
We do this over and over and over,

00:04:04.351 --> 00:04:05.709
and we look for patterns.

00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:07.855
So this pattern emerges,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.262
and it's a rather nice pattern.

00:04:10.286 --> 00:04:12.021
It looks like a curve, right?

00:04:12.045 --> 00:04:14.617
Just from drawing simple, straight lines.

00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:18.555
Now I can change my perspective
a little bit. I can rotate it.

00:04:18.944 --> 00:04:20.326
Have a look at the curve.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.729
What does it look like?

00:04:21.753 --> 00:04:23.735
Is it a part of a circle?

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.661
It's actually not a part of a circle.

00:04:25.685 --> 00:04:29.844
So I have to continue my investigation
and look for the true pattern.

00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:33.079
Perhaps if I copy it and make some art?
