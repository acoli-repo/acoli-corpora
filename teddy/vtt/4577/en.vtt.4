00:01:56.005 --> 00:02:00.115
This is a language we made up
for the patterns of tie knots,

00:02:00.522 --> 00:02:02.212
and a half-Windsor is all that.

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:06.316
This is a mathematics book
about tying shoelaces

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.730
at the university level,

00:02:07.754 --> 00:02:09.732
because there are patterns in shoelaces.

00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:11.867
You can do it in so many different ways.

00:02:11.891 --> 00:02:13.135
We can analyze it.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.925
We can make up languages for it.

00:02:16.218 --> 00:02:19.157
And representations
are all over mathematics.

00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:22.857
This is Leibniz's notation from 1675.

00:02:23.335 --> 00:02:27.005
He invented a language
for patterns in nature.

00:02:27.363 --> 00:02:29.231
When we throw something up in the air,

00:02:29.255 --> 00:02:30.445
it falls down.
