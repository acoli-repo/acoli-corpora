Mathematics and computer science
are the most imaginative art forms ever.

00:15:34.884 --> 00:15:37.066
And this thing about changing perspectives

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.598
should sound a little bit familiar to you,

00:15:39.622 --> 00:15:41.834
because we do it every day.

00:15:42.604 --> 00:15:44.224
And then it's called empathy.

00:15:44.954 --> 00:15:47.653
When I view the world
from your perspective,

00:15:48.939 --> 00:15:50.605
I have empathy with you.

00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:52.477
If I really, truly understand

00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:55.579
what the world looks
like from your perspective,

00:15:55.603 --> 00:15:57.074
I am empathetic.

00:15:57.098 --> 00:15:59.278
That requires imagination.

00:15:59.827 --> 00:16:02.286
And that is how we obtain understanding.
