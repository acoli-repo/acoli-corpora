Many of us think of mathematics
as addition, subtraction,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.518
multiplication, division,

00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:37.352
fractions, percent, geometry,
algebra -- all that stuff.

00:00:38.034 --> 00:00:41.708
But actually, I want to talk
about the essence of mathematics as well.

00:00:41.732 --> 00:00:45.019
And my claim is that mathematics
has to do with patterns.

00:00:45.043 --> 00:00:47.534
Behind me, you see a beautiful pattern,

00:00:47.558 --> 00:00:51.489
and this pattern actually emerges
just from drawing circles

00:00:51.513 --> 00:00:53.143
in a very particular way.

00:00:53.778 --> 00:00:58.367
So my day-to-day definition
of mathematics that I use every day

00:00:58.391 --> 00:00:59.596
is the following:
