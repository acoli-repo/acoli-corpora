We find patterns, and we represent them.

00:05:01.954 --> 00:05:04.578
And I think this is a nice
day-to-day definition.

00:05:04.602 --> 00:05:06.933
But today I want to go
a little bit deeper,

00:05:06.957 --> 00:05:10.901
and think about
what the nature of this is.

00:05:10.925 --> 00:05:12.353
What makes it possible?

00:05:12.377 --> 00:05:14.531
There's one thing
that's a little bit deeper,

00:05:14.555 --> 00:05:18.058
and that has to do with the ability
to change your perspective.

00:05:18.082 --> 00:05:20.605
And I claim that when
you change your perspective,

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:23.435
and if you take another point of view,

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:27.369
you learn something new
about what you are watching

00:05:27.393 --> 00:05:28.844
or looking at or hearing.

00:05:29.472 --> 00:05:33.262
And I think this is a really important
thing that we do all the time.
