00:10:59.732 --> 00:11:01.155
That's my aim here.

00:11:01.179 --> 00:11:03.309
And my claim is that
you understand something

00:11:03.333 --> 00:11:06.325
if you have the ability to view it
from different perspectives.

00:11:06.349 --> 00:11:08.890
Let's look at this letter.
It's a beautiful R, right?

00:11:08.914 --> 00:11:10.092
How do you know that?

00:11:10.557 --> 00:11:13.745
Well, as a matter of fact,
you've seen a bunch of R's,

00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:15.414
and you've generalized

00:11:15.438 --> 00:11:18.408
and abstracted all of these
and found a pattern.

00:11:18.432 --> 00:11:21.794
So you know that this is an R.

00:11:23.643 --> 00:11:26.450
So what I'm aiming for here
is saying something

00:11:26.474 --> 00:11:29.855
about how understanding
and changing your perspective

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:31.211
are linked.
