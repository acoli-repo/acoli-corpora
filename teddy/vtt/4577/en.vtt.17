00:08:27.717 --> 00:08:30.117
That means that when it goes
around four times,

00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:32.020
the other one goes around three times.

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:35.545
Now let's make two lines, and draw
this dot where the lines meet.

00:08:35.569 --> 00:08:37.271
We get this dot dancing around.

00:08:37.295 --> 00:08:38.332
(Laughter)

00:08:38.356 --> 00:08:40.125
And this dot comes from that number.

00:08:40.926 --> 00:08:42.793
Right? Now we should trace it.

00:08:43.239 --> 00:08:45.417
Let's trace it and see what happens.

00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:47.369
This is what mathematics is all about.

00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:49.028
It's about seeing what happens.

00:08:49.052 --> 00:08:51.996
And this emerges from four-thirds.

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.380
I like to say that this
is the image of four-thirds.

00:08:55.404 --> 00:08:56.700
It's much nicer -- (Cheers)

00:08:56.724 --> 00:08:57.882
Thank you!

00:08:57.906 --> 00:09:01.690
(Applause)
