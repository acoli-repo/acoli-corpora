00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:31.211
are linked.

00:11:31.235 --> 00:11:33.404
And I'm a teacher and a lecturer,

00:11:33.428 --> 00:11:35.740
and I can actually use this
to teach something,

00:11:35.764 --> 00:11:40.604
because when I give someone else
another story, a metaphor, an analogy,

00:11:40.628 --> 00:11:43.027
if I tell a story
from a different point of view,

00:11:43.051 --> 00:11:44.564
I enable understanding.

00:11:44.588 --> 00:11:46.454
I make understanding possible,

00:11:46.478 --> 00:11:49.544
because you have to generalize
over everything you see and hear,

00:11:49.568 --> 00:11:54.167
and if I give you another perspective,
that will become easier for you.

00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:56.097
Let's do a simple example again.

00:11:56.121 --> 00:11:58.762
This is four and three.
This is four triangles.

00:11:58.786 --> 00:12:01.234
So this is also four-thirds, in a way.
