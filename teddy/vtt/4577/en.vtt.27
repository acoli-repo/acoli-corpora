00:13:29.245 --> 00:13:32.398
you can see that this is also
a little bit like the octahedron.

00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:35.097
Do you see what I'm doing here?

00:13:35.121 --> 00:13:37.802
I am changing the perspective every time.

00:13:38.801 --> 00:13:41.451
So let's now take a step back --

00:13:41.475 --> 00:13:44.512
and that's actually
a metaphor, stepping back --

00:13:44.536 --> 00:13:46.899
and have a look at what we're doing.

00:13:46.923 --> 00:13:48.587
I'm playing around with metaphors.

00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:51.083
I'm playing around
with perspectives and analogies.

00:13:51.107 --> 00:13:53.139
I'm telling one story in different ways.

00:13:53.472 --> 00:13:54.682
I'm telling stories.

00:13:54.706 --> 00:13:57.890
I'm making a narrative;
I'm making several narratives.

00:13:57.914 --> 00:14:01.436
And I think all of these things
make understanding possible.
