Hi.

00:00:02.357 --> 00:00:06.176
I want to talk about understanding,
and the nature of understanding,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.593
and what the essence of understanding is,

00:00:09.617 --> 00:00:12.654
because understanding is something
we aim for, everyone.

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:15.089
We want to understand things.

00:00:15.763 --> 00:00:18.111
My claim is that understanding has to do

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:20.713
with the ability to change
your perspective.

00:00:20.737 --> 00:00:23.629
If you don't have that,
you don't have understanding.

00:00:24.106 --> 00:00:25.648
So that is my claim.

00:00:25.672 --> 00:00:27.571
And I want to focus on mathematics.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.546
Many of us think of mathematics
as addition, subtraction,
