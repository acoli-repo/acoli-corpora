00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:33.079
Perhaps if I copy it and make some art?

00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:34.830
Well, no.

00:04:34.854 --> 00:04:37.003
Perhaps I should extend
the lines like this,

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:38.797
and look for the pattern there.

00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:40.116
Let's make more lines.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.370
We do this.

00:04:41.394 --> 00:04:45.162
And then let's zoom out
and change our perspective again.

00:04:45.801 --> 00:04:49.312
Then we can actually see that
what started out as just straight lines

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:51.425
is actually a curve called a parabola.

00:04:51.855 --> 00:04:55.072
This is represented by a simple equation,

00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:56.914
and it's a beautiful pattern.

00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:59.296
So this is the stuff that we do.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.930
We find patterns, and we represent them.
