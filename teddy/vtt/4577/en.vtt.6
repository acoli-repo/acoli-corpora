I want you to think about how amazing
representing something actually is.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.363
Here it says the word "mathematics."

00:03:03.905 --> 00:03:06.305
But actually, they're just dots, right?

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.320
So how in the world can these dots
represent the word?

00:03:09.344 --> 00:03:10.684
Well, they do.

00:03:11.343 --> 00:03:13.241
They represent the word "mathematics,"

00:03:13.265 --> 00:03:15.825
and these symbols also represent that word

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.507
and this we can listen to.

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:18.888
It sounds like this.

00:03:18.912 --> 00:03:20.896
(Beeps)

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.210
Somehow these sounds represent
the word and the concept.

00:03:24.234 --> 00:03:25.890
How does this happen?

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:29.402
There's something amazing
going on about representing stuff.

00:03:29.966 --> 00:03:35.583
So I want to talk about
that magic that happens
