00:00:02.204 --> 00:00:04.913
Meet Esmeralda Flores.

00:00:05.913 --> 00:00:08.704
She is a home cleaner in New York City.

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:13.579
And like so many home cleaners,
she's using a tech platform, an app,

00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:15.371
to connect to clients.

00:00:15.371 --> 00:00:20.413
But unlike other home cleaners,
she's making $25 an hour,

00:00:20.413 --> 00:00:24.163
which is twice as much as she used to make
at her previous company.

00:00:24.163 --> 00:00:26.038
And she makes a living wage.

00:00:26.496 --> 00:00:29.746
There's no algorithmic boss at her company

00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:33.329
that changes the pay or hours
from under her feet,
