00:00:00.564 --> 00:00:05.650
So just by a show of hands, how many of you all have a robot at home?

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.590
Not very many of you.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.586
Okay. And actually of those hands,

00:00:09.586 --> 00:00:12.619
if you don't include Roomba how many of you have a robot at home?

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:14.076
So a couple.

00:00:14.076 --> 00:00:14.979
That's okay.

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:17.454
That's the problem that we're trying to solve at Romotive --

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:20.325
that I and the other 20 nerds at Romotive are obsessed with solving.

00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:24.327
So we really want to build a robot that anyone can use,

00:00:24.327 --> 00:00:26.579
whether you're eight or 80.

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.303
And as it turns out, that's a really hard problem,

00:00:29.303 --> 00:00:32.036
because you have to build a small, portable robot
