because you have to build a small, portable robot

00:00:32.036 --> 00:00:34.412
that's not only really affordable,

00:00:34.412 --> 00:00:35.953
but it has to be something

00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:39.940
that people actually want to take home and have around their kids.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.237
This robot can't be creepy or uncanny.

00:00:43.237 --> 00:00:45.448
He should be friendly and cute.

00:00:45.448 --> 00:00:48.359
So meet Romo.

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.216
Romo's a robot that uses a device you already know and love --

00:00:52.216 --> 00:00:55.065
your iPhone -- as his brain.

00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:59.176
And by leveraging the power of the iPhone's processor,

00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:03.627
we can create a robot that is wi-fi enabled
