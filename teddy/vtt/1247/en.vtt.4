00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.693
And Romo will actually stream video to this device.

00:02:01.693 --> 00:02:03.326
So I can see everything that Romo sees,

00:02:03.326 --> 00:02:05.358
and I get a robot's-eye-view of the world.

00:02:05.358 --> 00:02:06.794
Now this is a free app on the App Store,

00:02:06.794 --> 00:02:08.516
so if any of you guys had this app on your phones,

00:02:08.516 --> 00:02:12.243
we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together.

00:02:12.243 --> 00:02:13.925
So I'll show you really quickly,

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:15.771
Romo actually -- he's streaming video,

00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:17.961
so you can see me and the entire TED audience.

00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:19.493
If I get in front of Romo here.

00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:22.534
And if I want to control him, I can just drive.

00:02:22.534 --> 00:02:26.986
So I can drive him around,

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:28.912
and I can take pictures of you.

00:02:28.912 --> 00:02:31.317
I've always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person TED audience.
