00:01:28.078 --> 00:01:32.279
If I come over here -- (Laughs)

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:33.662
He's smart.

00:01:33.662 --> 00:01:35.876
And if I get too close to him,

00:01:35.876 --> 00:01:39.009
he gets scared just like any other creature.

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.459
So in a lot of ways, Romo is like a pet that has a mind of his own.

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.352
Thanks, little guy.

00:01:44.352 --> 00:01:45.734
(Sneezing sound)

00:01:45.734 --> 00:01:47.825
Bless you.

00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:52.443
And if I want to explore the world -- uh-oh, Romo's tired --

00:01:52.443 --> 00:01:54.458
if I want to explore the world with Romo,

00:01:54.458 --> 00:01:57.392
I can actually connect him from any other iOS device.

00:01:57.392 --> 00:01:58.952
So here's the iPad.

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.693
And Romo will actually stream video to this device.
