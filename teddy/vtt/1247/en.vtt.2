00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:03.627
we can create a robot that is wi-fi enabled

00:01:03.627 --> 00:01:07.311
and computer vision-capable for 150 bucks,

00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:12.243
which is about one percent of what these kinds of robots have cost in the past.

00:01:12.243 --> 00:01:15.860
When Romo wakes up, he's in creature mode.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.977
So he's actually using the video camera on the device to follow my face.

00:01:20.977 --> 00:01:22.476
If I duck down, he'll follow me.

00:01:22.476 --> 00:01:24.802
He's wary, so he'll keep his eyes on me.

00:01:24.802 --> 00:01:28.078
If I come over here, he'll turn to follow me.

00:01:28.078 --> 00:01:32.279
If I come over here -- (Laughs)
