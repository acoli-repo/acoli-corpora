00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I was raised in Seoul, Korea,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and moved to New York City in 1999 to attend college.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I was pre-med at the time,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and I thought I would become a surgeon

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
because I was interested in anatomy

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
At the same time, I fell in love with New York City.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I started to realize that I could look at the whole city

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
as a living organism.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I wanted to dissect it
