00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
as a living organism.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I wanted to dissect it

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and look into its unseen layers.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And the way to it, for me,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
was through artistic means.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So, eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and in grad school I became interested

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In New York City, rats are part of commuters' daily lives.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Most people ignore them or are frightened of them.
