I guess, except for in this picture.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And when the tides of waste matter come in

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
This is a still from a film I worked on recently, called "Blind Door."

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I've become more interested in capturing movement and texture.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And the 16mm black-and-white film gave a different feel to it.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And this is the first theater project I worked on.
