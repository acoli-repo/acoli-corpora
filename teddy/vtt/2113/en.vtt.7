00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
When I first went in, I was scared,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
because I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
But they happened to be wild dogs living there,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and it was right by the water,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
so there were swans and ducks swimming around

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and trees growing everywhere

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and bees nesting in the sugar barrels.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The nature had really reclaimed the whole complex.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And, in a way, I wanted the human figure in the picture

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
to become a part of that nature.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
When I got comfortable in the space,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
it also felt like a big playground.
