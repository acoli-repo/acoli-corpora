This is the New York City Farm Colony,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
which was a poorhouse in Staten Island

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
from the 1890s to the 1930s.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Most of my photos are set in places

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
that have been abandoned for decades,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
but this is an exception.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
This children's hospital was closed in 1997;

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
it's located in Newark.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
When I was there three years ago,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
the windows were broken and the walls were peeling,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
but everything was left there as it was.
