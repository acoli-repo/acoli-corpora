00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and I got off at the next station and met people there

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
that gave me access to their catacomb-like basement,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
which was used for ammunition storage during the war

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and also, at some point, to hide groups of Jewish refugees.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
This is the actual catacombs in Paris.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I explored there extensively

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
in the off-limits areas

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and fell in love right away.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
There are more than 185 miles of tunnels,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum.
