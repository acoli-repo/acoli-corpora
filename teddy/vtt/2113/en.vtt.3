"You can't take photographs here.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The MTA will confiscate your camera."

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I was quite shocked by that,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and thought to myself, "Well, OK then.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'll follow the rats."

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Then I started going into the tunnels,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that I never saw before and most people don't get to see.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Around the same time, I met like-minded individuals

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
who call themselves urban explorers, adventurers, spelunkers,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
guerrilla historians, etc.
