As you can see, the system is very complex and vast.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
It's very dangerous to get lost in there.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And at the same time,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
So the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
making them into the catacombs.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
The remains of over six million people are housed in there,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
some over 1,300 years old.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
This was taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery
