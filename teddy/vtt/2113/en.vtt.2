Most people ignore them or are frightened of them.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But I took a liking to them

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
because they dwell on the fringes of society.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And even though they're used in labs to promote human lives,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
they're also considered pests.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I also started looking around in the city

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and trying to photograph them.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
One day, in the subway, I was snapping pictures of the tracks

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
hoping to catch a rat or two,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and a man came up to me and said,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
"You can't take photographs here.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The MTA will confiscate your camera."
