which Victor Hugo wrote about in "Les Miserables."

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And I saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s, like this one.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
After exploring the underground of Paris,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I decided to climb up,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and I climbed a Gothic monument

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
that's right in the middle of Paris.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
This is the Tower of Saint Jacques.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
It was built in the early 1500s.
