00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and how vulnerable people truly are.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I love to travel,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
and Berlin has become one of my favorite cities.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
It's full of history,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and also full of underground bunkers

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and ruins from the war.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
This was taken under a homeless asylum

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
built in 1885 to house 1,100 people.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
I saw the structure while I was on the train,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and I got off at the next station and met people there
