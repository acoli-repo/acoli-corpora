00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and so I went ahead and put my camera on self-timer

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and ran back and forth.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And when I was done, he actually offered me his shirt

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
to wipe off my feet

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and kindly walked me out.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
It must have been a very unusual day for him.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
(Laughter)

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
One thing that struck me, after this incident,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
That homeless man, to me, really represented

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
an element of the unconscious of the city.
