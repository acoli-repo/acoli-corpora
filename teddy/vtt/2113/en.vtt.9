When you go into spaces like this,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
you're directly accessing the past,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
because they sit untouched for decades.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Instead of looking at reproductions of it at home,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
you're actually feeling the hand-laid bricks

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and shimmying up and down narrow cracks

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and getting wet and muddy

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park.
