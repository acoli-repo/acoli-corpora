When I was going out a lot to these places,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
because I was in a solitary phase in my life,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and I decided to title my series "Naked City Spleen,"

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
which references Charles Baudelaire.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
"Naked City" is a nickname for New York,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and "Spleen" embodies the melancholia and inertia

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
This is the same tunnel.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
You see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts
