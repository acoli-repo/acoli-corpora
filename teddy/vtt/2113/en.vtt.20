00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
The first tunnels date back to 60 B.C.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
They were consistently dug as limestone quarries

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and by the 18th century,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and dug new observation tunnels

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
in order to monitor and map the whole place.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
As you can see, the system is very complex and vast.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
It's very dangerous to get lost in there.
