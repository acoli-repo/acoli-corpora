Simply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
wasn't enough for me.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So I wanted to create a fictional character

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and the simplest way to do it, at the time,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
was to model myself.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I decided against clothing

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
because I wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
or time-specific elements.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I wanted a simple way to represent a living body
