This is a tunnel underneath Riverside Park.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
It was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
The murals were done by a graffiti artist

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
that got relocated from the tunnel in 1991

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
when the tunnel reopened for trains.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
There's nobody around you,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and you hear the kids playing in the park above you,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
completely unaware of what's underneath.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
When I was going out a lot to these places,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation
