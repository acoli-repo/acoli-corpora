00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:38.688

with rarefied, luminous spaghetti.”

00:02:38.688 --> 00:02:40.750
But although they can see all of time,

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.936
they don’t try to change 
the course of events.

00:02:43.936 --> 00:02:47.891
While the Trafalmadorians may be at peace 
with their lack of agency,

00:02:47.891 --> 00:02:51.825

still getting used to it.

00:02:51.825 --> 00:02:53.580

in the vastness of the universe,

00:02:57.218 --> 00:03:02.375
they find nothing but “empty heroics, 
low comedy, and pointless death.”
