Then, from their vantage point within 
a “chrono-synclastic infundibulum,”

00:03:07.388 --> 00:03:12.120
a man and his dog see devastating 
futures for their earthly counterparts,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.323
but can’t change the course of events.

00:03:15.323 --> 00:03:18.831
Though there aren’t easy answers 
available, they eventually conclude

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:23.931
that the purpose of life is “to love
whoever is around to be loved.”

00:03:23.931 --> 00:03:28.405

turn to a different source of meaning:

00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:29.669
Bokonism,

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:35.546
a religion based on harmless lies 
that all its adherents recognize as lies.
