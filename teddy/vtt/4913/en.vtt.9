His fictional alter ego, Kilgore Trout, 
supplied this parable:

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:34.782
two yeast sat “discussing the
possible purposes of life

00:04:34.782 --> 00:04:39.416
as they ate sugar and suffocated 
in their own excrement.

00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:41.359
Because of their limited intelligence,

00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:46.667
they never came close to guessing 
that they were making champagne.”

00:04:46.667 --> 00:04:49.756
In spite of his insistence that we’re
all here to fart around,

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:53.428
in spite of his deep concerns about 
the course of human existence,

00:04:53.428 --> 00:04:57.464
Vonnegut also advanced the possibility, 
however slim,

00:04:57.464 --> 00:05:00.652
that we might end up 
making something good.
