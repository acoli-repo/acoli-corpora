He found the tidy, satisfying arcs of 
many stories at odds with this reality,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.389
and he set out to explore the ambiguity

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.986
between good and bad fortune
in his own work.

00:02:06.986 --> 00:02:09.329
When Vonnegut ditched clear-cut fortunes,

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.707
he also abandoned
straightforward chronology.

00:02:12.707 --> 00:02:16.610
Instead of proceeding tidily from 
beginning to end, in his stories

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.019
“All moments, past, present and future 
always have existed, always will exist.”

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.833
Tralfamadorians, the aliens who crop up
in many of his books,

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:30.474
see all moments at once.
