00:01:00.382 --> 00:01:03.343
When he and the other prisoners
finally emerged,

they found Dresden utterly demolished.

00:01:07.038 --> 00:01:10.693
After the war, Vonnegut tried to 
make sense of human behavior

00:01:10.693 --> 00:01:14.055
by studying an unusual 
aspect of anthropology:

00:01:14.055 --> 00:01:15.823

which he insisted were just as interesting
as the shapes of pots or spearheads.

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:24.340

character’s fortune

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.254
from the beginning to the end of a story.

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:32.345
The zany curves he generated revealed 
common types of fairy tales and myths
