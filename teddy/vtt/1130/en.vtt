00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I call myself a body architect.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I trained in classical ballet

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and have a background in architecture and fashion.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
As a body architect, I fascinate with the human body

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and explore how I can transform it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I worked at Philips Electronics

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in the far-future design research lab,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
looking 20 years into the future.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I explored the human skin, and how technology can transform the body.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I worked on concepts like an electronic tattoo,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
which is augmented by touch,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
or dresses that blushed and shivered with light.
