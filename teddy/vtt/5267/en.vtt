00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:09.560
How much would you pay 
for a bouquet of tulips?

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.292
A few dollars? A hundred dollars?

00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:14.821
How about a million dollars?

00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:16.142
Probably not.

00:00:16.142 --> 00:00:19.002
Well, how much would you 
pay for this house,

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:23.244
or partial ownership of a website
that sells pet supplies?

00:00:23.244 --> 00:00:25.072
At different points in time,

00:00:25.072 --> 00:00:28.925
tulips, real estate and stock in pets.com

00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:32.877
have all sold for much more 
than they were worth.
