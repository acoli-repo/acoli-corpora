Maybe all of reality,
even its abstract concepts,

00:01:31.994 --> 00:01:36.434
like time, shape, color
and number are false,

00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:38.288
all just deceptions concocted

00:01:38.312 --> 00:01:40.267
by an evil genius!

00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:41.957
No, seriously.

00:01:41.981 --> 00:01:46.870
Descartes asks if you can disprove
the idea that an evil genius demon

00:01:46.894 --> 00:01:49.721
has tricked you into
believing reality is real.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.969
Perhaps this diabolical
deceiver has duped you.

00:01:53.993 --> 00:01:56.769
The world, your perceptions
of it, your very body.

00:01:56.793 --> 00:01:59.696
You can't disprove
that they're all just made up,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.820
and how could you exist without them?
