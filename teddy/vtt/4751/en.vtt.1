All his knowledge had come
from his sensory perceptions of the world.

00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:33.645
Same as you, right?

00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:37.400
You know you're watching this video
with your eyes, hearing it with your ears.

00:00:37.424 --> 00:00:40.275
Your senses show you the world as it is.

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:43.165
They aren't deceiving you,
but sometimes they do.

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:46.032
You might mistake a person
far away for someone else,

00:00:46.056 --> 00:00:48.449
or you're sure you're about
to catch a flyball,

00:00:48.473 --> 00:00:50.649
and it hits the ground in front of you.

00:00:50.673 --> 00:00:52.501
But come on, right here and now,

00:00:52.525 --> 00:00:54.766
you know what's right
in front of you is real.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.364
Your eyes, your hands,
your body: that's you.

00:00:57.388 --> 00:01:00.837
Only crazy people would deny that,
and you know you're not crazy.
