You can't be nothing
if you think you're something,

00:02:31.773 --> 00:02:34.171
even if you think
that something is nothing

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:37.590
because no matter what you think,
you're a thinking thing,

00:02:37.614 --> 00:02:42.305
or as Descartes put it,
"I think, therefore I am,"

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.781
and so are you, really.
