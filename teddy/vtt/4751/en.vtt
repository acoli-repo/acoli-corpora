00:00:07.693 --> 00:00:10.063
How do you know you're real?

00:00:10.087 --> 00:00:12.932
It's an obvious question
until you try to answer it,

00:00:12.956 --> 00:00:14.661
but let's take it seriously.

00:00:14.685 --> 00:00:17.135
How do you really know you exist?

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:19.849
In his "Meditations on First Philosophy,"

00:00:19.873 --> 00:00:23.018
RenÃ© Descartes tried to answer
that very question,

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:26.148
demolishing all his preconceived
notions and opinions

00:00:26.172 --> 00:00:28.963
to begin again from the foundations.

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:32.272
All his knowledge had come
from his sensory perceptions of the world.
