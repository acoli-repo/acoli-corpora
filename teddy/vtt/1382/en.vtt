00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We're 25, 26 years after

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
the advent of the Macintosh,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which was an astoundingly seminal event

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in the history

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of human-machine interface

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and in computation in general.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It fundamentally changed the way

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that people thought about computation,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
thought about computers,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It was such a radical change, in fact,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that the early Macintosh development team

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
in '82, '83, '84

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now, this is an interesting little message,
