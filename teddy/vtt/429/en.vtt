Why are transgender people
suddenly everywhere?

00:00:03.313 --> 00:00:05.456
(Laughter)

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.311
As a trans activist,
I get this question a lot.

00:00:08.653 --> 00:00:11.203
Keep in mind, less than one percent
of American adults

00:00:11.227 --> 00:00:12.949
openly identify as trans.

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:17.166
According to a recent GLAAD survey,
about 16 percent of non-trans Americans

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.523
claim to know a trans person in real life.

00:00:19.547 --> 00:00:22.997
So for the other 84 percent,
this may seem like a new topic.

00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:25.219
But trans people are not new.

00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:28.306
Gender variance is older than you think,

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.457
and trans people are part of that legacy.
