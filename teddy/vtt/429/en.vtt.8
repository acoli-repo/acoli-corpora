it had devastating implications
for trans research around the world.

00:04:03.214 --> 00:04:06.221
This was a deliberate attempt
to erase trans people,

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:08.340
and it was neither the first nor the last.

00:04:10.006 --> 00:04:13.284
So whenever people ask me
why trans people are suddenly everywhere,

00:04:13.308 --> 00:04:15.514
I just want to tell them
that we've been here.

00:04:15.538 --> 00:04:16.999
These stories have to be told,

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:19.929
along with the countless others
that have been buried by time.

00:04:19.953 --> 00:04:23.661
Not only were our lives not celebrated,
but our struggles have been forgotten

00:04:23.685 --> 00:04:26.827
and, yeah, to some people,
that makes trans issues seem new.

00:04:26.851 --> 00:04:29.610
Today, I meet a lot of people
who think that our movement

00:04:29.634 --> 00:04:31.835
is just a phase that will pass,
