00:01:29.277 --> 00:01:32.459
Around 1895, a group
of self-described androgynes

00:01:32.483 --> 00:01:34.372
formed the Cercle Hermaphroditos.

00:01:34.755 --> 00:01:39.232
Their mission was to unite for defense
against the world's bitter persecution.

00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:43.042
And in doing that, they became
one of the earliest trans support groups.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:46.844
By the '40s and '50s, medical researchers
were starting to study trans medicine,

00:01:46.868 --> 00:01:48.995
but they were aided
by their trans patients,

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:52.424
like Louise Lawrence, a trans woman
who had corresponded extensively

00:01:52.448 --> 00:01:55.653
with people who had been arrested
for public cross-dressing.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.083
She introduced sexual researchers
like Alfred Kinsey

00:01:59.107 --> 00:02:00.748
to a massive trans network.
