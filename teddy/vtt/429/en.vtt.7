00:03:26.914 --> 00:03:30.207
But what's rarely mentioned
is that included in this massive pile

00:03:30.231 --> 00:03:33.089
are works from the Institute
for Sexual Research.

00:03:33.113 --> 00:03:36.383
See, I just recapped
the trans movement in America,

00:03:36.407 --> 00:03:38.582
but Magnus Hirschfeld
and his peers in Germany

00:03:38.606 --> 00:03:40.517
had us beat by a few decades.

00:03:41.422 --> 00:03:45.199
Magnus Hirschfeld was
an early advocate for LGBT people.

00:03:45.223 --> 00:03:48.090
He wrote the first book-length account
of trans individuals.

00:03:48.114 --> 00:03:50.984
He helped them obtain
medical services and IDs.

00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:53.069
He worked with
the Berlin Police Department

00:03:53.093 --> 00:03:54.913
to end discrimination of LGBT people,

00:03:54.937 --> 00:03:56.848
and he hired them at the Institute.

00:03:56.872 --> 00:03:58.899
So when the Nazi Party burned his library,

00:03:58.923 --> 00:04:02.215
it had devastating implications
for trans research around the world.
