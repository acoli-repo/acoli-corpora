00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.457
and trans people are part of that legacy.

00:00:31.794 --> 00:00:35.778
From central Africa to South America
to the Pacific Islands and beyond,

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:38.793
there have been populations
who recognize multiple genders,

00:00:38.817 --> 00:00:40.690
and they go way back.

00:00:40.714 --> 00:00:42.912
The hijra of India
and Pakistan, for example,

00:00:42.936 --> 00:00:46.313
have been cited as far back
as 2,000 years ago in the Kama Sutra.

00:00:46.983 --> 00:00:49.516
Indigenous American nations
each have their own terms,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.714
but most share
the umbrella term "two-spirit."

00:00:52.722 --> 00:00:54.223
They saw gender-variant people

00:00:54.247 --> 00:00:56.617
as shamans and healers
in their communities,

00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:59.662
and it wasn't until
the spread of colonialism

00:00:59.686 --> 00:01:01.773
that they were taught to think otherwise.
