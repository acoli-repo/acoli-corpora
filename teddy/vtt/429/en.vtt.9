00:04:29.634 --> 00:04:31.835
is just a phase that will pass,

00:04:31.859 --> 00:04:35.407
but I also hear well-intentioned allies
telling us all to be patient,

00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:37.295
because our movement is "still new."

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:40.769
Imagine how the conversation would shift

00:04:40.793 --> 00:04:44.467
if we acknowledge just how long
trans people have been demanding equality.

00:04:45.605 --> 00:04:47.213
Are we still overreacting?

00:04:48.197 --> 00:04:49.507
Should we continue to wait?

00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:52.116
Or should we, for example,

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.042
do something about the trans women
of color who are murdered

00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:56.941
and whose killers never see justice?

00:04:58.178 --> 00:05:00.305
Do our circumstances seem dire to you yet?
