00:04:58.178 --> 00:05:00.305
Do our circumstances seem dire to you yet?

00:05:00.992 --> 00:05:01.702
(Sighs)

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.463
Finally, I want other trans people
to realize they're not alone.

00:05:07.535 --> 00:05:11.201
I grew up thinking my identity
was an anomaly that would die with me.

00:05:11.934 --> 00:05:14.409
People drilled this idea
of otherness into my mind,

00:05:14.433 --> 00:05:17.241
and I bought it because I didn't know
anyone else like me.

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:20.759
Maybe if I had known my ancestors sooner,

00:05:20.783 --> 00:05:23.564
it wouldn't have taken me so long
to find a source of pride

00:05:23.588 --> 00:05:25.951
in my identity and in my community.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.665
Because I belong to an amazing,
vibrant community of people
