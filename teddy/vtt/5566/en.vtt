00:00:07.052 --> 00:00:11.642
With every year, machines surpass humans
in more and more activities

00:00:11.642 --> 00:00:14.848
we once thought only we were capable of.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:18.423
Today's computers can beat us
in complex board games,

00:00:18.423 --> 00:00:21.294
transcribe speech in dozens of languages,

00:00:21.294 --> 00:00:24.746
and instantly identify almost any object.

00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:27.112
But the robots of tomorrow may go futher

00:00:27.112 --> 00:00:30.243
by learning to figure out 
what we're feeling.
