[SHAPE YOUR FUTURE]

00:00:05.516 --> 00:00:06.756
A decade ago,

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:10.916
after a peaceful revolution toppled
the longtime Tunisian dictator Ben Ali,

00:00:10.956 --> 00:00:14.196
I was sitting in an orange grove
outside of Athens, Greece.

00:00:14.236 --> 00:00:16.436
Undocumented migrants were hiding there.

00:00:16.476 --> 00:00:17.636
I came to interview them

00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:21.316
about human rights abuses
they had suffered while entering Europe.

00:00:21.356 --> 00:00:25.116
One of them, a Tunisian fellow
in a leather jacket, explained.

00:00:25.156 --> 00:00:27.116
The people who overthrew Ben Ali,

00:00:27.156 --> 00:00:29.476
they want democracy and a dignified life.

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:33.396
“We, who have crossed the Mediterranean,
want democracy and a dignified life.”
