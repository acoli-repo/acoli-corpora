00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm here today, as June said,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
to talk about a project

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We're crocheting a coral reef.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And it's a project that we've actually

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
been now joined by hundreds of people around the world,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
who are doing it with us. Indeed thousands of people

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
have actually been involved in this project,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in many of its different aspects.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's a project that now reaches across three continents,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and its roots go into the fields of mathematics,
