00:00:01.436 --> 00:00:04.156
Canada's great northern forests,

00:00:04.156 --> 00:00:06.156
they're the place of my heart.

00:00:07.796 --> 00:00:11.276
They hold 25 percent
of the Earth's wetlands.

00:00:12.156 --> 00:00:14.276
And they're the nesting
and breeding ground

00:00:14.276 --> 00:00:16.956
of the majority
of North America's songbirds.

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:22.556
They're the traditional territories
of hundreds of Indigenous nations.

00:00:22.596 --> 00:00:28.356
And my climate journey started here
as a forest activist a long time ago.

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:33.476
I was horrified that Canada's
old-growth forests are being logged.
