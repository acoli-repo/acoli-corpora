The two-thirds of minimum-wage workers
who are women have heard it.

00:12:32.583 --> 00:12:35.643
Workers who don't identify
as male or female

00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:37.309
and hide their identity at work

00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:38.601
have heard it.

00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:41.518
If they can hear,
"You can be anything you want now,

00:12:41.542 --> 00:12:43.059
it's up to you,"

00:12:43.083 --> 00:12:46.083
I believe it's time
for our businesses to hear it, too.

00:12:47.417 --> 00:12:51.768
Eliminating workplace bias
is a tall order.

00:12:51.792 --> 00:12:55.684
But we can't afford
to let half our people go on

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:57.125
being ignored.

00:12:58.333 --> 00:13:01.893
We've given businesses
a framework for real change.
