Opportunities for women
have increased over the last 50 years.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.309
But over the last decade,
progress has stalled.

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:44.018
Experts have previously identified 2059

00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:46.768
as the year the wage gap would close.

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:48.643
But in September of this year,

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:52.268
these same experts announced
that according to the most current data,

00:02:52.292 --> 00:02:55.684
we'll have to adjust our expectations

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:58.309
to the year 2119.

00:02:58.333 --> 00:02:59.601
(Audience murmurs)

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:03.101
One hundred one years from now.
