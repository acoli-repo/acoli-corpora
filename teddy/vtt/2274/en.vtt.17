while others just do
a good job of advertising.

00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:34.893
We wanted to find out
who is actually getting it right.

00:08:34.917 --> 00:08:37.726
So we put a poll on Facebook,

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.768
we asked women in workshops

00:08:39.792 --> 00:08:43.893
how they were choosing employers
where they would be valued.

00:08:43.917 --> 00:08:46.476
The most common response that we heard?

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.226
"I Google it."

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.268
So we googled it.

00:08:50.292 --> 00:08:51.643
(Laughter)

00:08:51.667 --> 00:08:56.268
Specifically, we googled
"best employers for women in tech."

00:08:56.292 --> 00:09:01.018
Our results showed
three completely different lists.
