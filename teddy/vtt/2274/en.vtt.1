00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:30.875
But in this team, there were two men
we'll call Howard and Tom.

00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.893
Howard just would not get back to me.

00:00:34.917 --> 00:00:36.768
I emailed him about the proposal,

00:00:36.792 --> 00:00:38.643
I left him voice mails,

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:41.184
I'd roll my chair back and forth
during meetings,

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:43.066
trying to make eye contact with Howard.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.101
(Laughter)

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:47.458
He'd just take out his phone
and start scrolling.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.976
And then I started to question myself.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.601
Had I been diplomatic enough
in that email?

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:57.684
Too demanding in that voice mail?

00:00:57.708 --> 00:01:00.351
Does Howard hate this proposal
