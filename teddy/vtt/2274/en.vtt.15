00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.101
but not job-related skills,

00:07:34.125 --> 00:07:39.667
appeared in 71 of the 94
yearly reviews received by women.

00:07:40.417 --> 00:07:43.226
Of the 83 reviews received by men,

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.417
personality criticism showed up twice.

00:07:47.708 --> 00:07:53.184
But in businesses that conduct
much shorter, highly frequent reviews,

00:07:53.208 --> 00:07:55.643
say, five-minute weekly evaluations

00:07:55.667 --> 00:07:57.893
focused on specific projects,

00:07:57.917 --> 00:08:01.601
the personality criticism vanishes.
