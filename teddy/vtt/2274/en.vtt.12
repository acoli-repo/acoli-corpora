00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:02.726
we need to take a step beyond Me Too.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.101
Beyond just being tolerated as women.

00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:10.309
Our organization decided
to tackle the problem in two ways.

00:06:10.333 --> 00:06:12.434
First, if we're all biased,

00:06:12.458 --> 00:06:17.309
our workplaces need to be
actively antibiased by design,

00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:21.226
not by trying to change mindsets
one training at a time.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.934
So our team began by identifying
over 100 cultural levers

00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:30.101
that can be adjusted
to counter the impact of bias.
