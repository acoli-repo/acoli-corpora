00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:02.976
Because I knew somehow that I was a guest

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.375
in a place that wasn't meant for me.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:09.226
And so instead of questioning
my environment,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.167
I questioned myself.

00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:14.101
I wanted to know

00:02:14.125 --> 00:02:17.476
how so many talented women
who worked long hours

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.893
and started their careers with confidence

00:02:19.917 --> 00:02:24.268
all became trained in this kind
of self-doubt that makes them say,

00:02:24.292 --> 00:02:26.125
"It's probably just me."

00:02:27.083 --> 00:02:29.018
How was that still possible?

00:02:29.042 --> 00:02:31.476
Aren't things getting better?
