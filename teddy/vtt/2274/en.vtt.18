00:08:56.292 --> 00:09:01.018
Our results showed
three completely different lists.

00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:03.893
One business shows up
as the top employer on one list,

00:09:03.917 --> 00:09:06.059
doesn't show up at all on another,

00:09:06.083 --> 00:09:08.518
some lists offer no criteria

00:09:08.542 --> 00:09:10.768
and some are purchased ads.

00:09:10.792 --> 00:09:12.042
They're paid for.

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:17.559
Employees and employers
both want clear benchmarks

00:09:17.583 --> 00:09:20.458
that go beyond good intentions.

00:09:21.542 --> 00:09:25.018
The LEED certification
gave businesses this clarity

00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:26.851
around environmental stewardship

00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:31.643
by outlining the exact steps
they need to take for certification.
