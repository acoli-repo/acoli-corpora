00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.351
To create this standard,

00:10:03.375 --> 00:10:06.976
we had to learn what matters
and what doesn't.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.476
We found out that what matters

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.309
is not the total percentage

00:10:12.333 --> 00:10:14.601
Or the number of board members
that are female.

Those are what we call vanity metrics.

00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:18.976
They can be bought,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.601
while the culture inside
can still be out of balance.

00:10:23.625 --> 00:10:26.726

are under the surface.

00:10:29.083 --> 00:10:30.476
For example,
