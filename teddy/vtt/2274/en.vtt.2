00:00:57.708 --> 00:01:00.351
Does Howard hate this proposal

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:02.934
or am I just overreacting?

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:06.143
It's probably just me, I thought.

00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:07.559
And then one day,

00:01:07.583 --> 00:01:11.518
I'm walking down the hall
and here comes Howard.

00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:13.351
He's holding a packet of papers,

00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:15.684
sees me and lights up.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:16.976
He says,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.018
"Sara, Tom just emailed this to me,
you should take a look.

00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:23.143
It's a proposal for us
to recruit more women."

00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:24.434
(Laughter)

00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:26.601
"I think Tom has a really great idea here,

00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:28.542
and we should all get behind it."
