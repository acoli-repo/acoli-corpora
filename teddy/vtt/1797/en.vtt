00:00:00.872 --> 00:00:02.416
I'd like to start, if I may,

00:00:02.416 --> 00:00:05.140
with the story of the Paisley snail.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.355
On the evening of the 26th of August, 1928,

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:10.729
May Donoghue took a train from Glasgow

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:13.260
to the town of Paisley, seven miles east of the city,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.573
and there at the Wellmeadow CafÃ©,

00:00:15.573 --> 00:00:18.699
she had a Scots ice cream float,

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.546
a mix of ice cream and ginger beer

00:00:20.546 --> 00:00:22.501
bought for her by a friend.

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:24.902
The ginger beer came in a brown, opaque bottle

00:00:24.902 --> 00:00:28.765
labeled "D. Stevenson, Glen Lane, Paisley."

00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:30.841
She drank some of the ice cream float,
