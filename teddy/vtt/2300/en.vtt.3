00:01:29.893 --> 00:01:31.044
And when I was 10,

00:01:31.068 --> 00:01:33.901
I was told that my parents left
because they didn't want me.

00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:35.886
When I was 11, I wanted to be left alone.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.259
When I was 12, I wanted to die.
When I was 13, I wanted to kill a kid.

00:01:39.283 --> 00:01:42.696
When I was 14, I was asked
to seriously consider a career path.

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:45.021
I said, "I'd like to be a writer."

00:01:45.783 --> 00:01:48.044
And they said,
"Choose something realistic."

00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:50.873
So I said, "Professional wrestler."

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:53.793
And they said, "Don't be stupid."

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.175
See, they asked me what I wanted to be,

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:58.937
then told me what not to be.

00:01:59.563 --> 00:02:01.135
And I wasn't the only one.
