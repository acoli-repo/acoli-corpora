00:02:57.288 --> 00:03:01.040
(Applause)

00:03:01.064 --> 00:03:05.812
And then this guy,
Duke "The Dumpster" Droese,

00:03:05.836 --> 00:03:07.556
stole my entire shtick.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.147
(Laughter)

00:03:09.171 --> 00:03:11.273
I was crushed,

00:03:11.297 --> 00:03:13.122
as if by a trash compactor.

00:03:13.146 --> 00:03:15.361
(Laughter)

00:03:15.668 --> 00:03:18.192
I thought to myself,
"What now? Where do I turn?"

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.652
Poetry.

00:03:20.676 --> 00:03:22.054
(Laughter)

00:03:22.078 --> 00:03:25.056
Like a boomerang,
the thing I loved came back to me.

00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:28.239
One of the first lines of poetry
I can remember writing

00:03:28.263 --> 00:03:30.883
was in response to a world
that demanded I hate myself.
