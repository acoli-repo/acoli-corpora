started therapy in eighth grade,

00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:04.745
had a personality
made up of tests and pills,

00:08:04.769 --> 00:08:08.537
lived like the uphills were mountains
and the downhills were cliffs,

00:08:08.561 --> 00:08:11.945

a tidal wave of antidepressants,

00:08:11.969 --> 00:08:14.855
and an adolescent being called "Popper,"

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:16.951
one part because of the pills,

00:08:16.975 --> 00:08:19.055

go home to Mom and Dad

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.720
had the audacity to tell him,
"Get over it."

00:08:28.323 --> 00:08:30.768
As if depression is something
that could be remedied
