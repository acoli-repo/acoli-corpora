00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.955
that we'd be lonely forever,

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.691
that we'd never meet someone
to make us feel like the sun

00:06:34.715 --> 00:06:37.073
was something they built
for us in their toolshed.

00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:38.922
So broken heartstrings bled the blues,

00:06:38.946 --> 00:06:41.456
and we tried to empty ourselves
so we'd feel nothing.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.835

00:06:43.859 --> 00:06:46.492

00:06:46.516 --> 00:06:49.139

when she got called ugly.

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:56.089
We both got moved to the back of class

00:06:56.113 --> 00:06:59.071
so we would stop
getting bombarded by spitballs.

00:06:59.095 --> 00:07:01.066
But the school halls were a battleground.
