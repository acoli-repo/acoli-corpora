00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.085
I knew I didn't have to hold up
my paper of 28 out of 30,

00:04:32.109 --> 00:04:35.117
but my satisfaction was complete
when he looked at me, puzzled,

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:38.599
and I thought to myself, "Smarter
than the average bear, motherfucker."

00:04:38.623 --> 00:04:40.405
(Laughter)

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:46.659
(Applause)

00:04:46.683 --> 00:04:48.472
This is who I am.

00:04:49.585 --> 00:04:51.943
This is how I stand up for myself.

00:04:53.283 --> 00:04:55.533
When I was a kid,

00:04:55.557 --> 00:04:59.469
I used to think that pork chops
and karate chops were the same thing.
