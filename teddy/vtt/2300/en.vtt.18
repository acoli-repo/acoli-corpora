The classics were
"Hey, stupid," "Hey, spaz."

00:09:05.809 --> 00:09:08.565
Seems like every school
has an arsenal of names

00:09:08.589 --> 00:09:10.203
getting updated every year.

00:09:10.787 --> 00:09:13.930
And if a kid breaks in a school
and no one around chooses to hear,

00:09:13.954 --> 00:09:15.304
do they make a sound?

00:09:15.328 --> 00:09:18.469
Are they just background noise
from a soundtrack stuck on repeat,

00:09:18.493 --> 00:09:21.709
when people say things like,
"Kids can be cruel."

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:25.753
Every school was a big top circus tent,

00:09:25.777 --> 00:09:28.592
and the pecking order
went from acrobats to lion tamers,

00:09:28.616 --> 00:09:31.965
from clowns to carnies,
all of these miles ahead of who we were.
