As if depression is something
that could be remedied

00:08:30.792 --> 00:08:33.434
by any of the contents
found in a first-aid kit.

00:08:33.458 --> 00:08:37.034
To this day, he is a stick of TNT
lit from both ends,

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:39.561
could describe to you in detail
the way the sky bends

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:41.514
in the moment before it's about to fall,

00:08:41.538 --> 00:08:44.506
and despite an army of friends
who all call him an inspiration,

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.827
he remains a conversation piece
between people who can't understand

00:08:47.851 --> 00:08:50.856
sometimes being drug-free
has less to do with addiction

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.082
and more to do with sanity.

00:08:53.965 --> 00:08:56.424
We weren't the only kids
who grew up this way.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.801
To this day, kids are still
being called names.
