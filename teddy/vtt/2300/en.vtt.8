00:03:59.493 --> 00:04:01.119
and in most cases, not at all.

00:04:01.143 --> 00:04:04.253
I gave myself a hall pass
to get through each broken promise.

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:06.604
And I remember this plan,
born out of frustration

00:04:06.628 --> 00:04:08.823
from a kid who kept calling me "Yogi,"

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:11.849

"Too many picnic baskets."

00:04:12.588 --> 00:04:15.010
Turns out it's not that hard
to trick someone,

00:04:15.034 --> 00:04:16.606

and I gave him all the wrong answers
that I'd written down the night before.

00:04:22.674 --> 00:04:25.180
He got his paper back
expecting a near-perfect score,

00:04:25.204 --> 00:04:29.015
and couldn't believe it when he looked
across the room at me and held up a zero.

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.085
I knew I didn't have to hold up
my paper of 28 out of 30,
