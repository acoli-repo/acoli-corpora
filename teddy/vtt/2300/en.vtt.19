00:09:28.616 --> 00:09:31.965
from clowns to carnies,
all of these miles ahead of who we were.

00:09:31.989 --> 00:09:33.411
We were freaks --

00:09:33.435 --> 00:09:36.032
lobster-claw boys and bearded ladies,

00:09:36.056 --> 00:09:38.142
oddities juggling
depression and loneliness,

00:09:38.166 --> 00:09:39.895
playing solitaire, spin the bottle,

00:09:39.919 --> 00:09:42.539
trying to kiss the wounded
parts of ourselves and heal,

00:09:42.563 --> 00:09:45.160
but at night, while the others slept,

00:09:45.184 --> 00:09:46.866
we kept walking the tightrope.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:50.064
It was practice, and yes, some of us fell.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.641
But I want to tell them that all of this

00:09:54.665 --> 00:09:56.680
is just debris

00:09:56.704 --> 00:10:01.408
left over when we finally decide to smash
all the things we thought we used to be,
