I get altitude sickness
just from standing up for myself.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.956
But that's what we were told.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.882
"Stand up for yourself."

00:00:35.648 --> 00:00:38.612
And that's hard to do
if you don't know who you are.

00:00:38.636 --> 00:00:42.376
We were expected to define ourselves
at such an early age,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.138
and if we didn't do it,
others did it for us.

00:00:45.718 --> 00:00:47.203
Geek. Fatty.

00:00:47.227 --> 00:00:48.972
Slut. Fag.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.627
And at the same time we were
being told what we were,

00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:54.976
we were being asked,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.508
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

00:00:57.953 --> 00:01:00.055
I always thought
that was an unfair question.
