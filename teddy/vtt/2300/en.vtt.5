00:02:29.258 --> 00:02:31.544
They're standing alone
at the high school dance,

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.020
and they've never been kissed.

00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:36.370
See, my dreams got called names too.

00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:39.054
Silly. Foolish.

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:40.770
Impossible.

00:02:40.794 --> 00:02:42.057
But I kept dreaming.

00:02:42.542 --> 00:02:45.140
I was going to be a wrestler.
I had it all figured out.

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:46.784
I was going to be The Garbage Man.

00:02:46.808 --> 00:02:47.809
(Laughter)

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:51.262
My finishing move was going
to be The Trash Compactor.

00:02:51.286 --> 00:02:54.404
My saying was going to be,
"I'm taking out the trash!"

00:02:54.428 --> 00:02:57.264
(Laughter)

00:02:57.288 --> 00:03:01.040
(Applause)
