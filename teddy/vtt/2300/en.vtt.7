00:03:28.263 --> 00:03:30.883
was in response to a world
that demanded I hate myself.

00:03:30.907 --> 00:03:33.303
From age 15 to 18, I hated myself

00:03:33.327 --> 00:03:36.127
for becoming the thing that I loathed:

00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:37.324
a bully.

00:03:37.728 --> 00:03:40.492
When I was 19, I wrote,

00:03:40.516 --> 00:03:43.041
"I will love myself
despite the ease with which

00:03:43.065 --> 00:03:44.889
I lean toward the opposite."

00:03:46.183 --> 00:03:49.389
Standing up for yourself
doesn't have to mean

00:03:49.413 --> 00:03:51.016
embracing violence.

00:03:51.862 --> 00:03:53.715
When I was a kid,

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.446
I traded in homework
assignments for friendship,

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.469
then gave each friend a late slip
for never showing up on time,

00:03:59.493 --> 00:04:01.119
and in most cases, not at all.
