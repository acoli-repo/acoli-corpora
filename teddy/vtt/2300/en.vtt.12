News of this silly little story
quickly spread through the school,

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:04.008
and I earned my first nickname:

00:06:04.841 --> 00:06:05.995
Porkchop.

00:06:06.896 --> 00:06:09.255
To this day,

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:11.181
I hate pork chops.

00:06:13.156 --> 00:06:16.180
I'm not the only kid who grew up this way,

00:06:16.204 --> 00:06:18.902
surrounded by people
who used to say that rhyme

00:06:18.926 --> 00:06:21.338
about sticks and stones,

00:06:21.362 --> 00:06:24.106
as if broken bones hurt more
than the names we got called,

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.617
and we got called them all.

00:06:26.066 --> 00:06:29.626
So we grew up believing
no one would ever fall in love with us,

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.955
that we'd be lonely forever,
