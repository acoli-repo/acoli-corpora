There's so many of you.

00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:09.433
(Laughter)

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:15.272
When I was a kid,

00:00:15.296 --> 00:00:17.780
I hid my heart under the bed,
because my mother said,

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:20.669
"If you're not careful,
someday someone's going to break it."

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:24.478
Take it from me: Under the bed
is not a good hiding spot.

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:27.433
I know because I've been
shot down so many times,

00:00:27.457 --> 00:00:30.364
I get altitude sickness
just from standing up for myself.
