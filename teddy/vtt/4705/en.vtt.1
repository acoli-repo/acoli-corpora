00:00:29.018 --> 00:00:31.057
Space isn't out to get me personally.

00:00:31.057 --> 00:00:33.993
It's also trying to kill you and everybody else.

00:00:33.993 --> 00:00:35.022
Think about it.

00:00:35.022 --> 00:00:37.941
Space doesn't naturally have what we need to survive

00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:39.235
when we travel there:

00:00:39.235 --> 00:00:40.273
no air,

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:41.421
it's too hot

00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:42.467
or too cold,

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:46.325
no ozone to protect us from those nasty UV rays, either.

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:47.529
This all sounds bad,

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:49.191
but what can space really do to me

00:00:49.191 --> 00:00:50.890
if I stay on Earth?

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.373
What we need to understand is that objects in space

00:00:53.373 --> 00:00:55.503
can cause people to think their days are numbered,

00:00:55.503 --> 00:00:57.709
even when there are events on Earth

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:59.386
that can hurt or kill us

00:00:59.386 --> 00:01:01.799
before something from space does.
