So, you still think space objects are trying to kill you

00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:02.612
even after what I've told you so far?

00:03:02.612 --> 00:03:04.290
I think I've even convinced myself

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.827
that odds are really good

00:03:05.827 --> 00:03:07.550
that space and the objects up there

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.674
won't kill me after all.

00:03:09.674 --> 00:03:11.936
But I'll probably keep looking up

00:03:11.936 --> 00:03:14.665
just to make sure nothing is headed my way.
