00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:02.895
to make energy for another 3 to 5 billion years.

00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:05.064
So, in 3 to 5 billion years,

00:02:05.064 --> 00:02:06.565
if people still exist on Earth,

00:02:06.565 --> 00:02:08.401
they'll have to deal with that.

00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:10.361
But today, well, we're safe.

00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:12.779
Sometimes the sun does shoot flares at Earth,

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.198
but the magnetic fields surrounding our planet

00:02:15.198 --> 00:02:17.245
blocks most of that radiation.

00:02:17.245 --> 00:02:18.988
The radiation that does get through

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:21.538
creates things like the Aurora Borealis.

00:02:21.538 --> 00:02:24.093
Gigantic solar flares can mess with our satellites

00:02:24.093 --> 00:02:25.553
and electrical equipment,

00:02:25.553 --> 00:02:28.842
but the chances of it killing you are pretty slim.

00:02:28.842 --> 00:02:31.763
Okay, what about that supermassive black hole
