There are still lots of things about space

00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:18.381
that we may never be able to answer,

00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:20.658
like is time travel possible?

00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:23.755
Or are aliens living somewhere else in the Milky Way?

00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:26.885
But there is one thing I believe about space:

00:00:26.885 --> 00:00:29.018
Space is trying to kill me.

00:00:29.018 --> 00:00:31.057
Space isn't out to get me personally.
