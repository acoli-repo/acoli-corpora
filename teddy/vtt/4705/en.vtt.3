00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:30.570
and see them coming using complex computer models

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.842
to predict the deadly rock's path.

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:34.819
For a while, the reported odds

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:38.607
that asteroid Apophis would strike Earth in 2036

00:01:38.607 --> 00:01:40.846
were once 1 in 625.

00:01:40.846 --> 00:01:42.751
But, after updating their data,

00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:46.130
astronomers now say the chances are extremely low.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.175
Okay, what about the sun?

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:50.635
Hollywood movies like to pick on our sun

00:01:50.635 --> 00:01:53.469
by showing Earth destroyed by solar flares

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:54.883
or the sun dying out,

00:01:54.883 --> 00:01:56.844
which would cause Earth to freeze.

00:01:56.844 --> 00:01:59.349
Astronomers predict our sun contains enough gas

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:02.895
to make energy for another 3 to 5 billion years.
