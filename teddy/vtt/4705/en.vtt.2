00:00:59.386 --> 00:01:01.799
before something from space does.

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.087
So, what are the odds that one of these objects

00:01:04.087 --> 00:01:05.511
will really affect Earth

00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:06.424
and you

00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:07.374
and me

00:01:07.374 --> 00:01:08.514
in our lifetime?

00:01:08.514 --> 00:01:10.933
Well, we can take what we know about the universe

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.907
to try and figure that out.

00:01:12.907 --> 00:01:14.192
You might have heard stories

00:01:14.192 --> 00:01:16.110
about asteroids hitting the Earth.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.820
That would be pretty bad.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.136
Scientists think asteroids might have killed off

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:21.784
most of the dinosaurs.

00:01:21.784 --> 00:01:24.827
Sounds like something we should worry about, right?

00:01:24.827 --> 00:01:27.483
Well, astronomers can now watch asteroids in space

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:30.570
and see them coming using complex computer models
