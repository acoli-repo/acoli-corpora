00:02:28.842 --> 00:02:31.763
Okay, what about that supermassive black hole

00:02:31.763 --> 00:02:33.637
in the middle of our galaxy?

00:02:33.637 --> 00:02:34.713
What happens to Earth,

00:02:34.713 --> 00:02:35.544
and us,

00:02:35.544 --> 00:02:36.963
when it pulls us in?

00:02:36.963 --> 00:02:39.934
After all, it is supermassive.

00:02:39.934 --> 00:02:41.445
Nope, not going to happen.

00:02:41.445 --> 00:02:44.236
That's one big object that can't bother us.

00:02:44.236 --> 00:02:45.986
How can we be so sure?

00:02:45.986 --> 00:02:48.697
Our solar system is on the edge of the Milky Way

00:02:48.697 --> 00:02:51.103
while the nearest supermassive black hole

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:54.325
is about 26,000 light years from Earth.

00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:57.398
That means we aren't on that black hole's menu.

00:02:57.398 --> 00:03:00.255
So, you still think space objects are trying to kill you
