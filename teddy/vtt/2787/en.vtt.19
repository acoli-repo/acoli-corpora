00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:31.226
We know that there are two kinds
of looting going on:

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.936
looting by criminal elements like ISIL,

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.826
and then more local looting
by those that are desperate for money.

00:09:38.249 --> 00:09:41.491
We would all do the same
to feed our families;

00:09:41.515 --> 00:09:43.664
I don't blame the local looters.

00:09:43.688 --> 00:09:48.366
I blame the middlemen,
the unethical traffickers

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.374
and an international art market

00:09:50.398 --> 00:09:55.789
that exploits often ambiguous
or even completely nonexistent laws.

00:09:56.938 --> 00:10:01.321
We know looting is going on
on a global scale and it's increasing,
