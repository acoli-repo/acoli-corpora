However, I believe that the most
important thing we do as archaeologists

00:05:30.922 --> 00:05:34.613
is acknowledge that past people existed

00:05:34.637 --> 00:05:36.511
and lived lives worth learning about.

00:05:37.773 --> 00:05:41.335
Can you even imagine
what the world would be like today

00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:44.601
if we acknowledged all
human beings in this way?

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.836
So, on a dig, we have a challenge:

00:05:50.813 --> 00:05:52.552
it often looks like this.

00:05:52.576 --> 00:05:54.410
You can't see anything.

00:05:54.434 --> 00:05:56.183
Where are we going to start digging?

00:05:56.207 --> 00:05:57.918
This is from a site south of Cairo.

00:05:57.942 --> 00:05:59.675
Let's have a look from space.
