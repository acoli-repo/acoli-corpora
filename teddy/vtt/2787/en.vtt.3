00:01:29.037 --> 00:01:31.857
that one discovery might change history.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.125
On my first day in Egypt,
I worked at a site

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.789
in the Northeast Egyptian Delta
called Mendes, dating to 4,200 years ago,

00:01:41.813 --> 00:01:42.964
in a cemetery.

00:01:42.988 --> 00:01:44.188
That's a picture of me --

00:01:44.212 --> 00:01:45.413
I'm just in my bliss.

00:01:45.888 --> 00:01:49.901
On the dig, surrounded
by emerald green rice paddies,

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:52.413
I discovered an intact pot.

00:01:53.772 --> 00:01:55.398
Flipping it over,

00:01:55.422 --> 00:01:59.905
I discovered a human thumbprint
left by whoever made the vessel.
