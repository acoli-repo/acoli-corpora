00:07:27.323 --> 00:07:30.150
I believe we have barely
scratched the surface

00:07:30.174 --> 00:07:32.254
in terms of what's left to discover.

00:07:33.098 --> 00:07:35.096
In the Egyptian Delta alone,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.938
we've excavated less
than one-1000th of one percent

00:07:38.962 --> 00:07:41.675
of the total volume of Egyptian sites.

00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:44.654
When you add to that
the thousands of other sites

00:07:44.678 --> 00:07:46.710
my team and I have discovered,

00:07:46.734 --> 00:07:50.489
what we thought we knew
pales in comparison

00:07:50.513 --> 00:07:52.411
to what we have left to discover.

00:07:53.118 --> 00:07:54.921
When you look at the incredible work

00:07:54.945 --> 00:07:57.366
that my colleagues are doing
all around the world

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:59.197
and what they're finding,

00:07:59.221 --> 00:08:04.819
I believe that there are millions
of undiscovered archaeological sites
