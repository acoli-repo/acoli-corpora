00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:02.958
For a moment, time stood still.

00:02:04.068 --> 00:02:05.414
I didn't know where I was.

00:02:05.955 --> 00:02:08.912
It was because at that moment I realized,

00:02:08.936 --> 00:02:10.314
when we dig,

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:11.995
we're digging for people,

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.230
not things.

00:02:14.664 --> 00:02:19.615
Never are we so present as when
we are in the midst of the great past.

00:02:20.513 --> 00:02:25.331
I can't tell you how many times I've stood
in front of the Pyramids of Giza,

00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:27.620
and they leave me speechless.

00:02:27.644 --> 00:02:30.621
I feel like the luckiest
person in the world.
