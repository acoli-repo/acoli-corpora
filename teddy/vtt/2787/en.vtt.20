We know looting is going on
on a global scale and it's increasing,

00:10:01.345 --> 00:10:04.429
but presently we don't have
any tools to stop it.

00:10:05.122 --> 00:10:06.617
This is beginning to change.

00:10:07.302 --> 00:10:11.740
My team and I have just completed a study
looking at looting in Egypt.

00:10:11.764 --> 00:10:14.111
We looked at open-source data

00:10:14.135 --> 00:10:17.070
and mapped the entirety
of looting across Egypt

00:10:17.094 --> 00:10:19.637
from 2002 to 2013.

00:10:20.474 --> 00:10:25.030
We found evidence of looting
and site destruction at 267 sites,

00:10:25.054 --> 00:10:29.031
and mapped over 200,000 looting pits.

00:10:29.901 --> 00:10:31.074
It's astonishing.
