00:15:28.675 --> 00:15:30.651
we learned, completely randomly,

00:15:30.675 --> 00:15:33.121
that we were born in the same year,

00:15:33.989 --> 00:15:35.590
the same month

00:15:35.614 --> 00:15:39.254
and the same day, six hours apart.

00:15:40.618 --> 00:15:41.769
Twins.

00:15:41.793 --> 00:15:43.187
(Laughter)

00:15:44.036 --> 00:15:46.334
Separated by an ocean,
but forever connected

00:15:46.358 --> 00:15:48.431
for Ancient Egypt is our mother.

00:15:49.047 --> 00:15:51.240
I knew then we'd always work together --

00:15:51.264 --> 00:15:52.621
not in my brain,

00:15:53.517 --> 00:15:58.014
but in the part of your soul that knows
not everything can be explained.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.877
