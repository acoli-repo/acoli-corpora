As an archaeologist,

00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:05.664
I'm most often asked
what my favorite discovery is.

00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:07.786
The answer's easy:

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:10.363
my husband, Greg.

00:00:10.387 --> 00:00:11.758
(Laughter)

00:00:11.782 --> 00:00:13.544
We met in Egypt on my first dig.

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:18.672
It was my first lesson in finding
unexpected, wonderful things.

00:00:19.941 --> 00:00:23.090
This began an incredible
archaeological partnership.

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:29.585
Years later, I proposed to him
in front of our favorite pair statue

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.770
of the Prince and Princess
Rahotep and Nofret,
