00:11:59.882 --> 00:12:04.088
because it teaches us so much
about how we can survive and thrive

00:12:04.112 --> 00:12:05.327
after great disasters.

00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:10.456
Now at this site, we had already mapped
countless looting pits.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.643
Lisht is a royal site;

00:12:11.667 --> 00:12:14.341
there would have been thousands
of people buried there

00:12:14.365 --> 00:12:16.479
who lived and worked
at the court of Pharaoh.

00:12:16.503 --> 00:12:19.671
You can see this before and after;
you see dozens of looting pits.

00:12:19.695 --> 00:12:20.867
North Lisht.

00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:23.354
This is in South Lisht, before and after.

00:12:24.967 --> 00:12:26.472
When we first visited the site,

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:29.100
we could see the tombs
of many high-ranking officials

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:30.464
that had been looted.
