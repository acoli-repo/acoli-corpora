Keep your eye on the red rectangle.

00:07:01.257 --> 00:07:03.884
When we process the image
using algorithms --

00:07:03.908 --> 00:07:06.313
think like a space-based CAT scan --

00:07:07.451 --> 00:07:09.485
this is what you see.

00:07:10.074 --> 00:07:13.783
This rectilinear form is an ancient tomb

00:07:13.807 --> 00:07:16.408
that is previously unknown
and unexcavated,

00:07:16.432 --> 00:07:21.193
and you all are the first people
to see it in thousands of years.

00:07:21.842 --> 00:07:27.299
(Applause)

00:07:27.323 --> 00:07:30.150
I believe we have barely
scratched the surface
