I get to see the most
incredible architecture,

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:06.174
see stunning sculptures --

00:04:06.198 --> 00:04:09.041
I mean, this is basically
a selfie in stone --

00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:12.022
and see that we've always
rocked serious bling.

00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:16.187
And also, we've been posting on walls

00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:18.290
and obsessing about cats --

00:04:18.314 --> 00:04:19.321
(Laughter)

00:04:19.345 --> 00:04:20.858
for thousands of years.

00:04:20.882 --> 00:04:21.889
(Laughter)

00:04:21.913 --> 00:04:24.249
(Applause)

00:04:26.786 --> 00:04:30.136
