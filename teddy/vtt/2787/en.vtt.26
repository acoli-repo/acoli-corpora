00:12:58.766 --> 00:13:02.162
Of course I agreed,
but I didn't think we'd find anything.

00:13:02.186 --> 00:13:04.308
I thought the looters
had stolen everything.

00:13:04.332 --> 00:13:07.329
What we started to find
were the most incredible reliefs.

00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:09.519
Look at this painting --
it's just stunning.

00:13:09.543 --> 00:13:12.198
We started finding engraved inscriptions.

00:13:12.222 --> 00:13:14.293
And even the titles of the tomb owner --

00:13:14.317 --> 00:13:16.628
he had titles like,
"Overseer of the Army,"

00:13:16.652 --> 00:13:18.079
"Overseer of the Treasury."

00:13:18.103 --> 00:13:19.293
I began to have hope.

00:13:19.701 --> 00:13:23.304
Maybe, just maybe we would find his name.

00:13:23.328 --> 00:13:26.315
For the ancient Egyptians, having
their name last for eternity

00:13:26.339 --> 00:13:27.557
was their goal.

00:13:28.396 --> 00:13:29.969
And then one day,

00:13:29.993 --> 00:13:31.174
this appeared.
