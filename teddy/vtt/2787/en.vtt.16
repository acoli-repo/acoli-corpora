I believe that there are millions
of undiscovered archaeological sites

00:08:04.843 --> 00:08:06.003
left to find.

00:08:06.574 --> 00:08:09.189
Discovering them will do nothing less

00:08:09.213 --> 00:08:12.927
than unlock the full potential
of our existence.

00:08:14.414 --> 00:08:16.729
But we have a challenge.

00:08:17.323 --> 00:08:18.910
Over the last year,

00:08:18.934 --> 00:08:21.558
we've seen horrible headlines

00:08:21.582 --> 00:08:25.904
of incredible destruction going on
to archaeological sites,

00:08:25.928 --> 00:08:28.733
and massive looting by people like ISIL.

00:08:29.594 --> 00:08:33.216
ISIL has destroyed temples at Palmyra.
