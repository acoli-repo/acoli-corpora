00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:30.464
that had been looted.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.472
Let me put into perspective
for you what was taken.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:39.175
Imagine a two meter by two meter area
full of coffins, jewelry

00:12:39.199 --> 00:12:40.709
and incredible statuary.

00:12:41.235 --> 00:12:44.063
Multiply that times over a thousand.

00:12:45.302 --> 00:12:46.769
That's what was taken.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:48.908
So, when we started work,

00:12:48.932 --> 00:12:52.084
my Egyptian co-director, Mohamed Youssef,
approached me and said,

00:12:52.108 --> 00:12:54.369
"We must work at this one particular tomb.

00:12:54.943 --> 00:12:56.702
It's been attacked by looters.

00:12:56.726 --> 00:12:58.742
If we don't do anything, they'll be back."

00:12:58.766 --> 00:13:02.162
Of course I agreed,
but I didn't think we'd find anything.
