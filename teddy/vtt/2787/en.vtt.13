00:06:30.012 --> 00:06:31.258
(Applause)

00:06:31.282 --> 00:06:32.568
Thank you.

00:06:32.956 --> 00:06:37.427
This means I use satellite images
and process them using algorithms,

00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:40.087
and look at subtle differences
in the light spectrum

00:06:40.111 --> 00:06:42.425
that indicate buried things
under the ground

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.918
that I get to go excavate and survey.

00:06:45.497 --> 00:06:46.657
By the way --

00:06:46.681 --> 00:06:49.258
NASA has a Space Archaeology program,

00:06:49.282 --> 00:06:50.768
so it's a real job.

00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:51.942
(Laughter)

00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:54.015
So, let's have a look again.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:56.124
We're back at the site
just south of Cairo.

00:06:56.148 --> 00:06:57.831
You can't see anything.

00:06:57.855 --> 00:07:01.233
Keep your eye on the red rectangle.
