00:04:26.786 --> 00:04:30.136
Archaeologists are the cultural
memory preservers

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.801
and the spokespeople

00:04:31.825 --> 00:04:35.157
for the billions of people
and the thousands of cultures

00:04:35.181 --> 00:04:36.515
that came before us.

00:04:37.136 --> 00:04:40.231
Good science, imagination
and a leap of faith

00:04:40.255 --> 00:04:43.695
are the trifecta we use to raise the dead.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.164
In the last year,

00:04:46.188 --> 00:04:49.364
archaeologists have made
incredible discoveries, including:

00:04:50.194 --> 00:04:52.516
new human ancestors from South Africa;

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.578
tools from 3.3 million years ago --

00:04:56.602 --> 00:04:58.838
these are the oldest tools
ever discovered --

00:04:58.862 --> 00:05:00.210
in Kenya.
