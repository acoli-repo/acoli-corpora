00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.148
with 2.3 million blocks,

00:03:03.172 --> 00:03:05.870
with incredible bureaucratic efficiency.

00:03:07.304 --> 00:03:10.269
It is not the pyramids
that stand the test of time;

00:03:10.293 --> 00:03:12.055
it is human ingenuity.

00:03:12.556 --> 00:03:16.462
That is our shared human brilliance.

00:03:17.523 --> 00:03:20.049
History may be cyclical,

00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:22.912
but we are singular.

00:03:23.768 --> 00:03:25.344
I love what I do,

00:03:25.368 --> 00:03:28.033
because I learn that we haven't changed.

00:03:29.486 --> 00:03:33.670
I get to read about mother-in-law
jokes from Mesopotamia
