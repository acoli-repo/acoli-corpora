This is the ocean as I used to know it.

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:08.038
And I find that since I've been
in the Gulf a couple of times,

00:00:08.062 --> 00:00:12.562
I really kind of am traumatized
because whenever I look at the ocean now,

00:00:12.586 --> 00:00:15.047
no matter where I am,

00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:18.976
even where I know
that none of the oil has gone,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.976
I sort of see slicks,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.247
and I'm finding that I'm very much
haunted by it.

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.862

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:32.416
is a lot of things that try
to put all of this in context,
