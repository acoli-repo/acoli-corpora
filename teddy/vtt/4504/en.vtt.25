00:12:28.188 --> 00:12:32.217
We hope to have opened the door
for more such research in this direction,

00:12:32.241 --> 00:12:36.538
so the remaining unknown terrain
will be charted in the future.

00:12:37.036 --> 00:12:38.617
And this is slowly starting.

00:12:38.641 --> 00:12:43.732
We're seeing the emergence of long-term
and highly-funded programs

00:12:43.756 --> 00:12:47.383
which aim at understanding
our networked world

00:12:47.407 --> 00:12:49.137
from a complexity point of view.

00:12:49.861 --> 00:12:51.659
But this journey has only just begun,

00:12:51.683 --> 00:12:55.384
so we will have to wait
before we see the first results.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.589
Now there is still
a big problem, in my opinion.
