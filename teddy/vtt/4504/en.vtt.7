00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.328
by looking at the interactions,

00:03:31.352 --> 00:03:33.722
so you can actually forget
about the equations

00:03:33.746 --> 00:03:36.298
and you just start to look
at the interactions.

00:03:36.322 --> 00:03:39.656
And it gets even better,
because most complex systems

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.160
have this amazing property
called emergence.

00:03:42.698 --> 00:03:46.889
So this means that the system as a whole
suddenly starts to show a behavior

00:03:46.913 --> 00:03:49.785
which cannot be understood or predicted

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:52.362
by looking at the components
of the system.

00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:55.687
So the whole is literally
more than the sum of its parts.

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:57.933
And all of this also means

00:03:57.957 --> 00:04:02.821
that you can forget about
the individual parts of the system,
