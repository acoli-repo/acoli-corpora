00:01:58.904 --> 00:02:01.913
So you take a chunk of reality
you want to understand

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:05.682
and you translate it into mathematics.

00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:08.124
You encode it into equations.

00:02:09.142 --> 00:02:11.544
Then, predictions can be made and tested.

00:02:13.124 --> 00:02:15.612
We're actually
really lucky that this works,

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:18.524
because no one really knows
why the thoughts in our heads

00:02:18.548 --> 00:02:22.355
should actually relate to the fundamental
workings of the universe.

00:02:24.278 --> 00:02:27.148
Despite the success,
physics has its limits.

00:02:27.688 --> 00:02:30.738
