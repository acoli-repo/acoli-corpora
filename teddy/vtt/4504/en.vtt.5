As Dirk Helbing pointed out
in the last quote,

00:02:30.762 --> 00:02:35.620
we don't really understand the complexity
that relates to us, that surrounds us.

00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:40.705
This paradox is what got me interested
in complex systems.

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:42.605
So these are systems which are made up

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.089
of many interconnected
or interacting parts:

00:02:46.113 --> 00:02:48.922
swarms of birds or fish,

00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:53.497
ant colonies, ecosystems,
brains, financial markets.

00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:55.270
These are just a few examples.

00:02:57.687 --> 00:03:02.906
Interestingly, complex systems
are very hard to map
