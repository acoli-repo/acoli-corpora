00:01:29.998 --> 00:01:34.236
which is coming from what is known
as the science of complexity.

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:38.472
To explain what this means
and what this thing is,

00:01:38.496 --> 00:01:41.109
please let me quickly take
a couple of steps back.

00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:44.189
I ended up in physics by accident.

00:01:44.213 --> 00:01:47.327
It was a random encounter
when I was young,

00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:51.945
and since then, I've often wondered
about the amazing success of physics

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.868
in describing the reality
we wake up in every day.

00:01:56.141 --> 00:01:58.880
In a nutshell, you can think
of physics as follows.

00:01:58.904 --> 00:02:01.913
So you take a chunk of reality
you want to understand
