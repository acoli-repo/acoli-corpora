It's an emergent property which depends
on the rules of interaction in the system,

00:12:04.697 --> 00:12:08.512
so it's probably not the result
of a top-down approach

00:12:08.536 --> 00:12:10.239
like a global conspiracy.

00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:14.698
Our study "is an impression
of the moon's surface.

00:12:14.722 --> 00:12:16.031
It's not a street map."

00:12:16.055 --> 00:12:19.865
So you should take the exact numbers
in our study with a grain of salt,

00:12:19.889 --> 00:12:25.972
yet it "gave us a tantalizing glimpse
of a brave new world of finance."

00:12:28.188 --> 00:12:32.217
We hope to have opened the door
for more such research in this direction,
