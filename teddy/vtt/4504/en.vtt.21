00:10:29.591 --> 00:10:34.945
So similarly, the control is flowing
in the ownership networks

00:10:34.969 --> 00:10:37.056
and is accumulating at the nodes.

00:10:39.073 --> 00:10:42.866
So what did we find after computing
all this network control?

00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:48.486
Well, it turns out
that the 737 top shareholders

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:54.080
have the potential to collectively control
80 percent of the TNCs' value.

00:10:55.728 --> 00:10:58.433
Now remember, we started out
with 600,000 nodes,

00:10:58.457 --> 00:11:05.140
so these 737 top players
make up a bit more than 0.1 percent.
