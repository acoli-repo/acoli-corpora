00:00:58.657 --> 00:01:02.534
trying to understand
the origins of the universe,

00:01:02.643 --> 00:01:08.513
while we still don't understand
the conditions for a stable society,

00:01:08.537 --> 00:01:12.186
a functioning economy, or peace."

00:01:14.177 --> 00:01:16.949
What's happening here?
How can this be possible?

00:01:16.973 --> 00:01:20.220
Do we really understand more
about the fabric of reality

00:01:20.244 --> 00:01:24.205
than we do about the fabric
which emerges from our human interactions?

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.532
Unfortunately, the answer is yes.

00:01:27.257 --> 00:01:29.974
But there's an intriguing solution

00:01:29.998 --> 00:01:34.236
which is coming from what is known
as the science of complexity.
