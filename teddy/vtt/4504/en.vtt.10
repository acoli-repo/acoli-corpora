The study we published last year, called
"The Network of Global Corporate Control,"

00:05:02.837 --> 00:05:07.474
was the first extensive analysis
of economic networks.

00:05:08.654 --> 00:05:11.216
The study went viral on the Internet

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.631
and it attracted a lot of attention
from the international media.

00:05:16.246 --> 00:05:20.465
This is quite remarkable, because, again,
why did no one look at this before?

00:05:20.489 --> 00:05:23.548
Similar data has been
around for quite some time.

00:05:23.572 --> 00:05:26.751
What we looked at in detail
was ownership networks.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.719
So here the nodes are companies,
people, governments, foundations, etc.
