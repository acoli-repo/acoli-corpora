Well, the high degree of control you saw
is very extreme by any standard.

00:11:39.285 --> 00:11:44.160
The high degree of interconnectivity
of the top players in the core

00:11:44.267 --> 00:11:48.722
could pose a significant systemic risk
to the global economy.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.442
And we could easily
reproduce the TNC network

00:11:52.466 --> 00:11:54.053
with a few simple rules.

00:11:54.766 --> 00:11:58.420
This means that its structure is probably
the result of self-organization.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:04.673
It's an emergent property which depends
on the rules of interaction in the system,
