00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:03.930
This is very much in the sense
of Max Weber's idea of potential power,

00:10:04.864 --> 00:10:08.331
which is the probability
of imposing one's own will

00:10:08.355 --> 00:10:10.338
despite the opposition of others.

00:10:12.406 --> 00:10:17.163
If you want to compute the flow
in an ownership network,

00:10:17.187 --> 00:10:18.544
this is what you have to do.

00:10:18.568 --> 00:10:20.762
It's actually not that hard to understand.

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:23.793
Let me explain by giving you this analogy.

00:10:23.817 --> 00:10:28.742
So think about water flowing in pipes,
where the pipes have different thickness.

00:10:29.591 --> 00:10:34.945
So similarly, the control is flowing
in the ownership networks
