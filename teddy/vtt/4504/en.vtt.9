00:04:30.614 --> 00:04:32.893
So what equations are for physics,

00:04:32.917 --> 00:04:36.397
complex networks are for the study
of complex systems.

00:04:37.664 --> 00:04:40.874
This approach has been
very successfully applied

00:04:40.898 --> 00:04:44.492
to many complex systems
in physics, biology,

00:04:44.516 --> 00:04:47.236
computer science, the social sciences,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.518
but what about economics?

00:04:49.557 --> 00:04:51.359
Where are economic networks?

00:04:52.113 --> 00:04:55.724
This is a surprising
and prominent gap in the literature.

00:04:56.983 --> 00:05:02.813
The study we published last year, called
"The Network of Global Corporate Control,"
