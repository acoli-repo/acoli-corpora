00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.372
These are companies that operate
in more than one country,

00:07:33.396 --> 00:07:35.237
and we found 43,000.

00:07:37.148 --> 00:07:40.109
In the next step, we built
the network around these companies,

00:07:40.133 --> 00:07:42.489
so we took all the TNCs' shareholders,

00:07:42.513 --> 00:07:44.472
and the shareholders' shareholders, etc.,

00:07:44.496 --> 00:07:47.348
all the way upstream,
and we did the same downstream,

00:07:47.372 --> 00:07:51.500
and ended up with a network
containing 600,000 nodes

00:07:51.524 --> 00:07:52.818
and one million links.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.801
This is the TNC network which we analyzed.

00:07:57.251 --> 00:07:59.360
And it turns out to be
structured as follows.

00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:01.911
So you have a periphery and a center
