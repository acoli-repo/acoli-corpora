00:02:57.687 --> 00:03:02.906
Interestingly, complex systems
are very hard to map

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.929
into mathematical equations,

00:03:04.953 --> 00:03:08.588
so the usual physics approach
doesn't really work here.

00:03:09.283 --> 00:03:11.452
So what do we know about complex systems?

00:03:11.476 --> 00:03:17.508
Well, it turns out that what looks
like complex behavior from the outside

00:03:17.532 --> 00:03:21.243
is actually the result
of a few simple rules of interaction.

00:03:22.995 --> 00:03:26.835
This means you can forget
about the equations

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.585
and just start to understand the system

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.328
by looking at the interactions,
