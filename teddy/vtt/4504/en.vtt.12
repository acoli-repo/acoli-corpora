In this little example,
you can see a few financial institutions

00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:02.524
with some of the many links highlighted.

00:06:03.845 --> 00:06:06.690
Now, you may think that no one
looked at this before

00:06:06.714 --> 00:06:11.201
because ownership networks
are really, really boring to study.

00:06:11.941 --> 00:06:16.007
Well, as ownership is related to control,

00:06:16.031 --> 00:06:17.564
as I shall explain later,

00:06:17.588 --> 00:06:19.005
looking at ownership networks

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:21.707
actually can give you
answers to questions like,

00:06:21.731 --> 00:06:23.180
who are the key players?

00:06:23.204 --> 00:06:25.530
How are they organized?
Are they isolated?

00:06:25.554 --> 00:06:27.199
Are they interconnected?

00:06:27.223 --> 00:06:29.949
And what is the overall
distribution of control?
