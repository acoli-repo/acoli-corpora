00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:01.911
So you have a periphery and a center

00:08:01.935 --> 00:08:06.388
which contains about 75 percent
of all the players,

00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:10.990
and in the center,
there's this tiny but dominant core

00:08:11.014 --> 00:08:14.153
which is made up of highly
interconnected companies.

00:08:15.116 --> 00:08:17.382
To give you a better picture,

00:08:17.406 --> 00:08:19.047
think about a metropolitan area.

00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:21.077
So you have the suburbs and the periphery,

00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:23.934
you have a center,
like a financial district,

00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.684
then the core will be something like

00:08:25.708 --> 00:08:28.277
the tallest high-rise building
in the center.

00:08:29.732 --> 00:08:33.189
And we already see signs
of organization going on here.
