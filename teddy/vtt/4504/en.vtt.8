00:03:57.957 --> 00:04:02.821
that you can forget about
the individual parts of the system,

00:04:02.845 --> 00:04:04.166
how complex they are.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.178
So if it's a cell or a termite or a bird,

00:04:09.202 --> 00:04:11.443
you just focus on the rules
of interaction.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.617
As a result, networks are ideal
representations of complex systems.

00:04:21.102 --> 00:04:25.620
The nodes in the network
are the system's components,

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.263
and the links are given
by the interactions.
