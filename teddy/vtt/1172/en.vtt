00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I became an inventor by accident. 


00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I was out of the air force in 1956. No, no, that's not true: 


00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I went in in 1956, came out in 1959, 


00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
was working at the University of Washington, 


00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article, 


00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm. 


00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now, that was before cassette tapes, C.D.s, DVDs --

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
any of the cool stuff we've got now. 


00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And it was an arm that, 



00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record, 


00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
went straight: a radial, linear tracking tone arm.
