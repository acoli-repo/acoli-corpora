As archaeologists pored over ancient tombs
in Turfan in western China,

00:00:12.508 --> 00:00:16.304
they discovered some surprisingly
well-preserved and familiar relics.

00:00:17.013 --> 00:00:19.390

dumplings.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.188

remains a mystery.

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:27.523
But some scholars suspect 
they were first spread

00:00:27.523 --> 00:00:30.943
around parts the ancient world 
by nomadic Turkic peoples
