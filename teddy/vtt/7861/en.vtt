00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:09.839
Take a good look at this slug.

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:11.883
No, not that— that’s a leaf.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:13.509
This slug.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.136
There we go.

00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:18.890
Elysia chlorotica may not look like much—

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.142
okay, it looks like a bright green leaf—

00:00:21.142 --> 00:00:24.312
but it’s one of the most extraordinary
creatures around.

00:00:24.687 --> 00:00:28.357
Living in salt marshes
along the east coast of North America,

00:00:28.357 --> 00:00:31.277
it can go about a year without eating.
