I have a story, a story that I would like to share with you.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And it's an African story.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It is a story of hope, resilience and glamour.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
There was Hollywood.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Then came Bollywood.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Today we have Nollywood, the third-largest film industry in the world.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In 2006 alone, almost 2,000 films were made in Nigeria.
