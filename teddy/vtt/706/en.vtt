00:00:01.396 --> 00:00:05.047
A few weeks ago, I had a chance
to go to Saudi Arabia.

00:00:05.484 --> 00:00:08.093
And the first thing
I wanted to do as a Muslim

00:00:08.117 --> 00:00:10.518
was to go to Mecca and visit the Kaaba,

00:00:10.542 --> 00:00:11.976
the holiest shrine of Islam.

00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:15.015
And I did that;
I put on my ritualistic dress,

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:16.547
I went to the holy mosque,

00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:18.250
I did my prayers,

00:00:18.274 --> 00:00:19.976
I observed all the rituals.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.377
And meanwhile,
besides all the spirituality,

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:26.698
there was one mundane detail in the Kaaba

00:00:26.722 --> 00:00:28.420
that was pretty interesting for me:

00:00:28.444 --> 00:00:30.203
there was no separation of sexes.
