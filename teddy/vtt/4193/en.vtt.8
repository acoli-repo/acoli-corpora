00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.079
For the next assignment, for the very
first time in my married life,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.519
without asking my husband,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.799
I got the contract and tickets
in my hand, and then told my husband

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.999
that we were going to Trinidad and Tobago.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.320
He came along!

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.879
After that he did not want to travel,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.728
so I opted for United Nations
peace keeping missions.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.399
I was 61 when I went to Afghanistan

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.347
as an aero medical evacuation specialist.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.479
Often, just after we had left a place,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.619
there would be a bomb blast there.
