00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.956
With no plans of getting married,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.959
until I met a charming Air Force pilot,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.799
and said yes to the proposal.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.119
I had just one conditionL

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.743
that I should be allowed
to practice after marriage.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.800
So we got married,

00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:16.800
and I donned the identity:

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:20.861
wife of flight lieutenant,
Karanjeetsingh Dhillon.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.417
I recall that my college professor
had mentioned

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.072
that I had wasted a seat
by marrying a non-medico.
