SRK: Now I want to know,

00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:31.999
you spoke about South Sudan,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.159
East Timor, Afghanistan
and other places you have been to,

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:36.825
like you mentioned Trinidad and Tobago.

00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:38.414
So which is the scariest moment?

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.639
The most dangerous?

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.402
You come across as someone very brave

00:08:42.402 --> 00:08:44.488
so I'm sure nothing could
have scared you.

00:08:44.488 --> 00:08:45.965
(Laughter)

00:08:45.965 --> 00:08:49.439
RD: Frankly, our profession is such,

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.699
the medical profession,

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.224
that despite all the bombing around,

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.454
when a patient comes to you,

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.519
running to the bunker
and hiding is not what you will do.
