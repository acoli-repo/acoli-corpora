00:07:29.875 --> 00:07:33.030
Really. Let's have a round of applause
for Dr. Ramindar Dhillon.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.694
(Cheering and applause)

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:36.720
Another question

00:07:36.721 --> 00:07:38.839
before I get to the serious questions.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.319
Since you will be on TV,

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.178
and tens of millions of people
will watch you via Star Plus,

00:07:43.202 --> 00:07:46.839
our attempt is to take TED Talks

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.761
which were in English to Hindi
and get them to every home.

00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:51.385
Lots of people will listen to you,

00:07:51.385 --> 00:07:53.861
one of them will be
your classmate Dhillon, too.

00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:55.240
(Laughter)

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.359
So let's say hello to him wherever he is?

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.490
He missed his chance!

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.640
(Laughter)
