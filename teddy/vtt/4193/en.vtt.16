(Laughter)

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.399
Please say, "Hi Mr. Dhillon" once.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.480
RD: OK, you do that.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.679

SRK: Absolutely. Is Mr. Dhillon at home?

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.975
Or is your Mr. Dhillon here?

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.864
RD: Yes, mine is here!
SRK: He's sitting here.

00:08:12.864 --> 00:08:14.309
OK, I am going to say something

00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:15.750
that I have never said before,

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.759
and I will repeat it
many times in the show

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:19.770
and for the first time
through Dr. Dhillon.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:20.770
I will say that:

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.718
Behind every successful woman
there is a fantastic man.

00:08:24.718 --> 00:08:26.730
A big round of applause
for Dr. Dhillon.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.130
