00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.519
running to the bunker
and hiding is not what you will do.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.439
You will stand there
and treat the patient.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.519
So the thought of fear

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.119
or that there is bombing around

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.910
never comes to mind.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.179
It has never come.

00:09:17.305 --> 00:09:18.639
Since my profession is such,

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.840
if I get scared how can I save people?

00:09:22.048 --> 00:09:23.063
SRK: Absolutely.

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:26.543
(Applause)

00:09:26.543 --> 00:09:30.304
SRK: Thank you very much, Dr. Dhillon,
for being here with us. God bless you.
