there would be a bomb blast there.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.561
Once I even encountered the Taliban.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.975
We managed to sneak away quickly.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.568
An army affirmation
that my parents often used was:

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.651
"One should never fear death

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.606
and always keep your faith in the Lord."

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.784
When I was 66 I went to East Timor.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.772
At 68, I was sent to one of the newest
nations of the world:

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.594
South Sudan in Africa.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.919
I had been there almost two years

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.221
when a civil war broke out in July 2016.
