It's coming together around these ideas,

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.856
liberals and conservatives,

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.960
to help people who need us the most.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.776
Now, I don't have to tell anybody
in this room that we're in a crisis,

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.376
in America and many countries around
the world with political polarization.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.296
It's risen to critical, crisis levels.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.720
It's unpleasant. It's not right.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.976
There was an article last year

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.616
in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences,

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.120
which is one of the most
prestigious scientific journals

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.336
published in the West.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.816
And it was an article in 2014

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.256
on political motive asymmetry.
