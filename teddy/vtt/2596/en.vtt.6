00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.216
and there were flies on his face
and a distended belly.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.160
And he wasn't going to make it,
and I knew that, and I was helpless.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.696
Some of you remember that picture,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.736
not exactly that picture,
one just like it.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.560
It introduced the West
to grinding poverty around the world.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.016
Well, that vision kind of haunted me
as I grew up and I went to school

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.816
and I dropped out and dropped in

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.800
and started my family.

00:03:25.496 --> 00:03:27.496
And I wondered, what happened to that kid?

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.200
Or to people just like him
all over the world?
