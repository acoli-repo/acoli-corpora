Or to people just like him
all over the world?

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.976
And so I started to study,
even though I wasn't in college,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.416
I was looking for the answer:

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.536
what happened to the world's
poorest people?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.816
Has it gotten worse?
Has it gotten better? What?

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.616
And I found the answer,
and it changed my life,

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.200
and I want to share it with you.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.240
See --

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.016
most Americans believe
that poverty has gotten worse

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.176
since we were children,
since they saw that vision.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.856
If you ask Americans, "Has poverty
gotten worse or better around the world?",

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.216
70 percent will say that hunger
has gotten worse since the early 1970s.
