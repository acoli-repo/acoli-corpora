00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.296
I come from one of the most liberal,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.536
tolerant, progressive places
in the United States,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.760
Seattle, Washington.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.376
And I grew up with a family
of great Seattlites.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.216
My mother was an artist,
my father was a college professor,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.776
and I am truly grateful for my upbringing,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.296
because I always felt completely
comfortable designing my life

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.280
exactly as I saw fit.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.336
And in point of fact,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.456
I took a route that was not exactly
what my parents had in mind.
