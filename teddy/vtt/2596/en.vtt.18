Well, first, let's be honest:
there are differences.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.216
Let's not minimize the differences.
That would be really naïve.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.296
There's a lot of good research on this.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.456
A veteran of the TED stage
is my friend Jonathan Haidt.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.536
He's a psychology professor
at New York University.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.496
He does work on the ideology
and values and morals of different people

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.760
to see how they differ.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.170
And he's shown, for example,
that conservatives and liberals

00:09:23.194 --> 00:09:26.210
have a very different emphasis
on what they think is important.

00:09:26.234 --> 00:09:29.536
For example, Jon Haidt has shown

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.536
that liberals care about poverty
