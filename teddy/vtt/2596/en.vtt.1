00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.456
I took a route that was not exactly
what my parents had in mind.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.400
When I was 19, I dropped out of college --

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.176
dropped out, kicked out, splitting hairs.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.560
(Laughter)

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.936
And I went on the road
as a professional French horn player,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.656
which was my lifelong dream.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.576
I played chamber music
all over the United States and Europe,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.376
and I toured for a couple of years

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.376
with a great jazz guitar player
named Charlie Bird.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.976
And by the end of my 20s,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.176
I wound up as a member of the Barcelona
Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
