00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.456
on the right, conservatives,

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.120
you're always talking about taxes
and regulations and big government.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.616
And on the left, liberals,
you're talking about economics,

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.896
it's always about income inequality.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.336
Right? Now those are important things,

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.616
really important to me,
really important to you.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.176
But when it comes to lifting people up

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.656
who are starving and need us today,
those are distractions.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.096
We need to come together
around the best ways

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.456
to mitigate poverty
using the best tools at our disposal,
