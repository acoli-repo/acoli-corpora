00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.696
and I was visiting
my parents for Christmas,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.400
and I was cooking dinner with my mother,
and we were alone in the kitchen.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.056
And she was quiet, too quiet.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.536
Something was wrong.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.080
And so I said, "Mom, what's on your mind?"

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.016
And she said, "Your dad and I
are really worried about you."

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.936
And I said, "What?"
I mean, what could it be, at this point?

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.760
And she said, "I want you to be
completely honest with me:

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.616
have you been voting for Republicans?"

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.840
(Laughter)
