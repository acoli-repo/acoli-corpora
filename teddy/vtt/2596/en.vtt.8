00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.216
70 percent will say that hunger
has gotten worse since the early 1970s.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.736
But here's the truth.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.456
Here's the epiphany that I had
that changed my thinking.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.240
From 1970 until today,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.736
the percentage of the world's population

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.776
living in starvation levels,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.456
living on a dollar a day or less,
obviously adjusted for inflation,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.696
that percentage has declined

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.400
by 80 percent.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.056
There's been an 80 percent decline
in the world's worst poverty

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.296
since I was a kid.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.896
And I didn't even know about it.
