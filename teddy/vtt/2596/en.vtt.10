00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.456
because that's what we're talking about:
since I was a kid,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.296
two billion of the least of these,
our brothers and sisters,

00:05:03.316 --> 00:05:04.856
have been pulled out of poverty.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.366
I want the next two billion,
so I've got to know why.

00:05:07.386 --> 00:05:09.016
And I went in search of an answer.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.696
And it wasn't a political answer,
because I didn't care.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.376
You know what, I still don't care.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.216
I wanted the best answer
from mainstream economists

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.360
left, right and center.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.080
And here it is.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.816
Here are the reasons.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.576
There are five reasons that two billion
of our brothers and sisters

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.976
have been pulled out of poverty
since I was a kid.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.520
Number one: globalization.
