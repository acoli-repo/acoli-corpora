00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.376
accompanied by the method
of economic freedom

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.016
spreading around the world.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.576
We need each other, in other words,

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.220
if we want to help people and get the next
two billion people out of poverty.

00:10:10.244 --> 00:10:11.524
There's no other way.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.896
Hmm.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.400
How are we going to get that?

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.016
It's a tricky thing, isn't it.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.256
We need innovative thinking.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.936
A lot of it's on this stage.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.120
Social entrepreneurship.
Yeah. Absolutely. Phenomenal.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.616
We need investment overseas

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.016
in a sustainable, responsible,
ethical and moral way. Yes. Yes.
