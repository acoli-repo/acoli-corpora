00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.056
suffer from political motive asymmetry.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.936
A majority of people in our country today
who are politically active believe

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.376
that they are motivated by love
but the other side is motivated by hate.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.936
Think about it. Think about it.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.135
Most people are walking around saying,

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:44.336
"You know, my ideology
is based on basic benevolence,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.576
I want to help people,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.400
but the other guys,
they're evil and out to get me."

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.496
You can't progress as a society
when you have this kind of asymmetry.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:55.720
It's impossible.

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.816
How do we solve it?

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.496
Well, first, let's be honest:
there are differences.
