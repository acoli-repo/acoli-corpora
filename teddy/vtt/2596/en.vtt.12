00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.056
But that is great.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.416
And that's beyond politics.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.536
Here's what I learned.
This is the epiphany.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.576
Capitalism is not just about accumulation.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.136
At its best, it's about aspiration,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.856
which is what so many people
on this stage talk about,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.096
is the aspiration that comes from dreams

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.376
that are embedded
in the free enterprise system.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.576
And we've got to share it
with more people.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.816
Now, I want to tell you
about a second epiphany

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.336
that's related to that first one

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.416
that I think can bring us progress,
not just around the world,

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.680
but right here at home.
