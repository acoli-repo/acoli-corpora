00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.520
Number one: globalization.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.176
Number two: free trade.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.536
Number three: property rights.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.096
Number four: rule of law.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.096
Number five: entrepreneurship.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.376
It was the free enterprise system
spreading around the world

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.176
after 1970 that did that.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.616
Now, I'm not naive.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.096
I know that free enterprise isn't perfect,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.256
and I know that free enterprise
isn't everything we need

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.496
to build a better world.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.056
But that is great.
