See, when I was a kid
growing up in Seattle,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.896
I remember the first time
I saw real poverty.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.296
We were a lower middle class family,
but that's of course not real poverty.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.056
That's not even close.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.496
The first time I saw poverty,
and poverty's face,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.336
was when I was six
or seven years old, early 1970s.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.896
And it was like a lot of you,
kind of a prosaic example, kind of trite.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.296
It was a picture in the National
Geographic Magazine

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.616
of a kid who was my age in East Africa,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.216
and there were flies on his face
and a distended belly.
