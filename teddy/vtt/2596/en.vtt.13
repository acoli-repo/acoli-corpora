00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.680
but right here at home.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.856
The best quote I've ever heard

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.456
to summarize the thoughts
that I've just given you

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.536
about pulling people out of poverty

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.656
is as follows:

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.536
"Free markets have created more wealth
than any system in history.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.360
They have lifted billions out of poverty."

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.656
Who said it?

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.080
It sounds like Milton Friedman
or Ronald Reagan.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.000
Wrong.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.720
President Barack Obama said that.
