Like Occupy Wall Street
and other protest movements,

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.096
Nuit Debout was born
in the face of crisis.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.576
It was messy --

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.920
full of controversies and contradictions.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.696
But whether you agreed
with the movement's goals or not,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.440
every gathering was
a beautiful lesson in raw humanity.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.656
And how fitting that Paris --

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.456
the city of ideals, the city of beauty --

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.696
was it's stage.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.536
It reminds us that like great cities,

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.736
the most beautiful organizations
are ideas worth fighting for --

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.800
even and especially
when their outcome is uncertain.
