00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.496
But we've all been ugly once.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.200
We were a weird-looking baby,

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.160
a new kid on the block, a foreigner.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.440
And we will be ugly again
when we don't belong.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.216
The Center for Political Beauty,

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.856
an activist collective in Berlin,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.560
recently staged an extreme
artistic intervention.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.096
With the permission of relatives,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.256
it exhumed the corpses of refugees
who had drowned at Europe's borders,

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.176
transported them all the way to Berlin,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.000
and then reburied them
at the heart of the German capital.
