It came completely out of the blue.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.696
There had been no market

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.696
and employees were so surprised

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.200
that they burst into tears
when they heard the news.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.920
Actions like Ulukaya's are beautiful
because they catch us off guard.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.976

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.696
that was the result of a merger

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.376
of a large IT outsourcing firm
and a small design firm.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.376
We were merging 9,000 software engineers
