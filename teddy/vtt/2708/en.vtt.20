00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.800
even and especially
when their outcome is uncertain.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.776
They are movements;

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.136
they are always imperfect,
never fully organized,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.856
so they avoid ever becoming banal.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.216
They have something
but we don't know what it is.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.176
They remain mysterious;
we can't take our eyes off them.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.160
We find them beautiful.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.096
So to do the unnecessary,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.776
to create intimacy,

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.296
to be ugly,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.880
to remain incomplete --

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.536
these are not only the qualities
of beautiful organizations,

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.000
these are inherently
human characteristics.
