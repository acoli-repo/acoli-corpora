Because as machines take our jobs
and do them more efficiently,

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.976
soon the only work left for us humans
will be the kind of work

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.080
that must be done beautifully
rather than efficiently.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.936
To maintain our humanity
in the this second Machine Age,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.960
we may have no other choice
than to create beauty.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.456
Beauty is an elusive concept.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.880

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.856
For me it's a goal by Lionel Messi.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.296
