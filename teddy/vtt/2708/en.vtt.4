00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.376
We were merging 9,000 software engineers

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.160
with 1,000 creative types.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.536
And to unify these
immensely different cultures,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.616
we were going to launch
a third, new brand.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.136
And the new brand color
was going to be orange.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.576
And as we were going
through the budget for the rollouts,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.656
we decided last minute

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.336
to cut the purchase
of 10,000 orange balloons,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.160
which we had meant
to distribute to all staff worldwide.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.960
They just seemed
unnecessary and cute in the end.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.816
I didn't know back then
