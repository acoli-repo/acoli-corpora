(Laughter)

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.896
So bear with me

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.296
as I am proposing four admittedly
very subjective principles

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.240
that you can use to build
a beautiful organization.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.496
First: do the unnecessary.

[Do the Unnecessary]

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.296
A few months ago, Hamdi Ulukaya,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.456
the CEO and founder
of the yogurt company Chobani,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.040
made headlines when he decided to grant
stock to all of his 2,000 employees.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.536
Some called it a PR stunt,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.776
others -- a genuine act of giving back.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.480
But there is something else
that was remarkable about it.
