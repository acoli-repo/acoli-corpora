00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.280
So how do we design
for organizational intimacy?

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.336
The humanitarian organization CARE

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.736
wanted to launch
a campaign on gender equality

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.240
in villages in northern India.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.376
But it realized quickly

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.360
that it had to have this conversation
first with its own staff.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.016
So it invited all 36 team members
and their partners

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.776
to one of the Khajuraho Temples,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.560
known for their famous erotic sculptures.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.096
And there they openly discussed
their personal relationships --

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.680
their own experiences of gender equality
