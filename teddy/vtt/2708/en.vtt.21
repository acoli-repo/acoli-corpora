00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.000
these are inherently
human characteristics.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.240
And these are also the qualities
of what we call home.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.936
And as we disrupt, and are disrupted,

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.256
the least we can do is to ensure

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.296
that we still feel at home
in our organizations,

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.720
and that we use our organizations
to create that feeling for others.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.696
Beauty can save the world
when we embrace these principles

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.200
and design for them.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.376
In the face of artificial intelligence
and machine learning,

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.736
we need a new radical humanism.
