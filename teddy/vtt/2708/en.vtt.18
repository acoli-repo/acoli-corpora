00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.376
and a friend of mine
took me to Nuit Debout,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.936
which stands for "up all night,"

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.896
the self-organized protest movement

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.840
that had formed in response
to the proposed labor laws in France.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.896
Every night, hundreds gathered
at the Place de la République.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.496
Every night they set up
a small, temporary village

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.120
to deliberate their own vision
of the French Republic.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.776
And at the core of this adhocracy

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.056
was a general assembly
where anybody could speak

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.680
using a specially designed sign language.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.176
Like Occupy Wall Street
and other protest movements,
