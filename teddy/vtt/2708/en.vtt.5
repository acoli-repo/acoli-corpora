00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.816
I didn't know back then

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.376
that our decision
marked the beginning of the end --

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.040
that these two organizations
would never become one.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.616
And sure enough,
the merger eventually failed.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.456
Now, was it because
there weren't any orange balloons?

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.080
No, of course not.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.920
But the kill-the-orange-balloons
mentality permeated everything else.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.896
You might not always realize it,
but when you cut the unnecessary,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.400
you cut everything.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.800
Leading with beauty means
rising above what is merely necessary.
