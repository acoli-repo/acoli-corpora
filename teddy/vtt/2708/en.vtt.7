The marriage researcher John Gottman says

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.096
that the secret of a healthy relationship

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.176
is not the great gesture
or the lofty promise,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.400
it's small moments of attachment.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.880
In other words, intimacy.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.656
In our networked organizations,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.296
we tout the strength of weak ties

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.176
but we underestimate
the strength of strong ones.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.096
We forget the words of the writer
Richard Bach who once said,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.336
"Intimacy --

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.576
not connectedness --

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.920
intimacy is the opposite of loneliness."

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.280
So how do we design
for organizational intimacy?
