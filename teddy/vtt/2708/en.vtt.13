vacation resorts, coffee shops,
playgrounds or college campuses --

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.296
(Laughter)

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.496
Based on the promises
of positive psychology,

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.896
we speak of play and gamification,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.456
and one start-up even says
that when someone gets fired,

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.776
they have graduated.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.776
(Laughter)

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.296
That kind of beautiful language
only goes "skin deep,

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.560
but ugly cuts clean to the bone,"

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.456
as the writer Dorothy Parker once put it.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.000
To be authentic is to be ugly.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.216
It doesn't mean that you can't have fun
or must give in to the vulgar or cynical,
