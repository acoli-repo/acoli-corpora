A June full moon is glowing upon this reef
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:20.163
Beneath the surface, 17,000 camouflage 
groupers dart about in the cloudy water.

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:24.871
What youâ€™re witnessing is, in fact,
an underwater orgyâ€”

00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:26.788
turned feeding frenzy.

00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:33.121
The water is hazy because groupers are
ejecting sperm and eggs in dense clouds.
