00:00:01.873 --> 00:00:07.045
Of America's 500 largest companies,
only 42 have female CEOs.

00:00:07.086 --> 00:00:08.796
And if you look at other countries,

00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:11.424
the data is similar,
and in some cases, worse.

00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:14.052
And, of course,
there are a number of factors

00:00:14.052 --> 00:00:16.929
contributing to global gender
inequity in the workplace.

00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:20.683
But I believe that there is one factor
often underecognized,

00:00:20.725 --> 00:00:22.268
and that's menopause.

00:00:22.894 --> 00:00:24.479
So what do I mean?

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.315
Many women will rise into
senior positions of leadership

00:00:27.356 --> 00:00:29.192
in their 40s or their 50s.

00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:31.736
The average age of a CEO is mid-50s.
