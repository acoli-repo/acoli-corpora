I'd like to begin with a thought experiment.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Imagine that it's 4,000 years into the future.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Civilization as we know it

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
has ceased to exist --

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
no books,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
no electronic devices,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
no Facebook or Twitter.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
All knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
has been lost.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now imagine archeologists

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
digging through the rubble of one of our cities.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What might they find?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic
