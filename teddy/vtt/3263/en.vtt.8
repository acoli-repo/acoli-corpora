I've come to kind of believe
that they're not really depressing at all.

00:04:02.196 --> 00:04:05.479
In fact, I think they're kind of the most
important songs we have.

00:04:06.317 --> 00:04:09.441
Songs that sing of sorrow,

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:10.616
of grief,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.998
of longing,

00:04:12.022 --> 00:04:14.186
of the darker side of love,

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.641
the underside of being alive,

00:04:16.665 --> 00:04:19.507
these are the songs
I just never tire of hearing

00:04:19.531 --> 00:04:21.742
and I never tire of writing,

00:04:21.766 --> 00:04:23.865
because they make me feel less alone.

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:28.298
They speak to a very real
part of being human

00:04:28.322 --> 00:04:30.943
that can often be hidden in fear and shame
