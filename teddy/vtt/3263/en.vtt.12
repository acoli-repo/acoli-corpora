nothing speaks to me more
than this, and --

00:06:02.116 --> 00:06:03.378
(Laughter)

00:06:03.402 --> 00:06:07.795
you know, I think it's been the essence
of my songwriting for years,

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:09.631
of what moves me to write,

00:06:09.655 --> 00:06:11.383
what inspires me to sing.

00:06:12.052 --> 00:06:15.234
Because pain and grief and doubt,

00:06:15.258 --> 00:06:18.790
when it's made manifest
in music, in song --

00:06:18.814 --> 00:06:22.504
when it's made beautiful
in poetry and painting,

00:06:24.097 --> 00:06:26.644
it can build a community and a kinship

00:06:26.668 --> 00:06:30.380
in the knowledge that we are
none of us alone in darkness.
