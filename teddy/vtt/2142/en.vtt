00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Sustainability represents

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
the what, the where and the how

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
of what is caught.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The who and the why are what's important to me.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I want to know the people behind my dinner choices.

for their living.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
away from a commodity

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to an opportunity

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to restore our ecosystem.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It allows for us to celebrate the seafood
