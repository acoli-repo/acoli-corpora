00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and we are paying a cost.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We are hiding that cost

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
is that it really takes into account our needs.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Restorative seafood might best be represented

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
not by Jaws, or by Flipper, or the Gordon's fisherman,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
but rather, by the Jolly Green Giant.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Vegetables:

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
they might yet save the oceans.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Well I'd like to respectfully submit
