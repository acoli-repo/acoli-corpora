It is a more hopeful, it is a more human,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and is a more useful way of understanding our environment.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Wallet guides -- standard issue

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
by lots in the marine conservation world --

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
are very handy; they're a wonderful tool.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Green, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The association is very easy: buy green, don't buy red,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
think twice about yellow.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But in my mind, it's really not enough

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
to just eat green list.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We can't sustain this without the measure of our success

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
really changing the fate of the species

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
in the yellow and the red.
