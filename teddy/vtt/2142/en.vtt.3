00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
really changing the fate of the species

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
in the yellow and the red.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
But what if we eat only in the green list?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You've got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here --

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
comes from sustainable stocks.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Pole caught -- no bycatch.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Great for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
But it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What's the context of this meal?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Do I do this three times a week?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I might still be in the green list,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
but I'm not doing myself, or you,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
or the oceans any favors.
