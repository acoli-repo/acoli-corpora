00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We have ravaged our Earth

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and then used the food that we've sourced

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
to handicap ourselves in more ways than one.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And so I think it's time

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
we change what we expect from our food.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Sustainability is complicated

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So let's start there.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
There's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Dan Barber and Alice Waters

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
But green foods often represent

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
a way for us to disregard
