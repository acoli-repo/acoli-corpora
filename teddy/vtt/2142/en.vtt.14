00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
maybe.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I expect a lot from food.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I expect health

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and joy and family and community.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I expect that producing ingredients,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
preparing dishes and eating meals

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
is all part of the communion of human interests.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And he taught me very early on

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
about the privilege that eating represents.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I remember well the meals of my childhood.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
They were reasonable portions of protein

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
served with copious quantities of vegetables

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and small amounts of starch, usually rice.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
This is still how I largely eat today.
