00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and then take the first step to minimize it.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
We've seen an image of our blue planet,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
our world bank.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
But it is more than just a repository of our resources;

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
it's also the global geography

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
of the communion we call dinner.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
So if we all take only what we need,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
then we can begin to share the rest,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
we can begin to celebrate,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
we can begin to restore.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
We need to savor vegetables.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
We need to savor smaller portions of seafood.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And we need to save dinner.
