00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to restore our ecosystem.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It allows for us to celebrate the seafood

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that we're also so fortunate to eat.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So what do we call this?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I think we call it restorative seafood.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Where sustainability is the capacity

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
to endure and maintain,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
restorative is the ability to replenish and progress.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
as a resource,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and to encourage its resiliency.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It is a more hopeful, it is a more human,
