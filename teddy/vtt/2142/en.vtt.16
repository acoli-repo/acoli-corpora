It's pretty straightforward.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So what are we looking for in a meal?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Well for health, I'm looking for wholesome ingredients

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that are good for my body.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
For joy, I'm looking for butter and salt

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and sexy things that make things taste less like penance.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
For family, I'm looking for recipes

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that genuflect to my own personal histories.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
For community though, we start at the very beginning.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
There's no escaping the fact

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that everything we eat has a global impact.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
So try and learn as best you can what that impact is

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and then take the first step to minimize it.
