00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
or the oceans any favors.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The point is that we have to have a context,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
a gauge for our actions in all this.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Example: I've heard that red wine is great for my health --

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
antioxidants and minerals -- heart healthy.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
That's great! I love red wine!

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I'm going to drink so much of it. I'm going to be so healthy.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Well, how many bottles is it

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
before you tell me that I have a problem?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Well folks, we have a protein problem.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We have lost this sensibility

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
when it regards our food,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and we are paying a cost.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves.
