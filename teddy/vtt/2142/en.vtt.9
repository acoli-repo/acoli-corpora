00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
But green foods often represent

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
a way for us to disregard

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
the responsibility as eaters.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Just because it comes from a green source

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We have eco-friendly shrimp.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
We can make them; we have that technology.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
It doesn't work.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
of restorative seafood.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
While we try to manage declining marine populations,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood.
