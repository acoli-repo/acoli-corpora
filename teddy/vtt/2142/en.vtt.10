00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Studies say that tens of thousands

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
of American grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers and fathers

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
might be around for another birthday

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
if we included more seafood.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
That's a reward I am not willing to pass up.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
But it's not all about the seafood.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
It's about the way that we look at our plates.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
As a chef, I realize the easiest thing for me to do

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
is reduce the portion sizes on my plate.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
A couple things happened.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I made more money.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
People started buying appetizers and salads,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone.
