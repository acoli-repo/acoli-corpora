00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
was begin to diversify the species that we served --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
small silverfish, anchovies, mackerel, sardines were uncommon.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Shellfish, mussels, oysters,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
clams, tilapia, char -- these were the common species.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
We were directing tastes

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
towards more resilience, more restorative options.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
This is what we need to favor.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
This is what the green list says.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
But what of those big predators,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
those fashionable species,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Well, if you must, I have a recipe for you.
