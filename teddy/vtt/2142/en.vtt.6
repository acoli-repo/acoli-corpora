Well I'd like to respectfully submit

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
that broccoli green might then be the new blue.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
We must continue to eat

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the best seafood possible, if at all.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
The best part about restorative seafood though

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
is that it comes on the half-shell

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy, broiled breadcrumbs

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
with crunchy, grilled broccoli

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
with just a hint of chili flake.
