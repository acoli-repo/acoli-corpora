00:05:27.372 --> 00:05:30.659
things like increasing
the number of state troopers

00:05:30.683 --> 00:05:31.887
that they needed to have,

00:05:31.911 --> 00:05:34.309
reducing wait times at the DMV --

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:37.953
and today, Mitch Daniels
is the president of Purdue University,

00:05:37.977 --> 00:05:40.159
applying yet again the same principles,

00:05:40.183 --> 00:05:41.984
this time at the higher ed level,

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:46.158
and he's done that in order to keep
tuition levels for students there flat

00:05:46.182 --> 00:05:47.396
for half a decade.

00:05:48.752 --> 00:05:51.840
Now, while Mitch Daniels
applied this at the federal level,

00:05:51.864 --> 00:05:53.657
the state level, and in higher ed,

00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:56.807
the guy that really cracked
the code for cities

00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:59.467
is a Democrat, Martin O'Malley,

00:05:59.491 --> 00:06:01.419
during his time as Mayor of Baltimore.
