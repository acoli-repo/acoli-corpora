00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:33.974
and today, it's being used
by mayors across the country

00:07:33.998 --> 00:07:36.133
to deal with some
of our greatest challenges.

00:07:36.157 --> 00:07:39.306
And the overall approach
is a very simple one --

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.152
identify the goal
that you want to achieve;

00:07:42.176 --> 00:07:45.528
identify a measurement
by which you can track progress

00:07:45.552 --> 00:07:47.021
toward that goal;

00:07:47.045 --> 00:07:53.228
identify a way of testing that measurement
cheaply and quickly;

00:07:53.252 --> 00:07:57.665
and then deploy whatever strategies
you think would work,

00:07:57.689 --> 00:07:59.114
test them,

00:07:59.138 --> 00:08:02.154
reduce funding for the strategies
that don't work,
