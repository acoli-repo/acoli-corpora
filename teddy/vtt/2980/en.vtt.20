00:09:57.736 --> 00:10:02.246
we don't think you could do good things
unless you've got happy employees;

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:06.509
improving the overall street quality
throughout our community.

00:10:06.533 --> 00:10:10.763
But we're also applying it
to things that are not so traditional

00:10:10.787 --> 00:10:13.573
when you think about
what cities are responsible for,

00:10:13.597 --> 00:10:16.015
things like increasing per capita income,

00:10:16.039 --> 00:10:17.890
increasing our population,

00:10:17.914 --> 00:10:20.496
improving our high school
graduation rates,

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.527
and perhaps the greatest challenge
that we face as a city.

00:10:26.937 --> 00:10:28.803
At the dawn of the 1920s,

00:10:28.827 --> 00:10:32.525
Tulsa was home to the most vibrant
African American community in the country.
