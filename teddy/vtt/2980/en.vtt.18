00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.020
because when you're focused on a goal,

00:09:02.044 --> 00:09:04.854
and you can test
different strategies quickly,

00:09:04.878 --> 00:09:08.243
the sky's the limit on the different
things that you can test out.

00:09:08.267 --> 00:09:11.338
You can come up with any strategy
that you can come up with

00:09:11.362 --> 00:09:13.244
and utilize and try and test it

00:09:13.268 --> 00:09:16.554
until you find something that works,
and then you double down on that.

00:09:16.578 --> 00:09:20.711

those old silos of ownership

00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:26.165
that we run into so often in government.

00:09:26.998 --> 00:09:30.658
It allows you to draw
all the stakeholders in your community
