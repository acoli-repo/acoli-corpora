00:10:28.827 --> 00:10:32.525
Tulsa was home to the most vibrant
African American community in the country.

00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:36.774
The Greenwood section of our city
was known as Black Wall Street.

00:10:37.842 --> 00:10:40.478
In 1921, in one night,

00:10:40.502 --> 00:10:43.794
Tulsa experienced the worst race riot
in American history.

00:10:44.755 --> 00:10:48.161
Black Wall Street
was burned to the ground,

00:10:48.185 --> 00:10:50.724
and today, a child that is born

00:10:50.748 --> 00:10:53.598
in the most predominantly
African American part of our city

00:10:53.622 --> 00:10:57.438
is expected to live 11 years less
than a kid that's born elsewhere in Tulsa.

00:10:59.555 --> 00:11:03.221
Now, for us, this is a unifying issue.
