00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:02.254
and yuck it up about
the Tulsa mayor's race.

00:01:02.278 --> 00:01:05.739
(Laughter)

00:01:05.763 --> 00:01:09.261
Never mind that I, like my opponent,

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:10.627
am a Republican.

00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:13.524
(Laughter)

00:01:13.548 --> 00:01:18.937
And so when something like this
hits you in a campaign,

00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:22.057
you have to decide
how you're going to respond,

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.175
and we had a novel idea.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.103
What if, instead of responding
with partisanship,

00:01:29.127 --> 00:01:31.913
we responded with a focus on results?
