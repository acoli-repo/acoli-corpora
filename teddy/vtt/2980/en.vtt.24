00:11:58.328 --> 00:12:00.408
Is that easy to accomplish?

00:12:00.432 --> 00:12:01.582
Of course not!

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.035
If it were easy to accomplish,

00:12:04.059 --> 00:12:06.543
somebody would have already
done it before us.

00:12:07.013 --> 00:12:09.201
But what I love about city government

00:12:09.225 --> 00:12:11.290
is that the citizens can create

00:12:11.314 --> 00:12:13.806
whatever kind of city
they're willing to build,

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:17.267
and in Tulsa, we have decided
to build a city

00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:22.609
where Republicans and Democrats
use evidence, data and evaluation

00:12:22.633 --> 00:12:25.317
to solve our greatest challenges together.

00:12:26.944 --> 00:12:28.221
And if we can do this,

00:12:28.245 --> 00:12:30.895
if we can set partisanship aside
