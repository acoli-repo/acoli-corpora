00:10:59.555 --> 00:11:03.221
Now, for us, this is a unifying issue.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.397
Four years from now, we will recognize

00:11:06.421 --> 00:11:10.675
the 100th commemoration
of that awful event,

00:11:10.699 --> 00:11:15.021
and in Tulsa, we are bringing
every tool that we can

00:11:15.045 --> 00:11:17.652
to address that life-expectancy disparity,

00:11:17.676 --> 00:11:20.034
and we're not checking
party registration cards

00:11:20.058 --> 00:11:21.549
at the door to the meetings.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.766
We don't care who
you voted for for president

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.464
if you want to help restore
the decade of life

00:11:27.488 --> 00:11:29.892
that's being stolen
from these kids right now.
