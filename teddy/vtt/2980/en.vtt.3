00:01:29.127 --> 00:01:31.913
we responded with a focus on results?

00:01:31.937 --> 00:01:34.190
What if we ran a campaign

00:01:34.214 --> 00:01:38.207
that was not about running
against someone,

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:41.699
but was about bringing people together
behind a common vision?

00:01:41.723 --> 00:01:46.637
And so we decided
to respond not with a negative ad

00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:49.955
but with something people
find even sexier --

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.154
data points.

00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:53.162
(Laughter)

00:01:53.186 --> 00:01:58.835
And so we emphasized things like
increasing per capita income in our city,

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:01.827
increasing our city's population,
