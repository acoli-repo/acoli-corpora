00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:33.230
an ethos where our business leaders
don't just run companies,

00:02:33.254 --> 00:02:37.597
they run philanthropic
institutions and nonprofits,

00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:39.706
and those folks took notice.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.690

00:02:43.714 --> 00:02:45.913
so that their kids
can have a better future,

00:02:45.937 --> 00:02:47.714
and those people took notice, too.

00:02:48.177 --> 00:02:50.508

a guy whose name reminds people
of a circus promoter ...

00:02:56.034 --> 00:02:57.898
(Laughter)

00:02:57.922 --> 00:03:02.883
a guy with the raw animal magnetism
of a young Orville Redenbacher ...
