00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:31.486
that ultimately lead to division?

00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:36.530
I believe it is because politicians

00:03:36.554 --> 00:03:39.722
find it easier to throw
the red meat out to the base

00:03:39.746 --> 00:03:40.896
than to innovate.

00:03:41.228 --> 00:03:43.879
The conventional wisdom
is that to win an election,

00:03:43.903 --> 00:03:45.325
you have to dumb it down

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:50.395
and play to your constituencies'
basest, divisive instincts.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.811
And when somebody
wins an election like that,

00:03:54.835 --> 00:03:57.652
they win, that's true,

00:03:57.676 --> 00:03:59.111
but the rest of us lose.
