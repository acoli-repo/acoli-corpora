(Laughter)

00:03:05.733 --> 00:03:09.669
I won the election by 17 points.

00:03:09.693 --> 00:03:14.351
(Applause)

00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:18.501
And we did it with the support
of Republicans and Democrats.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.073
Now, why is that story
and that approach so novel?

00:03:24.021 --> 00:03:25.986
Why do we always allow ourselves

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.059
to fall back on
philosophical disagreements

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:31.486
that ultimately lead to division?
