00:09:26.998 --> 00:09:30.658
It allows you to draw
all the stakeholders in your community

00:09:30.682 --> 00:09:35.614
that care about homelessness
or crime-fighting or education

00:09:35.638 --> 00:09:38.266
or vacant and abandoned properties,

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.339
and bring those people to the table

00:09:40.363 --> 00:09:44.633
so you can work together
to address your common goal.

00:09:44.657 --> 00:09:46.315
Now, in Tulsa, we're applying this

00:09:46.339 --> 00:09:50.195
to things that are
common city initiatives,

00:09:50.219 --> 00:09:52.473
things like, as you've heard
now repeatedly,

00:09:52.497 --> 00:09:55.013
public safety -- that's an obvious one;

00:09:55.037 --> 00:09:57.712
improving our employee
morale at the city --

00:09:57.736 --> 00:10:02.246
we don't think you could do good things
unless you've got happy employees;
