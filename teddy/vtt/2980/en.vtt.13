00:06:29.373 --> 00:06:32.674
and then police resources
would be allocated

00:06:32.698 --> 00:06:36.628
to those areas quickly where crimes
were occurring today

00:06:36.652 --> 00:06:39.222
rather than where
they were occurring last quarter.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.915
Well, O'Malley loved that approach,
and he applied it in Baltimore.

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:49.574
And he applied it to the two areas
that were most problematic for Baltimore

00:06:49.598 --> 00:06:51.217
from a crime-fighting standpoint.

00:06:51.241 --> 00:06:53.582
We call these the kidneys of death.

00:06:53.606 --> 00:06:55.575
[Baltimore homicides and shootings, 1999]

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:57.209
So there they are, the kidneys.

00:06:57.808 --> 00:06:59.042
Now watch this.

00:06:59.066 --> 00:07:02.324
Watch what happens
when you apply data in real time
