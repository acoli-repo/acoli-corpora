Watch what happens
when you apply data in real time

00:07:02.348 --> 00:07:04.131
and deploy resources quickly.

00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:09.918
In a decade, they reduced
violent crime in Baltimore

00:07:09.942 --> 00:07:12.521
by almost 50 percent, using this approach,

00:07:12.545 --> 00:07:15.085
but the genius of what O'Malley did

00:07:15.109 --> 00:07:17.975
was not that he just did
what some other city was doing.

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:19.713
Lots of us mayors do that.

00:07:19.737 --> 00:07:21.151
(Laughter)

00:07:21.175 --> 00:07:25.612
He realized that the same approach
could be used to all of the problems

00:07:25.636 --> 00:07:27.108
that his city faced.

00:07:27.132 --> 00:07:29.800
And so they applied it
to issue after issue in Baltimore,

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:33.974
and today, it's being used
by mayors across the country
