00:03:29.673 --> 00:03:30.923
and Anna turned back

00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:32.933
to philosophy and scholarship.

00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:34.783
Her husband had written a history

00:03:34.783 --> 00:03:36.543

00:03:36.543 --> 00:03:38.183

00:03:38.183 --> 00:03:39.423

the Alexiad recounts

00:03:52.652 --> 00:03:55.742
the tumultuous events of Alexios’s reign,

00:03:55.742 --> 00:03:58.712
and Anna’s own reactions to those events,

00:03:58.712 --> 00:04:00.612
like bursting into tears at the thought
