00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:30.231
the Emperor was stabbed in the buttocks.

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:32.629
To make matters worse, a strong wind

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.899
made the relic too heavy to carry,

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:36.649
so he stashed it in some bushes

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.005
as he escaped.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.415
But even as he fled,

00:00:39.415 --> 00:00:41.515
he managed to slay some Scythians

00:00:41.515 --> 00:00:44.195
and rescue a few comrades.

00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:47.185
At least, this is how Alexios' daughter

00:00:47.185 --> 00:00:49.035
Anna recounted the story,

00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:51.775
writing nearly 60 years later.

00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:54.765
She spent the last decade of her long life

00:00:54.765 --> 00:00:57.265
creating a 500-page history

00:00:57.265 --> 00:01:00.145
of her father’s reign called The Alexiad.
