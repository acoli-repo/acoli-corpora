00:00:07.071 --> 00:00:08.991
Alexios Komnenos,

00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:10.371
Byzantine emperor,

00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:13.046
led his army to meet the Scythian hordes

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:14.111
in battle.

00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:15.271
For good luck,


00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:17.261
he carried one of the holiest relics

00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:18.381
in Christendom:

00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:19.751
the veil that had belonged

00:00:19.751 --> 00:00:21.721
to the Virgin Mary.

00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:24.031
Unfortunately, it didnâ€™t help.


00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:26.281
Not only was his army defeated,

00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:27.491
but as they fled,

00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:30.231
the Emperor was stabbed in the buttocks.
