00:00:57.265 --> 00:01:00.145
of her father’s reign called The Alexiad.

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:02.065
Written in Greek, the book was modeled

00:01:02.065 --> 00:01:03.715
after ancient Greek epics

00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:05.415
and historical writings.

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:07.865
But Anna had a different, trickier task

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:10.055
than the writers in these traditions:

00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:11.165
as a princess writing

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:12.625
about her own family,

00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:15.215
she had to balance her loyalty to her kin

00:01:15.215 --> 00:01:16.455
with her obligation

00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:18.715
to portray events accurately,

00:01:18.715 --> 00:01:21.155
navigating issues like Alexios’s

00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:23.575
embarrassing stab to the buttocks.

00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:25.755
A lifetime of study and participation

00:01:25.755 --> 00:01:27.105
in her father’s government

00:01:27.105 --> 00:01:30.105
prepared Anna for this undertaking.
