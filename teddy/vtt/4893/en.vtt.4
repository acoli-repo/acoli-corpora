00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:00.306
to secure the frontiers of his empire,

00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:02.426
even striking up an uneasy alliance

00:02:02.426 --> 00:02:04.366
with the Crusaders.

00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:06.590
Meanwhile in Constantinople,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.670
Anna fought her own battle.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.690
She was expected to study subjects

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.770
considered proper

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.640
for a Byzantine princess,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.990
like courtly etiquette and the Bible,

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.670
but preferred classical myth

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.960
and philosophy.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.483
To access this material, she had to learn

00:02:21.483 --> 00:02:23.953
to read and speak Ancient Greek,

00:02:23.953 --> 00:02:26.413
by studying secretly at night.

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:27.933
Eventually her parents realized

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:29.223
how serious she was,

00:02:29.223 --> 00:02:31.403
and provided her with tutors.
