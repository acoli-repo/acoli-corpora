00:03:58.712 --> 00:04:00.612
like bursting into tears at the thought

00:04:00.612 --> 00:04:03.592
of the deaths of her parents and husband.

00:04:03.592 --> 00:04:05.792
She may have included 
these emotional passages

00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:07.772
in hopes that they would make her writing

00:04:07.772 --> 00:04:09.532
more palatable to a society

00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:10.912
that believed women shouldn't

00:04:10.912 --> 00:04:13.512
write about battles and empires.

00:04:13.512 --> 00:04:15.214
While her loyalty to her father

00:04:15.214 --> 00:04:17.064
was evident in her favorable account

00:04:17.064 --> 00:04:19.704
of his reign, she also included criticism

00:04:19.704 --> 00:04:22.284
and her opinions of events.

00:04:22.284 --> 00:04:24.180
In the centuries after her death,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.910
Anna’s Alexiad was copied over and over,

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.650
and remains an invaluable

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.800
eyewitness account

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.430
of Alexios’s reign today.
