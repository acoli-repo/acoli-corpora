00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.976
When I was nine years old,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.143
I went off to summer camp
for the first time.

00:00:04.167 --> 00:00:07.976
And my mother packed me a suitcase
full of books,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.667
which to me seemed like
a perfectly natural thing to do.

00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:14.976
Because in my family,
reading was the primary group activity.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.976
And this might sound antisocial to you,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.976
but for us it was really just
a different way of being social.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.976
You have the animal warmth of your family
sitting right next to you,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.858
but you are also free to go
roaming around the adventureland

00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:27.976
inside your own mind.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.976
And I had this idea

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.524
that camp was going to be
just like this, but better.
