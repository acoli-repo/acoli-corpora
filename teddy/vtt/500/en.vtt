00:00:00.708 --> 00:00:02.559
So when I was a little girl,

00:00:02.583 --> 00:00:05.893
a book sat on the coffee table
in our living room,

00:00:05.917 --> 00:00:07.934
just steps from our front door.

00:00:07.958 --> 00:00:10.476
And the living room is a first impression.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.101
Ours had white carpet

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:16.167
and a curio of my mother's
most treasured collectibles.

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:21.434
That room represented the sacrifices
of generations gone by

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:24.434
who, by poverty or by policy,

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:26.976
couldn't afford a curio of collectibles

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.268
let alone a middle class house
to put them in.
