00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Last year when I was here, I was speaking to you about a swim

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which I did across the North Pole.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And while that swim took place three years ago,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I can remember it as if it was yesterday.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I remember standing on the edge of the ice,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
about to dive into the water,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and thinking to myself, I have never ever

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
seen any place on this earth

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which is just so frightening.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The water is completely black.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
or 29 degrees Fahrenheit.
