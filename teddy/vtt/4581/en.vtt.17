After a while, a Samaritan, a very much
despised ethnicity at the time, walked by.

00:08:40.773 --> 00:08:46.156
Seeing the injured man
lying on the ground,

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.620
he did not ignore him
as if he weren't even there.

00:08:51.572 --> 00:08:54.673
Instead, he felt compassion for this man,

00:08:55.775 --> 00:09:02.747
which compelled him to act
in a very concrete manner.
