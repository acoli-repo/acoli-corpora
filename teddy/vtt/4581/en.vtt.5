00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.580
that we all need each other,

00:02:33.418 --> 00:02:36.058
none of us is an island,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.500
an autonomous and independent "I,"
separated from the other,

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.340
and we can only build the future
by standing together, including everyone.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.156
We don’t think about it often,
but everything is connected,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.620
and we need to restore
our connections to a healthy state.
