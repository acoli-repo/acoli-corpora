I am sure you have heard it before.
It is the Parable of the Good Samaritan.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.580
When Jesus was asked:
"Who is my neighbor?" -

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.660
namely, "Who should I take care of?" -

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.037
he told this story, the story of a man

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:20.900
who had been assaulted, robbed,
beaten and abandoned along a dirt road.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:28.420
Upon seeing him, a priest and a Levite,
two very influential people of the time,

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.620
walked past him without stopping to help.
