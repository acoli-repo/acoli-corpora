00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.220
This is the path that Jesus himself took.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.250
He lowered himself,

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.356
he lived his entire human existence

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.060
practicing the real,
concrete language of love.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.756
Yes, tenderness is the path of choice

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.820
for the strongest,
most courageous men and women.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.100
Tenderness is not weakness;
it is fortitude.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:31.180
It is the path of solidarity,
the path of humility.
