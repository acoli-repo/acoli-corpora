The "you" is always a real presence,

00:07:34.593 --> 00:07:37.756
a person to take care of.

00:07:41.454 --> 00:07:46.836
There is a parable Jesus told
to help us understand the difference

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:53.690
between those who'd rather not be bothered
and those who take care of the other.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:08:00.320
I am sure you have heard it before.
It is the Parable of the Good Samaritan.
