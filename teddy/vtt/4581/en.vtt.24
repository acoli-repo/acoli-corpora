00:11:55.180 --> 00:12:00.436
Hope is a humble, hidden seed of life

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.700
that, with time,
will develop into a large tree.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:11.180
It is like some invisible yeast
that allows the whole dough to grow,

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.180
that brings flavor to all aspects of life.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.988
And it can do so much,

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:24.801
because a tiny flicker of light
that feeds on hope

00:12:25.531 --> 00:12:29.340
is enough to shatter
the shield of darkness.
