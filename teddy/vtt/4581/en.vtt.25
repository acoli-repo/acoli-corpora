00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:35.396
A single individual
is enough for hope to exist,

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:38.604
and that individual can be you.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:45.194
And then there will be another "you,"
and another "you,"

00:12:46.282 --> 00:12:48.583
and it turns into an "us."

00:12:49.238 --> 00:12:53.495
And so, does hope begin
when we have an "us?"

00:12:53.519 --> 00:12:54.663
No.

00:12:54.687 --> 00:12:56.307
Hope began with one "you."

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:01.890
When there is an "us,"
there begins a revolution.
