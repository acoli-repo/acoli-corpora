Through the darkness of today's conflicts,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.796
each and every one of us
can become a bright candle,

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.978
a reminder that light
will overcome darkness,

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.190
and never the other way around.

00:11:16.557 --> 00:11:21.113
To Christians,
the future does have a name,

00:11:21.877 --> 00:11:24.017
and its name is Hope.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.980
Feeling hopeful does not mean
to be optimistically naïve
