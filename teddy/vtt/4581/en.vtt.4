WEBVTT

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.036
left for Argentina

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.540
and met the fate of those
who are left with nothing.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.140
I could have very well ended up
among today's "discarded" people.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.617
And that's why I always ask myself,
deep in my heart:

00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:21.919
"Why them and not me?"

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.716
First and foremost, I would love it
if this meeting could help to remind us

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.580
that we all need each other,
