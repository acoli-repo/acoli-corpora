00:00:00.548 --> 00:00:01.964
Applying for jobs online

00:00:01.988 --> 00:00:04.604
is one of the worst
digital experiences of our time.

00:00:04.628 --> 00:00:07.324
And applying for jobs in person
really isn't much better.

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:09.069
[The Way We Work]

00:00:11.588 --> 00:00:14.044
Hiring as we know it
is broken on many fronts.

00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:15.924
It's a terrible experience for people.

00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:17.764
About 75 percent of people

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:20.644
who applied to jobs
using various methods in the past year

00:00:20.668 --> 00:00:23.324
said they never heard anything back
from the employer.

00:00:23.348 --> 00:00:25.524
And at the company level
it's not much better.

00:00:25.548 --> 00:00:28.324
46 percent of people get fired or quit

00:00:28.348 --> 00:00:30.524
within the first year
of starting their jobs.
