Let's try one of the games together.

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.444
You're about to see a flashing circle,

00:02:02.468 --> 00:02:05.428
and your job is going to be
to clap when the circle is red

00:02:06.285 --> 00:02:07.781
and do nothing when it's green.

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:09.182
[Ready?]

00:02:09.207 --> 00:02:10.567
[Begin!]

00:02:11.708 --> 00:02:12.708
[Green circle]

00:02:13.708 --> 00:02:14.748
[Green circle]

00:02:15.708 --> 00:02:16.708
[Red circle]

00:02:17.708 --> 00:02:18.788
[Green circle]

00:02:19.708 --> 00:02:20.708
[Red circle]

00:02:21.928 --> 00:02:23.524
Maybe you're the type of person

00:02:23.548 --> 00:02:26.044
who claps the millisecond
after a red circle appears.

00:02:26.068 --> 00:02:27.724
Or maybe you're the type of person

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:30.483
who takes just a little bit longer
to be 100 percent sure.
