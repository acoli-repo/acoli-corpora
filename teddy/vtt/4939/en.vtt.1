00:00:28.348 --> 00:00:30.524
within the first year
of starting their jobs.

00:00:30.548 --> 00:00:31.764
It's pretty mind-blowing.

00:00:31.788 --> 00:00:33.244
It's also bad for the economy.

00:00:33.268 --> 00:00:34.724
For the first time in history,

00:00:34.748 --> 00:00:37.604
we have more open jobs
than we have unemployed people,

00:00:37.628 --> 00:00:39.804
and to me that screams
that we have a problem.

00:00:39.828 --> 00:00:43.804
I believe that at the crux of all of this
is a single piece of paper: the résumé.

00:00:43.828 --> 00:00:46.164
A résumé definitely has
some useful pieces in it:

00:00:46.188 --> 00:00:48.284
what roles people have had,
computer skills,

00:00:48.308 --> 00:00:49.564
what languages they speak,

00:00:49.588 --> 00:00:52.644
but what it misses is
what they have the potential to do

00:00:52.668 --> 00:00:55.644
that they might not have had
the opportunity to do in the past.

00:00:55.668 --> 00:00:58.924
And with such a quickly changing economy
where jobs are coming online

00:00:58.948 --> 00:01:01.004
that might require skills that nobody has,
