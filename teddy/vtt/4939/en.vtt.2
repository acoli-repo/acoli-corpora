00:00:58.948 --> 00:01:01.004
that might require skills that nobody has,

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:03.804
if we only look at what someone
has done in the past,

00:01:03.828 --> 00:01:07.084
we're not going to be able
to match people to the jobs of the future.

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:09.844
So this is where I think technology
can be really helpful.

00:01:09.868 --> 00:01:12.724
You've probably seen
that algorithms have gotten pretty good

00:01:12.748 --> 00:01:14.284
at matching people to things,

00:01:14.308 --> 00:01:16.564
but what if we could use
that same technology

00:01:16.588 --> 00:01:19.684
to actually help us find jobs
that we're really well-suited for?

00:01:19.708 --> 00:01:21.284
But I know what you're thinking.

00:01:21.308 --> 00:01:24.084
Algorithms picking your next job
sounds a little bit scary,

00:01:24.108 --> 00:01:26.164
but there is one thing that has been shown

00:01:26.188 --> 00:01:29.084
to be really predictive
of someone's future success in a job,

00:01:29.108 --> 00:01:31.244
and that's what's called
a multimeasure test.
