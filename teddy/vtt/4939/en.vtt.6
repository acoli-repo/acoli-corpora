00:02:57.188 --> 00:03:00.524
But if you clap immediately on red
and sometimes clap on green,

00:03:00.548 --> 00:03:03.204
that might mean that
you're more impulsive and creative,

00:03:03.228 --> 00:03:07.103
and we've found that top-performing
salespeople often embody these traits.

00:03:07.128 --> 00:03:09.144
The way we actually use this in hiring

00:03:09.168 --> 00:03:12.864
is we have top performers in a role
go through neuroscience exercises

00:03:12.888 --> 00:03:14.104
like this one.

00:03:14.128 --> 00:03:15.504
Then we develop an algorithm

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:18.184
that understands what makes
those top performers unique.

00:03:18.208 --> 00:03:20.144
And then when people apply to the job,

00:03:20.168 --> 00:03:24.304
we're able to surface the candidates
who might be best suited for that job.

00:03:24.328 --> 00:03:26.704
So you might be thinking
there's a danger in this.

00:03:26.728 --> 00:03:28.864
The work world today
is not the most diverse

00:03:28.888 --> 00:03:31.984
and if we're building algorithms
based on current top performers,
