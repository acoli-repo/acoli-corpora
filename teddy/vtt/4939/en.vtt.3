00:01:29.108 --> 00:01:31.244
and that's what's called
a multimeasure test.

00:01:31.268 --> 00:01:33.444
Multimeasure tests
really aren't anything new,

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:35.204
but they used to be really expensive

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:37.244
and required a PhD sitting across from you

00:01:37.268 --> 00:01:39.724
and answering lots of questions
and writing reports.

00:01:39.748 --> 00:01:41.444
Multimeasure tests are a way

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:43.924
to understand someone's inherent traits --

00:01:43.948 --> 00:01:45.724
your memory, your attentiveness.

00:01:46.662 --> 00:01:48.604
What if we could take multimeasure tests

00:01:48.628 --> 00:01:51.164
and make them scalable and accessible,

00:01:51.188 --> 00:01:54.564
and provide data to employers
about really what the traits are

00:01:54.588 --> 00:01:57.484
of someone who can make
them a good fit for a job?

00:01:57.508 --> 00:01:58.804
This all sounds abstract.

00:01:58.828 --> 00:02:00.563
Let's try one of the games together.
