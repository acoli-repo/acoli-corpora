00:03:59.368 --> 00:04:03.064
Every algorithm that we put
into production has been pretested

00:04:03.088 --> 00:04:06.184
to ensure that it doesn't favor
any gender or ethnicity.

00:04:06.208 --> 00:04:08.944
And if there's any population
that's being overfavored,

00:04:08.968 --> 00:04:12.088
we can actually alter the algorithm
until that's no longer true.

00:04:12.448 --> 00:04:14.664
When we focus on the inherent
characteristics

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:16.784
that can make somebody
a good fit for a job,

00:04:16.808 --> 00:04:20.384
we can transcend racism,
classism, sexism, ageism --

00:04:20.408 --> 00:04:21.824
even good schoolism.

00:04:21.848 --> 00:04:24.744
Our best technology and algorithms
shouldn't just be used

00:04:24.768 --> 00:04:28.504
for helping us find our next movie binge
or new favorite Justin Bieber song.

00:04:28.528 --> 00:04:31.184
Imagine if we could harness
the power of technology
