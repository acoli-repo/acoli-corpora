00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is Revolution 2.0.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
No one was a hero. No one was a hero.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Because everyone was a hero.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Everyone has done something.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We all use Wikipedia.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If you think of the concept of Wikipedia

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
where everyone is collaborating on content,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and at the end of the day

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
you've built the largest encyclopedia in the world.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
From just an idea that sounded crazy,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
you have the largest encyclopedia in the world.
