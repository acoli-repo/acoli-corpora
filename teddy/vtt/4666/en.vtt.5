Because Charles Bonnet Syndrome 
only occurs in people

00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:33.572
who had normal vision 
and then lost their sight,

00:02:33.572 --> 00:02:35.311
not those who were born blind,

00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:38.299
scientists think the brain uses
remembered images

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.922
to compensate for 
the lack of new visual input.

00:02:41.922 --> 00:02:44.067
And the same is true for other senses.

00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:47.978
People with hearing loss 
often hallucinate music or voices,

00:02:47.978 --> 00:02:52.929
sometimes as elaborate as the cacophony 
of an entire marching band.

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:55.662
In addition to sensory deprivation,

00:02:55.662 --> 00:02:57.941
recreational and therapeutic drugs,

00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:00.859
conditions like epilepsy and narcolepsy,
