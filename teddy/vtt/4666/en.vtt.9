00:04:27.943 --> 00:04:33.374
may share a similar mechanism with those
caused by LSD and psilocybin.

00:04:33.374 --> 00:04:35.031
Patients with schizophrenia

00:04:35.031 --> 00:04:38.008
often have elevated levels 
of serotonin in the brain.

00:04:38.008 --> 00:04:42.209
And antipsychotic drugs relieve 
symptoms of schizophrenia

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:47.612
by blocking the same serotonin 
receptors LSD and psilocybin bind to.

00:04:47.612 --> 00:04:49.117
And, in some cases,

00:04:49.117 --> 00:04:51.684
these drugs can even relieve 
the hallucinations

00:04:51.684 --> 00:04:54.282
of patients with Charles Bonnet Syndrome.

00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:57.848
We’re still a long way from understanding 
all the different causes

00:04:57.848 --> 00:05:01.234
and interconnected mechanisms 
of hallucinations.
