00:00:57.987 --> 00:01:02.107
and can last for mere minutes 
or recur for years.

00:01:02.107 --> 00:01:05.621
We still don’t fully understand 
what causes them to come and go,

00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:08.778
or why certain patients develop them 
when others don’t.

00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:13.011
We do know from fMRI studies 
that these hallucinations

00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:15.519
activate the same brain areas as sight,

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:20.023
areas that are not activated 
by imagination.

00:01:20.023 --> 00:01:22.905
Many other hallucinations, 
including smells,

00:01:22.905 --> 00:01:23.785
sights,

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:24.758
and sounds,

00:01:24.758 --> 00:01:29.428
also involve the same brain areas 
as real sensory experiences.

00:01:29.428 --> 00:01:35.626
Because of this, the cerebral cortex is
thought to play a part in hallucinations.
