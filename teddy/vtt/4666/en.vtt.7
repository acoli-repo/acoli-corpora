or burst into fractal-like patterns.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.521
Evidence suggests these drugs also 
act on the cerebral cortex.

00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:39.900
But while visual impairment typically 
only causes visual hallucinations,

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.794
and hearing loss auditory ones,

00:03:41.794 --> 00:03:48.390
substances like LSD cause perceptual
disturbances across all the senses.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.115
That’s likely because they activate 
receptors in a broad range of brain areas,

00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:56.653
including the cortical regions 
for all the senses.

00:03:56.653 --> 00:04:00.679
LSD and psilocybin both function 
like serotonin in the brain,
