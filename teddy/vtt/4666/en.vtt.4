00:01:57.091 --> 00:02:00.893
When the visual cortex processes light 
into coherent images,

00:02:00.893 --> 00:02:05.529
it fills in these blind spots with 
information from the surrounding area.

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:10.462
Occasionally, we might notice a glitch,
but most of the time we’re none the wiser.

00:02:10.462 --> 00:02:15.678
When the visual cortex is deprived 
of input from the eyes, even temporarily,

00:02:15.678 --> 00:02:18.810
the brain still tries 
to create a coherent picture,

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.953
but the limits of its abilities 
become a lot more obvious.

00:02:22.953 --> 00:02:27.971
The full-blown hallucinations of

00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:30.595
Because Charles Bonnet Syndrome 
only occurs in people
