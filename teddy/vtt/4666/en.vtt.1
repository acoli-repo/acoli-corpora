Her cognitive function was excellent,

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:34.642
and she had not taken any medications 
that might cause hallucinations.

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:39.662
Strangest of all, had a real-life crowd 
of circus performers burst into her room,

00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:41.741
she wouldn’t have been able to see them:

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:44.249
she was completely blind.

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:48.439
Rosalie had developed a condition known 
as Charles Bonnet Syndrome,

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:52.127
in which patients with either impaired 
vision or total blindness

00:00:52.127 --> 00:00:55.545
suddenly hallucinate whole scenes 
in vivid color.

00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:57.987
These hallucinations appear suddenly,

00:00:57.987 --> 00:01:02.107
and can last for mere minutes 
or recur for years.
