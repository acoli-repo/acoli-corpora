00:01:29.428 --> 00:01:35.626
Because of this, the cerebral cortex is
thought to play a part in hallucinations.

00:01:35.626 --> 00:01:39.533
This thin layer of grey matter 
covers the entire cerebrum,

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:44.169
with different areas processing 
information from each of our senses.

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:47.110
But even in people
with completely unimpaired senses,

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.840
the brain constructs the world we perceive
from incomplete information.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.130
For example, our eyes have blind spots

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.091
where the optic nerve 
blocks part of the retina.

00:01:57.091 --> 00:02:00.893
When the visual cortex processes light 
into coherent images,
