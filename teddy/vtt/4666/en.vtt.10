00:04:57.848 --> 00:05:01.234
and interconnected mechanisms 
of hallucinations.

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.698
But it’s clear that 
hallucinatory experiences

00:05:03.698 --> 00:05:08.361
are much more closely tied to ordinary
perception than we once thought.

00:05:08.361 --> 00:05:09.871
And by studying hallucinations,

00:05:09.871 --> 00:05:11.453
we stand to learn a great deal

00:05:11.453 --> 00:05:14.377
about how our brains construct 
the world we see,

00:05:14.377 --> 00:05:15.086
hear,

00:05:15.086 --> 00:05:15.918
smell,

00:05:15.918 --> 00:05:17.220
and touch.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.147
As we learn more,

00:05:18.147 --> 00:05:22.248
we’ll likely come to appreciate
just how subjective and individual

00:05:22.248 --> 00:05:26.435
each person’s island universe 
of perception really is.
