00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:00.859
conditions like epilepsy and narcolepsy,

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.635
and psychiatric disorders 
like schizophrenia,

00:03:03.635 --> 00:03:06.996
are a few of the many known causes 
of hallucinations,

00:03:06.996 --> 00:03:09.229
and we’re still finding new ones.

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:11.619
Some of the most notorious hallucinations

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:15.472
are associated with drugs 
like LSD and psilocybin.

00:03:15.472 --> 00:03:20.399
Their hallmark effects include 
the sensation that dry objects are wet

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:23.068
and that surfaces are breathing.

00:03:23.068 --> 00:03:26.978
At higher doses, the visual world 
can appear to melt,

00:03:26.978 --> 00:03:28.318
dissolve into swirls,

00:03:28.318 --> 00:03:31.340
or burst into fractal-like patterns.
