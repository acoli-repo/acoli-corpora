00:03:56.653 --> 00:04:00.679
LSD and psilocybin both function 
like serotonin in the brain,

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:05.063
binding directly to one type of
serotonin receptor in particular.

00:04:05.063 --> 00:04:08.990
While serotonin’s role in the brain 
is complex and poorly understood,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.596
it likely plays an important part 
in integrating information

00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:13.378
from the eyes,

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:14.111
nose,

00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:14.881
ears,

00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:16.743
and other sensory organs.

00:04:16.743 --> 00:04:21.022
So one theory is that LSD and psilocybin
cause hallucinations

00:04:21.022 --> 00:04:25.243
by disrupting the signaling 
involved in sensory integration.

00:04:25.243 --> 00:04:27.943
Hallucinations associated 
with schizophrenia

00:04:27.943 --> 00:04:33.374
may share a similar mechanism with those
caused by LSD and psilocybin.
