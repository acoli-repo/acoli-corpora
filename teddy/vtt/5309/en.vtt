00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.583
You’re the chief advisor 
to an eccentric king

00:00:10.583 --> 00:00:13.190
who needs to declare his successor.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.340
He wants his heir to be good 
at arithmetic, lucky,

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.860
and above all else, honest.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.660
So he’s devised a competition 
to test his children,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.761
and ordered you to choose the winner.

00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:30.275
Each potential heir will be given 
the same two six-sided dice.
