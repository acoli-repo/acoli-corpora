00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And to the cosmologist,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
these galaxies are just the atoms, as it were, of the large-scale universe.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
This picture shows a patch of sky

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
so small that it would take about 100 patches like it

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
to cover the full moon in the sky.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Through a small telescope, this would look quite blank,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
but you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Each is a galaxy, fully like ours or Andromeda,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
which looks so small and faint because its light

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
has taken 10 billion light-years to get to us.
