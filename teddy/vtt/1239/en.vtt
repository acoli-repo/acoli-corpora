If you take 10,000 people at random, 9,999 have something in common:

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
their interests in business lie on or near the Earth's surface.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The odd one out is an astronomer, and I am one of that strange breed.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
(Laughter)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
My talk will be in two parts. I'll talk first as an astronomer,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and then as a worried member of the human race.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
how we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution.
