00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
how we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
is to go back before Darwin's simple beginning,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to set our Earth in a cosmic context.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And let me just run through a few slides.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This was the impact that happened last week on a comet.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If they'd sent a nuke, it would have been rather more spectacular

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
than what actually happened last Monday.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So that's another project for NASA.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
That's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year.
