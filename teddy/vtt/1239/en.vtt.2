That's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This artist's impression turned into reality

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
when a parachute landed on Titan, Saturn's giant moon.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It landed on the surface. This is pictures taken on the way down.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That looks like a coastline.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It is indeed, but the ocean is liquid methane --

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
the temperature minus 170 degrees centigrade.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If we go beyond our solar system,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light.
