00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And we can see places where stars are forming,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
like the Eagle Nebula. We see stars dying.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
In six billion years, the sun will look like that.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
leaving remnants like that.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
On a still bigger scale, we see entire galaxies of stars.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And to the cosmologist,
