00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.536
When Nicolas Bourbaki applied 
to the American Mathematical Society

00:00:11.536 --> 00:00:12.926
in the 1950s,

00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:17.086
he was already one of the most influential
mathematicians of his time.

00:00:17.086 --> 00:00:19.766
He’d published articles 
in international journals

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:22.446
and his textbooks were required reading.

00:00:22.446 --> 00:00:27.407
Yet his application was firmly rejected 
for one simple reason—

00:00:27.407 --> 00:00:30.987
Nicolas Bourbaki did not exist.
