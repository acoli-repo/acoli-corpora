00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:01.257
but so far, we have been able

00:09:01.257 --> 00:09:03.866
to successfully identify the microRNA pattern

00:09:03.866 --> 00:09:07.128
of pancreatic cancer, lung cancer,

00:09:07.128 --> 00:09:10.188
breast cancer and hepatic cancer.

00:09:10.188 --> 00:09:13.370
And currently, we're doing a clinical trial

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.249
in collaboration with the
German Cancer Research Center

00:09:16.249 --> 00:09:19.840
with 200 women for breast cancer.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.448
(Applause)

00:09:23.448 --> 00:09:26.162
This is the single non-invasive,

00:09:26.162 --> 00:09:28.904
accurate and affordable test

00:09:28.904 --> 00:09:31.150
that has the potential to dramatically change
