00:05:58.467 --> 00:06:00.908
Imagine that next time you go to your doctor

00:06:00.908 --> 00:06:02.831
and do your next standard blood test,

00:06:02.831 --> 00:06:05.183
a lab technician extracts a total RNA,

00:06:05.183 --> 00:06:07.106
which is quite simple today,

00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:09.898
and puts it in a standard 
96-well plate like this one.

00:06:09.898 --> 00:06:11.565
Each well of these plates

00:06:11.565 --> 00:06:14.204
has specific biochemistry that we assign,

00:06:14.204 --> 00:06:16.544
that is looking for a specific microRNA,

00:06:16.544 --> 00:06:18.323
acting like a trap that closes

00:06:18.323 --> 00:06:20.680
only when the microRNA is present in the sample,

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.801
and when it does, it will shine with green color.

00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:24.904
To run the reaction,

00:06:24.904 --> 00:06:28.040
you put the plate inside a device like this one,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.930
and then you can put your smartphone on top of it.
