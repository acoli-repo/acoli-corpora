WEBVTT

00:03:29.377 --> 00:03:32.275
at the very early stages through a blood sample.

00:03:32.275 --> 00:03:35.223
We do it by detecting a set of very small molecules

00:03:35.223 --> 00:03:36.892
that circulate freely in our blood

00:03:36.892 --> 00:03:39.688
called microRNAs.

00:03:39.688 --> 00:03:41.999
To explain what microRNAs are

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.214
and their important role in cancer,

00:03:44.214 --> 00:03:45.607
I need to start with proteins,

00:03:45.607 --> 00:03:48.160
because when cancer is present in our body,

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.591
protein modification is observed

00:03:49.591 --> 00:03:51.202
in all cancerous cells.

00:03:51.202 --> 00:03:52.575
As you might know,

00:03:52.575 --> 00:03:54.850
proteins are large biological molecules

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.190
that perform different functions within our body,

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.275
like catalyzing metabolic reactions

00:03:59.275 --> 00:04:01.121
or responding to stimuli
