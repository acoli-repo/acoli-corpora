00:06:58.455 --> 00:07:00.300
but when the process is over,

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.325
wells that shine are matched 
with the specific microRNAs

00:07:03.325 --> 00:07:05.969
and analyzed in terms of how much and how fast

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:07.218
they shine.

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:11.486
And then, when this entire process is over,

00:07:11.486 --> 00:07:13.944
this is what happens.

00:07:13.944 --> 00:07:16.541
This chart is showing the specific microRNAs

00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:17.976
present in this sample

00:07:17.976 --> 00:07:20.388
and how they reacted over time.

00:07:20.388 --> 00:07:22.890
Then, if we take this specific pattern of microRNA

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:24.296
of this person's samples

00:07:24.296 --> 00:07:27.272
and compare it with existing scientific documentation

00:07:27.272 --> 00:07:29.220
that correlates microRNA patterns

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.501
with a specific presence of a disease,
