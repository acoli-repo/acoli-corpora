00:05:29.401 --> 00:05:31.950
is that we cannot use existing DNA-based technology

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.563
to detect them in a reliable way,

00:05:34.563 --> 00:05:37.353
because they are very short sequences of nucleotides,

00:05:37.353 --> 00:05:39.535
much smaller than DNA.

00:05:39.535 --> 00:05:42.550
And also, all microRNAs are
very similar to each other,

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.597
with just tiny differences.

00:05:44.597 --> 00:05:47.117
So imagine trying to differentiate two molecules,

00:05:47.117 --> 00:05:50.311
extremely similar, extremely small.

00:05:50.311 --> 00:05:53.217
We believe that we have found a way to do so,

00:05:53.217 --> 00:05:55.966
and this is the first time that we've shown it in public.

00:05:55.966 --> 00:05:58.467
Let me do a demonstration.

00:05:58.467 --> 00:06:00.908
Imagine that next time you go to your doctor
