00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:03.156
recent advances have leveled it
up for biotech progress as well,

00:03:03.156 --> 00:03:04.449
and that is allowing

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:06.564
multidisciplinary teams like ours

00:03:06.564 --> 00:03:09.219
to try to tackle and look at these problems

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:11.570
with new approaches.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.193
We are a team of scientists and technologists

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:17.183
from Chile, Panama,

00:03:17.183 --> 00:03:20.570
Mexico, Israel and Greece,

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.192
and based on recent scientific discoveries,

00:03:23.192 --> 00:03:24.574
we believe that we have found

00:03:24.574 --> 00:03:27.375
a reliable and accurate way

00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:29.377
of detecting several types of cancer

00:03:29.377 --> 00:03:32.275
at the very early stages through a blood sample.
