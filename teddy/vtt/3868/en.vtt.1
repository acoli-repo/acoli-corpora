00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:33.793
again her health wasn't getting any better.

00:00:33.793 --> 00:00:37.483
So finally, they decided to do a biopsy,

00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:38.700
and two weeks later,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.443
the results of the biopsy came back.

00:00:41.443 --> 00:00:46.212
It was stage 3 lung cancer.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:49.114
Her lifestyle was almost free of risk.

00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:50.847
She never smoked a cigarette,

00:00:50.847 --> 00:00:52.613
she never drank alcohol,

00:00:52.613 --> 00:00:53.715
and she had been playing sports

00:00:53.715 --> 00:00:55.897
for almost half her life.

00:00:55.897 --> 00:00:59.073
Perhaps, that is why it took them almost six months

00:00:59.073 --> 00:01:02.197
to get her properly diagnosed.
