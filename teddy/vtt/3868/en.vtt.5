00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.276
and more accessible than ever before.

00:02:30.276 --> 00:02:31.648
The context, of course,

00:02:31.648 --> 00:02:33.191
is that we're living at a time

00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:34.600
where technology is disrupting our present

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.107
at exponential rates,

00:02:36.107 --> 00:02:39.117
and the biological realm is no exception.

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:41.547
It is said today that biotech is advancing

00:02:41.547 --> 00:02:43.842
at least six times faster than the growth rate

00:02:43.842 --> 00:02:46.218
of the processing power of computers.

00:02:46.218 --> 00:02:47.530
But progress in biotech

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.170
is not only being accelerated,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.216
it is also being democratized.

00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:54.428
Just as personal computers or the Internet

00:02:54.428 --> 00:02:56.879
or smartphones leveled the playing field

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.736
for entrepreneurship, politics or education,

00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:03.156
recent advances have leveled it
up for biotech progress as well,
