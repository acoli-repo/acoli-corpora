00:07:58.426 --> 00:08:01.863
and analyze them with our contextual information.

00:08:01.863 --> 00:08:03.341
If we want to better understand

00:08:03.341 --> 00:08:05.456
and decode diseases like cancer,

00:08:05.456 --> 00:08:06.806
we need to stop treating them

00:08:06.806 --> 00:08:08.988
as acute, isolated episodes,

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.912
and consider and measure everything

00:08:10.912 --> 00:08:15.220
that affects our health on a permanent basis.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.506
This entire platform is a working prototype.

00:08:19.506 --> 00:08:22.971
It uses state-of-the-art molecular biology,

00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:25.717
a low-cost, 3D-printed device,

00:08:25.717 --> 00:08:27.679
and data science

00:08:27.679 --> 00:08:31.594
to try to tackle one of humanity's 
toughest challenges.
