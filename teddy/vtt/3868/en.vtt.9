00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.900
So microRNAs are small molecules

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.100
that regulate gene expression.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.315
Unlike DNA, which is mainly fixed,

00:04:35.315 --> 00:04:37.464
microRNAs can vary depending on internal

00:04:37.464 --> 00:04:40.321
and environmental conditions at any given time,

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:43.775
telling us which genes are actively 
expressed at that particular moment.

00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:45.194
And that is what makes microRNAs

00:04:45.194 --> 00:04:47.495
such a promising biomarker for cancer,

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:49.377
because as you know,

00:04:49.377 --> 00:04:53.190
cancer is a disease of altered gene expression.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.744
It is the uncontrolled regulation of genes.

00:04:56.744 --> 00:04:58.398
Another important thing to consider

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:00.817
is that no two cancers are the same,
