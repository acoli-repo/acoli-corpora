00:01:27.248 --> 00:01:30.420
discarding diseases over and over,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.800
was stressful and frustrating,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.712
especially for my aunt.

00:01:34.712 --> 00:01:37.423
And that is the way cancer diagnosis has been done

00:01:37.423 --> 00:01:39.763
since the beginning of history.

00:01:39.763 --> 00:01:42.609
We have 21st-century medical treatments and drugs

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:44.172
to treat cancer,

00:01:44.172 --> 00:01:46.714

00:01:46.714 --> 00:01:50.842
and processes for diagnosis, if any.

00:01:50.842 --> 00:01:53.486
Today, most of us have to wait for symptoms

00:01:53.486 --> 00:01:55.953
to indicate that something is wrong.

00:01:55.953 --> 00:01:58.470
Today, the majority of people still don't have access

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.888
to early cancer detection methods,
