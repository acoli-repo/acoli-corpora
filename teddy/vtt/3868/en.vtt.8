00:03:59.275 --> 00:04:01.121
or responding to stimuli

00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:02.923
or replicating DNA,

00:04:02.923 --> 00:04:05.666
but before a protein is expressed or produced,

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:07.364
relevant parts of its genetic code

00:04:07.364 --> 00:04:09.513
present in the DNA

00:04:09.513 --> 00:04:13.482
are copied into the messenger RNA,

00:04:13.482 --> 00:04:15.392
so this messenger RNA

00:04:15.392 --> 00:04:19.106
has instructions on how to build a specific protein,

00:04:19.106 --> 00:04:21.706
and potentially it can build hundreds of proteins,

00:04:21.706 --> 00:04:24.303
but the one that tells them when to build them

00:04:24.303 --> 00:04:26.632
and how many to build

00:04:26.632 --> 00:04:29.070
are microRNAs.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.900
So microRNAs are small molecules
