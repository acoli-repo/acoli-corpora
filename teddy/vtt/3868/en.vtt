Almost a year ago,

00:00:02.036 --> 00:00:04.897
my aunt started suffering back pains.

00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:06.262
She went to see the doctor

00:00:06.262 --> 00:00:08.511
and they told her it was a normal injury

00:00:08.511 --> 00:00:10.165
for someone who had been playing tennis

00:00:10.165 --> 00:00:12.190
for almost 30 years.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.158
They recommended that she do some therapy,

00:00:14.158 --> 00:00:17.253
but after a while she wasn't feeling better,

00:00:17.253 --> 00:00:20.593
so the doctors decided to do further tests.

00:00:20.593 --> 00:00:21.592
They did an x-ray

00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:23.681
and discovered an injury in her lungs,

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:25.238
and at the time they thought that the injury

00:00:25.238 --> 00:00:26.796
was a strain in the muscles and tendons

00:00:26.796 --> 00:00:27.966
between her ribs,

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.735
but after a few weeks of treatment,

00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:33.793
again her health wasn't getting any better.
