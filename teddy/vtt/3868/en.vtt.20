00:09:58.793 --> 00:10:00.941
It is too expensive for our families.

00:10:00.941 --> 00:10:03.393
It is too expensive for humanity.

00:10:03.393 --> 00:10:06.340
We cannot lose the war against cancer.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.230
It not only costs us billions of dollars,

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.152
but it also costs us the people we love.

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:14.650
Today, my aunt, she's fighting bravely

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.560
and going through this process
with a very positive attitude.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.138
However, I want fights like this

00:10:20.138 --> 00:10:21.761
to become very rare.

00:10:21.761 --> 00:10:22.888
I want to see the day

00:10:22.888 --> 00:10:24.815
when cancer is treated easily

00:10:24.815 --> 00:10:26.967
because it can be routinely diagnosed

00:10:26.967 --> 00:10:28.924
at the very early stages,

00:10:28.924 --> 00:10:30.016
and I'm certain
