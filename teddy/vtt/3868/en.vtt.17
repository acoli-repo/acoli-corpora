00:08:27.679 --> 00:08:31.594
to try to tackle one of humanity's 
toughest challenges.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.596
Since we believe early cancer detection

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:35.384
should really be democratized,

00:08:35.384 --> 00:08:37.769
this entire solution costs at least 50 times less

00:08:37.769 --> 00:08:39.770
than current available methods,

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.503
and we know that the community can help us

00:08:41.503 --> 00:08:42.988
accelerate this even more,

00:08:42.988 --> 00:08:44.923
so we're making the design of the device

00:08:44.923 --> 00:08:47.400
open-source.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.994
(Applause)

00:08:55.944 --> 00:08:57.541
Let me say very clearly

00:08:57.541 --> 00:08:59.276
that we are at the very early stages,

00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:01.257
but so far, we have been able
