00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.888
to early cancer detection methods,

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:02.260
even though we know

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.184
that catching cancer early

00:02:04.184 --> 00:02:05.647
is basically the closest thing we have

00:02:05.647 --> 00:02:09.127
to a silver bullet cure against it.

00:02:09.127 --> 00:02:11.608
We know that we can change this in our lifetime,

00:02:11.608 --> 00:02:13.160
and that is why my team and I

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.354
have decided to begin this journey,

00:02:15.354 --> 00:02:17.860
this journey to try to make cancer detection

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.405
at the early stages

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:22.557
and monitoring the appropriate 
response at the molecular level

00:02:22.557 --> 00:02:26.819
easier, cheaper, smarter

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.276
and more accessible than ever before.
