00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.501
with a specific presence of a disease,

00:07:34.501 --> 00:07:37.950
this is how pancreatic cancer looks like.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.607
This inside is a real sample

00:07:40.607 --> 00:07:43.926
where we just detected pancreatic cancer.

00:07:43.926 --> 00:07:48.365
(Applause)

00:07:52.086 --> 00:07:54.444
Another important aspect of this approach

00:07:54.444 --> 00:07:56.783
is the gathering and mining of data in the cloud,

00:07:56.783 --> 00:07:58.426
so we can get results in real time

00:07:58.426 --> 00:08:01.863
and analyze them with our contextual information.
