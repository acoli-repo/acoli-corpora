00:00:06.758 --> 00:00:10.428
A mother and her son trek 
across an endless desert.

00:00:10.428 --> 00:00:14.895
Wearing special skin-tight suits 
to dissipate heat and recycle moisture,

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:17.693
the travelers arenâ€™t worried 
about dying of thirst.

00:00:17.693 --> 00:00:19.924
Their fears are much greater.

00:00:19.924 --> 00:00:22.259
The pair try to walk without rhythm,

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.531
letting the vibrations of their footsteps 
blend into the shifting sands.

00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:31.174
But soon, the sound of the desert 
is drowned out by a louder hissing.
