CA: So there are scenarios
where in the US,

00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:32.539
like, if you extrapolate
those numbers forward,

00:02:32.563 --> 00:02:33.763
we end up with, what,

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:36.355
more than a quarter of a million

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.087
even this year if we're not careful,

00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:42.544
and worldwide, I guess the death toll
could, by the end of the year,

00:02:42.568 --> 00:02:45.774
be well into the millions, with an "s."

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:49.114

temperatures of the summer

00:02:49.138 --> 00:02:51.802
actually have been helping us?

00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:54.913
BG: They're not absolutely sure,

00:02:54.937 --> 00:03:01.937
but certainly, the IHME model
definitely wanted to use the season,
