00:10:57.779 --> 00:11:01.193
will it also stop you
from being a transmitter?

00:11:01.217 --> 00:11:02.424
CA: So that vaccine,

00:11:02.448 --> 00:11:05.036
it's such an important question,
let's come on to that.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.244
But before we go there,

00:11:06.268 --> 00:11:08.416
any other surprises
in the last couple months

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.370
that we've learned about this virus

00:11:10.394 --> 00:11:13.909
that really impact how
we should respond to it?

00:11:14.846 --> 00:11:19.612
BG: We're still not able to characterize
who the super-spreaders are

00:11:19.636 --> 00:11:21.934
in terms of what that profile is,

00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:23.365
and we may never.

00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:25.394
That may just be quite random.

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:28.329
If you could identify them,

00:11:28.353 --> 00:11:30.866
they're responsible
for the majority of transmission,
