00:05:56.831 --> 00:06:00.709
unfortunately, that will
work its way back,

00:06:00.733 --> 00:06:03.188
both the time lag and the transmission,

00:06:03.212 --> 00:06:04.853
back up into the elderly,

00:06:04.877 --> 00:06:07.367
will start to push the death rate back up,

00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:10.409
which, it is down --

00:06:10.433 --> 00:06:15.008
way down from 2,000
to around 500 right now.

00:06:15.653 --> 00:06:18.467
CA: And is that partly because
there's a three-week lag

00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:21.631
between case numbers and fatality numbers?

00:06:21.655 --> 00:06:23.982
And also, perhaps, partly because

00:06:24.006 --> 00:06:26.899
there have been
some effective interventions,

00:06:26.923 --> 00:06:29.346
and we're actually seeing the possibility

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.076
that the overall fatality rate
is actually falling a bit
