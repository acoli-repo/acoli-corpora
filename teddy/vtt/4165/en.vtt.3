00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:32.652
and that's worse than
I would have expected a month ago,

00:01:32.676 --> 00:01:35.745
the degree to which we're back
at high mobility,

00:01:35.769 --> 00:01:37.210
not wearing masks,

00:01:37.234 --> 00:01:42.127
and now the virus actually
has gotten into a lot of cities

00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:47.650
that it hadn't been in before
in a significant way,

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:50.756
so it's going to be a challenge.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.297
There's no case where we get
much below the current death rate,

00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:57.574
which is about 500 deaths a day,

00:01:57.598 --> 00:02:01.118
but there's a significant risk
we'd go back up
