A study that our foundation
funded in the UK

00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:03.633
found the only thing
other than remdesivir

00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:06.429
that is a proven therapeutic,

00:07:06.453 --> 00:07:08.435
which is the dexamethasone,

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:11.159
that for serious patients,

00:07:11.183 --> 00:07:15.213
is about a 20 percent death reduction,

00:07:15.237 --> 00:07:20.288
and there's still quite
a pipeline of those things.

00:07:20.312 --> 00:07:23.835
You know, hydroxychloroquine
never established positive data,

00:07:23.859 --> 00:07:26.161
so that's pretty much done.

00:07:26.185 --> 00:07:28.528
There's still a few trials ongoing,

00:07:28.552 --> 00:07:31.145
but the list of things being tried,
