00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:30.164
and the fact that there's not
a coughing element

00:09:30.188 --> 00:09:33.339
is not a major piece like the flu or TB.

00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:36.844
CA: Yeah, that is
devilish cunning by the virus.

00:09:36.868 --> 00:09:41.564
I mean, how much is
that nonsymptomatic transmission

00:09:41.588 --> 00:09:43.503
as a percentage of total transmission?

00:09:43.527 --> 00:09:46.891
I've heard numbers it could be
as much as half of all transmissions

00:09:46.915 --> 00:09:49.225
are basically presymptomatic.

00:09:49.982 --> 00:09:52.578
BG: Yeah, if you count presymptomatics,

00:09:52.602 --> 00:09:56.568
then most of the studies show
that's like at 40 percent,

00:09:57.044 --> 00:10:00.767
and we also have never symptomatics.
