00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.076
that the overall fatality rate
is actually falling a bit

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.234
now that we've gained
some extra knowledge?

00:06:34.822 --> 00:06:38.667
BG: Yeah, certainly
your fatality rate is always lower

00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:40.277
when you're not overloaded.

00:06:40.301 --> 00:06:43.445
And so Italy, when they were overloaded,

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:46.108
Spain, even New York at the start,

00:06:46.132 --> 00:06:48.569
certainly China,

00:06:48.593 --> 00:06:53.857
there you weren't even able
to provide the basics,

00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:56.674
the oxygen and things.
