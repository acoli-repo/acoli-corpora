00:11:57.484 --> 00:12:03.285
you're not exhaling in loud talking

00:12:03.309 --> 00:12:05.897
quite as much as in other
indoor environments.

00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:07.095
CA: Hmm.

00:12:07.119 --> 00:12:10.407
What do you think about the ethics
of someone who would go on a plane

00:12:10.431 --> 00:12:11.955
and refuse to wear a mask?

00:12:11.979 --> 00:12:15.156
BG: If they own the plane,
that would be fine.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.033
If there's other people on the plane,

00:12:18.057 --> 00:12:21.091
that would be endangering
those other people.

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:22.593
CA: Early on in the pandemic,

00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:27.787
the WHO did not advise
that people wear masks.

00:12:27.811 --> 00:12:33.250
They were worried about taking them away
from frontline medical providers.
