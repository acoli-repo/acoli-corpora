If you get a lot of young people infected,

00:01:00.707 --> 00:01:03.839
eventually, they will infect
old people again,

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:06.842
and so you'll get into the nursing homes,

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.023
the homeless shelters,

00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:11.723
the places where we've had
a lot of our deaths.

00:01:11.747 --> 00:01:15.181
The innovation track,
which probably we'll touch on --

00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:17.653
diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines --

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:20.334
there's good progress there,

00:01:20.358 --> 00:01:24.141
but nothing that would
fundamentally alter the fact

00:01:24.165 --> 00:01:28.063
that this fall in the United States
could be quite bad,

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:32.652
and that's worse than
I would have expected a month ago,
