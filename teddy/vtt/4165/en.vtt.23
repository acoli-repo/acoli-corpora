00:11:28.353 --> 00:11:30.866
they're responsible
for the majority of transmission,

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:33.829
a few people who have
very high viral loads.

00:11:33.853 --> 00:11:38.764
But sadly, we haven't figured that out.

00:11:38.788 --> 00:11:40.090
This mode of transmission,

00:11:40.114 --> 00:11:42.764
if you're in a room and nobody talks,

00:11:42.788 --> 00:11:45.804
there's way less transmission.

00:11:45.828 --> 00:11:48.826
That's partly why,
although planes can transmit,

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:53.887
it's less than you would expect
just in terms of time proximity measures,

00:11:53.911 --> 00:11:57.460
because unlike, say,
a choir or a restaurant,

00:11:57.484 --> 00:12:03.285
you're not exhaling in loud talking
