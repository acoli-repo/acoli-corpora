00:07:28.552 --> 00:07:31.145
but the list of things being tried,

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:35.545
including, eventually,
the monoclonal antibodies,

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:39.008
we will have some additional
tools for the fall.

00:07:39.032 --> 00:07:42.686
And so when you talk about death rates,

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.162
the good news is,
some innovation we already have,

00:07:46.186 --> 00:07:49.956
and we'll have more, even in the fall.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.244
We should start to have
monoclonal antibodies,

00:07:53.268 --> 00:07:57.850
which is the single therapeutic
that I'm most excited about.

00:07:57.874 --> 00:08:01.232
CA: I'll actually ask you to tell me
a bit more about that in one sec,
