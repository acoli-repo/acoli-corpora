00:10:29.892 --> 00:10:31.058
CA: Right.

00:10:31.082 --> 00:10:34.024
And so if you add in the never symptomatic

00:10:34.048 --> 00:10:36.420
to the presymptomatic,

00:10:36.444 --> 00:10:38.691
do you get above 50 percent
of the transmission

00:10:38.715 --> 00:10:40.994
is actually from nonsymptomatic people?

00:10:41.018 --> 00:10:45.056
BG: Yeah, transmission
is harder to measure.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.829
You know, we see certain
hotspots and things,

00:10:48.853 --> 00:10:51.658
but that's a huge question
with the vaccine:

00:10:51.682 --> 00:10:55.972
Will it, besides avoiding
you getting sick,

00:10:55.996 --> 00:10:57.755
which is what the trial will test,

00:10:57.779 --> 00:11:01.193
will it also stop you
from being a transmitter?
