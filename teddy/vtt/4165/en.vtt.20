00:09:57.044 --> 00:10:00.767
and we also have never symptomatics.

00:10:00.791 --> 00:10:04.169
The amount of virus you get
in your upper respiratory area

00:10:04.193 --> 00:10:05.634
is somewhat disconnected.

00:10:05.658 --> 00:10:08.678
Some people will have a lot here
and very little in their lungs,

00:10:08.702 --> 00:10:13.729
and what you get in your lungs
causes the really bad symptoms --

00:10:13.753 --> 00:10:16.896
and other organs, but mostly the lungs --

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.234
and so that's when you seek treatment.

00:10:19.258 --> 00:10:21.318
And so the worst case
in terms of spreading

00:10:21.342 --> 00:10:24.451
is somebody who's got a lot
in the upper respiratory tract

00:10:24.475 --> 00:10:26.689
but almost none in their lungs,

00:10:26.713 --> 00:10:29.006
so they're not care-seeking.

00:10:29.892 --> 00:10:31.058
CA: Right.
