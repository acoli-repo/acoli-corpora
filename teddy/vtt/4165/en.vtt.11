00:05:28.534 --> 00:05:32.221
and you have testing-positive
rates in young people

00:05:32.245 --> 00:05:38.505
that are actually higher than what we saw
even in some of the tougher areas.

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:42.955
And so, clearly, younger people
have come out of mobility

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.788
more than older people
have increased their mobility,

00:05:46.812 --> 00:05:51.355
so the age structure
is right now very young,

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.490
but because of
multigenerational households,

00:05:54.514 --> 00:05:56.807
people work in nursing care homes,

00:05:56.831 --> 00:06:00.709
unfortunately, that will
work its way back,
