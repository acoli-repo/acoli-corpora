Chris Anderson: Welcome, Bill Gates.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.127
Bill Gates: Thank you.

00:00:04.151 --> 00:00:06.552
CA: Alright. It's great
to have you here, Bill.

00:00:06.576 --> 00:00:09.310
You know, we had a TED conversation
about three months ago

00:00:09.334 --> 00:00:10.494
about this pandemic,

00:00:10.518 --> 00:00:14.044
and back then, I think fewer than --
I think that was the end of March --

00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:16.854
back then, fewer than
1,000 people in the US had died

00:00:16.878 --> 00:00:19.934
and fewer than 20,000 worldwide.

00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:24.326
I mean, the numbers now are,
like, 128,000 dead in the US

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.127
and more than half a million worldwide,

00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:28.650
in three months.

00:00:28.674 --> 00:00:30.021
In three months.
