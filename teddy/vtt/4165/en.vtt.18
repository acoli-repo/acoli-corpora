00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:03.669
where you would kind of notice,
"Hey, I'm coughing" --

00:09:03.693 --> 00:09:06.383

it's not coughing,

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:13.370

causes that spread,

00:09:18.957 --> 00:09:21.893
and that's pretty novel,

00:09:21.917 --> 00:09:25.971
and so even the experts have to say,
"Wow, this caught us by surprise."

00:09:25.995 --> 00:09:27.637
The amount of asymptomatic spread

00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:30.164
and the fact that there's not
a coughing element
