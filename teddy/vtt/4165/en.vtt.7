00:03:28.018 --> 00:03:30.142
to match why May wasn't worse,

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:34.182
why June wasn't worse than it was."

00:03:34.206 --> 00:03:39.487
And we see in the Southern Hemisphere,

00:03:39.511 --> 00:03:41.822
you know, Brazil,

00:03:41.846 --> 00:03:43.815
which is the opposite season,

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:48.093
now all of South America
is having a huge epidemic.

00:03:48.117 --> 00:03:53.139
South Africa is having
a very fast-growing epidemic.

00:03:53.163 --> 00:03:55.141
Fortunately, Australia and New Zealand,

00:03:55.165 --> 00:03:57.318
the last countries
in the Southern Hemisphere,

00:03:57.342 --> 00:03:59.456
are at really tiny case counts,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.014
and so although they have
to keep knocking it down,
