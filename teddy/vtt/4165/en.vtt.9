00:04:29.626 --> 00:04:31.994
But nonetheless,
smart policies down there.

00:04:32.018 --> 00:04:33.946
BG: Yeah, everything is so exponential

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.908
that a little bit of good work
goes a long way.

00:04:36.932 --> 00:04:38.841
It's not a linear game.

00:04:38.865 --> 00:04:43.549
You know, contact tracing, if you have
the number of cases we have in the US,

00:04:43.573 --> 00:04:45.810
it's super important to do,

00:04:45.834 --> 00:04:48.274
but it won't get you back down to zero.

00:04:48.298 --> 00:04:49.897
It'll help you be down,

00:04:49.921 --> 00:04:52.633
but it's too overwhelming.

00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:56.355
CA: OK, so in May and June in the US,

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.578
the numbers were slightly better
than some of the models predicted,

00:04:59.602 --> 00:05:03.293
and it's hypothesized that that might be
partly because of the warmer weather.
