00:04:59.602 --> 00:05:03.293
and it's hypothesized that that might be
partly because of the warmer weather.

00:05:03.317 --> 00:05:05.708
Now we're seeing, really,

00:05:05.732 --> 00:05:10.961
as really quite alarming upticks
in case rates in the US?

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:13.071
BG: That's right, it's --

00:05:13.603 --> 00:05:17.579
In, say, the New York area,

00:05:17.603 --> 00:05:20.715
the cases continue to go down somewhat,

00:05:20.739 --> 00:05:22.896
but in other parts of the country,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.390
primarily the South right now,

00:05:26.414 --> 00:05:28.510
you have increases
that are offsetting that,

00:05:28.534 --> 00:05:32.221
and you have testing-positive
rates in young people
