00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.456
but I just knew that at that moment

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.536
it was really important for me
to just focus right there

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.816
at the Australian Open,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.096
and I was definitely not sure what to do.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.496
I was like, can I play?

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.976
I know it's very dangerous, maybe,
sometimes in the first 12 weeks or so,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.856
so I had a lot of questions.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.416
GK: But not only did you play,
Ms. Williams, you won.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.016
(Cheers)

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.240
SW: Yeah.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.536
May I just say, 23 grand slams to you.
