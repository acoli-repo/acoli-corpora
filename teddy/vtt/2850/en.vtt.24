00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.336
and this incredible love,

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.656
and I think it's important for people
to realize you can be successful

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.936
but you can still have
a wonderful relationship.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.656
On the court we are mortal enemies,

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.496
but the second we shake hands,
we are best friends again.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.136
And if I lose, it might be
a day later for me,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.376
but for Venus --

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.416
(Laughter)

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.296
GK: There's never a time on the court
where you hit the ball

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.736
and say, "That's for seventh grade
when you did the blah blah blah"?

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.496
You never have any moment like that?

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.696
SW: I feel like she should have
those moments,
