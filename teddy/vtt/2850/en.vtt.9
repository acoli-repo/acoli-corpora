and to stand up for myself.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.936
And at that point it was
really important for me to say,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.816
like, I'm not afraid,
I'm not going anywhere,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.416
but this is inappropriate,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.896

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.536
Have you thought, am I coming back?

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.416
Will I take some time off?

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.376
