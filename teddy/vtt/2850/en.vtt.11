So that's been so inspiring to me,
especially recently,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.936
and I know that
it's something I want to do.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.136
And my story is definitely not over yet.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.056
I was talking to my coach about it,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.376
and we were talking about
how this is just a new part of my life,

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.416
and my baby's going to be in the stands

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.336
and hopefully cheering for me,
not crying too much.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.136
GK: No, you wrote a beautiful
letter to your baby yesterday

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.936
that you said -- from the oldest mommy
to the youngest one,

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.096
to the oldest, to the youngest,
I can't wait for you to get here.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.536
A lot of people feel that.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.776
I saw you about a year ago,
because I think about your life, Serena.
