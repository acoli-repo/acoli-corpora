00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.656
SW: So 30 minutes later --
my phone doesn't ring that much --

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.896
and 30 minutes later,
I missed like four calls,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.256
and I'm like, that's weird,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.216
and then I picked it up
and I was like, oh no.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.456
But it was a good moment.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.176
I was gonna wait literally
just five or six more days -- that's OK.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.616
GK: I know, because it was weird,
Serena, because it only said 20 weeks,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.496
so it's not like there was
a whole lot of information on it.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.256
SW: Exactly, so that's
what I've been doing all this time.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.616
I've been just tracking it.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.056
18, 19 -- every week
I'd just take a picture and save it,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.816
and I've been so good about it,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.096
and this was the one time that I slipped.
