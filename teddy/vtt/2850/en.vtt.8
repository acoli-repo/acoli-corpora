SW: Well, I think there are
very inappropriate comments,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.336
and not only that, I've been
really supportive of my peers

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.176
and the people that I've worked with.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.936
I've been a pro for almost 20 years,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.496
and so for me, it's really important
to hold women up,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.536
and it's something that these young women,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.896
they'll come to the locker room,
they'll want to take pictures with me,

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.255
and for me, it's just like,

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:19.416
I want to be able to be a good leader
and a good example for them.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.656
So not only --

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.896
(Applause)

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.096
Not only did he have rude things
to say about me and my peers,

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.816
I felt it was important
for us to stand up for each other

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.216
and to stand up for myself.
