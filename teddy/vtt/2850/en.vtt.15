so I was running around like crazy,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.016
and he, it was a simple gesture
of this shirt that he had,

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.616

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.976
and it was -- it's a weird story.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.976

Did you know it was coming?

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.736
SW: Yeah, I actually

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.176
I really love my life.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.736
I love my freedom.
