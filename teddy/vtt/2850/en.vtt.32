00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.536
I was like, I'm not going to do this.

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.176
But then after I won the US Open,

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.456
I realized that my body helped me
reach goals that I wanted to reach,

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.176
and I wanted to be happy with it,

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.576
and I was so appreciative of it.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.816
I'm always healthy.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.656
I'm really fortunate and superblessed,

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.616
and I felt like not only
am I happy with my body,

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.776
but I want other people
and other young girls

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.496
that have experienced
what I've experienced

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.896
to be happy with themselves.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.176
So whatever people say --

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.616
masculine, whatever,
too much, too little --

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.016
I'm OK with it as long as I love myself.
