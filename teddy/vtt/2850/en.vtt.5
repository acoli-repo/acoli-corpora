00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.536
May I just say, 23 grand slams to you.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.776
SW: Thank you.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.016
(Applause)

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.416
GK: While pregnant!

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.776
SW: Well, I was looking
for another handicap, so ... no.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.936
GK: Did you play differently that game,
knowing you were pregnant?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.016
SW: I did. It wasn't very easy.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.976
You hear all these stories
about people when they're pregnant,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.616
they get sick and they get tired.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.296
GK: Have you had morning sickness?

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.096
SW: No, I've been so fortunate
and so I haven't.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.216
But they get really tired
and they get really stressed out,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.176
and I had to really take all that energy,
