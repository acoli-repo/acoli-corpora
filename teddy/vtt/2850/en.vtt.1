00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.016
What do you mean?

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.096
Serena Williams: Well,
actually, it was an accident.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.896
I was on vacation,
just taking some time for myself,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.896
and I have this thing
where I've been checking my status

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.256
and taking pictures every week
to see how far along I'm going --

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.176
GK: And sharing it with friends, maybe?

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.896
SW: No, actually
I have just been saving it,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.936
and I didn't really tell a lot of people,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.536
to be quite honest,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.776
and I'd been saving it,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.056
and you know how social media is,
you press the wrong button and --

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.096
(Laughter)

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.736
GK: And there it was.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.656
SW: So 30 minutes later --
my phone doesn't ring that much --
