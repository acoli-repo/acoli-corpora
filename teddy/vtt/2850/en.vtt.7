00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.576
and really figure out
what the next step for me to do was.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.176
GK: You have a lot of support.
You have a lot of love.

Even when I was coming here,
people stopped me at the airport.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.616
I was saying to the flight attendant,
the pilot, "Guess where I'm going?"

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.136

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.976

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.896
but you responded. Why did you respond?

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.576
SW: Well, I think there are
very inappropriate comments,
