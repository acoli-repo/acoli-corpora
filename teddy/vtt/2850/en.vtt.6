00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.176
and I had to really take all that energy,

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.216
put it in a paper bag, so to say,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.456
and throw it away,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.616
because I really felt
like I didn't have time

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.736
to deal with any extra emotions,
any extra anything,

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.176
because pregnant or not, no one knew,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.176
and I was supposed to win that tournament

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.136
as I am every tournament that I show up.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.376
I am expected to win,

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.816
and if I don't win,
it's actually much bigger news.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.176
GK: Yeah, when you don't win,
that's a big story.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.256
SW: Yes, so for me,
I had to really take anything negative

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.176
and any emotions
that I was feeling at that point

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.416
and kind of just bottle them up

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.576
and really figure out
what the next step for me to do was.
