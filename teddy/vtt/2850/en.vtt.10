I know the women on the tour are saying,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.576
"How long does it take to have a baby?
Two years will she be gone?"

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.816
What are you thinking?

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.456
SW: Well, I'm always trying
to defy the odds, you know,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.816
so for me everything is really mental.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.256
I definitely plan on coming back.
I'm not done yet.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.136
I'm really inspired by my sister.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.816
She's a year older than me,
and that's something that --

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.856
if she's still playing, I know I can play.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.456
(Laughter)

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.816
And there's so many -- Roger Federer,
he's a little bit older than me

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.936
and he's still winning everything,
so I'm like, I know I can do that too.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.736
So that's been so inspiring to me,
especially recently,
