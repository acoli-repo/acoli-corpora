00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.776
I saw you about a year ago,
because I think about your life, Serena.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.456
You've had three life-changing things
in a six-month time:

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.696
pregnant, huge win, fell in love.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.576
And when I saw you last year,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.880
I was saying, "How's
your love life? Da da da."

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.576
You said, "I met a guy.
He's a nerdy, kinda geeky guy.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.136
You won't know who he is."

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.416
I said, "What's his name?"

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.616
SW: I remember talking
to you about that, yes.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.656
GK: And you said, "Alexis Ohanian."
I said, "I know him!" He's awesome.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.776
But I would never put you
with a nerdy geek,

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.056
and you said, you neither.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.576
SW: I'm going to be honest
with you, I didn't either,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.336
but it's been the best thing for me.
