Gayle King: Have a seat, Serena Williams,

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.616
or should we say, have a seat, mom.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.405
(Cheers)

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:11.336
So no doubt, you guys are like me.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.976
You saw the release of Serena

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.056
in that great yellow
bathing suit last week

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.496
and when I saw it,
all I could think of was,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.296
"Gosh, why couldn't she have waited
til we sat onstage for TED?"

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.256
I was very selfish, I know.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.936
So I asked you about that picture,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.736
and you said nobody was
supposed to see that picture.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.016
What do you mean?
