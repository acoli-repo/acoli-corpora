00:09:59.021 --> 00:10:01.091
That's pretty bad.

00:10:01.091 --> 00:10:02.423
On the contrary,

00:10:02.423 --> 00:10:05.189
there's plenty of charm and happiness in tenderness.

00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:09.238
I refer specifically to a kind of humor
that is unfortunately underused.

00:10:09.238 --> 00:10:12.115
It is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness.

00:10:12.115 --> 00:10:14.896
I refer to self-mockery.

00:10:14.896 --> 00:10:17.717
For a couple who is no longer sustained, supported

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:19.794
by the constraints of tradition,

00:10:19.794 --> 00:10:21.342
I believe that self-mockery

00:10:21.342 --> 00:10:25.695
is one of the best means for 
the relationship to endure.
