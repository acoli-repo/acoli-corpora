00:04:32.863 --> 00:04:35.355
and tearing them at the knees,

00:04:35.355 --> 00:04:37.467
because he wants to please Jennifer.

00:04:37.467 --> 00:04:39.917
(Laughter)

00:04:39.917 --> 00:04:43.201
Consumerism is not materialism.

00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:45.276
It is rather what is swallowed up

00:04:45.276 --> 00:04:48.285
and sacrificed in the name of the god of love,

00:04:48.285 --> 00:04:52.731
or rather in the name of seduction capital.

00:04:52.731 --> 00:04:58.112
In light of this observation on contemporary love,

00:04:58.112 --> 00:05:01.427
how can we think of love in the years to come?
