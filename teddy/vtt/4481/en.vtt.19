00:09:28.994 --> 00:09:30.521
I want them to be perfect

00:09:30.521 --> 00:09:32.678
so that I can be reassured of my value.

00:09:32.678 --> 00:09:35.065
It leads to couples

00:09:35.065 --> 00:09:37.357
obsessed with performance

00:09:37.357 --> 00:09:39.513
who will break up, just like that,

00:09:39.513 --> 00:09:42.067
at the slightest underachievement.

00:09:42.067 --> 00:09:46.190
In contrast to this attitude,

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.928
I call upon tenderness -- love as tenderness.

00:09:48.928 --> 00:09:50.296
What is tenderness?

00:09:50.296 --> 00:09:54.169
To be tender is to accept 
the loved one's weaknesses.

00:09:54.169 --> 00:09:57.826
It's not about becoming a sad couple of orderlies.

00:09:57.826 --> 00:09:59.021
(Laughter)

00:09:59.021 --> 00:10:01.091
That's pretty bad.
