00:10:29.285 --> 00:10:32.740
and then invaded by all of us
via social media in the noughties,

00:10:32.764 --> 00:10:34.693
but I think it's going to change again.

00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:37.775
And I think things
like the dark net markets --

00:10:37.799 --> 00:10:41.775
creative, secure, difficult to censor --

00:10:41.799 --> 00:10:43.401
I think that's the future.

00:10:44.929 --> 00:10:46.557
And the reason it's the future

00:10:46.581 --> 00:10:49.249
is because we're all worried
about our privacy.

00:10:49.273 --> 00:10:52.498
Surveys consistently show
concerns about privacy.

00:10:52.522 --> 00:10:56.481
The more time we spend online,
the more we worry about them,

00:10:56.505 --> 00:10:58.775
and those surveys show
our worries are growing.

00:10:58.799 --> 00:11:00.915
We're worried about
what happens to our data.
