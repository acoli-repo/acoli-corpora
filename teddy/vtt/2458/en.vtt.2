And because of this fiendishly
clever encryption system,

00:01:07.532 --> 00:01:12.951
the 20 or 30 -- we don't know exactly --
thousand sites that operate there

00:01:12.975 --> 00:01:16.182
are incredibly difficult to shut down.

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:22.095
It is a censorship-free world
visited by anonymous users.

00:01:23.268 --> 00:01:27.586
Little wonder, then,
that it's a natural place to go

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.522
for anybody with something to hide,

00:01:29.546 --> 00:01:34.137
and that something, of course,
need not be illegal.
