WEBVTT

00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:32.605
and which you access
with a special browser

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.074
called the Tor browser.

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:39.375
Now, the Tor browser was originally
a U.S. Naval intelligence project.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:41.280
It then became open source,

00:00:41.304 --> 00:00:43.891
and it allows anybody to browse the net

00:00:43.915 --> 00:00:46.367
without giving away their location.

00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:50.495
And it does this
by encrypting your IP address

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.295
and then routing it via several
other computers around the world

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:56.658
that use the same software.

00:00:57.508 --> 00:00:59.775
You can use it on the normal Internet,

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.514
but it's also your key to the dark net.
