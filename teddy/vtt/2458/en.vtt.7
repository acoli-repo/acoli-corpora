you enter an address -- 
preferably not your home address --

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.775
and you wait for your product
to arrive in the post,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.213
but they keep the same pseudonym
to build up a reputation.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.910
And because it's easy for the buyer
to change allegiance whenever they want,
