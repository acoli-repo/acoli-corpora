But then they realized there was
a problem with bitcoin,

00:08:33.552 --> 00:08:35.253
because every bitcoin transaction

00:08:35.277 --> 00:08:37.775
is actually recorded publicly
in a public ledger.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:41.076
So if you're clever, you can try
and work out who's behind them.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.385
So they came up with a tumbling service.

00:08:44.409 --> 00:08:47.800
Hundreds of people send
their bitcoin into one address,

00:08:47.824 --> 00:08:49.799
they're tumbled and jumbled up,

00:08:49.823 --> 00:08:53.613
and then the right amount
is sent on to the right recipients,

00:08:53.637 --> 00:08:55.459
but they're different bitcoins:

00:08:55.483 --> 00:08:57.173
micro-laundering systems.

00:08:57.197 --> 00:08:58.731
(Laughter)

00:08:58.755 --> 00:08:59.911
It's incredible.

00:08:59.935 --> 00:09:05.128
