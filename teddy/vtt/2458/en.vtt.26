00:12:58.496 --> 00:13:01.580
and therefore most of you
in this audience,

00:13:01.604 --> 00:13:03.960
will be using the dark net, too.

00:13:04.942 --> 00:13:07.971
So the Internet is about to get
more interesting,

00:13:07.995 --> 00:13:10.775
more exciting, more innovative,

00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:12.524
more terrible,

00:13:12.548 --> 00:13:13.902
more destructive.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.413
That's good news
if you care about liberty.

00:13:17.437 --> 00:13:19.407
It's good news if you care about freedom.

00:13:19.431 --> 00:13:21.550
It's good news if you care
about democracy.

00:13:21.574 --> 00:13:22.952
It's also good news

00:13:22.976 --> 00:13:25.422
if you want to browse
for illegal pornography

00:13:25.446 --> 00:13:27.775
and if you want to buy and sell drugs

00:13:27.799 --> 00:13:29.092
with impunity.

00:13:29.876 --> 00:13:33.775
Neither entirely dark, nor entirely light.
