They even promised to reinvest
20 percent of any profits

00:09:31.284 --> 00:09:33.074
into local education programs.

00:09:33.098 --> 00:09:34.120
(Laughter)

00:09:34.144 --> 00:09:36.123
There's even a mystery shopper.

00:09:36.936 --> 00:09:40.320
Now, whatever you think
about the morality of these sites --

00:09:40.344 --> 00:09:43.659
and I submit that it's not
actually an easy question --

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:49.185
the creation of functioning,
competitive, anonymous markets,

00:09:49.209 --> 00:09:51.775
where nobody knows who anybody else is,

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:54.898
constantly at risk of being shut down
by the authorities,

00:09:54.922 --> 00:09:57.456
is a staggering achievement,

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.518
a phenomenal achievement.
