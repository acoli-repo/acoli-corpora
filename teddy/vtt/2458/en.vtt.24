But you add distributed computing
and powerful encryption --

00:12:00.312 --> 00:12:04.199
that's very, very hard
to censor and control.

00:12:04.625 --> 00:12:07.438
Another called MaidSafe
works on similar principles.

00:12:07.462 --> 00:12:10.910
Another called Twister,
and so on and so on.

00:12:11.396 --> 00:12:13.386
And here's the thing --

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:14.874
the more of us join,

00:12:14.898 --> 00:12:17.349
the more interesting those sites become,

00:12:17.373 --> 00:12:19.861
and then the more of us join, and so on.

00:12:20.268 --> 00:12:22.293
And I think that's what's going to happen.

00:12:22.317 --> 00:12:24.465
In fact, it's already happening.

00:12:24.489 --> 00:12:28.365
The dark net is no longer
a den for dealers

00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:30.956
and a hideout for whistle-blowers.
