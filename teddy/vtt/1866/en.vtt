00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I was walking in the market one day with my wife,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and somebody stuck a cage in my face.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And in between those slits

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
were the saddest eyes I've ever seen.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
There was a very sick orangutan baby, my first encounter.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That evening I came back to the market in the dark

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I heard "uhh, uhh,"

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and sure enough I found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Of course, the cage was salvaged.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I took up the little baby,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
massaged her, forced her to drink

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
until she finally started breathing normally.
