00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.776
And so I'm going like this,
slowly pedaling,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.376
and all of a sudden, I'm on the floor.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.576
I'm on the ground, and I look up,

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.376
and there's this kid peddling away
in the getaway vehicle,

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.896
which is my bike,

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.176
and he's about 11 or 12 years old,
and I'm on the floor,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.056
and I'm crying because I saved
a lot of money for that bike,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.656
and I'm crying and I stand up
and I start screaming.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.936
Instinct steps in,
and I start screaming, "Mwizi, mwizi!"

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.600
which means "thief" in Swahili.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.576
And out of the woodworks,
all of these people come out
