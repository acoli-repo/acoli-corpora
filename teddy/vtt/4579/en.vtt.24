00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:00.656
And then lastly, I think that audiences
can make the world a better place

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.760
by switching off their phones,

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.576
by stepping away from their screens

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.080
and stepping out into the real world
beyond what feels safe.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.856
Alice Walker has said,

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.656
"Look closely at the present
you are constructing.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.840
It should look like the future
you are dreaming."

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.856
Storytellers can help us to dream,

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.680
but it's up to all of us
to have a plan for justice.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.696
Thank you.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.070
