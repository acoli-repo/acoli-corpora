(Cheers)

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.976
And so I decided that I should
probably write my own TED Talk,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.496
and so that is what I am here to do.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.840
I'm here to talk about
my own observations about storytelling.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.616
I want to talk to you
about the power of stories, of course,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.576
but I also want to talk
about their limitations,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.640
particularly for those of us
who are interested in social justice.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.176
So since Adichie gave that talk
seven years ago,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.456
there has been a boom in storytelling.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.216
Stories are everywhere,
