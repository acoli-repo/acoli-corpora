00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.256
And my job is to help to tell stories

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.816
that challenge mainstream narratives
about what it means to be black

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.896
or a Muslim or a refugee
or any of those other categories

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.936
that we talk about all the time.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.176
But I come to this work

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.696
after a long history
as a social justice activist,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.856
and so I'm really interested in the ways

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.576
that people talk
about nonfiction storytelling

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.936
as though it's about
more than entertainment,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.920
as though it's about being
a catalyst for social action.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.216
It's not uncommon to hear people say
