It's the talk that I would have given
if I had been famous first.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.256
(Laughter)

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.656
You know, and you know,
like, she's African and I'm African,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.616
and she's a feminist and I'm a feminist,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.816
and she's a storyteller
and I'm a storyteller,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.656
so I really felt like it's my talk.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.416
(Laughter)

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.736
So I decided that I was going
to learn how to code,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.776
and then I was going to hack the internet

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.536
and I would take down all the copies
of that talk that existed,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.976
and then I would memorize it,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.256
and then I would come here
and deliver it as if it was my own speech.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.456
So that plan was going really well,
except the coding part,
