00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.376
So earlier this year,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.216
I was informed that I would be
doing a TED Talk.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.216
So I was excited, then I panicked,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.256
then I was excited, then I panicked,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.816
and in between the excitement
and the panicking,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.136
I started to do my research,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.616
and my research primarily consisted
of Googling how to give a great TED Talk.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.856
(Laughter)

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.536
And interspersed with that,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.256
I was Googling Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.896
How many of you know who that is?

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.696
(Cheers)

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.055
So I was Googling her
because I always Google her
