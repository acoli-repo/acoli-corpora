Stories are everywhere,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.176
and if there was a danger
in the telling of one tired old tale,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.536
then I think there has got to be
lots to celebrate about the flourishing

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.336
of so many stories and so many voices.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.160
Stories are the antidote to bias.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.016
In fact, today, if you are middle class
and connected via the internet,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.176
you can download stories
at the touch of a button

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.576
or the swipe of a screen.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.416
You can listen to a podcast

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.336
about what it's like
to grow up Dalit in Kolkata.
