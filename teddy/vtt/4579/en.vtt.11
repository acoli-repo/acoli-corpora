00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.336
And this makes sense, of course, right?

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.416
Because if you like someone,
then you care about them.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.840
But the inverse is also true.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.176
If you don't like someone,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.136
then you don't care about them.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.016
And if you don't care about them,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.936
you don't have to see yourself
as having a moral obligation

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.200
to think about the circumstances
that shaped their lives.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.296
I learned this lesson
when I was 14 years old.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.096
I learned that actually,
you don't have to like someone

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.496
to recognize their wisdom,

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.616
and you certainly
don't have to like someone

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.080
to take a stand by their side.
