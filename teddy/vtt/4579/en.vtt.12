00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.080
to take a stand by their side.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.600
So my bike was stolen

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.976
while I was riding it --

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.136
(Laughter)

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.736
which is possible if you're
riding slowly enough, which I was.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.256
(Laughter)

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.256
So one minute
I'm cutting across this field

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.576
in the Nairobi neighborhood
where I grew up,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.056
and it's like a very bumpy path,

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.896
and so when you're riding a bike,

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.176
you don't want to be like, you know --

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.600
(Laughter)

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.776
And so I'm going like this,
slowly pedaling,
