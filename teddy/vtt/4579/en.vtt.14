00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.576
And out of the woodworks,
all of these people come out

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.016
and they start to give chase.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.296
This is Africa, so mob justice in action.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.776
Right?

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.576
And I round the corner,
and they've captured him,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.056
they've caught him.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.136
The suspect has been apprehended,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.736
and they make him give me my bike back,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.376
and they also make him apologize.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.976
Again, you know,
typical African justice, right?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.496
And so they make him say sorry.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.856
And so we stand there facing each other,

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.816
and he looks at me, and he says sorry,

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.336
but he looks at me
with this unbridled fury.
