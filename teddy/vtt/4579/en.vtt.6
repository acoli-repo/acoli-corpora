00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.336
about what it's like
to grow up Dalit in Kolkata.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.856
You can hear an indigenous
man in Australia

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.976
talk about the trials and triumphs
of raising his children in dignity

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.336
and in pride.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.336
Stories make us fall in love.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.536
They heal rifts and they bridge divides.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.416
Stories can even make it easier for us

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.096
to talk about the deaths
of people in our societies

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.576
who don't matter,
because they make us care.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.800
Right?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.056
I'm not so sure,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.160
and I actually work for a place
called the Centre for Stories.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.256
And my job is to help to tell stories
