00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.055
So I was Googling her
because I always Google her

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.336
because I'm just a fan,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.976
but also because she always has
important and interesting things to say.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.456
And the combination of those searches

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.096
kept leading me to her talk

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.296
on the dangers of a single story,

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.696
on what happens
when we have a solitary lens

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.216
through which to understand
certain groups of people,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.200
and it is the perfect talk.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.056
It's the talk that I would have given
if I had been famous first.
