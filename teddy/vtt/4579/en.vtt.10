There is nothing
like that feel-good factor you get

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.096
from listening to a fantastic story

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.496
where you feel like you
climbed that mountain, right,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.360
or that you befriended
that death row inmate.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.256
But you didn't.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.096
You haven't done anything.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.896
Listening is an important

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.880
but insufficient step
towards social action.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.976
Secondly, I think often we are drawn

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.936
towards characters and protagonists

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.416
who are likable and human.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.336
And this makes sense, of course, right?
