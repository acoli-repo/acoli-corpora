So that plan was going really well,
except the coding part,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.376
and then one morning a few months ago,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.976
I woke up

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.456
to the news that the wife
of a certain presidential candidate

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.456
had given a speech that --

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.416
(Laughter)

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.000
(Applause)

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.576
that sounded eerily like a speech
given by one of my other faves,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.816
Michelle Obama.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.936
(Cheers)
