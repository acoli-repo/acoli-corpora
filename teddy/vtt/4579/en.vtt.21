00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.760
That's what pushes the needle forward
in terms of social justice.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.560
In the final analysis, of course,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.296
it is justice

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.056
that makes the world a better place,

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.040
not stories. Right?

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.136
And so if it is justice that we are after,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.576
then I think we mustn't focus
on the media or on storytellers.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.296
We must focus on audiences,

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:55.416
on anyone who has ever turned on a radio

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.256
or listened to a podcast,

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.376
and that means all of us.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.536
So a few concluding thoughts
