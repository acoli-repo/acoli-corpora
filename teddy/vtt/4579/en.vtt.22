00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.536
So a few concluding thoughts

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.440
on what audiences can do
to make the world a better place.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.936
So firstly, the world
would be a better place, I think,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.536
if audiences were more curious
and more skeptical

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.176
and asked more questions
about the social context

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.280
that created those stories
that they love so much.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.456
Secondly, the world
would be a better place

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.160
if audiences recognized
that storytelling is intellectual work.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.576
And I think it would
be important for audiences
