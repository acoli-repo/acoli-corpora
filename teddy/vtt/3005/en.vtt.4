But the cool thing is
that using this technology,

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:03.561
Rwanda has been able to keep

and with the Rwandan government,

00:02:26.861 --> 00:02:29.575
we leveled it and built this center
in a couple weeks.

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.955
So when a patient is having an emergency,
