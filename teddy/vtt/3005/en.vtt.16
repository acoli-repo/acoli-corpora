00:07:59.255 --> 00:08:00.476
this is a global problem.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.561
Maternal health is a challenge everywhere.

00:08:02.585 --> 00:08:05.508
The main difference is that
Rwanda was the first country

00:08:05.532 --> 00:08:08.759
to use radical technology
to do something about it.

00:08:08.783 --> 00:08:13.087
And that's the reason this attitude
of Africa being disrupted

00:08:13.111 --> 00:08:15.024
or advanced technology not working here

00:08:15.048 --> 00:08:16.226
or needing aid

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:17.635
is so totally wrong.

00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:19.753
Africa can be the disrupter.

00:08:20.423 --> 00:08:25.682
These small, agile, developing economies
can out-innovate large, rich ones.

00:08:25.706 --> 00:08:29.586
And they can totally leapfrog over
the absence of legacy infrastructure

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.708
to go straight to newer
and better systems.
