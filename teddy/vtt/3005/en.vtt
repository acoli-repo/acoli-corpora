00:00:00.857 --> 00:00:03.539
Most people think

00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:09.228
that new technology or advanced technology
can never start in Africa.

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:13.853
Instead, they think that the best way
to help the continent advance

00:00:13.877 --> 00:00:16.449
is by providing aid or services

00:00:16.473 --> 00:00:19.123
that the continent
can't provide for itself.

00:00:19.864 --> 00:00:23.193
So while we see advanced
technology like robotics

00:00:23.217 --> 00:00:24.560
and artificial intelligence

00:00:24.584 --> 00:00:27.392
growing exponentially
in the developed world,

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:28.974
those same people are worried

00:00:28.998 --> 00:00:32.105
that a technologically backward
Africa is falling behind.
