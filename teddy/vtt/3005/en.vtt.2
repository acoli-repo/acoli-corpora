00:00:59.928 --> 00:01:01.162
And guess what?

00:01:01.692 --> 00:01:04.067
We did not do that in the US,

00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:06.107
we didn't do it in Japan,

00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:07.636
and we didn't do it in Europe.

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:11.258
It was actually President Paul Kagame

00:01:11.282 --> 00:01:14.074
and the Rwandan Ministry of Health

00:01:14.098 --> 00:01:17.444
that made a big bet
on the potential of this technology

00:01:17.468 --> 00:01:19.148
and signed a commercial contract

00:01:19.172 --> 00:01:23.106
to deliver a majority
of the country's blood on demand.

00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:26.354
(Applause)

00:01:29.395 --> 00:01:31.346
Yeah, they deserve the applause.
