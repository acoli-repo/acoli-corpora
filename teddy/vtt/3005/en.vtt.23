00:11:29.015 --> 00:11:30.482
They're total heroes.

00:11:30.971 --> 00:11:35.385
Our team's mission is to deliver
basic access to medicine

00:11:35.409 --> 00:11:37.498
to all seven billion people on the planet,

00:11:37.522 --> 00:11:39.761
no matter how hard it is to reach them.

00:11:39.785 --> 00:11:41.740
We often tell people about that mission,

00:11:41.764 --> 00:11:44.883
and they say, "That's so generous
of you, it's so philanthropic."

00:11:44.907 --> 00:11:46.269
No!

00:11:46.293 --> 00:11:48.323
Philanthropy has nothing to do with it.

00:11:48.347 --> 00:11:51.961
Because of the commercial contracts
that we sign with ministries of health,

00:11:51.985 --> 00:11:55.552
these networks are 100 percent
sustainable and scalable.

00:11:56.019 --> 00:11:59.582
And the reason we feel so strongly
about correcting that misperception

00:11:59.606 --> 00:12:02.661
is that entrepreneurship
is the only force in human history
