So yeah, East Africa
is moving really fast.

00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:37.963
One thing that people, I think, often miss

00:10:37.987 --> 00:10:41.219
is that these kinds of leaps
generate compounding gains.

00:10:41.243 --> 00:10:45.828
For example, Rwanda, by investing
in this infrastructure for health care,

00:10:45.852 --> 00:10:49.737
now has an aerial logistics network
that they can use

00:10:49.761 --> 00:10:53.144
to catalyze other parts of their economy,

00:10:53.168 --> 00:10:55.230
like agriculture or e-commerce.

00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:56.541
Even more importantly,

00:10:56.565 --> 00:11:01.857
100 percent of the teams we hire
at these distribution centers are local.
