00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.524
You can see a 75-kilometer service radius
around the distribution center,

00:10:02.548 --> 00:10:06.096
and that allows us to serve hundreds
of health facilities and hospitals,

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.386
all of which are rural,

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.303
from that single distribution center.

00:10:09.327 --> 00:10:12.363
But to serve over 20 percent
of the population of Tanzania,

00:10:12.387 --> 00:10:14.846
we're going to need
multiple distribution centers.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.211
We'll actually need four.

00:10:16.235 --> 00:10:18.272
And from these distribution centers,

00:10:18.296 --> 00:10:23.534
we expect to be doing several hundred
lifesaving deliveries every day,

00:10:23.558 --> 00:10:27.797
and this system will ultimately serve
over 1,000 health facilities

00:10:27.821 --> 00:10:29.671
and hospitals in the country.

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:32.790
So yeah, East Africa
is moving really fast.
