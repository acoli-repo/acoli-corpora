00:03:57.395 --> 00:04:00.018
this vehicle is about 50 kilometers away.

00:04:00.042 --> 00:04:04.073
We're able to watch the vehicle
as it makes a delivery at a hospital

00:04:04.097 --> 00:04:05.286
in real time.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.540
You may have noticed there are pings

00:04:07.564 --> 00:04:10.116
that are coming off
of that vehicle on the screen.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.917
Those pings are actually data packets

00:04:11.941 --> 00:04:14.222
that we're getting
over the cell phone networks.

00:04:14.246 --> 00:04:17.432
So these planes have SIM cards
just like your cell phone does,

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:19.657
and they're communicating
over the cell network

00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:22.560
to tell us where they are
and how they're doing at all times.

00:04:22.584 --> 00:04:25.004
Believe it or not,
we actually buy family plans --

00:04:25.028 --> 00:04:26.038
(Laughter)

00:04:26.062 --> 00:04:27.418
for this fleet of vehicles,

00:04:27.442 --> 00:04:29.489
because that's how we get the best rates.

00:04:29.513 --> 00:04:30.596
(Laughter)
