00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.035
in all of health care logistics,

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:03.109
you're always trading off
waste against access.

00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:07.708
So if you want to solve waste,
you keep everything centralized.

00:05:07.732 --> 00:05:10.722
As a result, when patients
are having emergencies,

00:05:10.746 --> 00:05:13.836
sometimes they don't have

But you end up throwing
a lot of medicine out,

00:05:23.292 --> 00:05:24.495
which is very expensive.

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:27.464
What's so amazing is that the Rwandan
government has been able

00:05:27.488 --> 00:05:29.959
to break this cycle permanently.

00:05:29.983 --> 00:05:33.431
Because doctors can get
what they need instantly,
