on the planet,

00:06:00.865 --> 00:06:02.455
and it happened here.

00:06:03.375 --> 00:06:07.777
But obviously, when we're talking about
delivering medical products instantly,

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:09.639
the most important thing is patients.

00:06:10.267 --> 00:06:12.526
Let me give you an example.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.174
A couple months ago, a 24-year-old mother
came into one of the hospitals

00:06:16.198 --> 00:06:17.366
that we serve,

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.104
and she gave birth via C-section.

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:22.693
But that led to complications,
and she started to bleed.

00:06:23.366 --> 00:06:27.258
Luckily, the doctors had some blood
of her blood type on hand

00:06:27.282 --> 00:06:30.242
that had been delivered
via Zipline's routine service,
