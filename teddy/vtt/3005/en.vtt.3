Yeah, they deserve the applause.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.556
So why is blood important?

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.463
Rwanda collects between 60- and 80,000
units of blood a year.

00:01:38.487 --> 00:01:40.487
So this is a product
that when you need it,

00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:42.124
you really, really need it.

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:44.819
But blood is also challenging,

00:01:44.843 --> 00:01:47.507
because it has a very short shelf life,

00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:50.177
there are lots of different
storage requirements,

00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:52.561
and it's really hard to predict the demand

00:01:52.585 --> 00:01:54.507
for all of these different blood groups

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:56.781
before a patient actually needs something.

00:01:57.477 --> 00:02:00.005
But the cool thing is
that using this technology,
