00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.955
So when a patient is having an emergency,

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:35.299
a doctor or a nurse at that hospital
can send us a WhatsApp,

00:02:35.323 --> 00:02:36.964
telling us what they need.

00:02:36.988 --> 00:02:39.753
And then our team will immediately
spring into action.

00:02:39.777 --> 00:02:41.455
We pull the blood from our stock,

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:44.670
which is delivered from the National
Center for Blood Transfusion;

00:02:44.694 --> 00:02:46.532
we scan the blood into our system

00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:49.649
so the Ministry of Health
knows where the blood is going;

00:02:49.673 --> 00:02:51.932
and then we'll basically
pack it into a Zip,

00:02:51.956 --> 00:02:54.676
which is what we call
these little autonomous airplanes

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.011
that run on batteries.

00:02:56.035 --> 00:02:58.050
And then once that Zip is ready to go,

00:02:58.074 --> 00:03:01.281
we accelerate it from zero
to 100 kilometers an hour
