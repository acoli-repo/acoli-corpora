00:03:27.454 --> 00:03:30.503
that allows the package to come
to the ground gently and reliably

00:03:30.527 --> 00:03:32.052
in the same place every time.

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:34.759
So it's just like ride sharing;

00:03:34.783 --> 00:03:38.049
the doctors get a text message
one minute before we arrive, saying,

00:03:38.073 --> 00:03:40.031
"Walk outside and receive your delivery."

00:03:40.055 --> 00:03:41.122
(Laughter)

00:03:41.146 --> 00:03:42.501
And then --

00:03:42.525 --> 00:03:46.939
(Applause)

00:03:49.892 --> 00:03:53.530
and then the doctors have what they need
to save a patient's life.

00:03:53.554 --> 00:03:57.371
This is actually watching a delivery
happen from our distribution center;

00:03:57.395 --> 00:04:00.018
this vehicle is about 50 kilometers away.
