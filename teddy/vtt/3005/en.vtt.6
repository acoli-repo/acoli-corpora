00:02:58.074 --> 00:03:01.281
we accelerate it from zero
to 100 kilometers an hour

00:03:01.305 --> 00:03:02.765
in about half of a second.

00:03:06.711 --> 00:03:07.868
(Audience) Whoa!

00:03:07.892 --> 00:03:10.576
And from the moment it leaves
the end of the launcher,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.976
it's completely autonomous.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.862
(Video: Air traffic controller
directs traffic)

00:03:14.886 --> 00:03:17.265
This is our air traffic
controller calling it in

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:19.131
to Kigali International Airport.

00:03:19.155 --> 00:03:21.108
And when the Zip arrives at the hospital,

00:03:21.132 --> 00:03:23.856
it descends to about 30 feet
and drops the package.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.430
We use a really simple paper parachute --
simple things are best --

00:03:27.454 --> 00:03:30.503
that allows the package to come
to the ground gently and reliably
