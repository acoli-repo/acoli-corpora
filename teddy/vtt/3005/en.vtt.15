00:07:28.828 --> 00:07:30.667
Here are just a couple of the moms

00:07:30.691 --> 00:07:32.836
who have received transfusions in this way

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.388
in the last couple months.

00:07:35.132 --> 00:07:39.232
We're always reminded: when we can help
a doctor save a mom's life,

00:07:39.256 --> 00:07:41.731
it's not just her life that you're saving.

00:07:41.755 --> 00:07:44.846
That's also a baby boy or a baby girl

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.364
who has a mother while they're growing up.

00:07:48.757 --> 00:07:51.726
(Applause)

00:07:53.507 --> 00:07:54.754
But I want to be clear:

00:07:54.778 --> 00:07:57.360
postpartum hemorrhaging --
it's not a Rwanda problem,

00:07:57.384 --> 00:07:59.231
it's not a developing-world problem --

00:07:59.255 --> 00:08:00.476
this is a global problem.
