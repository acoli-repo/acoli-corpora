00:05:36.818 --> 00:05:40.628
So although use of blood products
has increased substantially

00:05:40.652 --> 00:05:42.333
at all the hospitals we serve,

00:05:42.357 --> 00:05:46.418
in the last nine months,
zero units of blood have expired

00:05:46.442 --> 00:05:48.227
at any of these hospitals.

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:52.221

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:56.511
That's an amazing result.

00:05:56.535 --> 00:05:59.663
That's actually not been achieved
by any other health care system

00:05:59.687 --> 00:06:00.841
on the planet,
