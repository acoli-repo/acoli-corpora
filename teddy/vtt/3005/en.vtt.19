On Thursday, just a couple days ago,

00:09:30.777 --> 00:09:33.336
the Tanzanian Ministry of Health announced

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.092
that they are going to use
this same technology

00:09:36.116 --> 00:09:39.704
to provide instant delivery
of a wide range of medical products

00:09:39.728 --> 00:09:43.407
to 10 million of the hardest to reach
people in the country.

00:09:43.789 --> 00:09:47.008
(Applause)

00:09:50.387 --> 00:09:54.601
It's actually going to be the largest
autonomous system anywhere in the world.

00:09:54.625 --> 00:09:56.724
To give you a sense
of what this looks like,

00:09:56.748 --> 00:09:58.946
this is one of the first
distribution centers.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.524
You can see a 75-kilometer service radius
around the distribution center,
