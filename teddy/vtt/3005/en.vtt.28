00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:00.457
I wanted to show you the kids
and the teenagers

00:14:00.481 --> 00:14:02.716
who line up on the fence every day.

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:06.195
They cheer every launch and every landing.

00:14:06.219 --> 00:14:07.529
(Laughter)

00:14:07.553 --> 00:14:09.971
(Applause)

00:14:12.436 --> 00:14:15.310
Sometimes I actually show up
at the distribution center early

00:14:15.334 --> 00:14:16.498
because I'm jet-lagged.

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.815
I'll show up an hour before
we begin operation.

00:14:18.839 --> 00:14:21.479
And there will be kids on the fence
getting good seats.

00:14:21.503 --> 00:14:22.713
(Laughter)

00:14:22.737 --> 00:14:24.263
And you go up and you ask them,

00:14:24.287 --> 00:14:26.106
"What do you think about the planes?"

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.259
And they'll say, "Oh,
it's a sky ambulance."

00:14:29.757 --> 00:14:30.908
So they get it.
