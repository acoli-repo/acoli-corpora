00:08:27.538 --> 00:08:30.740
I had to learn a whole new world,
full of military jargon,

00:08:30.764 --> 00:08:32.832
with its own culture and everything.

00:08:34.184 --> 00:08:37.025
So we started out slow,
getting to know each other

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:40.125
and learning how
to work together, progressively.

00:08:40.748 --> 00:08:44.813
For example, on the first day
of class, I had no uniform.

00:08:44.837 --> 00:08:46.512
So I showed up in regular clothes,

00:08:46.536 --> 00:08:48.789
while the other cadets
were all in uniform.

00:08:48.813 --> 00:08:54.450
I found out that every morning at 5:30,
there was physical training, PT.

00:08:54.474 --> 00:08:58.160
On Fridays, there would be
field training -- labs -- off-campus,

00:08:58.184 --> 00:09:02.043
and occasionally, we would have
weekend training at a military base.
