00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.535
Due to an explosion, he lost his leg.

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:04.401
He’s recovered and currently has
a prosthetic leg.

00:06:05.085 --> 00:06:10.308
Now that he’s strong, he's back in combat,
still fighting in Afghanistan.

00:06:10.863 --> 00:06:12.307
It’s remarkable.

00:06:12.331 --> 00:06:15.015
And guess what? He’s not the only one.

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.228
There are 40 other soldiers like him,

00:06:17.252 --> 00:06:20.633
amputees who are serving in combat zones.

00:06:20.657 --> 00:06:21.817
Incredible.

00:06:21.841 --> 00:06:23.955
Also, we have a blind soldier here.

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:25.383
While he was in Iraq,

00:06:25.407 --> 00:06:29.651
an explosion from a suicide car bomber
destroyed his eyesight.
