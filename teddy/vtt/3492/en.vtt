(Interpreter voice-over) Hello, everyone.
My name is Keith Nolan.

00:00:04.484 --> 00:00:05.991
I’m a cadet private.

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:12.403
My talk today is on the topic
of the military.

00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:16.576
How many of you out there thought
you’d ever like to join the military?

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.542
I see a number of you nodding.

00:00:18.566 --> 00:00:21.241
And I thought the same thing
ever since I was young.

00:00:21.265 --> 00:00:24.014
Growing up, I’d always wanted
to join the military.

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.526
I loved military history

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.009
and I’ve read a great deal on the subject.

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:33.280
Also, I have various family members,
such as my grandfather and great uncle,
