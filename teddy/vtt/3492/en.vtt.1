Also, I have various family members,
such as my grandfather and great uncle,

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:34.618
who fought in World War II.

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:38.023
And like them, I wanted the same thing:
to serve my country.

00:00:38.047 --> 00:00:39.634
So the question is: Can I?

00:00:39.658 --> 00:00:40.912
No, I can’t.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.325
Why? Simply because I’m deaf.

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:48.963
Regardless of that fact, I still had
that longing to join the military.

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:53.451
For example, after I graduated
from high school,

00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:55.818
three months before 9/11 occurred,

00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:59.959
I went to a naval recruiting center
with high hopes of joining the navy.

00:00:59.983 --> 00:01:03.903
I went in and a strapping naval man
stood up and addressed me.
