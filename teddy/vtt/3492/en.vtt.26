00:12:59.589 --> 00:13:03.625
and land navigation, where you’re finding
your way out in the mountains.

00:13:05.466 --> 00:13:09.345
As far as accommodations,
I’ve been provided with interpreters

00:13:09.369 --> 00:13:13.318
through the National Center on Deafness,
NCOD, here at CSUN.

00:13:13.342 --> 00:13:14.890
And I really have to thank them,

00:13:14.914 --> 00:13:16.827
because it's hard to find interpreters

00:13:16.851 --> 00:13:19.235
who are willing to wake up
at 4:30 in the morning,

00:13:19.259 --> 00:13:21.144
or sometimes even 3:30 in the morning.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.624
That's the officer who emailed me back,

00:13:23.648 --> 00:13:26.161
saying I think you can have
a few classes with us.

00:13:26.185 --> 00:13:27.944
That's Lieutenant Mendoza.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.200
That’s my interpreter there,
before class starts.
