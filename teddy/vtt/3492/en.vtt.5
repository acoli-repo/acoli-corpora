00:02:29.363 --> 00:02:32.222
I interviewed 10 deaf Israeli soldiers,

00:02:32.246 --> 00:02:35.008
all of those video interviews
and questions I’ve compiled,

00:02:35.032 --> 00:02:37.216
and the findings,
I’ll share with you later.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:40.801
Thirdly, CSUN here, my alma mater,

00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:43.732
had recently started up
an Army ROTC program.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:49.317
ROTC, which stands for
Reserve Officer Training Corps,

00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:51.641
allows students working on
their college majors

00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:54.286
to concurrently participate
in the ROTC program.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.775
Upon graduation, ROTC students
have a military career

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.419
ready and waiting for them.

00:02:59.443 --> 00:03:02.883
So if one joined the army, one could
commission as a second lieutenant.
