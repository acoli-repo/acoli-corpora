00:07:57.656 --> 00:08:00.981
I have been involved with that thus far
and it’s still going on now.

00:08:01.005 --> 00:08:03.064
Really, I need to preface this

00:08:03.088 --> 00:08:07.823
by saying that this is the first time
my battalion had ever had a deaf cadet.

00:08:07.847 --> 00:08:09.778
They had never experienced that before.

00:08:09.802 --> 00:08:13.970
So of course, they were taken aback,
wondering, initially,

00:08:13.994 --> 00:08:17.217
how I would do this or that,
how would we communicate and such,

00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:18.586
which is a natural reaction,

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.886
considering that many of them
had never interacted with a deaf person

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.061
prior to me.

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:27.514
Plus, I was taken aback by this --
it was the real thing, the army.

00:08:27.538 --> 00:08:30.740
I had to learn a whole new world,
full of military jargon,
