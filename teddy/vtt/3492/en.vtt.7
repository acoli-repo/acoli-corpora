00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:31.913
I think maybe we can work something out

00:03:31.937 --> 00:03:34.038
and you can take a few classes with us."

00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:36.128
This was unprecedented.

00:03:36.663 --> 00:03:38.613
So naturally, I was shocked.

00:03:38.637 --> 00:03:42.276
Although I was teaching, I decided I had
to grab the opportunity right away

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.658
and get my foot in the door.

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:45.532
Altogether, that's how it transpired.

00:03:46.302 --> 00:03:48.556
Now, with all my life experiences,

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.303
having talked with all the people I had,
and given everything I’ve read,

00:03:52.327 --> 00:03:56.113
I decided to write a research paper
called “Deaf in the Military.”

00:03:56.137 --> 00:03:58.756
I'll share with you
what those 98 pages entail.
