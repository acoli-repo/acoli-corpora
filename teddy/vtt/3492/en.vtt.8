Here in America, we’ve actually had
deaf soldiers serving in the past.

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.826
In fact, during
the Texas War of Independence,

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.873
there was a key character
named Deaf Smith,

00:04:09.897 --> 00:04:12.368
who made a large contribution
to that war effort.

00:04:13.034 --> 00:04:14.611
For the American Civil War,

00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:18.727
Gallaudet University actually has archived
a list of deaf soldiers in that war

00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:20.441
from the North and the South,

00:04:20.465 --> 00:04:23.592
showing that deaf soldiers
were even fighting against each other.

00:04:23.616 --> 00:04:26.442
During World War II,
there are a few rare examples

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:29.316
of deaf people who made it
into the military at that time

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.589
and were able to serve
their country as well.
