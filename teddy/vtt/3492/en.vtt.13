00:06:30.345 --> 00:06:33.065
He’s recovered and hasn’t left the army.

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:35.615
The army has retained him on active duty,

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:38.857
and he’s currently running a hospital
for wounded soldiers.

00:06:38.881 --> 00:06:41.289
I also found out online
about another soldier,

00:06:41.313 --> 00:06:42.671
who is deaf in one ear.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.464
He’s developed civil programs in Iraq,

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:49.010
one of which actually started
a school for the deaf in Iraq.

00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:52.864
All of this is incredible.

00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:55.666
But I am going to ask all of you:

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.098
If the US Military can retain
their disabled soldiers,

00:06:59.122 --> 00:07:01.922
why can’t they accept
disabled citizens as well?
