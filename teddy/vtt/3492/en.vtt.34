00:17:03.037 --> 00:17:06.213
Many of the officers
and cadets have empathized

00:17:06.237 --> 00:17:08.566
with this sudden shock of disappointment,

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:11.103
and are wondering
why this has to be the case.

00:17:11.587 --> 00:17:14.579
Colonel Phelps has tried
to speak with the higher-ups

00:17:14.603 --> 00:17:15.928
in the chain of command

00:17:15.952 --> 00:17:18.544
and explain to them
that I’m one of the top cadets,

00:17:18.568 --> 00:17:21.928
having passed all the events
and receiving high marks on my exams.

00:17:21.952 --> 00:17:23.587
But their response is unwavering:

00:17:23.611 --> 00:17:26.577
policy is policy, and if you’re deaf,
you’re disqualified.

00:17:27.717 --> 00:17:31.937
I know that the cadre has tried
to find various ways.
