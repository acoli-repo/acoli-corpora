00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.727
the first being, Israeli defense
openly accepts deaf soldiers.

00:07:30.751 --> 00:07:33.926
If you have the qualities
and skills required, they’ll take you.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.582
Secondly, the US Military
has accommodations

00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:38.554
for retaining their disabled soldiers.

00:07:38.578 --> 00:07:43.378
And lastly, 80% of occupations
in the military are non-combat.

00:07:43.955 --> 00:07:46.868
Now, can we Deaf Americans
serve our country?

00:07:46.892 --> 00:07:49.702
Yes! Of course!
Absolutely, without a doubt!

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.913
Now I’ll explain a bit
about my experience in the Army ROTC,

00:07:55.937 --> 00:07:57.292
which began last fall.

00:07:57.656 --> 00:08:00.981
I have been involved with that thus far
and it’s still going on now.
