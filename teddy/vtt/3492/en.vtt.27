00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.200
That’s my interpreter there,
before class starts.

00:13:31.524 --> 00:13:35.078
This is a picture from last fall,
when we were new to training.

00:13:35.985 --> 00:13:38.303
This is Lieutenant Colonel Phelps,

00:13:38.824 --> 00:13:40.586
this being his name sign.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.824
He's the commanding officer
of the entire Bruin Battalion.

00:13:44.617 --> 00:13:48.446
Every time I see him walk by,
it’s rather inspiring.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:53.974
I mean, the way he presents himself,
you can see he’s the epitome of a soldier.

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:56.569
Plus, he doesn't view me as a deaf person.

00:13:56.593 --> 00:13:59.242
He looks at my skills
and capabilities instead.

00:13:59.266 --> 00:14:02.452
He’s really pushed for me,
and I respect him for all that.
