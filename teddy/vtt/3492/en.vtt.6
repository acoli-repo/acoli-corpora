So if one joined the army, one could
commission as a second lieutenant.

00:03:02.907 --> 00:03:05.291
That's generally the ROTC
program here at CSUN.

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:07.724
Having learned that, I was intrigued.

00:03:08.178 --> 00:03:10.200
I already had a profession as a teacher,

00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:13.177
but I went ahead anyway
and sent an email off to the program,

00:03:13.201 --> 00:03:15.334
explaining that I was
a teacher of the deaf,

00:03:15.358 --> 00:03:17.691
wondering if I could take
a few classes with them

00:03:17.715 --> 00:03:20.363
and perhaps share their lessons
with my students.

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:22.135
I got an email response back,

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:25.739
and surprisingly, it was the first
time that I wasn't told,

00:03:25.763 --> 00:03:27.920
"Sorry, no, you can’t. You’re deaf."

00:03:27.944 --> 00:03:29.969
It said, "Well, that's interesting.

00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:31.913
I think maybe we can work something out
