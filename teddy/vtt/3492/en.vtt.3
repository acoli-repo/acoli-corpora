00:01:29.312 --> 00:01:31.835
but over and over again,
I got the same response:

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.012
“Sorry, you’re deaf. We can’t accept you.”

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.935
So I shifted gears
and decided to become a teacher.

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.986
I completed a master's in deaf education
and taught for almost two years,

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.470
until this past spring,
when three things occurred

00:01:43.494 --> 00:01:45.135
that changed that course,

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.964
the first of which, while I was teaching
a high school history class.

00:01:48.988 --> 00:01:51.362
I’d lectured on the Mexican-American War.

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:53.833
The bell had rung,
and I was seated at my desk,

00:01:53.857 --> 00:01:56.637
when one of my students,
who is deaf, approached me

00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:58.820
and said that he’d like
to join the military.

00:01:58.844 --> 00:02:00.997
I said, “Ah, sorry.
You can’t. You're deaf.”
