He’s really pushed for me,
and I respect him for all that.

00:14:02.476 --> 00:14:04.332
That’s me during one of the exercises.

00:14:04.356 --> 00:14:07.131
This is that Chinook helicopter
I almost didn’t get on.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.669
Every cadet has a mentor.

00:14:10.202 --> 00:14:12.868
My mentor is Cinatl.

00:14:13.359 --> 00:14:15.225
He’s a really sharp soldier.

00:14:15.249 --> 00:14:18.949
He teaches me all the finer points
and how to execute them ideally.

00:14:19.774 --> 00:14:23.429
This top picture is when
a group of us went to Las Vegas

00:14:23.453 --> 00:14:24.778
to compete in a test,

00:14:24.802 --> 00:14:28.701
to see if we could match the German
troops' physical training standards.

00:14:28.725 --> 00:14:32.700
It involved swimming, timed sprints,
marksmanship and numerous fitness events.
