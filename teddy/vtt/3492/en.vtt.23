00:11:27.322 --> 00:11:30.861
Once, at the garrison base,
during one of the training days,

00:11:30.885 --> 00:11:35.444
a huge Chinook helicopter with its
tandem rotors landed right down to us,

00:11:35.468 --> 00:11:37.637
forcefully spinning
exhilaration in the air.

00:11:38.006 --> 00:11:40.563
All of us cadets were supposed
to be getting on board.

00:11:40.587 --> 00:11:42.657
Everyone was geared up and ready.

00:11:42.681 --> 00:11:44.421
However, the cadre had decided

00:11:44.445 --> 00:11:47.108
I wasn’t going to be able
to ride the Chinook.

00:11:47.132 --> 00:11:49.514
They were afraid
if the pilot shouted out orders,

00:11:49.538 --> 00:11:51.770
how would I be able
to follow the instructions?

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:53.693
I’d potentially cause a disruption.

00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:55.711
So I had to stand aside,

00:11:55.735 --> 00:11:58.745
while the others were filing
toward the helicopter.

00:11:58.769 --> 00:12:01.724
I could see the cadre huddled up,
discussing, mulling it over.
