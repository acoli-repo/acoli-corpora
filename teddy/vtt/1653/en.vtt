It's a great time to be a molecular biologist. (Laughter)

00:00:03.994 --> 00:00:06.876
Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier

00:00:06.876 --> 00:00:08.408
and cheaper.

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:10.578
By the end of this year, we'll be able to sequence

00:00:10.578 --> 00:00:12.282
the three million bits of information

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:15.252
in your genome in less than a day

00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:17.662
and for less than 1,000 euros.

00:00:17.662 --> 00:00:20.492
Biotech is probably the most powerful

00:00:20.492 --> 00:00:23.516
and the fastest-growing technology sector.

00:00:23.516 --> 00:00:26.818
It has the power, potentially,

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:29.035
to replace our fossil fuels,

00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:31.252
to revolutionize medicine,
