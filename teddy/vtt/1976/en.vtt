00:00:00.515 --> 00:00:02.976
I think I was supposed
to talk about my new book,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.879
which is called "Blink,"

00:00:04.903 --> 00:00:07.647
and it's about snap judgments
and first impressions.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.791
And it comes out in January,
and I hope you all buy it in triplicate.

00:00:11.815 --> 00:00:13.289
(Laughter)

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:14.976
But I was thinking about this,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.210
and I realized that although
my new book makes me happy,

00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:21.870
and I think would make my mother happy,

00:00:21.894 --> 00:00:24.352
it's not really about happiness.

00:00:24.376 --> 00:00:27.976
So I decided instead,
I would talk about someone

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.679
who I think has done as much
to make Americans happy
