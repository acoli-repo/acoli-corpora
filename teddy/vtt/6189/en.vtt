Tom Stranger: In 1996,
when I was 18 years old,

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:11.480
I had the golden opportunity to go
on an international exchange program.

00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:15.792
Ironically I'm an Australian
who prefers proper icy cold weather,

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:20.675
so I was both excited and tearful
when I got on a plane to Iceland,

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.922
after just having farewelled
my parents and brothers goodbye.

00:00:24.853 --> 00:00:27.908
I was welcomed into the home
of a beautiful Icelandic family

00:00:27.932 --> 00:00:29.333
who took me hiking,

00:00:29.357 --> 00:00:32.448
and helped me get a grasp
of the melodic Icelandic language.
