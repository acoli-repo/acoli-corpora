00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:01.714
so she gave me this look, like, "Really?"

00:04:01.714 --> 00:04:04.391
And I said, "Veronica, actually,
the specialist I'm talking about

00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:06.677
is someone I call a community health worker,

00:04:06.677 --> 00:04:08.318
someone who, if it's okay with you,

00:04:08.318 --> 00:04:09.100
can come to your home

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.830
and try to understand what's going on

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.188
with those water leaks and that mold,

00:04:12.188 --> 00:04:16.226
trying to help you manage those conditions in your housing that I think are causing your symptoms,

00:04:16.226 --> 00:04:18.318
and if required, that specialist might refer you

00:04:18.318 --> 00:04:20.810
to another specialist that we
call a public interest lawyer,

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.503
because it might be that your landlord

00:04:22.503 --> 00:04:25.776
isn't making the fixes he's required to make."

00:04:25.776 --> 00:04:27.903
Veronica came back in a few months later.

00:04:27.903 --> 00:04:30.715
She agreed to all of those treatment plans.
