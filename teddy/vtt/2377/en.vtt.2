at that clinic in South Central Los Angeles.

00:01:01.174 --> 00:01:03.693
She came into our clinic with a chronic headache.

00:01:03.693 --> 00:01:04.856
This headache had been going on

00:01:04.856 --> 00:01:06.809
for a number of years, and this particular episode

was very, very troubling.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.974

00:01:24.786 --> 00:01:26.529
but if the pain persists or if it worsens,

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:28.258

00:01:28.258 --> 00:01:31.350
Veronica followed those standard instructions
