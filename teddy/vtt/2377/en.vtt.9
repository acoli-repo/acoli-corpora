00:04:27.903 --> 00:04:30.715
She agreed to all of those treatment plans.

00:04:30.715 --> 00:04:33.761
She told us that her symptoms
had improved by 90 percent.

00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:35.627
She was spending more time at work

00:04:35.627 --> 00:04:37.513
and with her family and less time

00:04:37.513 --> 00:04:42.123
shuttling back and forth between
the emergency rooms of Los Angeles.

00:04:42.123 --> 00:04:44.335
Veronica had improved remarkably.

00:04:44.335 --> 00:04:46.329
Her sons, one of whom had asthma,

00:04:46.329 --> 00:04:48.104
were no longer as sick as they used to be.

00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:50.491
She had gotten better, and not coincidentally,

00:04:50.491 --> 00:04:54.166
Veronica's home was better too.

00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:56.010
What was it about this different approach we tried

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.604
that led to better care,

00:04:59.604 --> 00:05:03.163
fewer visits to the E.R., better health?
