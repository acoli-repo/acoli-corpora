00:01:57.304 --> 00:02:00.925
When she came to our clinic, though, 
we tried a different approach.

00:02:00.925 --> 00:02:03.562
Our approach started with our medical assistant,

00:02:03.562 --> 00:02:05.609
someone who had a GED-level training

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:06.959
but knew the community.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.080
Our medical assistant asked some routine questions.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.532
She asked, "What's your chief complaint?"

00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:13.821
"Headache."

00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:15.115
"Let's get your vital signs" —

00:02:15.115 --> 00:02:17.624
measure your blood pressure and your heart rate,

00:02:17.624 --> 00:02:19.637
but let's also ask something equally as vital

00:02:19.637 --> 00:02:21.707
to Veronica and a lot of patients like her

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:23.514
in South Los Angeles.

00:02:23.514 --> 00:02:26.155
"Veronica, can you tell me about where you live?

00:02:26.155 --> 00:02:27.908
Specifically, about your housing conditions?

00:02:27.908 --> 00:02:30.361
Do you have mold? Do you have water leaks?
