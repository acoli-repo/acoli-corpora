00:16:28.238 --> 00:16:30.286
But finally, and perhaps most importantly,

00:16:30.286 --> 00:16:32.845
what do we do? What do we do as patients?

00:16:32.845 --> 00:16:35.110
We can start by simply going to our doctors

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:36.819
and our nurses, to our clinics,

00:16:36.819 --> 00:16:39.151
and asking, "Is there something in where I live

00:16:39.151 --> 00:16:41.494
and where I work that I should be aware of?"

00:16:41.494 --> 00:16:44.342
Are there barriers to health that I'm just not aware of,

00:16:44.342 --> 00:16:46.300
and more importantly, if there are barriers

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.281
that I'm surfacing, if I'm coming to you

00:16:48.281 --> 00:16:50.400
and I'm saying I think have a problem with

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.503
my apartment or at my workplace

00:16:52.503 --> 00:16:54.699
or I don't have access to transportation,

00:16:54.699 --> 00:16:56.330
or there's a park that's way too far,

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.190
so sorry doctor, I can't take your advice

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.276
to go and jog,
