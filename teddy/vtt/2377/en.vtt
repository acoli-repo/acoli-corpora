00:00:00.715 --> 00:00:02.464
For over a decade as a doctor,

00:00:02.464 --> 00:00:05.130
I've cared for homeless veterans,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.185
for working-class families.

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:11.406
I've cared for people who 
live and work in conditions

00:00:11.406 --> 00:00:13.855
that can be hard, if not harsh,

00:00:13.855 --> 00:00:15.608
and that work has led me to believe

00:00:15.608 --> 00:00:17.553
that we need a fundamentally different way

00:00:17.553 --> 00:00:19.787
of looking at healthcare.

00:00:19.787 --> 00:00:21.193
We simply need a healthcare system

00:00:21.193 --> 00:00:23.294
that moves beyond just looking at the symptoms

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:24.973
that bring people into clinics,

00:00:24.973 --> 00:00:27.850
but instead actually is able to look

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.445
and improve health where it begins.
