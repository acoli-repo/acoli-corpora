00:02:27.908 --> 00:02:30.361
Do you have mold? Do you have water leaks?

00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:32.518
Do you have roaches in your home?"

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:34.925
Turns out, Veronica said yes
to three of those things:

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:37.232
roaches, water leaks, mold.

00:02:37.232 --> 00:02:40.347
I received that chart in hand, reviewed it,

00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:41.674
and I turned the handle on the door

00:02:41.674 --> 00:02:43.666
and I entered the room.

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:45.116
You should understand that Veronica,

00:02:45.116 --> 00:02:47.569
like a lot of patients that I have
the privilege of caring for,

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.292
is a dignified person, a formidable presence,

00:02:50.292 --> 00:02:52.125
a personality that's larger than life,

00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:53.925
but here she was

00:02:53.925 --> 00:02:56.760
doubled over in pain sitting on my exam table.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.944
Her head, clearly throbbing, was resting in her hands.
