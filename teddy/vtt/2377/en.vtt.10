00:04:59.604 --> 00:05:03.163
fewer visits to the E.R., better health?

00:05:03.163 --> 00:05:05.260
Well, quite simply, it started with that question:

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.251
"Veronica, where do you live?"

00:05:08.251 --> 00:05:10.627
But more importantly, it was that we put in place

00:05:10.627 --> 00:05:13.197
a system that allowed us to routinely ask questions

and food insecurity are the major conditions

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.492
that we as a clinic had to be aware of,

00:05:29.492 --> 00:05:31.220
but in other communities it could be
