00:15:29.489 --> 00:15:31.144
These stories are compelling because

00:15:31.144 --> 00:15:33.124
not only do they tell us that we're this close

00:15:33.124 --> 00:15:35.710
to getting the healthcare system that we want,

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:38.459
but that there's something
that we can all do to get there.

00:15:38.459 --> 00:15:40.321
Doctors and nurses can get better at asking

00:15:40.321 --> 00:15:42.165
about the context of patients' lives,

00:15:42.165 --> 00:15:44.676
not simply because it's better bedside manner,

00:15:44.676 --> 00:15:47.758
but frankly, because it's a better standard of care.

00:15:47.758 --> 00:15:50.100
Healthcare systems and payers

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.890
can start to bring in public health agencies

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.305
and departments and say,

00:15:54.305 --> 00:15:55.843
let's look at our data together.

00:15:55.843 --> 00:15:59.369
Let's see if we can discover some patterns
in our data about our patients' lives

00:15:59.369 --> 00:16:01.840
and see if we can identify an upstream cause,
