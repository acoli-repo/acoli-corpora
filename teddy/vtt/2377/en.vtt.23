00:11:27.272 --> 00:11:30.080
matters, and the ability to do something about it

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.857
in the systems in which we work.

00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:34.191
This is a huge problem right now,

00:11:34.191 --> 00:11:36.339
because it leads them to this next question, which is,

00:11:36.339 --> 00:11:37.926
whose responsibility is it?

00:11:37.926 --> 00:11:39.635
And that brings me to that third point,

00:11:39.635 --> 00:11:42.909
that third answer to Veronica's compelling question.

00:11:42.909 --> 00:11:44.495
Part of the reason that we have this conundrum

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:48.250
is because there are not nearly enough upstreamists

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.295
in the healthcare system.

00:11:50.295 --> 00:11:52.195
There are not nearly enough of that third friend,

00:11:52.195 --> 00:11:53.959
that person who is going to find out

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:56.816
who or what is throwing those kids in the water.

00:11:56.816 --> 00:11:58.521
Now, there are many upstreamists,

00:11:58.521 --> 00:12:00.962
and I've had the privilege of meeting many of them,
