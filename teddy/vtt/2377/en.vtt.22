00:10:58.349 --> 00:11:01.169
It's not that doctors don't know
these are important issues.

00:11:01.169 --> 00:11:03.040
In a recent survey done in the U.S. among physicians,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.931
over 1,000 physicians,

00:11:04.931 --> 00:11:06.743
80 percent of them actually said that

00:11:06.743 --> 00:11:08.441
they know that their patients' upstream problems

00:11:08.441 --> 00:11:10.328
are as important as their health issues,

00:11:10.328 --> 00:11:12.020
as their medical problems,

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.381
and yet despite that widespread awareness

00:11:14.381 --> 00:11:16.315
of the importance of upstream issues,

00:11:16.315 --> 00:11:18.588
only one in five doctors said they had

00:11:18.588 --> 00:11:21.453
any sense of confidence to address those issues,

00:11:21.453 --> 00:11:23.301
to improve health where it begins.

00:11:23.301 --> 00:11:24.843
There's this gap between knowing

00:11:24.843 --> 00:11:27.272
that patients' lives, the context
of where they live and work,

00:11:27.272 --> 00:11:30.080
matters, and the ability to do something about it
