00:13:29.203 --> 00:13:31.734
is that next critical part of what upstreamists do.

00:13:31.734 --> 00:13:33.973
They mobilize the resources to create a solution,

00:13:33.973 --> 00:13:35.694
both within the clinical system,

00:13:35.694 --> 00:13:38.030
and then by bringing in people from public health,

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:39.372
from other sectors, lawyers,

00:13:39.372 --> 00:13:41.319
whoever is willing to play ball,

00:13:41.319 --> 00:13:43.402
let's bring in to create a solution that makes sense,

00:13:43.402 --> 00:13:46.212
to take those patients who
actually have clinical problems

00:13:46.212 --> 00:13:48.395
and address their root causes together

00:13:48.395 --> 00:13:50.937
by linking them to the resources you need.

00:13:50.937 --> 00:13:52.714
It's clear to me that there are so many stories

00:13:52.714 --> 00:13:55.200
of upstreamists who are doing remarkable things.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.860
The problem is that there's just not
nearly enough of them out there.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.443
By some estimates, we need one upstreamist
