WEBVTT

00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:00.874
we have that raft-builder.

00:07:00.874 --> 00:07:02.585
That's the primary care clinician,

00:07:02.585 --> 00:07:04.743
people on the care team who are there

00:07:04.743 --> 00:07:06.333
to manage your chronic conditions,

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:07.874
your diabetes, your hypertension,

00:07:07.874 --> 00:07:09.280
there to give you your annual checkups,

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.485
there to make sure your vaccines are up to date,

00:07:11.485 --> 00:07:13.150
but also there to make sure that you have

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.626
a raft to sit on and usher yourself to safety.

00:07:16.626 --> 00:07:18.393
But while that's also vital and very necessary,

00:07:18.393 --> 00:07:20.237
what we're missing is that third friend.

00:07:20.237 --> 00:07:22.352
We don't have enough of that upstreamist.

00:07:22.352 --> 00:07:24.013
The upstreamists are the health care professionals

00:07:24.013 --> 00:07:26.300
who know that health does begin

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.291
where we live and work and play,

00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:30.823
but beyond that awareness, is able to mobilize
