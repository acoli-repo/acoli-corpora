00:14:29.328 --> 00:14:30.689
but the main thing that we're interested in

00:14:30.689 --> 00:14:32.601
is making sure that we're changing

00:14:32.601 --> 00:14:34.140
the sense of confidence,

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.045
that "don't ask, don't tell" metric among clinicians.

00:14:36.045 --> 00:14:38.344
We're trying to make sure that clinicians,

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:40.284
and therefore their systems that they work in

00:14:40.284 --> 00:14:42.579
have the ability, the confidence

00:14:42.579 --> 00:14:45.254
to address the problems in the living

00:14:45.254 --> 00:14:48.261
and working conditions in our lives.

00:14:48.261 --> 00:14:50.240
We're seeing nearly a tripling

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.821
of that confidence in our work.

00:14:51.821 --> 00:14:53.124
It's remarkable,

00:14:53.124 --> 00:14:55.038
but I'll tell you the most compelling part

00:14:55.038 --> 00:14:56.607
of what it means to be working

00:14:56.607 --> 00:15:01.090
with upstreamists to gather them together.
