00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.445
and improve health where it begins.

00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:31.932
And where health begins

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:34.692
is not in the four walls of a doctor's office,

00:00:34.692 --> 00:00:36.102
but where we live

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.321
and where we work,

00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:41.473
where we eat, sleep, learn and play,

00:00:41.473 --> 00:00:44.900
where we spend the majority of our lives.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.568
So what does this different 
approach to healthcare look like,

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:50.794
an approach that can improve health where it begins?

00:00:50.794 --> 00:00:54.601
To illustrate this, I'll tell you about Veronica.

00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:56.320
Veronica was the 17th patient

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.227
out of my 26-patient day

00:00:58.227 --> 00:01:01.174
at that clinic in South Central Los Angeles.
