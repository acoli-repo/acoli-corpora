00:07:57.337 --> 00:08:00.454
is important enough work.

00:08:00.454 --> 00:08:01.725
Who has the time?

00:08:01.725 --> 00:08:04.616
I would argue, though, that if we
were to use science as our guide,

00:08:04.616 --> 00:08:07.349
that we would find an upstream
approach is absolutely necessary.

00:08:07.349 --> 00:08:09.104
Scientists now know that

00:08:09.104 --> 00:08:11.354
the living and working conditions that we all

00:08:11.354 --> 00:08:12.990
are part of

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.380
have more than twice the impact on our health

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.507
than does our genetic code,

00:08:17.507 --> 00:08:18.840
and living and working conditions,

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.226
the structures of our environments,

00:08:20.226 --> 00:08:23.695
the ways in which our social fabric is woven together,

00:08:23.695 --> 00:08:25.877
and the impact those have on our behaviors,

00:08:25.877 --> 00:08:28.190
all together, those have more than five times

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.155
the impact on our health

00:08:29.155 --> 00:08:31.164
than do all the pills and procedures
