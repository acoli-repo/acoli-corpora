00:05:29.492 --> 00:05:31.220
but in other communities it could be

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.300
transportation barriers, obesity,

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.685
access to parks, gun violence.

00:05:36.685 --> 00:05:38.919
The important thing is, we put in place a system

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.283
that worked,

00:05:40.283 --> 00:05:42.554
and it's an approach that I call an upstream approach.

00:05:42.554 --> 00:05:44.227
It's a term many of you are familiar with.

00:05:44.227 --> 00:05:46.344
It comes from a parable that's very common

00:05:46.344 --> 00:05:48.663
in the public health community.

00:05:48.663 --> 00:05:51.273
This is a parable of three friends.

00:05:51.273 --> 00:05:53.440
Imagine that you're one of these three friends

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.020
who come to a river.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.380
It's a beautiful scene, but it's
shattered by the cries of a child,

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.357
and actually several children,
in need of rescue in the water.
