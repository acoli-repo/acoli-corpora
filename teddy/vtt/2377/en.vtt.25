00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.176
That process is a quite simple process.

00:12:30.176 --> 00:12:32.549
It's one, two and three.

00:12:32.549 --> 00:12:34.200
First, they sit down and they say,

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.224
let's identify the clinical problem

00:12:36.224 --> 00:12:37.567
among a certain set of patients.

00:12:37.567 --> 00:12:39.310
Let's say, for instance,

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.244
let's try to help children

00:12:41.244 --> 00:12:43.048
who are bouncing in and out of the hospital

00:12:43.048 --> 00:12:45.130
with asthma.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.641
After identifying the problem, they 
then move on to that second step,

00:12:47.641 --> 00:12:50.380
and they say, let's identify the root cause.

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.171
Now, a root cause analysis, in healthcare,

00:12:54.171 --> 00:12:55.886
usually says, well, let's look at your genes,

00:12:55.886 --> 00:12:58.344
let's look at how you're behaving.

00:12:58.344 --> 00:13:00.424
Maybe you're not eating healthy enough.
