00:08:58.767 --> 00:09:00.851
a landmark study that reviewed the records

00:09:00.851 --> 00:09:04.192
of over 40 million residents in the U.K.,

00:09:04.192 --> 00:09:06.020
looked at several variables,

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.587
controlled for a lot of factors, and found that

00:09:08.587 --> 00:09:12.670
when trying to adjust the risk of heart disease,

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.701
one's exposure to green
space was a powerful influence.

00:09:15.701 --> 00:09:17.580
The closer you were to green space,

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.922
to parks and trees,

00:09:18.922 --> 00:09:20.417
the lower your chance of heart disease,

00:09:20.417 --> 00:09:23.224
and that stayed true for rich and for poor.

00:09:23.224 --> 00:09:25.544
That study illustrates what my friends in public health

00:09:25.544 --> 00:09:27.042
often say these days:

00:09:27.042 --> 00:09:29.110
that one's zip code matters more

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:30.786
than your genetic code.
