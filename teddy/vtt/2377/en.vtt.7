00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.329
and examining her and listening to her,

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.134
I said, "Veronica, I think I know what you have.

00:03:34.134 --> 00:03:36.188
I think you have chronic allergies,

00:03:36.188 --> 00:03:38.451
and I think you have migraine
headaches and some sinus congestion,

00:03:38.451 --> 00:03:41.989
and I think all of those are 
related to where you live."

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.733
She looked a little bit relieved,

00:03:43.733 --> 00:03:45.708
because for the first time, she had a diagnosis,

00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:47.945
but I said, "Veronica, now let's
talk about your treatment.

00:03:47.945 --> 00:03:51.387
We're going to order some
medications for your symptoms,

00:03:51.387 --> 00:03:54.920
but I also want to refer you to
a specialist, if that's okay."

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.226
Now, specialists are a little hard to find

00:03:57.226 --> 00:03:59.028
in South Central Los Angeles,

00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:01.714
so she gave me this look, like, "Really?"
