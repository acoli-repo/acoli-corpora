00:10:29.323 --> 00:10:31.167
And there are many reasons for that, but the big three

00:10:31.167 --> 00:10:35.767
are first, we don't pay for that.

00:10:35.767 --> 00:10:39.152
In healthcare, we often pay 
for volume and not value.

00:10:39.152 --> 00:10:40.940
We pay doctors and hospitals usually

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.920
for the number of services they provide,

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.219
but not necessarily on how healthy they make you.

00:10:46.219 --> 00:10:48.530
That leads to a second phenomenon that I call

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:49.910
the "don't ask, don't tell" approach

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.484
to upstream issues in healthcare.

00:10:52.484 --> 00:10:54.228
We don't ask about where you
live and where you work,

00:10:54.228 --> 00:10:55.453
because if there's a problem there,

00:10:55.453 --> 00:10:58.349
we don't know what to tell you.

00:10:58.349 --> 00:11:01.169
It's not that doctors don't know
these are important issues.
