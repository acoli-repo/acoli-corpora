00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:04.595
I want to talk about social innovation

00:00:04.619 --> 00:00:06.546
and social entrepreneurship.

00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:10.166
I happen to have triplets.

00:00:10.773 --> 00:00:12.739
They're little. They're five years old.

00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:16.406
Sometimes I tell people I have triplets.
They say, "Really? How many?"

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.795
(Laughter)

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:21.920
Here's a picture of the kids --
that's Sage, and Annalisa and Rider.

00:00:23.396 --> 00:00:26.498
Now, I also happen to be gay.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.558
Being gay and fathering triplets is by far
