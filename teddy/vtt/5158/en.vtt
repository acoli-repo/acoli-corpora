In 1165, copies of a strange letter began 
to circulate throughout Western Europe.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.500
It spoke of a fantastical realm,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.290
containing the Tower of Babel 
and the Fountain of Youth—

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.616
all ruled over by the letter’s 
mysterious author: Prester John.

00:00:25.616 --> 00:00:30.155
Today, we know that this extraordinary
king never existed.
