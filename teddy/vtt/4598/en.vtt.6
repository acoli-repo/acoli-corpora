00:02:55.127 --> 00:03:00.137
But soon, some of our Sun-adapted
ancestors migrated northward

00:03:00.137 --> 00:03:01.718
out of the tropical zone,

00:03:01.718 --> 00:03:04.678
spreading far and wide across the Earth.

00:03:04.678 --> 00:03:08.316
The further north they traveled,
the less direct sunshine they saw.

00:03:08.316 --> 00:03:12.211
This was a problem because 
although UV light can damage skin,

00:03:12.211 --> 00:03:15.269
it also has an important parallel benefit.

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.227
UV helps our bodies produce vitamin D,

00:03:18.227 --> 00:03:22.251
an ingredient that strengthens bones
and lets us absorb vital minerals,

00:03:22.251 --> 00:03:26.384
like calcium, iron, magnesium, 
phosphate, and zinc.

00:03:26.384 --> 00:03:30.524
Without it, humans experience serious
fatigue and weakened bones
