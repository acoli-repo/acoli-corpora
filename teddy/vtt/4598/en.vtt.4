The key to survival lay 
in their own personal sunscreen

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:05.166
manufactured beneath the skin: melanin.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.613
The type and amount 
of melanin in your skin

00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:11.637
determines whether you'll be more or less
protected from the sun.

00:02:11.637 --> 00:02:15.373
This comes down to the skin's response
as sunlight strikes it.

00:02:15.373 --> 00:02:17.334
When it's exposed to UV light,

00:02:17.334 --> 00:02:21.070
that triggers special light-sensitive 
receptors called rhodopsin,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.637
which stimulate the production of melanin
to shield cells from damage.

00:02:25.637 --> 00:02:30.598
For light-skin people, that extra melanin
darkens their skin and produces a tan.
