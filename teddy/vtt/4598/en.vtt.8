00:03:56.666 --> 00:04:00.657
and survived well enough to produce
healthy offspring.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.715
Over many generations of selection,

00:04:02.715 --> 00:04:05.997
skin color in those regions
gradually lightened.

00:04:05.997 --> 00:04:09.509
As a result of 
our ancestor's adaptability,

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:13.828
today the planet is full of people
with a vast palette of skin colors,

00:04:13.828 --> 00:04:19.165
typically, darker eumelanin-rich skin
in the hot, sunny band around the Equator,

00:04:19.165 --> 00:04:23.869
and increasingly lighter pheomelanin-rich
skin shades fanning outwards

00:04:23.869 --> 00:04:26.211
as the sunshine dwindles.

00:04:26.211 --> 00:04:30.461
Therefore, skin color is little more than
an adaptive trait for living on a rock
