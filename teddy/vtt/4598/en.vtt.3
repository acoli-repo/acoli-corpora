by the Sun's UV-carrying rays.

00:01:31.372 --> 00:01:34.908
When skin is exposed to UV for long
periods of time,

00:01:34.908 --> 00:01:38.287
the UV light damages 
the DNA within our cells,

00:01:38.287 --> 00:01:40.634
and skin starts to burn.

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:42.342
If that damage is severe enough,

00:01:42.342 --> 00:01:44.980
the cells mutations can lead to melanoma,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.687
a deadly cancer that forms 
in the skin's melanocytes.

00:01:49.687 --> 00:01:53.901
Sunscreen as we know it today
didn't exist 50,000 years ago.

00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:58.179
So how did our ancestors cope 
with this onslaught of UV?

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.749
The key to survival lay 
in their own personal sunscreen
