When ultraviolet sunlight hits our skin,

00:00:12.117 --> 00:00:14.890
it affects each of us 
a little differently.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.235
Depending on skin color, it will take
only minutes of exposure

00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:20.585
to turn one person beetroot-pink,

00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:24.783
while another requires hours to experience
the slightest change.

00:00:24.783 --> 00:00:26.831
So what's to account for that difference

00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:31.721
and how did our skin come to take on
so many different hues to begin with?
