00:03:26.384 --> 00:03:30.524
Without it, humans experience serious
fatigue and weakened bones

00:03:30.524 --> 00:03:33.783
that can cause a condition 
known as rickets.

00:03:33.783 --> 00:03:37.706
For humans whose dark skin effectively
blocked whatever sunlight there was,

00:03:37.706 --> 00:03:42.057
vitamin D deficiency would have posed
a serious threat in the north.

00:03:42.057 --> 00:03:44.656
But some of them happened to produce
less melanin.

00:03:44.656 --> 00:03:49.232
They were exposed to small enough amounts
of light that melanoma was less likely,

00:03:49.232 --> 00:03:53.347
and their lighter skin 
better absorbed the UV light.

00:03:53.347 --> 00:03:55.438
So they benefited from vitamin D,

00:03:55.438 --> 00:03:56.666
developed strong bones,

00:03:56.666 --> 00:04:00.657
and survived well enough to produce
healthy offspring.
