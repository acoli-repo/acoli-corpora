00:02:25.637 --> 00:02:30.598
For light-skin people, that extra melanin
darkens their skin and produces a tan.

00:02:30.598 --> 00:02:33.264
Over the course of generations,

00:02:33.264 --> 00:02:36.643
humans living at 
the Sun-saturated latitudes in Africa

00:02:36.643 --> 00:02:39.959
adapted to have a higher 
melanin production threshold

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.917
and more eumelanin,

00:02:41.917 --> 00:02:44.592
giving skin a darker tone.

00:02:44.592 --> 00:02:48.036
This built-in sun shield helped protect
them from melanoma,

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:50.388
likely making them evolutionarily fitter

00:02:50.388 --> 00:02:55.127
and capable of passing this useful trait
on to new generations.

00:02:55.127 --> 00:03:00.137
But soon, some of our Sun-adapted
ancestors migrated northward
