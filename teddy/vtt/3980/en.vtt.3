00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.637
But you can barely see it

00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:34.621
until I remove all the other
organs in front.

00:01:35.093 --> 00:01:38.089
It's also surrounded
by many other vital organs,

00:01:38.113 --> 00:01:41.225
like the liver, the stomach,
the bile duct.

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:44.662
And the ability of the tumor
to grow into those organs

00:01:44.686 --> 00:01:46.708
is the reason why pancreatic cancer

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:49.664
is one of the most painful tumor types.

00:01:50.295 --> 00:01:53.457
The hard-to-reach location
also prevents the doctor

00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:55.200
from surgically removing it,

00:01:55.224 --> 00:01:58.259
as is routinely done
for breast cancer, for example.

00:01:58.716 --> 00:02:02.100
So all of these reasons leave
chemotherapy as the only option
