00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:31.643
It's become the third cause
of cancer deaths,

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:37.193
and only eight percent of the patients
will survive beyond five years.

00:00:37.217 --> 00:00:39.136
That's a very tiny number,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.916
especially if you compare it
with breast cancer,

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.380
where the survival rate
is almost 90 percent.

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:48.313
So it doesn't really come as a surprise

00:00:48.337 --> 00:00:50.802
that being diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer

00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:54.077
means facing an almost
certain death sentence.

00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:57.747
What's shocking, though,
is that in the last 40 years,

00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:00.149
this number hasn't changed a bit,
