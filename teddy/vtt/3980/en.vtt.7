00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.196
and the Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston,

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.133
we have revolutionized
the way we treat cancer

00:03:33.157 --> 00:03:36.500
by making localized
drug delivery a reality.

00:03:36.974 --> 00:03:40.960
We are basically parachuting you
on top of your destination,

00:03:40.984 --> 00:03:43.886
avoiding your having to drive
all around the highway.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.200
We have embedded the drug
into devices that look like this one.

00:03:49.224 --> 00:03:54.413
They are flexible enough
that they can be folded

00:03:54.437 --> 00:03:56.359
to fit into the catheter,

00:03:56.383 --> 00:04:00.179
so the doctor can implant it
directly on top of the tumor
