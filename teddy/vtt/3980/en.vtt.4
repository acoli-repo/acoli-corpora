00:01:58.716 --> 00:02:02.100
So all of these reasons leave
chemotherapy as the only option

00:02:02.124 --> 00:02:04.267
for the pancreatic cancer patient.

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:07.198
This brings us to the second
piece of bad news.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.187
Pancreatic cancer tumors have
very few blood vessels.

00:02:11.624 --> 00:02:15.410
Why should we care
about the blood vessel of a tumor?

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:18.900
Let's think for a second
how chemotherapy works.

00:02:18.924 --> 00:02:20.813
The drug is injected in the vein

00:02:20.837 --> 00:02:25.481
and it navigates throughout the body
until it reaches the tumor site.

00:02:25.505 --> 00:02:29.680
It's like driving on a highway,
trying to reach a destination.
