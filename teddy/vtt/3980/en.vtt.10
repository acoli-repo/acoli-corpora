00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.233
We are working relentlessly to bring
this technology to the next level.

00:05:01.257 --> 00:05:04.104
We are finalizing the pre-clinical testing

00:05:04.128 --> 00:05:08.207
and the animal model required
prior to asking the FDA for approval

00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:09.838
for clinical trials.

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:16.100
Currently, the majority of patients
will die from pancreatic cancer.

00:05:16.124 --> 00:05:17.959
We are hoping that one day,

00:05:17.983 --> 00:05:21.254
we can reduce their pain,
extend their life

00:05:21.278 --> 00:05:24.311
and potentially make pancreatic cancer

00:05:24.335 --> 00:05:25.873
a curable disease.

00:05:26.257 --> 00:05:28.977
By rethinking the way we deliver the drug,

00:05:29.001 --> 00:05:32.758
we don't only make it
more powerful and less toxic,
