00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:00.149
this number hasn't changed a bit,

while much more progress has been made

00:01:02.301 --> 00:01:03.988
with other types of tumors.

00:01:04.552 --> 00:01:08.212
So how can we make pancreatic cancer
treatment more effective?

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.565
As a biomedical entrepreneur,

00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:29.966
It's depicted in orange on the screen.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.637
But you can barely see it
