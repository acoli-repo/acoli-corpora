00:03:56.383 --> 00:04:00.179
so the doctor can implant it
directly on top of the tumor

00:04:00.203 --> 00:04:02.268
with minimally invasive surgery.

00:04:02.603 --> 00:04:06.373
But they are solid enough
that once they are positioned

00:04:06.397 --> 00:04:08.088
on top of the tumor,

00:04:08.112 --> 00:04:09.881
they will act as a cage.

00:04:09.905 --> 00:04:13.056
They will actually
physically prevent the tumor

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.755
from entering other organs,

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:17.214
controlling the metastasis.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.743
The devices are also biodegradable.

00:04:20.767 --> 00:04:22.517
That means that once in the body,

00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:24.426
they start dissolving,

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.813
delivering the drug only locally,
slowly and more effectively

00:04:29.837 --> 00:04:33.320
than what is done with the current
whole-body treatment.
