00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.333
To me, it seems very counterintuitive
to have a whole-body treatment

00:03:01.357 --> 00:03:03.621
to target a specific organ.

00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:06.097
However, in the last 40 years,

00:03:06.121 --> 00:03:10.445
a lot of money, research
and effort have gone towards

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:14.552
finding new, powerful drugs
to treat pancreatic cancer,

00:03:14.576 --> 00:03:16.987
but nothing has been done
in changing the way

00:03:17.011 --> 00:03:19.074
we deliver them to the patient.

00:03:20.397 --> 00:03:22.023
So after two pieces of bad news,

00:03:22.047 --> 00:03:25.076
I'm going to give you
good news, hopefully.

With a collaborator at MIT

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.196
and the Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston,
