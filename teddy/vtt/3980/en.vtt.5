00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.965
But what if your destination
doesn't have an exit on the highway?

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.618
You will never get there.

00:02:35.642 --> 00:02:37.764
And that's exactly the same problem

00:02:37.788 --> 00:02:40.481
for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer.

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.964
The drugs navigate
throughout all of your body.

00:02:43.988 --> 00:02:46.401
They will reach healthy organs,

00:02:46.425 --> 00:02:50.232
resulting in high toxic effect
for the patients overall,

00:02:50.256 --> 00:02:52.771
but very little will go to the tumor.

00:02:52.795 --> 00:02:55.223
Therefore, the efficacy is very limited.

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.333
To me, it seems very counterintuitive
to have a whole-body treatment
