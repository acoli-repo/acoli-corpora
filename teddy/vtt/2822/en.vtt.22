00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.456
and it took going to these malls

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.120
for me to be inspired again.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.296
And to see my audience

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.216
and people from all over the world
writing me and saying,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.456
"God, I love your videos,"

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.400
is incredible.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.976
I don't know how to even explain it,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.376
as an artist,

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.296
how fulfilling that is.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.440
If you would have told me a year ago

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.440
that I would be standing on this stage

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.336
talking to all of you wonderful people,

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.856
I would have never believed it.
