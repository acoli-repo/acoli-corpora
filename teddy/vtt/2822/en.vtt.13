00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.216
so I started using a hidden camera
and different techniques

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.856
to get the footage that I needed,

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.016
and basically what I wanted to do

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.256
was make the video

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.616
like it was a first-person experience,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.680
like you are sitting --

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.736
put your headphones on
watching the screen --

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.656
it's like, you're there in the video,

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.400
like a video game, basically.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.976
I also started to use music,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.256
collaborating with artists
who create music called vaporwave.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.216
And vaporwave is a music genre

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.216
that emerged in the early 2010s
among internet communities.
