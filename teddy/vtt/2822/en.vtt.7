00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.416
So when I started producing
"The Dead Mall Series,"

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.176
I put the videos up onto YouTube,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.336
and while I thought they were interesting,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.936
frankly I didn't think others
would share the enthusiasm

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.400
for such a drab and depressing topic.
