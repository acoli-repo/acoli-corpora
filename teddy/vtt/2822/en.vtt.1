00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.736
I started producing this series

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.080
in early 2015

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.096
after going through
kind of a dark period in my life

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.616
where I just didn't want
to create films anymore.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.880
I put my camera away

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.200
and I just stopped.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.520
So in 2015, I decided to make
a short film about the Owings Mills Mall.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.576
Owings Mills Mall opened in 1986.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.480
I should know because
I was there on opening day.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.896
I was there with my family,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.080
along with every other
family in Baltimore,
