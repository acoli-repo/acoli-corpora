00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.080
along with every other
family in Baltimore,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.656
and you had to drive around

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.376
for 45 minutes

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.176
just to find a parking spot.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.736
So if you can imagine,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.680
that's not happening at the malls today.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.816
My first mall job that I had as a teenager

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.376
was at a sporting goods store
called Herman's World of Sports.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.616
Maybe you remember.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.536
(Singing) Herman's World of Sports.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.136
You guys remember that?

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.056
(Laughter)

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.680
Yeah, so I worked in a lady's shoe store.
