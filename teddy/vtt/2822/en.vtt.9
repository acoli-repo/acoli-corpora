00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.080
Some were abandoned.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.536
It was kind of always hard
to get into the ones that were abandoned,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.056
but I somehow always found a way in.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.456
(Laughter)

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.536
The malls that are still open,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.176
they always do this weird thing --
like the dead malls.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.736
They'll have three stores left,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.776
but they try to spruce it up

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.136
to make it appear
like things are on the up-and-up.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.016
For example,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.056
you'll have an empty store

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.856
and they bring the gate down.
