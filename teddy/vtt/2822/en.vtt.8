00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.400
for such a drab and depressing topic.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.616
But apparently I was wrong,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.696
because a lot of people
started to comment.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.600
And at first the comments were like --

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.496
basically like, "Oh my God,
that's the mall from my childhood.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.720
What happened?"

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.120
And then I would get comments
from people who were like,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.800
"There's a dead mall in my town.
You should come and film it."

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:26.056
So I started to travel around
the mid-Atlantic region

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.696
filming these dead malls.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.920
Some were open.
