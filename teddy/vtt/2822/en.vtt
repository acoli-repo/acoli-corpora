In the last couple of years,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.896
I have produced what I call
"The Dead Mall Series,"

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.176
32 short films and counting
about dead malls.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.616
Now, for those of you who are
not familiar with what a dead mall is,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.056
it's basically a shopping mall

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.560
that has fallen into hard times.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.976
So it either has few shops
and fewer shoppers,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.240
or it's abandoned and crumbling into ruin.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.496
No sale at Penny's.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.336
(Laughter)

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.736
I started producing this series
