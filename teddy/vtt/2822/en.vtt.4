00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.216
I did what any normal teenager did

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.440
in the 1990s.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.120
I shoplifted.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.295
I'm just kidding.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.216
I hung out with my friends at the mall.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.776
(Laughter)

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.816
Everyone's like, "Oh my God,
what kind of talk is this?"

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.080
(Laughter)

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.416
Hanging out at the mall could be fun,
but it could be really lame, too,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.896
like sharing a cigarette
with a 40-year-old unemployed mall rat

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.056
who has put on
black lipstick for the night
