00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:31.157
When you open the doors,

00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:34.087
they look the same
as they did 50 years ago.

00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:39.435
We've just changed the location,
the size, the way they operate.

00:03:40.273 --> 00:03:42.617
Can you name anything else
that looks the same

00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:44.196
as it did 50 years ago?

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.375
It's crazy.

00:03:45.836 --> 00:03:48.868
We've made all the tweaks
to the model that we could,

00:03:48.892 --> 00:03:51.890
and now we hit its limits.

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:57.869
After all of our attempts to fix
the manufacturing model failed,

00:03:57.893 --> 00:04:00.698
we thought growth could come
from elsewhere.
