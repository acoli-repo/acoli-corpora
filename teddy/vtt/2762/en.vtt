00:00:01.734 --> 00:00:04.270
Guys, we have an issue.

00:00:04.294 --> 00:00:05.392
(Laughter)

00:00:05.416 --> 00:00:08.210
Growth is fading away,
and it's a big deal.

00:00:09.136 --> 00:00:11.292
Our global economy stops growing.

00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:13.417
And it's not new.

00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:16.752
Growth has actually declined
for the last 50 years.

00:00:17.213 --> 00:00:19.753
If we continue like this, we need to learn

00:00:19.777 --> 00:00:23.502
how to live in a world
with no growth in the next decade.

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.726
This is scary because
when the economy doesn't grow,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.710
our children don't get better lives.
