Not only did this not
inspire productivity,

00:02:32.655 --> 00:02:35.127
but it only saved money
for a short period of time,

00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:37.690
because cheap labor
didn't stay cheap for long.

00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:42.377
Then, we've tried to make
our factories larger

00:02:42.401 --> 00:02:44.290
and we specialized them by product.

00:02:45.318 --> 00:02:48.631
The idea was that we can
make a lot of one product

00:02:48.655 --> 00:02:51.037
and stockpile it to be sold with demand.

00:02:52.022 --> 00:02:54.601
This did help productivity for a while.

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:58.546
But it introduced a lot of rigidities
in our supply chain.

00:02:59.432 --> 00:03:00.828
Let's take fashion retail.
