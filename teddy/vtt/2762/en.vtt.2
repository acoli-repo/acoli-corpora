The steam engine
in the middle of the 19th century,

00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:04.228
the mass-production model
in the beginning of the 20th century --

00:01:04.252 --> 00:01:05.571
thanks, Mr. Ford.

00:01:06.384 --> 00:01:09.368
And the first automation
wave in the 1970s.

00:01:10.157 --> 00:01:12.353
Why did these manufacturing revolutions

00:01:12.377 --> 00:01:14.602
create huge growth in our economies?

00:01:15.677 --> 00:01:18.791
Because they have injected
huge productivity improvement.

00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:20.741
It's rather simple:

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.315
in order to grow,
you need to be producing more,

00:01:24.339 --> 00:01:26.307
putting more into our economy.

00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:32.853
This means either more labor
or more capital or more productivity.
