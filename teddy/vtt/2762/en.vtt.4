00:01:59.935 --> 00:02:05.206
I'm here to tell you about the amazing
fourth manufacturing revolution

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.642
that is currently underway.

00:02:07.213 --> 00:02:09.674
It's not as if we've done nothing
with manufacturing

00:02:09.698 --> 00:02:10.987
since the last revolution.

00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:13.426
Actually, we've made
some pretty lame attempts

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.051
to try to revitalize it.

00:02:15.075 --> 00:02:18.052
But none of them
have been the big overhaul

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:19.965
we really need to get us growing again.

00:02:20.384 --> 00:02:24.978
For example, we've tried
to relocate our factories offshore

00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:28.025
in order to reduce cost
and take advantage of cheap labor.

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:32.631
Not only did this not
inspire productivity,
