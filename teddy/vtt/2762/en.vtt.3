Each time, productivity
has been the growth lever.

00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:40.487
I'm here today to tell you

00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:44.221
that we are on the verge
of another huge change,

00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:47.707
and that this change, surprisingly enough,

00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:50.401
is going to come
from manufacturing, again.

00:01:51.394 --> 00:01:54.502
It will get us out of our growth slump

00:01:54.526 --> 00:01:58.370
and it will change radically
the way globalization has been shaped

00:01:58.394 --> 00:01:59.635
over the last decade.

00:01:59.935 --> 00:02:05.206
I'm here to tell you about the amazing
fourth manufacturing revolution
