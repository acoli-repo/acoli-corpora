Imagine that -- sitting at work,
scrolling through Facebook,

00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:35.109
watching videos on YouTube
has made us less productive.

00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:36.284
Weird.

00:04:36.308 --> 00:04:37.892
(Laughter)

00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:39.697
This is why we are not growing.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.856
We failed at reinventing
the manufacturing space,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.830
and large technological innovations
have played away from it.

00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:51.458
But what if we could combine those forces?

00:04:51.927 --> 00:04:56.795
What if the existing manufacturing
and large technological innovation

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:01.382
came together to create
the next big manufacturing reinvention.
