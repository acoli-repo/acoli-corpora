00:09:59.007 --> 00:10:03.452
will be much cleaner,
much better for our environment.

00:10:04.678 --> 00:10:08.463
In mature economies,
manufacturing will be back home,

00:10:08.487 --> 00:10:10.563
creating more employment,

00:10:10.587 --> 00:10:12.954
more productivity and more growth.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.422
Good news, isn't it?

00:10:16.541 --> 00:10:18.346
But here's the thing with growth --

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.025
it does not come automatically.

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:22.455
Mature economies will have to seize it.

00:10:23.196 --> 00:10:26.102
We'll have to massively
re-train our workforce.

00:10:26.547 --> 00:10:29.207
In most countries,
like in my country, France,

00:10:29.231 --> 00:10:32.333
we've told our children
that manufacturing had no future.
