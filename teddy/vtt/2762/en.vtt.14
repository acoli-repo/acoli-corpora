00:06:59.967 --> 00:07:04.460
fuel nozzles are some of the most
complex parts to manufacture,

00:07:04.484 --> 00:07:05.782
for one reason:

00:07:05.806 --> 00:07:08.995
they are made up of 20 different parts

00:07:09.019 --> 00:07:11.830
that need to be separately produced

00:07:11.854 --> 00:07:14.479
and then painstakingly assembled.

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:18.427
Aerospace companies
are now using 3D printing,

00:07:18.451 --> 00:07:21.515
which allows them to turn
those 20 different parts

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:22.849
into just one.

00:07:23.368 --> 00:07:24.518
The results?

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:27.245
40 percent more productivity,

00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:30.536
40 percent more output produced,
40 percent more growth
