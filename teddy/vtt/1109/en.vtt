00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Thank you very much.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Please excuse me for sitting; I'm very old.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
(Laughter)

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, the topic I'm going to discuss

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is one which is, in a certain sense, very peculiar

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because it's very old.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Roughness is part of human life

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
forever and forever,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and ancient authors have written about it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It was very much uncontrollable,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and in a certain sense,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
it seemed to be the extreme of complexity,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
just a mess, a mess and a mess.
