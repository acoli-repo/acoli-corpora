00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:02.548
with a few others, make them quasars.

00:01:02.548 --> 00:01:05.465
At the same time, the objects I study

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.242
are producing some of the most
powerful particle streams

00:01:08.242 --> 00:01:09.937
ever observed.

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:12.777
These narrow streams, called jets,

00:01:12.777 --> 00:01:17.385
are moving at 99.99 percent 
of the speed of light,

00:01:17.385 --> 00:01:21.368
and are pointed directly at the Earth.

00:01:21.368 --> 00:01:27.257
These jetted, Earth-pointed, hyperactive
and supermassive black holes

00:01:27.257 --> 00:01:31.801
are called blazars, or blazing quasars.
