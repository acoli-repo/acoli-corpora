00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:32.252
some of the most exotic objects 
in our universe.

00:00:32.252 --> 00:00:36.064
The objects that have captivated me 
from first crush throughout my career

00:00:36.064 --> 00:00:40.473
are supermassive, 
hyperactive black holes.

00:00:41.813 --> 00:00:45.931
Weighing one to 10 billion times 
the mass of our own sun,

00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:48.825
these galactic black holes 
are devouring material,

00:00:48.825 --> 00:00:52.145
at a rate of upwards of 
1,000 times more

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:55.512
than your "average" 
supermassive black hole.

00:00:55.512 --> 00:00:57.640
(Laughter)

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.334
These two characteristics,

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:02.548
with a few others, make them quasars.
