00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:02.599
Although the blazar system is rare,

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:05.606
the process by which nature
pulls in material via a disk,

00:02:05.606 --> 00:02:08.883
and then flings some of it out via a jet,
is more common.

00:02:09.647 --> 00:02:12.091
We'll eventually zoom out of 
the blazar system

00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:17.180
to show its approximate relationship
to the larger galactic context.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.295
Beyond the cosmic accounting
of what goes in to what goes out,

00:02:26.295 --> 00:02:29.342
one of the hot topics in 
blazar astrophysics right now

00:02:29.342 --> 00:02:33.053
is where the highest-energy 
jet emission comes from.
