00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:32.886
by which some of the most fascinating
objects in our universe are formed.

00:03:33.892 --> 00:03:37.501
This all started as a love story.

00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:39.414
And it still is.

00:03:39.414 --> 00:03:43.624
This love transformed me from 
a curious, stargazing young girl

00:03:43.624 --> 00:03:45.445
to a professional astrophysicist,

00:03:45.445 --> 00:03:48.782
hot on the heels of celestial discovery.

00:03:48.782 --> 00:03:51.202
Who knew that chasing after the universe

00:03:51.202 --> 00:03:55.000
would ground me so deeply
to my mission here on Earth.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.468
Then again, when do we ever know
where love's first flutter

00:03:58.468 --> 00:03:59.942
will truly take us.

00:03:59.942 --> 00:04:01.171
Thank you.
