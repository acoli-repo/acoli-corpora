WEBVTT

00:02:29.342 --> 00:02:33.053
is where the highest-energy 
jet emission comes from.

00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:36.974
In this image, I'm interested
in where this white blob forms

00:02:36.974 --> 00:02:40.617
and if, as a result, there's any 
relationship between the jet

00:02:40.617 --> 00:02:43.483
and the accretion disc material.

00:02:43.483 --> 00:02:45.286
Clear answers to this question

00:02:45.286 --> 00:02:48.401
were almost completely
inaccessible until 2008,

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:52.675
when NASA launched a new telescope
that better detects gamma ray light --

00:02:52.675 --> 00:02:55.387
that is, light with energies
a million times higher

00:02:55.387 --> 00:02:58.934
than your standard x-ray scan.

00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:02.824
I simultaneously compare variations
between the gamma ray light data
