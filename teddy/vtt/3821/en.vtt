00:00:01.131 --> 00:00:04.432
My first love was for the night sky.

00:00:04.432 --> 00:00:05.998
Love is complicated.

00:00:05.998 --> 00:00:10.527
You're looking at a fly-through of the 
Hubble Space Telescope Ultra-Deep Field,

00:00:10.527 --> 00:00:14.639
one of the most distant images
of our universe ever observed.

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.153
Everything you see here is a galaxy,

00:00:17.153 --> 00:00:20.160
comprised of billions of stars each.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.901
And the farthest galaxy is 
a trillion, trillion kilometers away.

00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:28.805
As an astrophysicist, I have
the awesome privilege of studying

00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:32.252
some of the most exotic objects 
in our universe.
