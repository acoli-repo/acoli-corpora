00:02:58.934 --> 00:03:02.824
I simultaneously compare variations
between the gamma ray light data

00:03:02.824 --> 00:03:06.493
and the visible light data from
day to day and year to year,

00:03:06.493 --> 00:03:09.767
to better localize these gamma ray blobs.

00:03:09.767 --> 00:03:12.453
My research shows that in some instances,

00:03:12.453 --> 00:03:15.513
these blobs form much closer
to the black hole

00:03:15.513 --> 00:03:17.873
than we initially thought.

00:03:17.873 --> 00:03:19.764
As we more confidently localize

00:03:19.764 --> 00:03:22.060
where these gamma ray 
blobs are forming,

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.583
we can better understand how jets
are being accelerated,

00:03:25.583 --> 00:03:28.191
and ultimately reveal 
the dynamic processes

00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:32.886
by which some of the most fascinating
objects in our universe are formed.
