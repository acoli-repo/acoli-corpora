00:01:27.257 --> 00:01:31.801
are called blazars, or blazing quasars.

00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:35.282
What makes blazars so special
is that they're some of the universe's

00:01:35.282 --> 00:01:37.802
most efficient particle accelerators,

00:01:37.802 --> 00:01:42.720
transporting incredible amounts
of energy throughout a galaxy.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.469
Here, I'm showing an
artist's conception of a blazar.

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:48.669
The dinner plate by which 
material falls onto the black hole

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:50.256
is called the accretion disc,

00:01:50.256 --> 00:01:52.082
shown here in blue.

00:01:52.082 --> 00:01:55.061
Some of that material is slingshotted
around the black hole

00:01:55.061 --> 00:01:57.085
and accelerated to insanely high speeds


00:01:57.085 --> 00:01:59.912
in the jet, shown here in white.

00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:02.599
Although the blazar system is rare,
