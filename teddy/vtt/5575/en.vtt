“It was a pleasure to burn.


00:00:08.344 --> 00:00:11.144
It was a special pleasure
to see things eaten,

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.944
to see things blackened and changed.”

00:00:13.944 --> 00:00:18.844
Fahrenheit 451 opens in a blissful blaze
- and before long,

00:00:18.844 --> 00:00:21.894
we learn what’s going up in flames.

00:00:21.894 --> 00:00:24.394
Ray Bradbury’s novel imagines a world


00:00:24.394 --> 00:00:28.304
where books are banned 
from all areas of life -

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:32.184
and possessing, let alone 
reading them, is forbidden.
