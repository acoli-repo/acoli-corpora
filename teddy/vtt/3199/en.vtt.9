00:04:28.063 --> 00:04:30.294
that you must combine
in a very defined way.

00:04:30.948 --> 00:04:34.473
In soft robots, you just build
your actuator from scratch

00:04:34.497 --> 00:04:35.648
most of the time,

00:04:35.672 --> 00:04:38.054
but you shape your flexible material

00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:40.481
to the form that responds
to a certain input.

00:04:41.054 --> 00:04:43.512
For example, here,
you can just deform a structure

00:04:43.536 --> 00:04:46.007
doing a fairly complex shape

00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:49.309
if you think about doing the same
with rigid links and joints,

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:51.666
and here, what you use is just one input,

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.054
such as air pressure.

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:57.358
OK, but let's see
some cool examples of soft robots.

00:04:57.765 --> 00:05:02.312
