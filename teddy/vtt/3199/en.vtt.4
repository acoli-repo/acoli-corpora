Well, maybe you think that you're not
really able to do anything if you're soft,

00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:04.103
probably.

00:02:04.127 --> 00:02:06.977
Well, nature teaches us the opposite.

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:09.032
For example, at the bottom of the ocean,

00:02:09.056 --> 00:02:11.492
under thousands of pounds
of hydrostatic pressure,

00:02:11.516 --> 00:02:13.944
a completely soft animal

00:02:13.968 --> 00:02:17.245
can move and interact
with a much stiffer object than him.

00:02:17.878 --> 00:02:20.725
He walks by carrying around
this coconut shell

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.133
thanks to the flexibility
of his tentacles,

00:02:23.157 --> 00:02:25.661
which serve as both his feet and hands.

00:02:26.241 --> 00:02:30.066
And apparently,
an octopus can also open a jar.
