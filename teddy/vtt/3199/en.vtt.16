you don't have too many lights
inside your body.

00:08:03.167 --> 00:08:04.340
We hope.

00:08:04.364 --> 00:08:07.366
(Laughter)

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:12.088
But sometimes, a surgical procedure
can even be done using a single needle,

00:08:12.112 --> 00:08:16.159
and in Stanford now, we are working
on a very flexible needle,

00:08:16.183 --> 00:08:18.835
kind of a very tiny soft robot

00:08:18.859 --> 00:08:22.153
which is mechanically designed
to use the interaction with the tissues

00:08:22.177 --> 00:08:24.407
and steer around inside a solid organ.

00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:28.511
This makes it possible to reach
many different targets, such as tumors,

00:08:28.535 --> 00:08:30.233
deep inside a solid organ
