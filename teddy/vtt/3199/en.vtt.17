00:08:28.535 --> 00:08:30.233
deep inside a solid organ

00:08:30.257 --> 00:08:32.582
by using one single insertion point.

00:08:32.606 --> 00:08:36.645
And you can even steer around
the structure that you want to avoid

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:38.033
on the way to the target.

00:08:39.377 --> 00:08:42.682
So clearly, this is a pretty
exciting time for robotics.

00:08:42.706 --> 00:08:45.859
We have robots that have to deal
with soft structures,

00:08:45.883 --> 00:08:48.468
so this poses new
and very challenging questions

00:08:48.492 --> 00:08:49.849
for the robotics community,

00:08:49.873 --> 00:08:52.548
and indeed, we are just starting
to learn how to control,

00:08:52.572 --> 00:08:55.576
how to put sensors
on these very flexible structures.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.560
But of course, we are not even close
to what nature figured out

00:08:58.584 --> 00:09:00.778
in millions of years of evolution.
