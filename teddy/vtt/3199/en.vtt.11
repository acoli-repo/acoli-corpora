00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.240
and keep working.

00:05:32.056 --> 00:05:33.207
It's cute.

00:05:33.231 --> 00:05:34.652
(Laughter)

00:05:34.676 --> 00:05:38.540
Or a robotic fish, which swims
like a real fish does in water

00:05:38.564 --> 00:05:41.748
simply because it has a soft tail
with distributed actuation

00:05:41.772 --> 00:05:43.416
using still air pressure.

00:05:43.954 --> 00:05:45.312
That was from MIT,

00:05:45.336 --> 00:05:48.141
and of course, we have a robotic octopus.

00:05:48.165 --> 00:05:50.244
This was actually one
of the first projects

00:05:50.268 --> 00:05:52.394
developed in this new field
of soft robots.

00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:54.304
Here, you see the artificial tentacle,

00:05:54.328 --> 00:05:59.007
but they actually built an entire machine
with several tentacles

00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:01.642
they could just throw in the water,
