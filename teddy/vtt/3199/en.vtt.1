00:00:29.023 --> 00:00:33.301
to do even a simple task
which doesn't require much precision,

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:34.936
this is what can happen.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.689
I mean, opening a door,
you don't require much precision.

00:00:37.713 --> 00:00:38.743
(Laughter)

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:41.221
Or a small error in the measurements,

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:43.071
he misses the valve, and that's it --

00:00:43.095 --> 00:00:44.365
(Laughter)

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:46.833
with no way of recovering,
most of the time.

00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:49.236
So why is that?

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.134
Well, for many years,

00:00:51.158 --> 00:00:54.458
robots have been designed
to emphasize speed and precision,

00:00:54.482 --> 00:00:57.444
and this translates
into a very specific architecture.

00:00:57.468 --> 00:00:58.619
If you take a robot arm,

00:00:58.643 --> 00:01:01.402
it's a very well-defined
set of rigid links
