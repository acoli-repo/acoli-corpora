00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:32.328
or how carefully we program them,

00:01:32.352 --> 00:01:34.170
but rather look at their bodies.

00:01:34.606 --> 00:01:37.485
There is obviously
something wrong with it,

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.636
because what makes a robot
precise and strong

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.049
also makes them ridiculously dangerous
and ineffective in the real world,

00:01:45.073 --> 00:01:47.058
because their body cannot deform

00:01:47.082 --> 00:01:50.311
or better adjust to the interaction
with the real world.

00:01:51.226 --> 00:01:54.344
So think about the opposite approach,

00:01:54.368 --> 00:01:57.186
being softer than
anything else around you.

00:01:57.827 --> 00:02:02.912
Well, maybe you think that you're not
really able to do anything if you're soft,
