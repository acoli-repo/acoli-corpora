00:02:57.126 --> 00:03:00.308
plays a fundamental role
during a physical task,

00:03:00.332 --> 00:03:05.945
because we can conform to our environment

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.373
so we can succeed in a large
variety of situations

00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:11.390
without much planning
or calculations ahead.

00:03:11.414 --> 00:03:14.129
So why don't we put
some of this embodied intelligence

00:03:14.153 --> 00:03:15.708
into our robotic machines,

00:03:15.732 --> 00:03:18.081
to release them from relying
on excessive work

00:03:18.105 --> 00:03:20.122
on computation and sensing?

00:03:21.097 --> 00:03:23.747
Well, to do that, we can follow
the strategy of nature,

00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:26.383
because with evolution,
she's done a pretty good job

00:03:26.407 --> 00:03:30.903
in designing machines
for environment interaction.
