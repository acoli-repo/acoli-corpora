00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:01.642
they could just throw in the water,

00:06:01.666 --> 00:06:05.959
and you see that it can kind of go around
and do submarine exploration

00:06:05.983 --> 00:06:09.286
in a different way
than rigid robots would do.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.970
But this is very important for delicate
environments, such as coral reefs.

00:06:12.994 --> 00:06:14.390
Let's go back to the ground.

00:06:14.414 --> 00:06:15.604
Here, you see the view

00:06:15.628 --> 00:06:19.776
from a growing robot developed
by my colleagues in Stanford.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.650
You see the camera fixed on top.

00:06:21.674 --> 00:06:23.112
And this robot is particular,

00:06:23.136 --> 00:06:25.552
because using air pressure,
it grows from the tip,

00:06:25.576 --> 00:06:28.922
while the rest of the body stays
in firm contact with the environment.

00:06:29.316 --> 00:06:32.034
And this is inspired
by plants, not animals,
