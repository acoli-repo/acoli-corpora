00:00:01.531 --> 00:00:03.368
So, robots.

00:00:03.392 --> 00:00:04.806
Robots can be programmed

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.521
to do the same task millions of times
with minimal error,

00:00:08.545 --> 00:00:11.059
something very difficult for us, right?

00:00:11.083 --> 00:00:14.244
And it can be very impressive
to watch them at work.

00:00:14.268 --> 00:00:15.524
Look at them.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.456
I could watch them for hours.

00:00:18.108 --> 00:00:19.407
No?

00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:21.638
What is less impressive

00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:24.595
is that if you take these robots
out of the factories,

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.999
where the environments are not
perfectly known and measured like here,

00:00:29.023 --> 00:00:33.301
to do even a simple task
which doesn't require much precision,
