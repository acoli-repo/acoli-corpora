00:06:58.384 --> 00:07:00.133
because they must enter the body

00:07:00.157 --> 00:07:02.784
using small holes
and straight instruments,

00:07:02.808 --> 00:07:06.318
and these instruments must interact
with very delicate structures

00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:08.390
in a very uncertain environment,

00:07:08.414 --> 00:07:10.089
and this must be done safely.

00:07:10.113 --> 00:07:12.225
Also bringing the camera inside the body,

00:07:12.249 --> 00:07:15.867
so bringing the eyes of the surgeon
inside the surgical field

00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:18.242
can be very challenging
if you use a rigid stick,

00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:19.873
like a classic endoscope.

00:07:20.517 --> 00:07:23.106
With my previous research group in Europe,

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.726
we developed this
soft camera robot for surgery,

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.518
which is very different
from a classic endoscope,

00:07:29.542 --> 00:07:32.646
which can move thanks
to the flexibility of the module
