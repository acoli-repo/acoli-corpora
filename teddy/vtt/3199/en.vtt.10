Here is a little cute guy
developed at Harvard University,

00:05:02.336 --> 00:05:06.829
and he walks thanks to waves
of pressure applied along its body,

00:05:06.853 --> 00:05:10.139
and thanks to the flexibility,
he can also sneak under a low bridge,

00:05:10.163 --> 00:05:11.314
keep walking,

00:05:11.338 --> 00:05:14.535
and then keep walking
a little bit different afterwards.

00:05:15.345 --> 00:05:17.576
And it's a very preliminary prototype,

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.276
but they also built a more robust version
with power on board

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.747
that can actually be sent out in the world
and face real-world interactions

00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:28.477
like a car passing it over it ...
