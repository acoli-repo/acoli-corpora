00:00:58.643 --> 00:01:01.402
it's a very well-defined
set of rigid links

00:01:01.426 --> 00:01:03.485
and motors, what we call actuators,

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:05.279
they move the links about the joints.

00:01:05.303 --> 00:01:06.610
In this robotic structure,

00:01:06.624 --> 00:01:08.851
you have to perfectly
measure your environment,

00:01:08.865 --> 00:01:10.762
so what is around,

00:01:10.786 --> 00:01:13.425
and you have to perfectly
program every movement

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:15.584
of the robot joints,

00:01:15.608 --> 00:01:18.870
because a small error
can generate a very large fault,

00:01:18.894 --> 00:01:21.907
so you can damage something
or you can get your robot damaged

00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:23.462
if something is harder.

00:01:24.107 --> 00:01:26.312
So let's talk about them a moment.

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:29.559
And don't think
about the brains of these robots

00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:32.328
or how carefully we program them,
