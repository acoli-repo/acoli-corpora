00:03:26.407 --> 00:03:30.903
in designing machines
for environment interaction.

00:03:30.927 --> 00:03:35.421
And it's easy to notice that nature
uses soft material frequently

00:03:35.445 --> 00:03:37.740
and stiff material sparingly.

00:03:37.764 --> 00:03:41.556
And this is what is done
in this new field of robotics,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.880
which is called "soft robotics,"

00:03:43.904 --> 00:03:47.640
in which the main objective
is not to make super-precise machines,

00:03:47.664 --> 00:03:49.601
because we've already got them,

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:54.545
but to make robots able to face
unexpected situations in the real world,

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.126
so able to go out there.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.674
And what makes a robot soft
is first of all its compliant body,

00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:05.229
which is made of materials or structures
that can undergo very large deformations,
