00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:05.229
which is made of materials or structures
that can undergo very large deformations,

00:04:05.253 --> 00:04:07.084
so no more rigid links,

00:04:07.108 --> 00:04:10.656
and secondly, to move them,
we use what we call distributed actuation,

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.712
so we have to control continuously
the shape of this very deformable body,

00:04:15.736 --> 00:04:19.034
which has the effect
of having a lot of links and joints,

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:21.681
but we don't have
any stiff structure at all.

00:04:21.705 --> 00:04:25.135
So you can imagine that building
a soft robot is a very different process

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:28.039
than stiff robotics,
where you have links, gears, screws

00:04:28.063 --> 00:04:30.294
that you must combine
in a very defined way.
