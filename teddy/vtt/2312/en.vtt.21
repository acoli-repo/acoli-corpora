or a terrorist incident that causes nations of the world

00:10:31.196 --> 00:10:33.120
to rush to adopt these weapons

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.891
before thinking through the consequences.

00:10:36.891 --> 00:10:39.872
Autonomous robotic weapons concentrate too much power

00:10:39.872 --> 00:10:46.155
in too few hands, and they would imperil democracy itself.

00:10:46.155 --> 00:10:48.841
Now, don't get me wrong, I think there are tons

00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:51.459
of great uses for unarmed civilian drones:

00:10:51.459 --> 00:10:55.398
environmental monitoring, search and rescue, logistics.

00:10:55.398 --> 00:10:58.224
If we have an international treaty on robotic weapons,

00:10:58.224 --> 00:11:01.811
how do we gain the benefits of autonomous drones
