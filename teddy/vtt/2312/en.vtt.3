00:01:28.228 --> 00:01:31.754
but also changing our social landscape entirely,

00:01:31.754 --> 00:01:33.978
far from the battlefield.

00:01:33.978 --> 00:01:38.487
That's because the way humans resolve conflict

00:01:38.487 --> 00:01:40.220
shapes our social landscape.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.853
And this has always been the case, throughout history.

00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:45.514
For example, these were state-of-the-art weapons systems

00:01:45.514 --> 00:01:47.593
in 1400 A.D.

00:01:47.593 --> 00:01:50.737
Now they were both very expensive to build and maintain,

00:01:50.737 --> 00:01:53.977
but with these you could dominate the populace,

00:01:53.977 --> 00:01:57.866
and the distribution of political power in feudal society reflected that.

00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:00.553
Power was focused at the very top.
