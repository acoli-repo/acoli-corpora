I write fiction sci-fi thrillers,

00:00:03.849 --> 00:00:06.042
so if I say "killer robots,"

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:08.403
you'd probably think something like this.

00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:10.958
But I'm actually not here to talk about fiction.

00:00:10.958 --> 00:00:13.906
I'm here to talk about very real killer robots,

00:00:13.906 --> 00:00:17.028
autonomous combat drones.

00:00:17.028 --> 00:00:20.655
Now, I'm not referring to Predator and Reaper drones,

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:23.915
which have a human making targeting decisions.

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:27.044
I'm talking about fully autonomous robotic weapons

00:00:27.044 --> 00:00:29.698
that make lethal decisions about human beings

00:00:29.698 --> 00:00:32.115
all on their own.
