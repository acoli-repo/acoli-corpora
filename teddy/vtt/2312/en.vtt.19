on robotic weapons, and in particular a global ban

00:09:30.864 --> 00:09:34.772
on the development and deployment of killer robots.

00:09:34.772 --> 00:09:38.026
Now we already have international treaties

00:09:38.026 --> 00:09:41.412
on nuclear and biological weapons, and, while imperfect,

00:09:41.412 --> 00:09:43.700
these have largely worked.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.468
But robotic weapons might be every bit as dangerous,

00:09:47.468 --> 00:09:50.756
because they will almost certainly be used,

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:55.783

00:09:55.783 --> 00:09:59.251
Now in November 2012 the U.S. Department of Defense

00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:01.709
issued a directive requiring
