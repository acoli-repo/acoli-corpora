than any people in history,

00:07:30.091 --> 00:07:35.707
and this perfectly suits the targeting needs of autonomous weapons.

00:07:35.707 --> 00:07:37.445
What you're looking at here

00:07:37.445 --> 00:07:40.691
is a link analysis map of a social group.

00:07:40.691 --> 00:07:44.325
Lines indicate social connectedness between individuals.

00:07:44.325 --> 00:07:47.205
And these types of maps can be automatically generated

00:07:47.205 --> 00:07:51.920
based on the data trail modern people leave behind.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.397
Now it's typically used to market goods and services

00:07:54.397 --> 00:07:58.813
to targeted demographics, but it's a dual-use technology,

00:07:58.813 --> 00:08:02.173
because targeting is used in another context.
