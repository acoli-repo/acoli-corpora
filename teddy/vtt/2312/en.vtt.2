00:00:56.687 --> 00:01:00.211
identifying a human target and firing on it,

00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:04.535
the one on the left at a distance of over a kilometer.

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:08.124
Now, in both cases, there's still a human in the loop

00:01:08.124 --> 00:01:10.496
to make that lethal firing decision,

00:01:10.496 --> 00:01:15.909
but it's not a technological requirement. It's a choice.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.002
And it's that choice that I want to focus on,

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:21.643
because as we migrate lethal decision-making

00:01:21.643 --> 00:01:24.752
from humans to software,

00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:28.228
we risk not only taking the humanity out of war,

00:01:28.228 --> 00:01:31.754
but also changing our social landscape entirely,
