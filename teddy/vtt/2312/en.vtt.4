00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:00.553
Power was focused at the very top.

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:04.081
And what changed? Technological innovation.

00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:05.952
Gunpowder, cannon.

00:02:05.952 --> 00:02:09.769
And pretty soon, armor and castles were obsolete,

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.302
and it mattered less who you brought to the battlefield

00:02:12.302 --> 00:02:16.081
versus how many people you brought to the battlefield.

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:19.719
And as armies grew in size, the nation-state arose

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.399
as a political and logistical requirement of defense.

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:25.775
And as leaders had to rely on more of their populace,

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:27.608
they began to share power.

00:02:27.608 --> 00:02:30.207
Representative government began to form.
