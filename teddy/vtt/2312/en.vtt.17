searching for political enemies, you might instead remove them,

00:08:30.948 --> 00:08:33.708
eliminate them, disrupt their social group,

00:08:33.708 --> 00:08:36.877
and those who remain behind lose social cohesion

00:08:36.877 --> 00:08:39.498
and organization.

00:08:39.498 --> 00:08:42.822
Now in a world of cheap, proliferating robotic weapons,

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:45.457
borders would offer very little protection

00:08:45.457 --> 00:08:47.403
to critics of distant governments

00:08:47.403 --> 00:08:51.049
or trans-national criminal organizations.

00:08:51.049 --> 00:08:54.542
Popular movements agitating for change

00:08:54.542 --> 00:08:58.151
could be detected early and their leaders eliminated

00:08:58.151 --> 00:09:01.062
before their ideas achieve critical mass.
