00:12:25.608 --> 00:12:30.458
Let's not succumb to the temptation to automate war.

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:33.176
Autocratic governments and criminal organizations

00:12:33.176 --> 00:12:36.132
undoubtedly will, but let's not join them.

00:12:36.132 --> 00:12:38.023
Autonomous robotic weapons

00:12:38.023 --> 00:12:40.074
would concentrate too much power

00:12:40.074 --> 00:12:42.556
in too few unseen hands,

00:12:42.556 --> 00:12:45.811
and that would be corrosive to representative government.

00:12:45.811 --> 00:12:48.772
Let's make sure, for democracies at least,

00:12:48.772 --> 00:12:51.376
killer robots remain fiction.

00:12:51.376 --> 00:12:52.486
Thank you.

00:12:52.486 --> 00:12:57.051
(Applause)

00:12:57.051 --> 00:13:01.667
Thank you. (Applause)
