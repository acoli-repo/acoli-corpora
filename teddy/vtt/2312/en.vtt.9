00:04:27.775 --> 00:04:30.647
and that's electromagnetic jamming,

00:04:30.647 --> 00:04:32.883
severing the connection between the drone

00:04:32.883 --> 00:04:35.697
and its operator.

00:04:35.697 --> 00:04:38.315
Now we saw an example of this in 2011

00:04:38.315 --> 00:04:41.271
when an American RQ-170 Sentinel drone

00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:45.578
got a bit confused over Iran due to a GPS spoofing attack,

00:04:45.578 --> 00:04:50.692
but any remotely-piloted drone is susceptible to this type of attack,

00:04:50.692 --> 00:04:52.744
and that means drones

00:04:52.744 --> 00:04:56.364
will have to shoulder more decision-making.

00:04:56.364 --> 00:04:59.407
They'll know their mission objective,

00:04:59.407 --> 00:05:04.252
and they'll react to new circumstances without human guidance.
