00:02:27.608 --> 00:02:30.207
Representative government began to form.

00:02:30.207 --> 00:02:33.495
So again, the tools we use to resolve conflict

00:02:33.495 --> 00:02:36.799
shape our social landscape.

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.863
Autonomous robotic weapons are such a tool,

00:02:40.863 --> 00:02:46.031
except that, by requiring very few people to go to war,

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:50.871
they risk re-centralizing power into very few hands,

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:57.386
possibly reversing a five-century trend toward democracy.

00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:59.143
Now, I think, knowing this,

00:02:59.143 --> 00:03:03.495
we can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions,
