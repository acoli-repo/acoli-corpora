00:02:59.143 --> 00:03:03.495
we can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions,

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:07.474
to do what humans do best, which is adapt.

00:03:07.474 --> 00:03:09.479
But time is a factor.

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:12.330
Seventy nations are developing remotely-piloted

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.487
combat drones of their own,

00:03:14.487 --> 00:03:17.080
and as you'll see, remotely-piloted combat drones

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.552
are the precursors to autonomous robotic weapons.

00:03:21.552 --> 00:03:24.319
That's because once you've deployed remotely-piloted drones,

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.703
there are three powerful factors pushing decision-making

00:03:27.703 --> 00:03:32.303
away from humans and on to the weapon platform itself.
