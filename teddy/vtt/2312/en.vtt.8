00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:00.614
The Pentagon's Gorgon Stare and Argus programs

00:04:00.614 --> 00:04:03.778
will put up to 65 independently operated camera eyes

00:04:03.778 --> 00:04:05.816
on each drone platform,

00:04:05.816 --> 00:04:09.119
and this would vastly outstrip human ability to review it.

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:11.279
And that means visual intelligence software will need

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:15.327
to scan it for items of interest.

00:04:15.327 --> 00:04:16.675
And that means very soon

00:04:16.675 --> 00:04:19.422
drones will tell humans what to look at,

00:04:19.422 --> 00:04:21.919
not the other way around.

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.392
But there's a second powerful incentive pushing

00:04:24.392 --> 00:04:27.775
decision-making away from humans and onto machines,

00:04:27.775 --> 00:04:30.647
and that's electromagnetic jamming,
