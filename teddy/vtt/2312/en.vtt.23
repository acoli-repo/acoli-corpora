that can be used to track its movement through public spaces.

00:11:32.543 --> 00:11:35.924
We have license plates on cars, tail numbers on aircraft.

00:11:35.924 --> 00:11:37.765
This is no different.

00:11:37.765 --> 00:11:39.777
And every citizen should be able to download an app

00:11:39.777 --> 00:11:42.902
that shows the population of drones and autonomous vehicles

00:11:42.902 --> 00:11:45.331
moving through public spaces around them,

00:11:45.331 --> 00:11:48.064
both right now and historically.

00:11:48.064 --> 00:11:51.612
And civic leaders should deploy sensors and civic drones

00:11:51.612 --> 00:11:53.956
to detect rogue drones,

00:11:53.956 --> 00:11:57.132
and instead of sending killer drones of their own up to shoot them down,

00:11:57.132 --> 00:12:00.124
they should notify humans to their presence.
