I want to talk about the transformed media landscape,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to anywhere in the world.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
about that transformation.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'll start here. Last November there was a presidential election.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You probably read something about it in the papers.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And there was some concern that in some parts of the country

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
there might be voter suppression.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And so a plan came up to video the vote.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And the idea was that individual citizens

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
with phones capable of taking photos or making video
