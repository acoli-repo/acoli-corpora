The New Yorker occupies a very different space.

00:14:33.092 --> 00:14:36.817
It's a space that is playful in its own way, and also purposeful,

00:14:36.817 --> 00:14:40.309
and in that space, the cartoons are different.

00:14:40.309 --> 00:14:42.678
Now I'm going to show you cartoons The New Yorker did

00:14:42.678 --> 00:14:47.276
right after 9/11, a very, very sensitive area when humor could be used.

00:14:47.276 --> 00:14:48.705
How would The New Yorker attack it?

00:14:48.705 --> 00:14:53.258
It would not be with a guy with a bomb saying, "Too snug?"

00:14:53.258 --> 00:14:55.482
Or there was another cartoon I didn't show because

00:14:55.482 --> 00:14:59.442
actually I thought maybe people would be offended.

00:14:59.442 --> 00:15:03.088
The great Sam Gross cartoon, this happened
