A hundred and nine voted it a 10, the highest. Ten voted it one.

00:02:31.173 --> 00:02:33.484
But look at the individual responses.

00:02:33.484 --> 00:02:35.787
"I like animals!!!!!" Look how much they like them.

00:02:35.787 --> 00:02:39.314
(Laughter)

00:02:39.314 --> 00:02:42.413
"I don't want to hurt them. That doesn't seem very funny to me."

00:02:42.413 --> 00:02:44.302
This person rated it a two.

00:02:44.302 --> 00:02:48.684
"I don't like to see animals suffer -- even in cartoons."

00:02:48.684 --> 00:02:53.810
To people like this, I point out we use anesthetic ink.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.567
Other people thought it was funny.

00:02:55.567 --> 00:02:58.636
That actually is the true nature of the distribution of humor

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:02.814
when you don't have the contagion of humor.
