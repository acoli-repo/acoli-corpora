00:07:27.263 --> 00:07:31.015
"No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?"

00:07:31.015 --> 00:07:33.582
It's been reprinted thousands of times, totally ripped off.

00:07:33.582 --> 00:07:36.344
It's even on thongs,

00:07:36.344 --> 00:07:42.971
but compressed to "How about never — is never good for you?"

00:07:42.971 --> 00:07:46.370
Now these look like very different forms of humor

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.764
but actually they bear a great similarity.

00:07:48.764 --> 00:07:53.187
In each instance, our expectations are defied.

00:07:53.187 --> 00:07:56.903
In each instance, the narrative gets switched.

00:07:56.903 --> 00:07:59.157
There's an incongruity and a contrast.

00:07:59.157 --> 00:08:02.406
In "No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?"
