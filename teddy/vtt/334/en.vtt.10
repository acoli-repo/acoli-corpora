(Laughter)

00:05:00.458 --> 00:05:02.340
Now I know all about rejection,

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.587
because when I quit -- actually, I was booted out of -- psychology school

00:05:06.587 --> 00:05:10.019
and decided to become a cartoonist, a natural segue,

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:15.093
from 1974 to 1977 I submitted 2,000 cartoons to The New Yorker,

00:05:15.093 --> 00:05:19.689
and got 2,000 cartoons rejected by The New Yorker.

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:24.041
At a certain point, this rejection slip, in 1977 --

00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:25.036
[We regret that we are unable to use the enclosed material. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider it.] —

00:05:25.036 --> 00:05:26.610
magically changed to this.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.048
[Hey! You sold one. No shit! You really sold a cartoon to the fucking New Yorker magazine.]
