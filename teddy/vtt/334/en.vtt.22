00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:00.609
(Laughter)

00:11:00.609 --> 00:11:04.086
That's sort of an exaggeration of what I do.

00:11:04.086 --> 00:11:07.352
Now, we do reject, many, many, many cartoons,

00:11:07.352 --> 00:11:10.456
so many that there are many books called "The Rejection Collection."

00:11:10.456 --> 00:11:14.834
"The Rejection Collection" is not quite New Yorker kind of humor.

00:11:14.834 --> 00:11:17.301
And you might notice the bum on the sidewalk here

00:11:17.301 --> 00:11:21.124
who is boozing and his ventriloquist dummy is puking.

00:11:21.124 --> 00:11:23.612
See, that's probably not going to be New Yorker humor.

00:11:23.612 --> 00:11:26.889
It's actually put together by Matt Diffee, one of our cartoonists.

00:11:26.889 --> 00:11:31.311
So I'll give you some examples of rejection collection humor.
