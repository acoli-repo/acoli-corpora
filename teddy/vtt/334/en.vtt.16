In "No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?"

00:08:02.406 --> 00:08:04.886
what you have is the syntax of politeness

00:08:04.886 --> 00:08:07.147
and the message of being rude.

00:08:07.147 --> 00:08:10.416
That really is how humor works. It's a cognitive synergy

00:08:10.416 --> 00:08:14.195
where we mash up these two things which don't go together

00:08:14.195 --> 00:08:16.976
and temporarily in our minds exist.

00:08:16.976 --> 00:08:19.496
He is both being polite and rude.

00:08:19.496 --> 00:08:22.767
In here, you have the propriety of The New Yorker

00:08:22.767 --> 00:08:24.748
and the vulgarity of the language.

00:08:24.748 --> 00:08:26.773
Basically, that's the way humor works.

00:08:26.773 --> 00:08:29.295
So I'm a humor analyst, you would say.

00:08:29.295 --> 00:08:32.837
Now E.B. White said, analyzing humor is like dissecting a frog.
