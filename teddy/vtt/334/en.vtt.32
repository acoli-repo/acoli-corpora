The easiest thing to do with humor, and it's perfectly legitimate,

00:16:01.425 --> 00:16:05.050
is a friend makes fun of an enemy.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.183
It's called dispositional humor.

00:16:07.183 --> 00:16:10.652
It's 95 percent of the humor. It's not our humor.

00:16:10.652 --> 00:16:13.062
Here's another cartoon.

00:16:13.062 --> 00:16:16.694
"I wouldn't mind living in a fundamentalist Islamic state."

00:16:16.694 --> 00:16:21.283
(Laughter)

00:16:25.851 --> 00:16:30.215
Humor does need a target.
