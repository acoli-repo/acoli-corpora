00:01:58.316 --> 00:02:01.828
and nobody knows what anybody else is laughing at,

00:02:01.828 --> 00:02:05.144
and when you look at that the subjectivity involved in humor

00:02:05.144 --> 00:02:06.727
is really interesting.

00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:08.365
Let's look at this cartoon.

00:02:08.365 --> 00:02:10.700
"Discouraging data on the antidepressant."

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.724
(Laughter)

00:02:12.724 --> 00:02:15.735
Indeed, it is discouraging.

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.537
Now, you would think, well, look,

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:19.206
most of you laughed at that.

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:20.627
Right? You thought it was funny.

00:02:20.627 --> 00:02:22.309
In general, that seems like a funny cartoon,

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.693
but let's look what online survey I did.

00:02:25.693 --> 00:02:27.810
Generally, about 85 percent of the people liked it.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.173
A hundred and nine voted it a 10, the highest. Ten voted it one.
