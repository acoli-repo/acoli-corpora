Now, we could fit more cartoons in the magazine

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:02.635
if we removed the articles.

00:04:02.635 --> 00:04:06.367
(Laughter)

00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:11.324
But I feel that would be a huge loss,

00:04:11.324 --> 00:04:15.097
one I could live with, but still huge.

00:04:15.097 --> 00:04:18.013
Cartoonists come in through the magazine every week.

00:04:18.013 --> 00:04:20.011
The average cartoonist who stays with the magazine

00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:22.567
does 10 or 15 ideas every week.

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:25.633
But they mostly are going to be rejected.

00:04:25.633 --> 00:04:28.677
That's the nature of any creative activity.

00:04:28.677 --> 00:04:32.141
Many of them fade away. Some of them stay.
