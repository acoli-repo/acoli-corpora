The New Yorker and I, when we made comments,

00:07:00.541 --> 00:07:05.052
the cartoon carries a certain ambiguity about what it actually is.

00:07:05.052 --> 00:07:07.340
What is it, the cartoon? Is it really about lemmings?

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.692
No. It's about us.

00:07:09.692 --> 00:07:12.572
You know, it's my view basically about religion,

00:07:12.572 --> 00:07:17.259
that the real conflict and all the fights between religion

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:20.140
is who has the best imaginary friend.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:25.271
(Laughter)

00:07:25.271 --> 00:07:27.263
And this is my most well-known cartoon.

00:07:27.263 --> 00:07:31.015
"No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?"
