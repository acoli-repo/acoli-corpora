00:11:58.502 --> 00:12:01.544
which says, "Cartoons you never saw and never will see

00:12:01.544 --> 00:12:04.267
in The New Yorker," this humor is perfect.

00:12:04.267 --> 00:12:05.872
I'm going to explain why.

00:12:05.872 --> 00:12:07.584
There's a concept about humor about it being

00:12:07.584 --> 00:12:09.917
a benign violation.

00:12:09.917 --> 00:12:11.894
In other words, for something to be funny, we've got to think

00:12:11.894 --> 00:12:15.435
it's both wrong and also okay at the same time.

00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:18.371
If we think it's completely wrong, we say, "That's not funny."

00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:22.036
And if it's completely okay, what's the joke? Okay?

00:12:22.036 --> 00:12:27.416
And so, this benign, that's true of "No, Thursday's out. How about never — is never good for you?"

00:12:27.416 --> 00:12:29.574
It's rude. The world really shouldn't be that way.

00:12:29.574 --> 00:12:32.478
Within that context, we feel it's okay.
