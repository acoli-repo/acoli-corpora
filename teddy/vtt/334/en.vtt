I'm going to be talking about designing humor,

00:00:02.445 --> 00:00:04.419
which is sort of an interesting thing, but it goes

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:08.127
to some of the discussions about constraints,

00:00:08.127 --> 00:00:10.885
and how in certain contexts, humor is right,

00:00:10.885 --> 00:00:12.576
and in other contexts it's wrong.

00:00:12.576 --> 00:00:15.352
Now, I'm from New York,

00:00:15.352 --> 00:00:18.938
so it's 100 percent satisfaction here.

00:00:18.938 --> 00:00:22.141
Actually, that's ridiculous, because when it comes to humor,

00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:25.430
75 percent is really absolutely the best you can hope for.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.413
Nobody is ever satisfied 100 percent with humor
