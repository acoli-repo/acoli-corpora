(Laughter)

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.632
Now let's look at this cartoon.

00:01:03.632 --> 00:01:05.208
One of the things I'm pointing out is that

00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:07.512
cartoons appear within the context

00:01:07.512 --> 00:01:09.225
of The New Yorker magazine,

00:01:09.225 --> 00:01:11.166
that lovely Caslon type, and it seems

00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:14.640
like a fairly benign cartoon within this context.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.711
It's making a little bit fun of getting older,

00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:18.063
and, you know, people might like it.

00:01:18.063 --> 00:01:21.299
But like I said, you cannot satisfy everyone.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.745
You couldn't satisfy this guy.

00:01:23.745 --> 00:01:26.832
"Another joke on old white males. Ha ha. The wit.

00:01:26.832 --> 00:01:28.492
It's nice, I'm sure to be young and rude,

00:01:28.492 --> 00:01:31.965
but some day you'll be old, unless you drop dead as I wish."
