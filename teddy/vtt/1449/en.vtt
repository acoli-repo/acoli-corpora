00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Both myself and my brother

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
belong to the under 30 demographic,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which Pat said makes 70 percent,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but according to our statistics

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
it makes 60 percent of the region's population.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Qatar is no exception to the region.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's a very young nation led by young people.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We have been reminiscing about the latest technologies

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and the iPods,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and for me the abaya,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
my traditional dress that I'm wearing today.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Now this is not a religious garment,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
nor is it a religious statement.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Instead, it's a diverse cultural statement
