00:00:58.028 --> 00:01:00.581
the legislators in the state government,

00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:02.571
and turn to something they understand,

00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:04.869
that they have to promote the economic development

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.556
of their state economy.

00:01:06.556 --> 00:01:08.372
Now, by promoting economic development,

00:01:08.372 --> 00:01:10.086
I don't mean anything magical.

00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:13.549
All I mean is, is that early childhood education

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.452
can bring more and better jobs to a state

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:20.630
and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.580
for the state's residents.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.573
Now, I think it's fair to say that when people think about

00:01:26.573 --> 00:01:28.577
state and local economic development,

00:01:28.577 --> 00:01:32.359
they don't generally think first about what they're doing
