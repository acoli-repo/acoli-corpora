00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.095
So when we invest in other people's children,

00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:07.280
and build up those skills, we increase the overall job growth

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.801
of a metro area.

00:06:08.801 --> 00:06:12.689
As another example, if we look

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:15.924
at what determines an individual's wages,

00:06:15.924 --> 00:06:20.149
and we do statistical exploration of that, what determines wages,

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:24.672
we know that the individual's wages will depend, in part,

00:06:24.672 --> 00:06:27.103
on that individual's education,

00:06:27.103 --> 00:06:30.096
for example whether or not they have a college degree.
