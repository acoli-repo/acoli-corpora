00:09:58.503 --> 00:10:03.623
The data is that over 60 percent of Americans

00:10:03.623 --> 00:10:06.061
spend most of their working careers

00:10:06.061 --> 00:10:09.831
in the state they were born in, over 60 percent.

00:10:09.831 --> 00:10:13.926
That percentage does not vary much from state to state.

00:10:13.926 --> 00:10:17.030
It doesn't vary much with the state's economy,

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.828
whether it's depressed or booming,

00:10:18.828 --> 00:10:21.149
it doesn't vary much over time.

00:10:21.149 --> 00:10:26.962
So the reality is, if you invest in kids,

00:10:26.962 --> 00:10:29.461
they will stay.

00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:32.499
Or at least, enough of them will stay
