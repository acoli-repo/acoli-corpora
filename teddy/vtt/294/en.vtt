In this talk today, I want to present a different idea

00:00:05.774 --> 00:00:09.995
for why investing in early childhood education

00:00:09.995 --> 00:00:12.694
makes sense as a public investment.

00:00:12.694 --> 00:00:14.932
It's a different idea, because usually,

00:00:14.932 --> 00:00:16.305
when people talk about early childhood programs,

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:19.646
they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants

00:00:19.646 --> 00:00:22.928
in terms of former participants, in preschool,

00:00:22.928 --> 00:00:25.193
they have better K-12 test scores,

00:00:25.193 --> 00:00:27.308
better adult earnings.

00:00:27.308 --> 00:00:29.423
Now that's all very important,

00:00:29.423 --> 00:00:33.519
but what I want to talk about is what preschool does
