00:07:57.438 --> 00:08:01.239
but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills,

00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:04.208
my employer is going to find it more difficult

00:08:04.208 --> 00:08:08.264
to introduce new technology, new production techniques.

00:08:08.264 --> 00:08:11.866
So as a result, my employer is going to be less productive.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:15.467
They will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages.

00:08:15.467 --> 00:08:19.148
Even if everyone at my firm has good skills,

00:08:19.148 --> 00:08:22.656
if the workers at the suppliers to my firm

00:08:22.656 --> 00:08:24.626
do not have good skills,

00:08:24.626 --> 00:08:27.023
my firm is going to be less competitive

00:08:27.023 --> 00:08:29.408
competing in national and international markets.

00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:32.502
And again, the firm that's less competitive
