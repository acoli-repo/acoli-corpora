to stick around the state or local economy and not move out,

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.030
and you take research on how much skills

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.201
drive job creation, you will conclude,

00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:40.244
from these three separate lines of research,

00:03:40.244 --> 00:03:44.323
that for every dollar invested in early childhood programs,

00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:47.776
the per capita earnings of state residents

00:03:47.776 --> 00:03:50.542
go up by two dollars and 78 cents,

00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:52.409
so that's a three-to-one return.

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.442
Now you can get much higher returns,

00:03:55.442 --> 00:03:59.516
of up to 16-to-one, if you include anti-crime benefits,

00:03:59.516 --> 00:04:04.230
if you include benefits to former preschool participants
