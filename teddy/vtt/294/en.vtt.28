00:14:03.339 --> 00:14:07.264
we're investing in now for the future.

00:14:07.264 --> 00:14:11.213
And so what I want to leave you with is

00:14:11.213 --> 00:14:13.519
what I think is the ultimate question.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:16.353
I mean, I'm an economist, but this is ultimately

00:14:16.353 --> 00:14:21.898

Are we willing, as Americans,

00:14:26.105 --> 00:14:29.555
are we as a society still capable

00:14:29.555 --> 00:14:34.339
of making the political choice to sacrifice now
