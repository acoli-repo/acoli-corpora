00:10:56.452 --> 00:11:00.131
pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy,

00:11:00.131 --> 00:11:03.574
and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar,

00:11:03.574 --> 00:11:06.303
we get about three dollars back

00:11:06.303 --> 00:11:08.478
in benefits for the state economy.

00:11:08.478 --> 00:11:12.090
So in my opinion, the research evidence is compelling

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.914
and the logic of this is compelling.

00:11:14.914 --> 00:11:18.604
So what are the barriers to getting it done?

00:11:18.604 --> 00:11:21.868
Well, one obvious barrier is cost.

00:11:21.868 --> 00:11:26.198
So if you look at what it would cost

00:11:26.198 --> 00:11:29.025
if every state government invested

00:11:29.025 --> 00:11:33.230
in universal preschool at age four, full-day preschool at age four,
