00:12:57.532 --> 00:13:00.086
Now, that's one barrier.

00:13:00.086 --> 00:13:03.508
I actually think the more profound barrier

00:13:03.508 --> 00:13:07.938
is the long-term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs.

00:13:07.938 --> 00:13:10.784
So the argument I'm making is, is that we're increasing

00:13:10.784 --> 00:13:12.539
the quality of our local workforce,

00:13:12.539 --> 00:13:15.205
and thereby increasing economic development.

00:13:15.205 --> 00:13:18.585
Obviously if we have a preschool with four-year-olds,

00:13:18.585 --> 00:13:20.953
we're not sending these kids out at age five

00:13:20.953 --> 00:13:24.468
to work in the sweatshops, right? At least I hope not.

00:13:24.468 --> 00:13:27.880
So we're talking about an investment

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.350
that in terms of impacts on the state economy
