00:11:29.025 --> 00:11:33.230
in universal preschool at age four, full-day preschool at age four,

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.645
the total annual national cost would be roughly

00:11:36.645 --> 00:11:38.950
30 billion dollars.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.375
So, 30 billion dollars is a lot of money.

00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:45.120
On the other hand, if you reflect on

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.980
that the U.S.'s population is over 300 million,

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.663
we're talking about an amount of money

00:11:51.663 --> 00:11:54.283
that amounts to 100 dollars per capita.

00:11:54.283 --> 00:11:57.261
Okay? A hundred dollars per capita, per person,

00:11:57.261 --> 00:12:01.266
is something that any state government can afford to do.
