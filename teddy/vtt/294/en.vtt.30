00:14:57.986 --> 00:15:00.720
that you still believe in the notion of investment?

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.119
That is the notion of investment.

00:15:02.119 --> 00:15:04.693
You sacrifice now for a return later.

00:15:04.693 --> 00:15:08.331
So I think the research evidence

00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:10.969
on the benefits of early childhood programs

00:15:10.969 --> 00:15:14.576
for the local economy is extremely strong.

00:15:14.576 --> 00:15:18.858
However, the moral and political choice

00:15:18.858 --> 00:15:23.962
is still up to us, as citizens and as voters.

00:15:23.962 --> 00:15:27.985
Thank you very much. (Applause)
