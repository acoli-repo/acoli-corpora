00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.350
that in terms of impacts on the state economy

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:34.311
is not going to really pay off for 15 or 20 years,

00:13:34.311 --> 00:13:37.169
and of course America is notorious for being

00:13:37.169 --> 00:13:40.176
a short term-oriented society.

00:13:40.176 --> 00:13:41.836
Now one response you can make to this,

00:13:41.836 --> 00:13:43.361
and I sometimes have done this in talks,

00:13:43.361 --> 00:13:46.438
is people can talk about, there are benefits for these programs

00:13:46.438 --> 00:13:50.085
in reducing special ed and remedial education costs,

00:13:50.085 --> 00:13:52.391
there are benefits, parents care about preschool,

00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:54.641
maybe we'll get some migration effects

00:13:54.641 --> 00:13:56.959
from parents seeking good preschool,

00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:58.606
and I think those are true,

00:13:58.606 --> 00:14:00.768
but in some sense they're missing the point.
