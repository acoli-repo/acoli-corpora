00:01:59.796 --> 00:02:03.461
to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants.

00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:05.601
They hand out all kinds of business tax breaks.

00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:07.799
Now, those programs can make sense

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.801
if they in fact induce new location decisions,

00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:12.186
and the way they can make sense is,

00:02:12.186 --> 00:02:14.499
by creating more and better jobs,

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:18.082
they raise employment rates, raise per capita earnings of state residents.

00:02:18.082 --> 00:02:20.152
So there is a benefit to state residents

00:02:20.152 --> 00:02:22.301
that corresponds to the costs that they're paying

00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:24.574
by paying for these business tax breaks.

00:02:24.574 --> 00:02:28.382
My argument is essentially that early childhood programs

00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:32.107
can do exactly the same thing,
