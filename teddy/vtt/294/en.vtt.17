00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:32.502
And again, the firm that's less competitive

00:08:32.502 --> 00:08:35.191
will not be able to pay as good wages,

00:08:35.191 --> 00:08:39.324
and then, particularly in high-tech businesses,

00:08:39.324 --> 00:08:42.585
they're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses.

00:08:42.585 --> 00:08:45.805
So clearly the productivity of firms in Silicon Valley

00:08:45.805 --> 00:08:49.600
has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm,

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.019
but the workers at all the other firms in the metro area.

00:08:54.019 --> 00:08:57.553
So as a result, if we can invest in other people's children

00:08:57.553 --> 00:08:59.955
through preschool and other early childhood programs

00:08:59.955 --> 00:09:03.611
that are high-quality, we not only help those children,
