00:02:36.016 --> 00:02:38.434
It's a somewhat more indirect way.

00:02:38.434 --> 00:02:42.080
These programs can promote more and better jobs by,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.955
you build it, you invest in high-quality preschool,

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:48.773
it develops the skills of your local workforce

00:02:48.773 --> 00:02:52.516
if enough of them stick around, and, in turn,

00:02:52.516 --> 00:02:54.669
that higher-quality local workforce

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:59.361
will be a key driver of creating jobs and creating

00:02:59.361 --> 00:03:01.869
higher earnings per capita in the local community.
