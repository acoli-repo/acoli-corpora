00:06:30.096 --> 00:06:33.434
One of the very interesting facts is that, in addition,

00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:37.481
we find that even once we hold constant, statistically,

00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:40.385
the effect of your own education,

00:06:40.385 --> 00:06:43.585
the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area

00:06:43.585 --> 00:06:45.557
also affects your wages.

00:06:45.557 --> 00:06:49.761
So specifically, if you hold constant your education,

00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:53.864
you stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area,

00:06:53.864 --> 00:06:57.824
you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages

00:06:57.824 --> 00:07:01.294
without changing your education at all.
