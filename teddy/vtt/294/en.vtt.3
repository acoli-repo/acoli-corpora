00:01:28.577 --> 00:01:32.359
they don't generally think first about what they're doing

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.914
about childcare and early childhood programs.

00:01:34.914 --> 00:01:38.817
I know this. I've spent most of my career researching these programs.

00:01:38.817 --> 00:01:40.440
I've talked to a lot of directors

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.768
of state economic development agencies about these issues,

00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:45.310
a lot of legislators about these issues.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.369
When legislators and others think about economic development,

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.625
what they first of all think about are business tax incentives,

00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:54.503
property tax abatements, job creation tax credits,

00:01:54.503 --> 00:01:57.190
you know, there are a million of these programs all over the place.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.796
So for example, states compete very vigorously

00:01:59.796 --> 00:02:03.461
to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants.
