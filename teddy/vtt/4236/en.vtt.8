at about 2.4 million colonies.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Now, those losses are tragic on many fronts,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And it's really important to talk about beekeepers first,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you'll ever meet.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
If this was a group of beekeepers, you would have everyone

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
to the, you know, the self-expressed quirky San Francisco

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
backyard pig farmer.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
