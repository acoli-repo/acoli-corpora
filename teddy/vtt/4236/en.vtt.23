00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And in fact, there is now a red list of pollinators

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
that we're worried have disappeared, and on top of that list

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
are a lot of these kleptoparasites, but also these bumblebees.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And in fact, if you guys live on the West Coast,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
go to these websites here, and they're really looking for people

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
to look for some of these bumblebees, because we think

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
some have gone extinct. Or some, the population has declined.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And so it's not just honeybees that are in trouble,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
but we don't understand these native pollinators

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
or all those other parts of our community.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And of course, bees are not the only important factor here.
