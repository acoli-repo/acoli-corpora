00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And if you're ever in Central Valley in February, you go to this café

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
at 10 o'clock in the morning, Kathy and Kate's.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And that's where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
into the almond groves.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
They all have their breakfast

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and complain about everyone right there. And it's a great experience,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and I really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
because that's quite essential American experience.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And we see these families, these nomadic families, you know,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
father to son, father to son, and these guys are hurting.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And they're not people who like to ask for help,
