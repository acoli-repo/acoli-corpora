But what beekeepers can do is, if they have one surviving colony,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
they can split that colony in two.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And then the one half that doesn't have a queen, they can buy a queen.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It comes in the mail; it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and you can introduce that queen.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And in fact, America was the first country

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that ever did mail-delivery queens and in fact,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
it's part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country.
