00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
In Pennsylvania alone, we have been surveying bees for 150 years,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and very intensely in the last three years.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
We have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Thirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Now, that could be because we haven't been sampling right,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
but it does, I think, suggest that something's wrong

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
with the pollinator force. And these bees are fascinating.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
We have bumblebees on the top.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And bumblebees are what we call eusocial: they're not truly social,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
because only the queen is, over winter.
