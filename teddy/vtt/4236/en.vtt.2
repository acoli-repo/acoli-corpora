And below, you can see all these out yards,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
or temporary yards, where the colonies are brought in until February,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and then they're shipped out to the almonds.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And one documentary writer, who was here and looked at this two months

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
after I was here, described this not as beehives

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but as a graveyard, with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now, I'm going to sum up a year's worth of work in two sentences

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to say that we have been trying to figure out

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
what the cause of this is.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And what we know is that it's as if the bees have caught a flu.
