And they're not people who like to ask for help,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
although they are the most helpful people ever.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
If there's one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
everyone pitches in and gives 20 hives

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
to help him replace those lost colonies.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And so, it's a very dynamic, and I think,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
historic and exciting community to be involved with.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Of course, the real importance for bees is not the honey.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And although I highly encourage you, all use honey.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I mean, it's the most ethical sweetener,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and you know, it's a dynamic and fun sweetener.
