They're just fascinating. And they're like that all over the world.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I had the privilege of working in Haiti just for two weeks earlier this year.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And Haiti, if you've ever been there, is just a tragedy.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I mean, there may be 100 explanations

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
for why Haiti is the impoverished nation it is,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
No formal education, but very knowledgeable.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
We needed beeswax for a project we were working on; he was so capable,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax I have ever seen
