When they're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
they stay to that crop exclusively, in order to help generate.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And of course, they're made to carry this pollen.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
They build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
However, honeybees are a minority.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Honeybees are not native to America; they were introduced

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
with the colonialists.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And there are actually more species of bees

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
than there are mammals and birds combined.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
In Pennsylvania alone, we have been surveying bees for 150 years,
