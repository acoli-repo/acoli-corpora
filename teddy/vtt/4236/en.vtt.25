00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
becoming the population of half of this county in three years.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And so that's incredible. And there's no money to do that.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
But I'm glad to say that I think we know the cause

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
of all these conditions, and that cause is NDD:

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Nature Deficit Disorder.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And that is that I think that what we have in our society is,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
we forgot our connection with nature.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And I think if we reconnect to nature,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
we'll be able to have the resources and that interest

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
to solve these problems.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD.
