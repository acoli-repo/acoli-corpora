00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
(Laughter)

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And you get all of these people in the same room,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and they're all engaged and they're getting along,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and they're all there because of the passion for bees.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Now, there's another part of that community

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
which are the commercial beekeepers,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And these tend to be some of the most independent, tenacious,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
intuitive, you know, inventive people you will ever meet.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
They're just fascinating. And they're like that all over the world.
