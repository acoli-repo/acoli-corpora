00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and that being bad, but we've done that for thousands of years.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The ancient Egyptians used to move bees up and down the Nile on rafts,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And one of our real worries with Colony Collapse Disorder

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead-out colonies.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And you can do that one year in a row,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
you may be able to do it two years in a row.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
But if you're losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
you can't survive three years in a row. And we're really worried

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
about losing this segment of our industry.
