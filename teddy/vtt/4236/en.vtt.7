a three-pound package of bees, which comes in the mail, and of course,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So even though we've lost 30 percent of the colonies every year,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
the same number of colonies have existed in the country,
