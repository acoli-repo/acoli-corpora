00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
actually, deserts: they're totally sterile.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Americans spent, in 2001 -- 11 percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And so it's incredible the amount of resources we've spent

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
keeping our lawns, which are these useless biosystems.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And so we need to rethink this idea.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
In fact, you know, the White House

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
used to have sheep in front in order to help fund

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
the war effort in World War I, which probably is not a bad idea;

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
it wouldn't be a bad idea.
