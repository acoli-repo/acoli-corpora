00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that, you know, we're finding a lot of different pesticides

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
in the hive, and surprisingly, sometimes the healthiest hives

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
have the most pesticides. And so we discover all these

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
very strange things that we can't begin to understand.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Now of course, if you lose a lot of colonies,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
beekeepers can replace them very quickly.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And that's why we've been able to recover from a lot of loss.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
If we lost one in every three cows in the winter, you know,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
the National Guard would be out.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
But what beekeepers can do is, if they have one surviving colony,
