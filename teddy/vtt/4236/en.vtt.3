00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And what we know is that it's as if the bees have caught a flu.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And this flu has wiped through the population of bees.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
In some cases, and in fact in most cases in one year,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
this flu was caused by a new virus to us,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
or newly identified by us, called Israeli Acute Paralysis virus.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It was called that because a guy in Israel first found it,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease, because,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
of course, there's the implication.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
or other flus, and so the question we're still struggling with,
