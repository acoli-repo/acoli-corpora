and had we taken out all those ingredients,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
-- except for the almonds I wasn't going to pick out from the granola --

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
if we had taken out all those ingredients

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
we wouldn't have much on our plate.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So if we did not have bees, it's not like we would starve,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
but clearly our diet would be diminished.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and for flowers bees are the messengers of love.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And that's a really great expression, because really,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
bees are the sex workers for flowers. They are, you know --
