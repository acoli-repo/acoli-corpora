00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
or insects, that come to these flowers, to watch that --

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and we've heard about, you know, this relationship you can have with wine,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
this companion you can have as it matures

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
and as it has these different fragrances.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
And this is a companion,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and this is a relationship that never dries up.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
You never run out of that companion as you drink this wine, too.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And I encourage you to look at that.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Now, not all of us have meadows,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
or lawns that we can convert, and so you can always, of course,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
grow a meadow in a pot.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Bees apparently, can be the gateway to, you know, other things.
