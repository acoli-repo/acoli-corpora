It's also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
or other flus, and so the question we're still struggling with,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and the question that keeps us up at night,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And we don't have the answer to that yet,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We think perhaps it's a combination of factors.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that, you know, we're finding a lot of different pesticides
