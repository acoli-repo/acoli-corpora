And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And that is, make meadows and not lawns.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And I think we have lost our connection,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I've had the privilege of living by a meadow

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
for the last little while, and it is terribly engaging.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And if we look at the history of lawns, it's actually rather tragic.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
It used to be, two, three hundred years ago,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
that a lawn was a symbol of prestige,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
actually, deserts: they're totally sterile.
