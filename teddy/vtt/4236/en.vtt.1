00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And this is the second year in a row we have lost over 30 percent

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
of the colonies, or we estimate we've lost 30 percent of the colonies over the winter.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now, that's a lot, a lot of bees, and that's really important.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And most of those losses are because of things we know.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and caused a lot of losses, and we also have this new phenomenon,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
which I talked about last year, Colony Collapse Disorder.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And here we see a picture on top of a hill in Central Valley last December.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And below, you can see all these out yards,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
or temporary yards, where the colonies are brought in until February,
