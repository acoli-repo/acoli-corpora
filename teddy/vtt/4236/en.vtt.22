What these bees do is, they sit there. These solitary bees,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and they collect pollen and make it into a ball,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and they lay an egg on it.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Well, these bees hang out at that hole,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and they wait for that mother to fly away, they go in, eat the egg,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and lay their own egg there. So they don't do any work.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And so, in fact, if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
you know that your environment is healthy,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
because they're top-of-the-food-chain bees.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And in fact, there is now a red list of pollinators
