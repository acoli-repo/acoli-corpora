00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, that's kind of an obvious statement up there.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I started with that sentence about 12 years ago,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I started in the context

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
of developing countries,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but you're sitting here from every corner of the world.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So if you think of a map of your country,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I think you'll realize

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that for every country on Earth,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you could draw little circles to say,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
"These are places where good teachers won't go."

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
On top of that,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
those are the places from where trouble comes.
