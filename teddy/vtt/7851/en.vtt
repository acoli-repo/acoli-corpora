00:00:00.476 --> 00:00:01.636
Thirteen years ago,

00:00:01.676 --> 00:00:04.916
I had just made partner
in my large global services firm.

00:00:04.956 --> 00:00:07.476
I was one of the first, one of the only.

00:00:07.476 --> 00:00:10.396
And I was celebrating
in New York with a friend,

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:12.676
someone I'd gone to business school with,

00:00:12.716 --> 00:00:14.156
a really close friend of mine.

00:00:14.196 --> 00:00:16.356
In the book that I wrote,
I called him Walter.

00:00:16.356 --> 00:00:17.556
That's not his real name,

00:00:17.596 --> 00:00:20.116
but we're going to call him Walter
for today as well.

00:00:20.116 --> 00:00:22.156
And we were sitting at a bar in New York.

00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:25.596
We were going to have a big dinner
to celebrate our collective successes.

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:28.876
He had just gotten promoted
to partner in his firm as well.

00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:32.036
And the waiter had just delivered,
you know, champagne,
