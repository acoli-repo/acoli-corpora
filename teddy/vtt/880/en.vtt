I want to start my story in Germany, in 1877,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
with a mathematician named Georg Cantor.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And Cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process, a recursive process.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So he starts out with one line, and then two,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and then four, and then 16, and so on.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And if he does this an infinite number of times, which you can do in mathematics,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
he ends up with an infinite number of lines,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
each of which has an infinite number of points in it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity.
