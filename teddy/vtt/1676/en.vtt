00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:07.796
(Nature sounds)

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.512
When I first began
recording wild soundscapes

00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:12.443
45 years ago,

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:14.865
I had no idea that ants,

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.344
insect larvae, sea anemones and viruses

00:00:18.368 --> 00:00:20.472
created a sound signature.

00:00:20.496 --> 00:00:21.915
But they do.

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.328
And so does every wild
habitat on the planet,

00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:28.563
like the Amazon rainforest
you're hearing behind me.

00:00:28.587 --> 00:00:32.137
In fact, temperate
and tropical rainforests
