CA: But what conversations did you or do you

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000

CP: At first, very kind of pained,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
awkward conversations.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
The content is not dinner table conversation in the least.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
But my parents -- I think part of why

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
is because they don't understand it.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
(Laughter)

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
CA: And they were probably pleased to see you

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
on top of the Time poll.
