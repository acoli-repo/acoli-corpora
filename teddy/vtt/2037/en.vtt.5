00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So does a site like this have rules?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We do; they're the codified rules that I've come up with,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
which are more-or-less ignored by the community.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And so they've come up with their own set of rules,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
the "Rules of the Internet."

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And so there are three that I want to show you specifically.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Rule one is you don't talk about /b/.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Two is you do not talk about /b/.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And this one's kind of interesting:

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
"If it exists, there is porn of it. No exceptions."

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
(Laughter)

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And I will spare you that slide.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I assure you, it is very true.
