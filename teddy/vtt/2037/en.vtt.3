Internet phenomena, viral videos and whatnot, known as "memes."

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Two of the largest memes that have come out of this site

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
some of you might be familiar with are these LOLcats --

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
just silly pictures of cats with text.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And this resonates with millions of people, apparently,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
because there are tens of thousands of these,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and there is a whole blogging empire now

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
dedicated to pictures like these.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And Rick Astley's kind of rebirth

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
these past two years ...

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Rickroll was this bait and switch,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
really simple, classic bait and switch.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Somebody says they're linking to something interesting,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and you get an '80s pop song. That's all it was.
