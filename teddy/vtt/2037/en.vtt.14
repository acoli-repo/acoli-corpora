00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
But seriously,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
this issue on anonymity is --

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I mean, you made the case there.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
But anonymity basically allows people to say anything,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
all the rules gone.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
You've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And I'm just curious whether you

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
sometimes lie awake in the night

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
worrying that you've opened Pandora's box.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
CP: Yes and no.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I mean, for as much good

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
that kind of comes out of this environment,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
there is plenty of bad.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
There are plenty of downsides.
