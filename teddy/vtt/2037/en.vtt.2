00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
to 48 boards.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This is what it looks like.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So, what's unique about the site

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
is that it's anonymous,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and it has no memory.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
There's no archive, there are no barriers, there's no registration.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
These things that we're used to with forums

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
don't exist on 4chan.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And that's led to this

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
discussion that's completely raw, completely unfiltered.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What the site's known for,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
because it has this environment,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
is it's fostered the creation of a lot of

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Internet phenomena, viral videos and whatnot, known as "memes."
