00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that protested, very famously,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Scientology.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
The story is,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Scientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise. It went up online.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And so these people, over 7,000 people,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
less than one month later,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
organized in a hundred cities around the globe and --

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
this is L.A. --

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
protested the Church of Scientology,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and they have continued to do so,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
now, two full years after the fact.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
They are still protesting.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000
(Laughter)
