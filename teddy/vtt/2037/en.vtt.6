I assure you, it is very true.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
/b/ is the first board we started with,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and it is, in many ways,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
the beating heart of the website.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
It is where a third of all the traffic is going.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And /b/ is known for,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
more than anything,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
not just the memes they've created, but the exploits.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And Chris just touched on one of those a second ago,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and that was the Time 100 poll.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So somebody at Time, at the magazine,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
thought it would be fun to nominate me

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
for this thing they did last year.
