00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
it had over 12,000 responses.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And the thing is,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I didn't make it into that presentation

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
because I can't read to you anything that they said, more or less.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
(Laughter)

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
99 percent of it is just,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
would have been, you know, bleeped out.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
But there were some good things that came out of that too.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
(Laughter)

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Love and peace were mentioned.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
CA: Love and peace were mentioned,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
kind of with quote marks around them, right?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
CP: Cats and dogs were mentioned too.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
CA: And that content is all off the board now.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Right, it's gone? Or is it still up there?
