00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
on top of the Time poll.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
CP: Yeah. They still didn't know what to think of that though.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
(Laughter)

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
CA: And so, in 10 years' time,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
what do you picture yourself doing?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
CP: That's a good question.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
As I said, I just went back to school,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
and I am considering

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
majoring in urban studies

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and then going on to urban planning,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
kind of taking whatever I've learned from online communities

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
and trying to adapt that

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
to a physical community.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
CA: Chris, thank you. Absolutely fascinating. Thank you for coming to TED.
