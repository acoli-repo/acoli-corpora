Christopher Poole: When I was 15,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I found this website called Futaba Channel.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That format of forum, at that time,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
was not well-known outside of Japan.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And so what I did is I took it, I translated it into English,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and I stuck it up for my friends to use.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now, six and a half years later,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
over seven million people are using it,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
contributing over 700,000 posts per day.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And we've gone from one board

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
to 48 boards.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This is what it looks like.
