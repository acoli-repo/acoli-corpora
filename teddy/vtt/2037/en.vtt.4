Somebody says they're linking to something interesting,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and you get an '80s pop song. That's all it was.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And it got big enough to the point where

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
there was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and Rick Astley pops out, and rickrolls

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
millions of people on television.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
(Laughter)

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
There are thousands of memes that come out of the site.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
There are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
the ones I've just shown you,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but every day, every month,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
people are producing thousands of these.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So does a site like this have rules?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We do; they're the codified rules that I've come up with,
