Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is one of the major threats against our fauna,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
especially birds,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and mainly to supply the pet market

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
with thousands of animals taken from nature every month,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and transported far from their origins,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and SÃ£o Paulo.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It is estimated that

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
withdraw from nature

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
almost 38 million animals every year,
