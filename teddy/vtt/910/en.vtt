00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Every presentation needs this slide in it.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
(Laughter)

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Do you see?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
All the points, all the lines --

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
it's incredible.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It is the network;

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and in my case, the network has been important in media,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
because I get to connect to people.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Isn't it amazing?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Through that, I connect to people.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And the way that I've been doing it

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
has been multifaceted.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
For example, I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners.
