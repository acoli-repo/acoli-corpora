00:09:58.633 --> 00:10:03.291
so the common default is just saying nothing.

00:10:03.291 --> 00:10:05.890
The problem with that

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:07.496
is then it feels like your service

00:10:07.496 --> 00:10:10.010
was not even acknowledged,

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.017
like no one even cared.

00:10:13.017 --> 00:10:16.040
"Thank you for your service,"

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.133
and we move on.

00:10:19.133 --> 00:10:21.809
What I wanted to better understand

00:10:21.809 --> 00:10:25.123
was what's behind that,

00:10:25.123 --> 00:10:30.875
and why "thank you for your service" isn't enough.
