00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.554
needs to be more than just a quote break,

00:13:32.554 --> 00:13:35.180
that "thank you for your service" means

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.406
honestly digging in

00:13:37.406 --> 00:13:40.356
to the people who have stepped up

00:13:40.356 --> 00:13:44.199
simply because they were asked to,

00:13:44.199 --> 00:13:46.228
and what that means for us not just now,

00:13:46.228 --> 00:13:49.720
not just during combat operations,

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.069
but long after the last vehicle has left

00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:57.943
and after the last shot has been taken.

00:13:57.943 --> 00:14:00.773
These are the people who I served with,
