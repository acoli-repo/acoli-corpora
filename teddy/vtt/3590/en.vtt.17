00:08:26.557 --> 00:08:31.220
It plays out in all of our emotions.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.557
Please forgive us

00:08:32.557 --> 00:08:37.767
if we don't like being in big crowds.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.030
Please forgive us

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.354
when we spend one week in a place

00:08:42.354 --> 00:08:44.702
that has 100 percent light discipline,

00:08:44.702 --> 00:08:46.930
because you're not allowed to
walk around with white lights,

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.417
because if anything has a white light,

00:08:48.417 --> 00:08:49.894
it can be seen from miles away,

00:08:49.894 --> 00:08:51.607
versus if you use little green

00:08:51.607 --> 00:08:52.774
or little blue lights,

00:08:52.774 --> 00:08:54.706
they cannot be seen from far away.

00:08:54.706 --> 00:08:56.839
So please forgive us if out of nowhere,

00:08:56.839 --> 00:09:00.046
we go from having 100 percent light discipline
