00:06:29.024 --> 00:06:31.314
with a bare shoulder,

00:06:31.314 --> 00:06:35.404
and it burned every time someone stared at it.

00:06:35.404 --> 00:06:38.412
But you get a chance to talk to your soldiers,

00:06:38.412 --> 00:06:42.190
and you ask them why did they sign up.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.279
I signed up because college was expensive.

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:50.700
A lot of my soldiers signed up
for completely different reasons.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.632
They signed up because of a sense of obligation.

00:06:52.632 --> 00:06:54.441
They signed up because they were angry

00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:56.258
and they wanted to do something about it.

00:06:56.258 --> 00:06:57.570
They signed up because

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.416
their family said this was important.

00:06:59.416 --> 00:07:01.628
They signed up because they
wanted some form of revenge.
