00:11:29.604 --> 00:11:30.895
and we've taken off the uniform

00:11:30.895 --> 00:11:33.175
does not mean our larger service to this country

00:11:33.175 --> 00:11:35.851
is somehow over.

00:11:35.851 --> 00:11:38.732
The fact is, there's still a tremendous amount

00:11:38.732 --> 00:11:42.922
that can be offered and can be given.

00:11:42.922 --> 00:11:44.352
When I look at people

00:11:44.352 --> 00:11:49.010
like our friend Taylor Urruela,

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.754
who in Iraq loses his leg,

00:11:50.754 --> 00:11:53.412
had two big dreams in his life.

00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:56.480
One was to be a soldier. The other
was to be a baseball player.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:01.280
He loses his leg in Iraq.
