00:07:58.626 --> 00:08:02.100
I thought that if you make it back from conflict,

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.941
then the dangers were all over.

00:08:05.941 --> 00:08:08.138
I thought that if you made it
back from a conflict zone

00:08:08.138 --> 00:08:10.437
that somehow you could kind of

00:08:10.437 --> 00:08:11.671
wipe the sweat off your brow and say,

00:08:11.671 --> 00:08:15.415
"Whew, I'm glad I dodged that one,"

00:08:15.415 --> 00:08:17.223
without understanding that for so many people,

00:08:17.223 --> 00:08:19.366
as they come back home,

00:08:19.366 --> 00:08:21.665
the war keeps going.

00:08:21.665 --> 00:08:23.919
It keeps playing out in all of our minds.

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:26.557
It plays out in all of our memories.

00:08:26.557 --> 00:08:31.220
It plays out in all of our emotions.
