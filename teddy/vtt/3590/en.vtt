00:00:00.755 --> 00:00:03.046
I'm excited to be here to speak about vets,

00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:04.652
because I didn't join the Army

00:00:04.652 --> 00:00:06.800
because I wanted to go to war.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.518
I didn't join the Army because I had a lust

00:00:09.518 --> 00:00:13.175
or a need to go overseas and fight.

00:00:13.175 --> 00:00:15.515
Frankly, I joined the Army because

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.242
college is really damn expensive,

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:18.951
and they were going to help with that,

00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:21.291
and I joined the Army because

00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:23.447
it was what I knew,

00:00:23.447 --> 00:00:26.309
and it was what I knew that I thought I could do well.

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:28.707
I didn't come from a military family.

00:00:28.707 --> 00:00:29.950
I'm not a military brat.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.729
No one in my family ever
had joined the military at all,
