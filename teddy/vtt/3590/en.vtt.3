00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:31.381
I can see you're upset, and
I'm going to work harder."

00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:33.476
And she was like, "No, you're going next week."

00:01:33.476 --> 00:01:35.881
And that was how I first got introduced

00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:38.471
to this whole idea of the military,

00:01:38.471 --> 00:01:41.367
because she thought this was a good idea.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.179
I had to disagree with her wholeheartedly

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:44.479
when I first showed up there,

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.279
because literally in the first four days,

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:48.447
I had already run away five times from this school.

00:01:48.447 --> 00:01:50.333
They had these big black gates
that surrounded the school,

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.423
and every time they would turn their backs,

00:01:52.423 --> 00:01:54.879
I would just simply run out of the black gates

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:56.741
and take them up on their offer
that if we don't want to be there,

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:58.171
we can leave at any time.

00:01:58.171 --> 00:01:59.864
So I just said, "Well, if that's the case,

00:01:59.864 --> 00:02:03.112
then I'd like to leave." (Laughter)
