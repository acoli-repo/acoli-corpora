00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:01.944
By the time I finished that up and I rejoined

00:06:01.944 --> 00:06:04.634
my military unit and we were getting
ready to deploy to Afghanistan,

00:06:04.634 --> 00:06:06.222
there were soldiers in my unit who were now

00:06:06.222 --> 00:06:08.320
on their second and third deployments

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.740
before I even had my first.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.728
I remember walking out with
my unit for the first time,

00:06:11.728 --> 00:06:13.092
and when you join the Army

00:06:13.092 --> 00:06:14.748
and you go through a combat tour,

00:06:14.748 --> 00:06:16.082
everyone looks at your shoulder,

00:06:16.082 --> 00:06:19.860
because on your shoulder is your combat patch.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.136
And so immediately as you meet people,

00:06:21.136 --> 00:06:22.552
you shake their hand,

00:06:22.552 --> 00:06:24.411
and then your eyes go to their shoulder,

00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:26.024
because you want to see where did they serve,

00:06:26.024 --> 00:06:27.330
or what unit did they serve with?

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.024
And I was the only person walking around

00:06:29.024 --> 00:06:31.314
with a bare shoulder,
