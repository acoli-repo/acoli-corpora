00:02:59.298 --> 00:03:00.984
I thought about a lot of the people,

00:03:00.984 --> 00:03:03.803
in particular a lot of the men, in my life

00:03:03.803 --> 00:03:05.732
who I looked up to.

00:03:05.732 --> 00:03:07.607
They all happened to wear the uniform

00:03:07.607 --> 00:03:09.546
of the United States of America,

00:03:09.546 --> 00:03:11.791
so for me, the question and the answer

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.858
really became pretty easy.

00:03:13.858 --> 00:03:15.606
The question of what I wanted to do

00:03:15.606 --> 00:03:17.244
was filled in very quickly with saying,

00:03:17.244 --> 00:03:20.443
I guess I'll be an Army officer.

00:03:20.443 --> 00:03:22.267
So the Army then went through this process

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:23.468
and they trained me up,

00:03:23.468 --> 00:03:24.870
and when I say I didn't join the Army

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.500
because I wanted to go to war,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.583
the truth is, I joined in 1996.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:31.353
There really wasn't a whole lot going on.
