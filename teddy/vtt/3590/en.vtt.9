00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.887
this is exactly what was now going to happen.

00:04:32.887 --> 00:04:36.234
And I thought about so much about the soldiers

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:38.091
who I eventually had to end up leading.

00:04:38.091 --> 00:04:40.601
I remember when we first, right after 9/11,

00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:43.224
three weeks after 9/11, I was
on a plane heading overseas,

00:04:43.224 --> 00:04:45.210
but I wasn't heading overseas with the military,

and to go study and live overseas,

00:04:52.716 --> 00:04:54.788
and I was living in England and that was interesting,

00:04:54.788 --> 00:04:56.254
but at the same time, the same people who

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.998
I was training with,

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:01.411
the same soldiers that I went
through all my training with,
