00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.579
I wanted people to ask me about my experiences.

00:09:31.579 --> 00:09:33.327
I wanted people to come up to me and tell me,

00:09:33.327 --> 00:09:34.642
"What did you do?"

00:09:34.642 --> 00:09:36.129
I wanted people to come up to me and tell me,

00:09:36.129 --> 00:09:37.747
"What was it like? What was the food like?

00:09:37.747 --> 00:09:42.272
What was the experience like? How are you doing?"

00:09:42.272 --> 00:09:44.333
And the only questions I got from people was,

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:47.064
"Did you shoot anybody?"

00:09:47.064 --> 00:09:48.890
And those were the ones who were even curious

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.548
enough to say anything.

00:09:52.548 --> 00:09:54.218
Because sometimes there's this fear

00:09:54.218 --> 00:09:55.783
and there's this apprehension that if I say anything,

00:09:55.783 --> 00:09:57.259
I'm afraid I'll offend,

00:09:57.259 --> 00:09:58.633
or I'm afraid I'll trigger something,

00:09:58.633 --> 00:10:03.291
so the common default is just saying nothing.
