00:00:59.575 --> 00:01:00.870
so I'd look at the brochures, and I'm like,

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.197
"Okay, Mommy, I can see you're
serious, and I'll work harder."

00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:05.349
And then when I was 10 and 11,

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.503
my behavior just kept on getting worse.

00:01:08.503 --> 00:01:10.870
I was on academic and disciplinary probation

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.601
before I hit double digits,

00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:17.543
and I first felt handcuffs on my wrists

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:19.491
when I was 11 years old.

00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:21.107
And so when I was 13 years old,

00:01:21.107 --> 00:01:23.121
my mother came up to me, and she was like,

00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:24.857
"I'm not going to do this anymore.

00:01:24.857 --> 00:01:26.403
I'm going to send you to military school."

00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:28.241
And I looked at her, and I said, "Mommy,

00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:31.381
I can see you're upset, and
I'm going to work harder."
