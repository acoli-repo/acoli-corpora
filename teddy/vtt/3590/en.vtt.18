WEBVTT

00:08:56.839 --> 00:09:00.046
we go from having 100 percent light discipline

00:09:00.046 --> 00:09:02.599
to then a week later being back
in the middle of Times Square,

00:09:02.599 --> 00:09:07.730
and we have a difficult time adjusting to that.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.162
Please forgive us

00:09:09.162 --> 00:09:11.001
when you transition back to a family

00:09:11.001 --> 00:09:15.105
who has completely been maneuvering without you,

00:09:15.105 --> 00:09:17.132
and now when you come back, it's not that easy

00:09:17.132 --> 00:09:20.776
to fall back into a sense of normality,

00:09:20.776 --> 00:09:25.258
because the whole normal has changed.

00:09:25.258 --> 00:09:28.820
I remember when I came back,
I wanted to talk to people.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.579
I wanted people to ask me about my experiences.
