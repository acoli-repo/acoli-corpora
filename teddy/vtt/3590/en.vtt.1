00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.729
No one in my family ever
had joined the military at all,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.015
and how I first got introduced to the military

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:37.110
was when I was 13 years old

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.789
and I got sent away to military school,

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.458
because my mother had been threatening me

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:44.564

00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:53.931
And I'd look at her, and I'd say, "Mommy,

00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:55.863
I'll work harder."

00:00:55.863 --> 00:00:57.347
And then when I was nine years old,

00:00:57.347 --> 00:00:59.575
she started giving me brochures

00:00:59.575 --> 00:01:00.870
