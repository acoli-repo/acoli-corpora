00:10:25.123 --> 00:10:30.875
and why "thank you for your service" isn't enough.

00:10:30.875 --> 00:10:34.491
The fact is, we have literally

00:10:34.491 --> 00:10:37.048
2.6 million men and women

00:10:37.048 --> 00:10:39.972
who are veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:42.642
who are all amongst us.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.122
Sometimes we know who they are,

00:10:44.122 --> 00:10:47.234
sometimes we don't,

00:10:47.234 --> 00:10:49.401
but there is that feeling, the shared experience,

00:10:49.401 --> 00:10:52.325
the shared bond

00:10:52.325 --> 00:10:54.197
where we know that that experience

00:10:54.197 --> 00:10:56.206
and that chapter of our life,

00:10:56.206 --> 00:10:58.921
while it might be closed,

00:10:58.921 --> 00:11:02.967
it's still not over.
