00:00:00.397 --> 00:00:02.071
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:02.095 --> 00:00:05.253
My name is Art Benjamin,
and I am a "mathemagician."

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.976
What that means is, I combine
my loves of math and magic

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.976
to do something I call "mathemagics."

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.191
But before I get started, I have
a quick question for the audience.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:16.976
By any chance, did anyone happen

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.617
to bring with them
this morning a calculator?

00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:24.276
Seriously, if you have a calculator
with you, raise your hand.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.576
Raise your hand. Did your hand go up?

00:00:26.888 --> 00:00:29.143
Now bring it out, bring it out.
Anybody else?

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:30.976
I see, I see one way in the back.
