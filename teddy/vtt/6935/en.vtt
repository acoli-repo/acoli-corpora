00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:11.871
Straddling Virginia and North Carolina
is an area that was once described as the

00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:15.038
“most repulsive of American possessions.”

00:00:15.538 --> 00:00:20.204
By 1728, it was known 
as the Great Dismal Swamp.

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:22.913
But while many deemed it uninhabitable,

00:00:22.913 --> 00:00:28.329
recent findings suggest that 
a hidden society persisted in the Swamp

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.704
until the mid-1800′s.
