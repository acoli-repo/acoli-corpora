Do you feel trapped

00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:05.059
in a broken economic model?

00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:07.726
A model that's trashing the living world

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.726
and threatens the lives
of our descendants?

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.684
A model that excludes billions of people

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:19.684
while making a handful unimaginably rich?

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:22.851
That sorts us into winners and losers,

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:27.393
and then blames the losers
for their misfortune?

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:29.976

the zombie doctrine
that never seems to die,
