00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:30.843
I saw resistance happening.

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:32.113
We were standing up.

00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:37.191
There were youth that had run
2,000 miles from Cannonball, North Dakota

00:02:37.215 --> 00:02:41.404
all the way out to Washington, DC,
with a message for President Obama:

00:02:41.428 --> 00:02:42.968
"Please intervene.

00:02:42.992 --> 00:02:44.449
Please do something.

00:02:44.473 --> 00:02:45.704
Help us."

00:02:47.174 --> 00:02:49.643
And I went out, and I heard the call,

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:52.659
and so did thousands
of people around the world.

00:02:52.683 --> 00:02:55.280
Why did this resonate with so many people?

00:02:55.304 --> 00:03:00.111
Indigenous peoples are impacted
first and worst by climate change.
