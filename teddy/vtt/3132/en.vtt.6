00:02:55.304 --> 00:03:00.111
Indigenous peoples are impacted
first and worst by climate change.

00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:04.667
We are impacted first and worst
by the fossil-fuel industry.

00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:08.410
Here in Louisiana, the first US
climate change refugees exist.

00:03:08.434 --> 00:03:09.794
They are Native people

00:03:09.818 --> 00:03:12.726
being pushed off their homelands
from rising sea levels.

00:03:13.194 --> 00:03:15.101
That's our reality, that's what we live.

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:18.823
And with these projects
comes a slew of human costs

00:03:18.847 --> 00:03:20.694
that people don't think about:

00:03:20.718 --> 00:03:24.773
thousands of workers influxing
to build these pipelines,

00:03:24.797 --> 00:03:28.484
to build and extract from the earth,

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:31.793
bringing crime and sex trafficking
and violence with them.
