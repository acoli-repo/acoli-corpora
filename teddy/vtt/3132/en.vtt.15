00:07:26.975 --> 00:07:30.292
But this woman's out there
and we're all out there standing together,

00:07:30.316 --> 00:07:32.436
because we are resilient, we are fierce,

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.326
and we are teaching people
how to reconnect to the earth,

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.674
remembering where we come from.

00:07:38.698 --> 00:07:40.865
So much of society has forgotten this.

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:45.016
(Applause)

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.739
That food you eat comes from somewhere.

00:07:47.763 --> 00:07:50.809
The tap water you drink
comes from somewhere.

00:07:51.255 --> 00:07:53.357
We're trying to remember, teach,

00:07:53.381 --> 00:07:55.421
because we know, we still remember.

00:07:55.445 --> 00:07:58.542
It's in our plants,
in our medicines, in our lives,

00:07:58.566 --> 00:08:00.423
every single day.
