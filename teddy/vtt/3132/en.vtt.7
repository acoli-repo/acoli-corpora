has become so significant
it's spawned a movement

00:03:38.228 --> 00:03:40.123
and a national inquiry.

00:03:40.147 --> 00:03:43.006
Thousands of Native women
who have disappeared,

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.551
who have been murdered.

00:03:44.878 --> 00:03:46.979
And here in the US,

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.107

00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:54.018

the United States Supreme Court,

00:03:54.042 --> 00:03:58.600
stripped us, in 1978, of the right
to prosecute at the same rate

00:03:58.624 --> 00:04:00.750
as anywhere else in the United States.
