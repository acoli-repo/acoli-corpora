00:04:29.968 --> 00:04:32.536
You could feel the resistance happening.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.126
People were standing and saying, "No more.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.830
Enough is enough.

00:04:37.854 --> 00:04:40.045
We will put our bodies
in front of the machines

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:41.865
to stop this project from happening.

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.504
Our lives matter.

00:04:43.528 --> 00:04:45.528
Our children's lives matter."

00:04:46.483 --> 00:04:50.102
And thousands of allies came
to stand with us from around the world.

00:04:50.126 --> 00:04:55.621
It was incredible, it was incredible
to stand together, united as one.

00:04:56.464 --> 00:05:03.405
