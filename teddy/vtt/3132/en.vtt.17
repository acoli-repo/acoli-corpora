00:08:27.453 --> 00:08:30.468
It's incredible, the power
that we have when we stand together,

00:08:30.492 --> 00:08:33.583
human resistance,
people having this power,

00:08:33.607 --> 00:08:36.323
some of the most oppressed people
you can possibly imagine

00:08:36.347 --> 00:08:39.745
costing this company
hundreds of millions of dollars,

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:43.751
and now our divestment efforts, focusing
on the banks behind these projects,

00:08:43.775 --> 00:08:46.633
costing them billions of dollars.

00:08:46.657 --> 00:08:49.112
Five billion dollars
we've cost them so far,

00:08:49.136 --> 00:08:50.287
hanging out with banks.

00:08:50.311 --> 00:08:55.211
(Applause)

00:08:55.235 --> 00:08:56.760
So what can you do?

00:08:56.784 --> 00:08:58.162
How can you help?

00:08:58.186 --> 00:08:59.854
How can you change the conversation

00:08:59.878 --> 00:09:02.630
for extremely oppressed
and forgotten people?
