00:06:59.034 --> 00:07:00.917
But I interviewed one of the women,

00:07:00.941 --> 00:07:03.893
who had been bitten on the breast
by one of these dogs,

00:07:03.917 --> 00:07:07.132
and the ferocity and strength of her

00:07:07.156 --> 00:07:08.307
was incredible,

00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:10.713
and she's out right now
in another resistance camp,

00:07:10.737 --> 00:07:12.578
the same resistance camp I'm part of,

00:07:12.602 --> 00:07:16.544
fighting Line 3, another pipeline project
in my people's homelands,

00:07:16.568 --> 00:07:20.974
wanting 900,000 barrels
of tar sands per day

00:07:20.998 --> 00:07:24.378
through the headwaters of the Mississippi
to the shore of Lake Superior

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:26.951
and through all the Treaty
territories along the way.

00:07:26.975 --> 00:07:30.292
But this woman's out there
and we're all out there standing together,
