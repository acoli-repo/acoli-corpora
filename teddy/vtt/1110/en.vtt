00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:05.321
Before March, 2011, I was a photographic retoucher

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:08.268
based in New York City.

00:00:08.268 --> 00:00:10.324
We're pale, gray creatures.

00:00:10.324 --> 00:00:12.384
We hide in dark, windowless rooms,

00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:14.712
and generally avoid sunlight.

00:00:14.712 --> 00:00:18.976
We make skinny models skinnier, perfect skin more perfect,

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:20.956
and the impossible possible,

00:00:20.956 --> 00:00:25.006
and we get criticized in the press all the time,

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.507
but some of us are actually talented artists

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:30.587
with years of experience
