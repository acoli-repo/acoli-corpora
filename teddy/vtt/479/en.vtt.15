00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:33.315
that public science outreach
has traditionally overlooked.

00:07:34.427 --> 00:07:36.316
And in the process,

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.308
I am affirming the genius

00:07:39.332 --> 00:07:43.347
that thrives in the young minds of people
from every hood everywhere.

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:45.966
So let me ask you one last time,

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.395
you down with EPC?

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:48.776
Audience: Yeah, you know me!

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.057
DNL: You down with EPC?

00:07:50.081 --> 00:07:51.420
Audience: Yeah, you know me!

00:07:51.444 --> 00:07:52.646
DNL: You down with EPC?

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.030
Audience: Yeah, you know me!

00:07:54.054 --> 00:07:55.262
DNL: Who's down with EPC?

00:07:55.286 --> 00:07:57.362
Audience: All the homies!

00:07:57.698 --> 00:07:58.864
Thank you.

00:07:58.888 --> 00:08:03.277
