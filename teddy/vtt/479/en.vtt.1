Now, "OPP" is a call-and-response song.

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:35.649
So throughout the talk,
I'm going to put lyrics up on the screen,

00:00:35.673 --> 00:00:37.063
and I'm going to recite some

00:00:37.087 --> 00:00:38.450
and I'm going to prompt you

00:00:38.474 --> 00:00:40.644
when it's your turn
to do the response, OK?

00:00:40.668 --> 00:00:41.921
(Cheers)

00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:44.580
Now, I know some people
in this audience know this song,

00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:47.429
so I need you to lead the way
with the tempo and the rhythm,

00:00:47.453 --> 00:00:48.857
if that's alright, OK?

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:50.071
Right, y'all ready?

00:00:50.974 --> 00:00:52.321
You down with OPP?

00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:53.712
Audience: Yeah, you know me!

00:00:53.736 --> 00:00:55.119
DNL: You down with OPP?

00:00:55.143 --> 00:00:56.498
Audience: Yeah, you know me!

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:57.777
DNL: You down with OPP?

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.133
Audience: Yeah, you know me!

00:00:59.157 --> 00:01:00.355
