00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:02.029
after all the science news broke
while I was in graduate school.

00:05:02.403 --> 00:05:04.703
And as we were taking a class,

00:05:04.727 --> 00:05:07.601
talking about current discoveries
and mating systems,

00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:09.403
this topic comes up.

00:05:09.855 --> 00:05:12.459
And as my professor's
going through the definition

00:05:12.483 --> 00:05:15.292
and recounting all
the dramatic turns of events

00:05:15.316 --> 00:05:17.482
that lead to these new revelations,

00:05:17.506 --> 00:05:21.109
I'm sitting in class and a familiar song
starts bopping in my head.

00:05:21.133 --> 00:05:22.768
I'm like, "You down with OPP?

00:05:22.792 --> 00:05:24.323
Yeah, you know me!"

00:05:24.347 --> 00:05:25.966
(Laughter)

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.799
I mean, that's exactly
what that song was about:

00:05:29.823 --> 00:05:30.973
EPCs.
