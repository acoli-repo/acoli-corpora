00:00:01.071 --> 00:00:02.221
How y'all doing?

00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:04.111
Good.

00:00:04.135 --> 00:00:06.920
I came here to give you a science lesson

00:00:06.944 --> 00:00:09.006
about animal mating systems

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.614
and why defining monogamy
has been a challenge for scientists.

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:17.046
But you won't need a textbook
or to download an online lecture.

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:22.283
All you'll simply need to do
is revisit the song "OPP"

00:00:22.307 --> 00:00:23.712
by Naughty by Nature.

00:00:23.736 --> 00:00:24.926
(Laughter)

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.211
It was released in 1991.

00:00:28.808 --> 00:00:31.493
Now, "OPP" is a call-and-response song.
