00:01:58.514 --> 00:02:02.522
which could copy DNA
from a small tissue or fluid sample

00:02:02.546 --> 00:02:04.641
and decode the genetics of individuals.

00:02:05.046 --> 00:02:07.109
Now, before that technique,

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:09.378
we were never ever certain about,

00:02:09.402 --> 00:02:12.245
100 percent, who the parents
of baby birds were.

00:02:12.744 --> 00:02:14.482
All we had were our field notes.

00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:17.164
And we would know
which adults lived in a nest

00:02:17.188 --> 00:02:19.323
and which ones fed the baby birds.

00:02:20.085 --> 00:02:25.704
Well, come to find out,
study after study kept coming in

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:29.286
and we found so much
evidence of infidelity --

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.658
