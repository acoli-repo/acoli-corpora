Now, around the time that this song
was in heavy rotation,

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:35.974
biologists were in deep discussion
about whether bird species,

00:01:35.998 --> 00:01:41.246
notably songbirds and waterfowl
were actually monogamous or not.

00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:45.117
See, for decades,
generations of science students

00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:49.131
were taught that well over 90 percent
of the bird species were monogamous.

00:01:49.657 --> 00:01:52.723
A male and female
mating faithfully for life.

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:55.672
That was until the late 1980s,

00:01:55.696 --> 00:01:58.490
when a new laboratory technique
came on the scene,

00:01:58.514 --> 00:02:02.522
which could copy DNA
from a small tissue or fluid sample
