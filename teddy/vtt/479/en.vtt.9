Who thinks it's wrong because I was
splitting and cohitting that.

00:04:30.754 --> 00:04:33.785
Well if you do, that's OPP"

00:04:34.238 --> 00:04:35.777
Actually, that's EPC

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.572
Which is the abbreviation
for extra-pair copulation.

00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:42.888
(Laughter)

00:04:42.912 --> 00:04:47.720
Now, we define extra-pair copulation
as the mating outside of a pair bond.

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:50.434
And just like we were
discovering via science,

00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:54.085
it can lead to babies
that don't belong to the male partner.

00:04:54.109 --> 00:04:55.264
Alright?

00:04:55.288 --> 00:04:58.942
Now, I first learned
about EPCs years later,

00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:02.029
after all the science news broke
while I was in graduate school.
