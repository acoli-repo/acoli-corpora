That's because I was either talking
to people who looked and sounded like me,

00:06:31.561 --> 00:06:34.967
or at the very least, you know,
listened to some of the same songs.

00:06:34.991 --> 00:06:37.791
We were sharing a common cultural lexicon.

00:06:38.346 --> 00:06:42.768
And with that lexicon, I was able
to bring new science terms to them,

00:06:42.792 --> 00:06:48.653
and together, we were sharing a new
comprehension of science for the culture.

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:53.745
Now, hip-hop song references

00:06:53.769 --> 00:06:59.880
are a really good tool for teaching
content to students from hip-hop culture

00:06:59.904 --> 00:07:01.333
or urban communities.
