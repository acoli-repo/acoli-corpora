00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:32.783
The situation where we know
the male and female pair together

00:03:32.807 --> 00:03:35.355
and all the babies
belong to both partners?

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.346
We call that "genetic monogamy."

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.815
And we now recognize
that it only holds true

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:43.966
for about 14 percent
of the songbird species,

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.070
which we were very certain
were truly monogamous.

00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:49.569
And with this reclassification,

00:03:49.593 --> 00:03:52.343
we realized that in a lot
of those field observations

00:03:52.367 --> 00:03:55.481
where we saw a male and female
sharing a nest,

00:03:55.505 --> 00:04:00.021
comaintaining a territory,
even provisioning offspring together,
