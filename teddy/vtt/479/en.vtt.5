00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.658
(Laughter)

00:02:30.682 --> 00:02:32.048
among bird species,

00:02:32.072 --> 00:02:33.463
particularly these songbirds

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:36.075
that we thought
were the pinnacle of monogamy.

00:02:36.445 --> 00:02:39.783
It would have made Maury Povich
jealous for the ratings.

00:02:39.807 --> 00:02:42.180
(Laughter)

00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:45.831
It rocked biology and ornithology so hard,

00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:50.053
we had to modify and expand
the entire definition of monogamy.

00:02:50.974 --> 00:02:54.657
Now, it was so bad
that this was the headline

00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:57.172
of the "New York Times" science section,

00:02:57.196 --> 00:02:58.958
August, 1990.

00:02:59.427 --> 00:03:02.381
"Mating for Life?
It's not for the Birds or the Bees."
