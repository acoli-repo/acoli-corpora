Caitlin Quattromani: The election
of 2016 felt different.

00:00:04.578 --> 00:00:07.601
Political conversations
with our family and friends

00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:09.411
uncovered a level of polarization

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:12.029
that many of us had not
previously experienced.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.193
People who we always thought
were reasonable and intelligent

00:00:16.217 --> 00:00:17.802
seemed like strangers.

00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:20.485
We said to ourselves,
"How could you think that?

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.381
I thought you were smart."

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:25.798
Lauran Arledge: Caitlin and I met
in the summer of 2011,

00:00:25.822 --> 00:00:27.712
and we bonded around being working moms

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:30.802
and trying to keep
our very energetic boys busy.
