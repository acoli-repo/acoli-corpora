00:02:58.237 --> 00:03:02.207
And then see how it disperses
this other group, who are teenagers,

00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:05.345
with the threat of an autonomously
issued injunction.

00:03:06.387 --> 00:03:09.520
And then there's this giant
floating disc called Madison.

00:03:10.203 --> 00:03:12.423
Its glaring presence is so overpowering,

00:03:12.447 --> 00:03:14.600
I can't help but stare at it.

00:03:15.242 --> 00:03:17.243
But if feels like each time I look at it,

00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:19.081
it knows a little more about me --

00:03:19.914 --> 00:03:23.079
like it keeps flashing all these
Brianair adverts at me,

00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:25.447
as if it knows about
the holiday I'm planning.

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:30.206
I'm not sure if I find this
mildly entertaining
