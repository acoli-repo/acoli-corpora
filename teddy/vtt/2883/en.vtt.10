You know you'll wake up
in the morning feeling awful,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.472
but you justify it by saying,

00:05:02.496 --> 00:05:04.999
"The other me in the future
will deal with that."

00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:07.475
But as we find out in the morning,

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:09.464
that future "you" is you.

00:05:10.454 --> 00:05:13.651
When I was growing up in India
in the late '70s and early '80s,

00:05:13.675 --> 00:05:14.826
there was a feeling

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.837
that the future both needed to
and could actually be planned.

00:05:18.343 --> 00:05:21.603
I remember my parents had to plan
for some of the simplest things.

00:05:21.627 --> 00:05:23.656
When they wanted a telephone in our house,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.990
they needed to order it and then wait --

00:05:26.014 --> 00:05:29.261
wait for nearly five years before
it got installed in our house.

00:05:29.285 --> 00:05:30.319
