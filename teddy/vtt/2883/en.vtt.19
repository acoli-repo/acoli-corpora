00:09:26.051 --> 00:09:30.234
when Arnold was asked to submit
a saliva sample in this spit kit

00:09:30.258 --> 00:09:31.816
to the NHI --

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.790
the UK's National Health
Insurance service.

00:09:35.289 --> 00:09:38.209
When Arnold received
his health insurance bill,

00:09:38.233 --> 00:09:39.945
he was shocked and scared

00:09:39.969 --> 00:09:42.351
to see that his premiums
had gone through the roof,

00:09:42.375 --> 00:09:45.349
beyond anything he or his family
could ever afford.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.651
The state's algorithm had scanned
his genetic data

00:09:48.675 --> 00:09:52.683
and found the risk of a chronic health
condition lurking in his DNA.

00:09:53.135 --> 00:09:56.499
And so Arnold had to start paying
toward the potential costs

00:09:56.523 --> 00:09:58.199
of that future disease --

00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:00.406
potential future disease from today.
