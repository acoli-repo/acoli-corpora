00:00:28.263 --> 00:00:31.427
a machine that makes you rich
by trading your genetic data;

00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:33.498
a lamp powered by sugar;

00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:35.926
a computer for growing food.

00:00:36.573 --> 00:00:40.964
OK, so I don't actually travel
to different futures -- yet.

00:00:40.988 --> 00:00:43.927
But my husband Jon and I spend
a lot of time thinking

00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:47.641
and creating visions
of different futures in our studio.

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:50.857
We are constantly looking out
for weak signals,

00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:53.255
those murmurs of future potential.

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:57.352
Then we trace those threads of potential
out into the future, asking:

00:00:57.963 --> 00:01:00.498
What might it feel like
to live in this future?
