00:00:57.963 --> 00:01:00.498
What might it feel like
to live in this future?

00:01:01.068 --> 00:01:03.903
What might we see, hear and even breathe?

00:01:05.157 --> 00:01:09.606
Then we run experiments,
build prototypes, make objects,

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.660
bringing aspects of these futures to life,

00:01:11.684 --> 00:01:13.996
making them concrete and tangible

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.774
so you can really feel the impact
of those future possibilities

00:01:18.798 --> 00:01:19.965
here and now.

00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:23.737
But this work is not about predictions.

00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:25.768
It's about creating tools --

00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:29.256
tools that can help connect
our present and our future selves

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.685
so we become active participants
in creating a future we want --
