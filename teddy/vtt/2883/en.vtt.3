00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.685
so we become active participants
in creating a future we want --

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:35.565
a future that works for all.

00:01:36.758 --> 00:01:38.573
So how do we go about doing this?

00:01:39.143 --> 00:01:42.487
For a recent project called Drone Aviary,

00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:44.049
we were interested in exploring

00:01:44.073 --> 00:01:47.040
what it would mean to live
with drones in our cities.

00:01:47.064 --> 00:01:49.897
Drones that have the power
to see things we can't,

00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:51.673
to go places we can't

00:01:51.697 --> 00:01:53.896
and to do so with increasing autonomy.

00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:56.324
But to understand the technology,

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:58.217
getting our hands dirty was crucial.

00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:01.482
So we built several different
drones in our studio.
