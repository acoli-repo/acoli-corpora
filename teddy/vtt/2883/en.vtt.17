00:08:29.875 --> 00:08:32.966
the technology of gathering
and using people's genetic data

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.849
to create personalized medicine.

00:08:35.268 --> 00:08:36.646
We were asking:

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:40.394
What are some of the unintended
consequences of linking our genetics

00:08:40.418 --> 00:08:41.579
to health care?

00:08:43.175 --> 00:08:45.441
To explore this question further,

00:08:45.465 --> 00:08:47.357
we created a fictional lawsuit,

00:08:47.914 --> 00:08:52.300
and brought it to life through 31 pieces
of carefully crafted evidence.

00:08:52.783 --> 00:08:55.871
So we built an illegal genetic clinic,

00:08:55.895 --> 00:08:59.078
a DIY carbon dioxide incubator,

00:08:59.102 --> 00:09:01.438
and even bought frozen mice on eBay.
