00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:03.611
I visit the future for a living.

00:00:04.265 --> 00:00:05.891
Not just one future,

00:00:05.915 --> 00:00:08.161
but many possible futures,

00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:12.304
bringing back evidences from those futures
for you to experience today.

00:00:13.197 --> 00:00:15.420
Like an archaeologist of the future.

00:00:16.432 --> 00:00:19.164
Over the years, my many journeys
have brought back things

00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:22.213
like a new species
of synthetically engineered bees;

00:00:25.052 --> 00:00:27.435
a book named, "Pets as Protein;"

00:00:28.263 --> 00:00:31.427
a machine that makes you rich
by trading your genetic data;
