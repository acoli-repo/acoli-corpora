(Laughter)

00:05:30.343 --> 00:05:33.841
And then if they wanted to call
my grandparents who lived in another city,

00:05:33.865 --> 00:05:36.393
they needed to book
something called a "trunk call,"

00:05:36.417 --> 00:05:38.677
and then wait again,
for hours or even days.

00:05:39.298 --> 00:05:42.235
And then abruptly, the phone
would ring at two in the morning,

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.509
and all of us would jump out of our beds
and gather round the phone,

00:05:45.533 --> 00:05:47.848
shrieking into it,
discussing general well-being

00:05:47.872 --> 00:05:49.205
at two in the morning.

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.009
Today it can feel like things
are happening too fast --

00:05:53.033 --> 00:05:55.288
so fast, that it can
become really difficult

00:05:55.312 --> 00:05:58.269
for us to form an understanding
of our place in history.

00:05:58.293 --> 00:06:01.720
It creates an overwhelming sense
of uncertainty and anxiety,
