00:06:58.387 --> 00:07:01.707
As I was excitably taking a group
of government officials

00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:03.268
and members of energy companies

00:07:03.292 --> 00:07:05.823
through one sustainable
future on our model,

00:07:05.847 --> 00:07:07.577
one of the participants told me,

00:07:08.122 --> 00:07:11.229
"I cannot imagine that in the future
people will stop driving cars

00:07:11.253 --> 00:07:13.051
and start using public transport."

00:07:13.916 --> 00:07:15.076
And then he said,

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.706
"There's no way I can tell my own son
to stop driving his car."

00:07:19.927 --> 00:07:21.908
But we were prepared for this reaction.

00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:26.545
Working with scientists in a chemistry lab
in my home city in India,

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:28.744
we had created approximate samples

00:07:28.768 --> 00:07:33.518
of what the air would be like in 2030
if our behavior stays the same.
