00:12:58.567 --> 00:13:00.291
we have successfully grown tomatoes.

00:13:01.254 --> 00:13:04.381
But we'll need more food than what
we can grow in this small room.

00:13:04.705 --> 00:13:06.940
So what else could we forage
from the city?

00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:10.881
Insects? Pigeons? Foxes?

00:13:13.794 --> 00:13:16.363
Earlier, we brought back
air from the future.

00:13:16.387 --> 00:13:19.110
This time we are bringing
an entire room from the future,

00:13:19.134 --> 00:13:21.481
a room full of hope, tools and tactics

00:13:21.505 --> 00:13:24.640
to create positive action
in hostile conditions.

00:13:25.384 --> 00:13:26.975
Spending time in this room,

00:13:26.999 --> 00:13:29.062
a room that could be our own future home,

00:13:29.086 --> 00:13:32.648
makes the consequences
of climate change and food insecurity
