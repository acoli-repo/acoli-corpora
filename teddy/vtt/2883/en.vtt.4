00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:01.482
So we built several different
drones in our studio.

00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:04.610
We gave them names, functions
and then flew them --

00:02:05.395 --> 00:02:06.908
but not without difficulty.

00:02:07.413 --> 00:02:08.802
Things came loose,

00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:10.446
GPS signals glitched

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.882
and drones crashed.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.741
But it was through such experimentation

00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:18.940
that we could construct a very
concrete and very experiential slice

00:02:18.964 --> 00:02:20.587
of one possible future.

00:02:21.613 --> 00:02:23.688
So now, let's go to that future.

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:27.569
Let's imagine we are living in a city
with drones like this one.

00:02:28.196 --> 00:02:30.123
We call it The Nightwatchman.
