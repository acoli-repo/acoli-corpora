00:05:58.293 --> 00:06:01.720
It creates an overwhelming sense
of uncertainty and anxiety,

00:06:01.744 --> 00:06:04.786
and so, we let the future
just happen to us.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:08.027
We don't connect with that future "us."

00:06:08.528 --> 00:06:10.840
We treat our future selves as a stranger,

00:06:10.864 --> 00:06:12.832
and the future as a foreign land.

00:06:13.735 --> 00:06:14.920
It's not a foreign land;

00:06:14.944 --> 00:06:16.692
it's unfolding right in front of us,

00:06:16.716 --> 00:06:19.280
continually being shaped
by our actions today.

00:06:19.734 --> 00:06:21.224
We are that future,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.770
and so I believe fighting
for a future we want

00:06:24.794 --> 00:06:27.417
is more urgent and necessary
than ever before.

00:06:28.297 --> 00:06:29.762
We have learned in our work

00:06:29.786 --> 00:06:33.230
that one of the most powerful means
of effecting change
