00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:30.206
I'm not sure if I find this
mildly entertaining

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.042
or just entirely invasive.

00:03:33.684 --> 00:03:35.008
Back to the present.

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:37.834
In creating this future, we learned a lot.

00:03:38.352 --> 00:03:40.958
Not just about how these machines work,

00:03:40.982 --> 00:03:43.841
but what it would feel like
to live alongside them.

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.493
Whilst drones like Madison
and Nightwatchman,

00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:48.034
in these particular forms,

00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:49.599
are not real yet,

00:03:49.623 --> 00:03:53.580
most elements of a drone future
are in fact very real today.

00:03:54.264 --> 00:03:55.415
For instance,

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.753
facial recognition systems
are everywhere --

00:03:57.777 --> 00:04:00.187
in our phones, even in our thermostats
