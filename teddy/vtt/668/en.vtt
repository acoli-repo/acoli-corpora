00:00:00.782 --> 00:00:04.057
I'm in the business
of safeguarding secrets,

00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:06.253
and this includes your secrets.

00:00:07.206 --> 00:00:09.340
Cryptographers are
the first line of defense

00:00:09.364 --> 00:00:12.946
in an ongoing war that's been
raging for centuries:

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.233
a war between code makers

00:00:15.257 --> 00:00:16.509
and code breakers.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.124
And this is a war on information.

00:00:20.227 --> 00:00:23.711
The modern battlefield
for information is digital.

00:00:23.735 --> 00:00:25.897
And it wages across your phones,

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:27.097
your computers

00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:28.290
and the internet.

00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:34.278
Our job is to create systems that scramble
your emails and credit card numbers,
