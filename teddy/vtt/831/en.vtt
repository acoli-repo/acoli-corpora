00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm here to give you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
your recommended dietary allowance

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
of poetry.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And the way I'm going to do that

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is present to you

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
five animations

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
of five of my poems.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Because the mixing of those two media

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
is a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But when I was United States Poet Laureate --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and I love saying that.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
(Laughter)

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's a great way to start sentences.
