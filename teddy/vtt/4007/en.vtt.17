00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.080
But really, here's why.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.936
The longest longitudinal study
of humans ever conducted

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.135
is called the Harvard Grant Study.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.496
It found that professional
success in life,

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.096
which is what we want for our kids,

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.896
that professional success in life
comes from having done chores as a kid,

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.936
and the earlier you started, the better,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.336
that a roll-up-your-sleeves-
and-pitch-in mindset,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.736
a mindset that says,
there's some unpleasant work,

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.976
someone's got to do it,
it might as well be me,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.216
a mindset that says,

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.336
I will contribute my effort
to the betterment of the whole,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.416
that that's what gets you ahead
in the workplace.
