they might end up with a longer
childhood résumé when we help --

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.496
what I'm saying is that all of this

to their sense of self.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.016
What I'm saying is,
we should be less concerned

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.856
with the specific set of colleges

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.096
they might be able
to apply to or might get into

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:53.016
and far more concerned that they have
the habits, the mindset, the skill set,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.976
the wellness, to be successful
wherever they go.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.216
What I'm saying is,

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.816
our kids need us to be a little
less obsessed with grades and scores
