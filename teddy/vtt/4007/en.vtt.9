00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.376
They're a little old before their time,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.416
wishing the grown-ups in their lives
had said, "What you've done is enough,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.416
this effort you've put forth
in childhood is enough."

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.696
And they're withering now
under high rates of anxiety and depression

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.936
and some of them are wondering,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.320
will this life ever turn out
to have been worth it?

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.536
Well, we parents,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.936
we parents are pretty sure
it's all worth it.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.176
We seem to behave --

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.936
it's like we literally think
they will have no future

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.656
if they don't get into one of these
tiny set of colleges or careers
