00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.296
when we see our child
for the first time in a few hours.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.256
And then we have to say,

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.480
"How was your day?

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.656
What did you like about today?"

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.416
And when your teenage daughter
says, "Lunch," like mine did,

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.496
and I want to hear about the math test,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.936
not lunch,

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.976
you have to still
take an interest in lunch.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.176
You gotta say, "What was great
about lunch today?"

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.576
They need to know
they matter to us as humans,

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.200
not because of their GPA.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.856
All right, so you're thinking,
chores and love,
