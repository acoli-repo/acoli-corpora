that that's what gets you ahead
in the workplace.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.336
Now, we all know this. You know this.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.176
(Applause)

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.776
We all know this, and yet,
in the checklisted childhood,

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.576
we absolve our kids of doing
the work of chores around the house,

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.096
and then they end up
as young adults in the workplace

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.336
still waiting for a checklist,

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.816
but it doesn't exist,

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.136
and more importantly,
lacking the impulse, the instinct

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.376
to roll up their sleeves and pitch in

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.976
and look around and wonder,
how can I be useful to my colleagues?
