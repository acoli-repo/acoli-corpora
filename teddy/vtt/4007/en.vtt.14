00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.256
Hell no.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.496
(Laughter)

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.216
That is not what I'm saying.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.856
What I'm saying is, when we treat
grades and scores and accolades and awards

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.976
as the purpose of childhood,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.776
all in furtherance of some hoped-for
admission to a tiny number of colleges

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.776
or entrance to a small number of careers,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.176
that that's too narrow a definition
of success for our kids.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.736
And even though we might help them
achieve some short-term wins

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.976
by overhelping --

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.560
like they get a better grade
if we help them do their homework,
