00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.416
and so because so much is required,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.656
we think,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.896
well then, of course we parents
have to argue with every teacher

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.496
and principal and coach and referee

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.416
and act like our kid's concierge

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.680
and personal handler

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.696
and secretary.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.896
And then with our kids, our precious kids,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.056
we spend so much time nudging,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.496
cajoling, hinting, helping, haggling,
nagging as the case may be,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.376
to be sure they're not screwing up,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.896
not closing doors,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.416
not ruining their future,
