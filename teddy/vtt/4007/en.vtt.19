and look around and wonder,
how can I be useful to my colleagues?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.320
How can I anticipate a few steps ahead
to what my boss might need?

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.880
A second very important finding
from the Harvard Grant Study

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.680
said that happiness in life

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.576
comes from love,

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.456
not love of work,

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.680
love of humans:

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.840
our spouse, our partner,
our friends, our family.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.296
So childhood needs to teach
our kids how to love,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.296
and they can't love others
if they don't first love themselves,
