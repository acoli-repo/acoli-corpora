00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.336
that our approval, that our love,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.976
that their very worth,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.856
comes from A's.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.456
And then we walk alongside them

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.176
and offer clucking praise like a trainer
at the Westminster Dog Show --

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.416
(Laughter)

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.736
coaxing them to just jump a little higher
and soar a little farther,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.816
day after day after day.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.576
And when they get to high school,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.496
they don't say, "Well, what might I
be interested in studying

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.776
or doing as an activity?"

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.496
They go to counselors and they say,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.096
"What do I need to do
to get into the right college?"
