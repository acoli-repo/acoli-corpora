00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.296
is a make-or-break moment
for this future we have in mind for them,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.256
and we absolve them
of helping out around the house,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.656
and we even absolve them
of getting enough sleep

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.576
as long as they're checking off
the items on their checklist.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.416
And in the checklisted childhood,
we say we just want them to be happy,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.496
but when they come home from school,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.656
what we ask about all too often first

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.736
is their homework and their grades.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.776
And they see in our faces

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.336
that our approval, that our love,
