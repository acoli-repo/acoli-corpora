00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.576
and it's my job to provide
a nourishing environment,

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.976
to strengthen them through chores

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.296
and to love them so they can
love others and receive love

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.416
and the college, the major, the career,

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.136
that's up to them.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.816
My job is not to make them become
what I would have them become,

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.640
but to support them
in becoming their glorious selves.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.616
Thank you.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:03.070
