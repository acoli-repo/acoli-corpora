00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.016
if you have the courage
to really look at it,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.016
you'll see that not only do our kids
think their worth comes

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.736
from grades and scores,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.656
but that when we live right up inside
their precious developing minds

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.256
all the time, like our very own version
of the movie "Being John Malkovich,"

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.216

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.456
"Hey kid, I don't think you can actually
achieve any of this without me."

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.136
And so with our overhelp,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.696
our overprotection
and overdirection and hand-holding,

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.736
we deprive our kids
of the chance to build self-efficacy,
