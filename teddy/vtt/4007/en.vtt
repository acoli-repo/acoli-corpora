You know, I didn't set out
to be a parenting expert.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.280
In fact, I'm not very interested
in parenting, per Se.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.016
It's just that there's a certain style
of parenting these days

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.216
that is kind of messing up kids,

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:21.296
impeding their chances
to develop into theirselves.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.536
There's a certain style
of parenting these days

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.896
that's getting in the way.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.536
I guess what I'm saying is,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.616
we spend a lot of time
being very concerned

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.296
about parents who aren't involved enough
in the lives of their kids
