00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.736
we deprive our kids
of the chance to build self-efficacy,

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.456
which is a really fundamental tenet
of the human psyche,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.096
far more important
than that self-esteem they get

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.520
every time we applaud.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:15.296
Self-efficacy is built when one sees
that one's own actions lead to outcomes,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.536
not --

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.776
There you go.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.640
(Applause)

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.376
Not one's parents'
actions on one's behalf,

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.176
but when one's own actions
lead to outcomes.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.696
So simply put,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.056
if our children are to develop
self-efficacy, and they must,
