00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.056
if our children are to develop
self-efficacy, and they must,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.936
then they have to do a whole lot more
of the thinking, planning, deciding,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.536
doing, hoping, coping, trial and error,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.696
dreaming and experiencing of life

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.360
for themselves.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.776
Now, am I saying

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.136
every kid is hard-working and motivated

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.336
and doesn't need a parent's involvement
or interest in their lives,

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.240
and we should just back off and let go?
