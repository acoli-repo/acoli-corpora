00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.376
When we raise kids this way,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.096
and I'll say we,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.896
because Lord knows,
in raising my two teenagers,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.656
I've had these tendencies myself,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.560
our kids end up leading
a kind of checklisted childhood.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.896
And here's what the checklisted
childhood looks like.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.816
We keep them safe and sound

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.520
and fed and watered,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.216
and then we want to be sure
they go to the right schools,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.816
that they're in the right classes
at the right schools,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.460
and that they get the right grades
in the right classes in the right schools.
