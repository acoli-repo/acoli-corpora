00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.296
and they can't love others
if they don't first love themselves,

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.296
and they won't love themselves
if we can't offer them unconditional love.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.280
(Applause)

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.800
Right.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.016
And so,

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.296
instead of being obsessed
with grades and scores

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.216
when our precious offspring
come home from school,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.736
or we come home from work,

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.536
we need to close our technology,
put away our phones,

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.936
and look them in the eye

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.136
and let them see
the joy that fills our faces

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.296
when we see our child
for the first time in a few hours.
