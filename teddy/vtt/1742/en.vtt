00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.561
I want to talk to you about,

00:00:03.561 --> 00:00:07.122
or share with you, a
breakthrough new approach

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:10.464
for managing items of
inventory inside of a warehouse.

00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:13.022
We're talking about a pick,
pack and ship setting here.

00:00:13.022 --> 00:00:15.845
So as a hint,

00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:19.998
this solution involves
hundreds of mobile robots,

00:00:19.998 --> 00:00:22.422
sometimes thousands
of mobile robots,

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.020
moving around a warehouse.
And I'll get to the solution.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.240
But for a moment, just think

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.766
about the last time that
you ordered something online.

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.830
You were sitting
on your couch
