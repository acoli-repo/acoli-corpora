This is a tiny joke -- E-ZR pass. One letter makes an idea.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
This is a big joke.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
This is the audition for "King Kong."

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
(Laughter)

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
People always ask me, where do you get your ideas, how do your ideas come?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Truth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
in the middle of the night, this came to me like a Xerox -- all I had to do was write it down.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
It was perfectly clear. I didn't do any thinking about it.
