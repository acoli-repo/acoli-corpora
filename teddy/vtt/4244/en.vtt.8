It's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
so I think that’s a case for serious play.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
This is emblematic of it -- this is wing dining,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over France in the 20s,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
dining on the wing of a plane. You can't see it very well here,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
but that's Hemingway reading some pages from his new novel

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
to Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford until the slipstream blows him away.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000
This is tank polo in the South Hamptons.
