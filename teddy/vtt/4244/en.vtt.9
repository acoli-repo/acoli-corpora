This is tank polo in the South Hamptons.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody. I do a lot of that.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I think it adds a huge amount.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Those, for example, are Mark IV British tanks from 1916.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
They had two machine guns and a cannon,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
and they had 90 horsepower Ricardo engines.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
They went five miles an hour and inside it was 105 degrees in the pitch dark.
