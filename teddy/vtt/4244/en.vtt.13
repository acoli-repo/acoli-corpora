Shamelessly cheap is something, I think -- this will wake you up.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It has no meaning, just -- Desoto discovers the Mississippi,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and it's a Desoto discovering the Mississippi.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I did that as a quick back page -- I had like four hours to do a back page

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
for an issue of the Lampoon, and I did that,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and I thought, "Well, I'm ashamed. I hope nobody knows it."

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
People wrote in for reprints of that thing.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Urban absurdism -- that's what the New Yorker really calls for.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers.
