This is the '58 Bulgemobile: so new, they make tomorrow look like yesterday.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
This is a chain gang of guys admiring the car.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
That's from a whole catalog -- it's 18 pages or so --

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
ran back in the days of the Lampoon, where I cut my teeth.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Techno-archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened --

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
for good reason, usually.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The zeppelin -- this was from a brochure about the zeppelin

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
based, obviously, on the Hindenburg.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
But the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man.
