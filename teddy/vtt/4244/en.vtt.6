00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So the Hindenburg wasn't, you know, it was inevitable it was going to go.

This is auto-gyro jousting in Malibu in the 30s.

The auto-gyro couldn't wait for the invention of the helicopter,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
It's the only Spanish innovation, technologically, of the 20th century, by the way.
