I called it "Serious Nonsense" because on the serious side,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
from when I was a kid. I copied it and I never unlearned it --

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
it's the only style I know. And it's very kind of staid and formal.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And meanwhile, I use nonsense, as you can see.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is a Scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor --

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
which you can't see there.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This was one of a series called "Zany Afternoons," which became a book.
