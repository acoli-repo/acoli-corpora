This is a very un-PC cover. Not in New York.

I couldn't resist, and I got a nasty email from some environmental group saying,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
"This is too serious and solemn to make fun of. You should be ashamed,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
please apologize on our website."

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Haven't got around to it yet but -- I may.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
This is the word side of my brain.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
(Laughter)

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I love the word "Eurotrash."

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
