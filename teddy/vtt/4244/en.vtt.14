I try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I've done about 40 of them, and I'd say 30 of them are based on that concept.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
I was driving down 7th Avenue one night at 3 a.m.,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and this steam pouring out of the street, and I thought, "What causes that?" And that --

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
who’s to say?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
The Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan in New York -- it's a very somber place.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I thought I could jazz it up a bit, have a little fun with it.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
This is a very un-PC cover. Not in New York.
