00:00:00.418 --> 00:00:03.156
When my father and I started a company

00:00:03.156 --> 00:00:06.432
to 3D print human tissues and organs,

00:00:06.432 --> 00:00:09.788
some people initially thought we were a little crazy.

00:00:09.788 --> 00:00:12.479
But since then, much progress has been made,

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.686
both in our lab and other labs around the world.

00:00:15.686 --> 00:00:18.953
And given this, we started getting questions like,

00:00:18.953 --> 00:00:21.680
"If you can grow human body parts,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.060
can you also grow animal products like meat and leather?"

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.502
When someone first suggested this to me,

00:00:29.502 --> 00:00:32.456
quite frankly I thought they were a little crazy,
