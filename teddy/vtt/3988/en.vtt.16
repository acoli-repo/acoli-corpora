00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:02.905
It may be that we can improve
nonviolent action

00:08:02.929 --> 00:08:06.180
to a point where it is increasingly
used in place of war.

00:08:06.838 --> 00:08:10.913
Violence as a tool of conflict
could then be abandoned

00:08:10.937 --> 00:08:13.344
in the same way that bows and arrows were,

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:16.712
because we have replaced them
with weapons that are more effective.

00:08:17.427 --> 00:08:22.306
With human innovation, we can make
nonviolent struggle more powerful

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.954
than the newest and latest
technologies of war.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:30.473
The greatest hope for humanity
lies not in condemning violence
