00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:32.163
In fact, most of the rights
that we have today in this country --

00:01:32.187 --> 00:01:33.338
as women,

00:01:33.362 --> 00:01:34.513
as minorities,

00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:35.885
as workers,

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.475
as people of different sexual orientations

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:40.957
and citizens concerned
with the environment --

00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:42.838
these rights weren't handed to us.

00:01:43.226 --> 00:01:45.386
They were won by people
who fought for them

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.232
and who sacrificed for them.

00:01:47.256 --> 00:01:49.776
But because we haven't learned
from this history,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.841
nonviolent struggle as a technique
is widely misunderstood.

00:01:54.488 --> 00:01:57.610
I met recently with a group
of Ethiopian activists,

00:01:57.634 --> 00:02:00.784
and they told me something
that I hear a lot.
