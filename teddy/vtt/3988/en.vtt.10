00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:01.252
in nearly every country in the world.

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:02.869
For example,

00:05:02.893 --> 00:05:05.450
recently a group of activists in Uganda

00:05:05.474 --> 00:05:07.607
released a crate of pigs in the streets.

00:05:08.096 --> 00:05:11.534
You can see here that the police
are confused about what to do with them.

00:05:11.558 --> 00:05:12.594
(Laughter)

00:05:12.618 --> 00:05:15.234
The pigs were painted
the color of the ruling party.

00:05:15.617 --> 00:05:17.895
One pig was even wearing a hat,

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.799
a hat that people recognized.

00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:21.384
(Laughter)

00:05:22.264 --> 00:05:25.633
Activists around the world
are getting better at grabbing headlines,

00:05:25.657 --> 00:05:28.320
but these isolated actions do very little

00:05:28.344 --> 00:05:30.527
if they're not part of a larger strategy.
