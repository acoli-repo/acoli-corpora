But what most people don't know

00:06:31.086 --> 00:06:34.600
is that people have stood up to ISIS
using nonviolent action.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.930
When ISIS captured Mosul in June 2014,

00:06:38.954 --> 00:06:42.685
they announced that they were putting
in place a new public school curriculum,

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:44.839
based on their own extremist ideology.

00:06:45.556 --> 00:06:47.096
But on the first day of school,

00:06:47.672 --> 00:06:49.358
not a single child showed up.

00:06:50.222 --> 00:06:53.044
Parents simply refused to send them.

00:06:53.068 --> 00:06:56.260
They told journalists they would rather
homeschool their children

00:06:56.284 --> 00:06:57.840
than to have them brainwashed.

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:01.698
This is an example
of just one act of defiance
