00:01:57.634 --> 00:02:00.784
and they told me something
that I hear a lot.

00:02:00.808 --> 00:02:03.134
They said they'd already
tried nonviolent action,

00:02:03.158 --> 00:02:04.576
and it hadn't worked.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.936
Years ago they held a protest.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.668
The government arrested everyone,
and that was the end of that.

00:02:11.302 --> 00:02:15.262
The idea that nonviolent struggle
is equivalent to street protests

00:02:15.286 --> 00:02:16.684
is a real problem.

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:21.604
Because although protests can be a great
way to show that people want change,

00:02:21.628 --> 00:02:24.498
on their own, they don't
actually create change --

00:02:24.522 --> 00:02:26.490
at least change that is fundamental.

00:02:26.514 --> 00:02:27.702
(Laughter)

00:02:27.726 --> 00:02:30.835
Powerful opponents are not going to give
people what they want
