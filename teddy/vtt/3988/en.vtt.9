00:04:28.793 --> 00:04:30.724
So they organized a general strike,

00:04:30.748 --> 00:04:33.395
in which people throughout
the country refused to work.

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.821
In Guatemala City alone,

00:04:34.845 --> 00:04:37.794
over 400 businesses
and schools shut their doors.

00:04:38.367 --> 00:04:39.548
Meanwhile,

00:04:39.572 --> 00:04:42.201
farmers throughout the country
blocked major roads.

00:04:42.225 --> 00:04:43.703
Within five days,

00:04:43.727 --> 00:04:44.904
the president,

00:04:44.928 --> 00:04:47.651
along with dozens of other
government officials,

00:04:47.675 --> 00:04:49.144
resigned already.

00:04:49.168 --> 00:04:53.451
(Applause)

00:04:53.475 --> 00:04:55.078
I've been greatly inspired

00:04:55.102 --> 00:04:59.005
by the creativity and bravery
of people using nonviolent action

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:01.252
in nearly every country in the world.
