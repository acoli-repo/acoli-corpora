War has been a part of my life
since I can remember.

00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:08.955
I was born in Afghanistan,
just six months after the Soviets invaded,

00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:12.807
and even though I was too young
to understand what was happening,

00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:16.152
I had a deep sense of the suffering
and the fear around me.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:22.341
Those early experiences had a major impact
on how I now think about war and conflict.

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:26.487
I learned that when people
have a fundamental issue at stake,

00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:27.763
for most of them,

00:00:27.787 --> 00:00:29.419
giving in is not an option.

00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:31.583
