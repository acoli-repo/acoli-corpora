00:05:58.103 --> 00:06:01.349
and some of our best minds
dedicated to understanding

00:06:01.373 --> 00:06:03.098
and improving how it works.

00:06:03.608 --> 00:06:08.190
Meanwhile, nonviolent struggle
is rarely systematically studied,

00:06:08.214 --> 00:06:10.224
and even though the number is growing,

00:06:10.248 --> 00:06:14.033
there are still only a few dozen people
in the world who are teaching it.

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:16.142
This is dangerous,

00:06:16.166 --> 00:06:20.334
because we now know that our old
approaches of dealing with conflict

00:06:20.358 --> 00:06:23.776
are not adequate for the new
challenges that we're facing.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.883
The US government recently admitted

00:06:25.907 --> 00:06:28.820
that it's in a stalemate
in its war against ISIS.

00:06:29.318 --> 00:06:31.062
But what most people don't know
