00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:01.698
This is an example
of just one act of defiance

00:07:01.722 --> 00:07:03.077
in just one city.

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:05.104
But what if it was coordinated

00:07:05.128 --> 00:07:07.750
with the dozens of other acts
of nonviolent resistance

00:07:07.774 --> 00:07:09.829
that have taken place against ISIS?

00:07:09.853 --> 00:07:13.288
What if the parents' boycott
was part of a larger strategy

00:07:13.312 --> 00:07:17.538
to identify and cut off the resources
that ISIS needs to function;

00:07:18.157 --> 00:07:20.653
the skilled labor needed to produce food;

00:07:20.677 --> 00:07:24.266
the engineers needed
to extract and refine oil;

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.883
the media infrastructure
and communications networks

00:07:26.907 --> 00:07:28.880
and transportation systems,

00:07:28.904 --> 00:07:31.408
and the local businesses
that ISIS relies on?
