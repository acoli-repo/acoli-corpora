00:07:28.904 --> 00:07:31.408
and the local businesses
that ISIS relies on?

00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:35.032
It may be difficult
to imagine defeating ISIS

00:07:35.056 --> 00:07:36.967
with action that is nonviolent.

00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:40.619
But it's time we challenge
the way we think about conflict

00:07:40.643 --> 00:07:43.058
and the choices we have in facing it.

00:07:44.194 --> 00:07:46.465
Here's an idea worth spreading:

00:07:46.489 --> 00:07:49.644
let's learn more about where
nonviolent action has worked

00:07:49.668 --> 00:07:52.185
and how we can make it more powerful,

00:07:52.209 --> 00:07:55.253
just like we do with other
systems and technologies

00:07:55.277 --> 00:07:58.836
that are constantly being refined
to better meet human needs.

00:07:59.446 --> 00:08:02.905
It may be that we can improve
nonviolent action
