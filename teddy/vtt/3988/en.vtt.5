00:02:27.726 --> 00:02:30.835
Powerful opponents are not going to give
people what they want

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.791
just because they asked nicely ...

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.396
or even not so nicely.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.553
(Laughter)

00:02:36.577 --> 00:02:39.621
Nonviolent struggle works
by destroying an opponent,

00:02:40.018 --> 00:02:41.330
not physically,

00:02:41.354 --> 00:02:45.764
but by identifying the institutions
that an opponent needs to survive,

00:02:45.788 --> 00:02:47.970
and then denying them
those sources of power.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.234
Nonviolent activists
can neutralize the military

00:02:51.258 --> 00:02:53.482
by causing soldiers to defect.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:56.781
They can disrupt the economy
through strikes and boycotts.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.492
And they can challenge
government propaganda

00:02:59.516 --> 00:03:01.382
by creating alternative media.
