My name's Seth Priebatsch.
I'm the chief ninja of SCVNGR.

00:00:03.858 --> 00:00:05.326
I'm a proud Princeton dropout.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.404
Also proud to have relocated
here to Boston,

00:00:07.428 --> 00:00:08.975
where I actually grew up.

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:10.779
(Applause) Yeah, Boston.

00:00:10.803 --> 00:00:14.105
Easy wins, I should just name
the counties that we've got around here.

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.320
I'm also fairly determined
to try and build

00:00:16.344 --> 00:00:17.933
a game layer on top of the world.

00:00:17.957 --> 00:00:20.617
This is sort of a new concept
and it's really important,

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:23.738
because while the last decade
was the decade of social,

00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:27.543
the decade where the framework in which
we connect with other people was built,

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:31.890
this next decade will be the decade
where the game framework is built,
