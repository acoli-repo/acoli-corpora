00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:31.229
just like our ancestors
who evolved their social cognitions

00:01:31.253 --> 00:01:33.298
telling stories around the campfire.

00:01:33.857 --> 00:01:36.201
And that's exactly what tools
should do, I think.

00:01:36.225 --> 00:01:37.704
They should extend our bodies.

00:01:37.728 --> 00:01:40.397
And I think computers today
are doing quite the opposite.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.167
Whether you're sending
an email to your wife

00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:45.213
or you're composing a symphony

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:46.841
or just consoling a friend,

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:49.211
you're doing it in pretty
much the same way.

00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:51.468
You're hunched over these rectangles,

00:01:51.492 --> 00:01:54.243
fumbling with buttons and menus
and more rectangles.

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.756
And I think this is the wrong way,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.208
I think we can start using
a much more natural machine.
