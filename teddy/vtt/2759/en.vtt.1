00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:31.635
and I was having this great conversation
with a fellow student

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:34.962
about the power of holograms
to one day replace computers.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.479
And just as we were getting
to the best part of the conversation,

00:00:38.503 --> 00:00:40.065
of course, his phone lights up.

00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:45.046
And he pulls it towards himself,
and he looks down and he starts typing.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.253
And then he forces his eyeballs
back up to mine and he goes,

00:00:48.277 --> 00:00:50.380
"Keep going. I'm with you."

00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:52.761
But of course his eyes were glazed over,

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:54.128
and the moment was dead.

00:00:54.964 --> 00:00:56.184
Meanwhile across the bar,

00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:58.492
I noticed another student
holding his phone,

00:00:58.516 --> 00:00:59.961
this time towards a group.

00:00:59.985 --> 00:01:02.745
He was swiping through
pictures on Instagram,
