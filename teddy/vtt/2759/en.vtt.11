And the principle we all revolve around

00:05:32.258 --> 00:05:35.266
is what's called the "Neural Path
of Least Resistance."

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.421
At every turn, we're connecting
the iOS of the brain with our brain

00:05:39.445 --> 00:05:41.831
on, for the first time, our brain's terms.

00:05:41.855 --> 00:05:46.247
In other words, we're trying to create
a zero learning-curve computer.

00:05:46.738 --> 00:05:50.073
We're building a system
that you've always known how to use.

00:05:50.097 --> 00:05:52.990
Here are the first three
design guidelines that we employ

00:05:53.014 --> 00:05:55.345
in this brand-new form of user experience.

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:58.763
First and foremost,
you are the operating system.

00:05:58.787 --> 00:06:01.494
Traditional file systems
are complex and abstract,
