00:03:58.227 --> 00:04:00.711
instead of the other way around.

00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:03.203
Now ...

00:04:03.227 --> 00:04:06.589
in the next few years, humanity's
going to go through a shift, I think.

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:09.826
We're going to start putting
an entire layer of digital information

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.285
on the real world.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.318
Just imagine for a moment

00:04:13.342 --> 00:04:15.602
what this could mean for storytellers,

00:04:15.626 --> 00:04:16.941
for painters,

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.123
for brain surgeons,

00:04:19.147 --> 00:04:20.964
for interior decorators

00:04:20.988 --> 00:04:23.099
and maybe for all of us here today.

00:04:23.544 --> 00:04:25.711
And what I think we need
to do as a community,

00:04:25.735 --> 00:04:27.727
is really try and make an effort

00:04:27.751 --> 00:04:30.642
to imagine how we can
create this new reality
