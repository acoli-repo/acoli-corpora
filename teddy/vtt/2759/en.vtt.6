Now if you're anything like me,
your mind is already reeling

00:03:02.906 --> 00:03:06.207
with the possibilities of what we can do
with this kind of technology,

00:03:06.231 --> 00:03:07.389
so let's look at a few.

00:03:07.413 --> 00:03:08.563
My mom is an architect,

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:10.492
so naturally the first thing I imagined

00:03:10.516 --> 00:03:12.997
was laying out a building in 3D space

00:03:13.021 --> 00:03:15.413
instead of having to use
these 2D floor plans.

00:03:15.437 --> 00:03:17.902
She's actually touching graphics right now

00:03:17.926 --> 00:03:19.703
and selecting an interior decor.

00:03:19.727 --> 00:03:23.091
This was all shot through a GoPro
through our very glasses.

00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:25.730
And this next use case
is very personal to me,

00:03:25.754 --> 00:03:29.168
it's Professor Adam Gazzaley's
glass brain project,
