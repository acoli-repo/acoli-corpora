As a neuroscience student,

00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:34.223
I would always fantasize

00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:39.686
about the ability to learn and memorize
these complex brain structures

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.877
with an actual machine,

00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:44.203
where I could touch and play
with the various brain structures.

00:03:44.535 --> 00:03:48.061
Now what you're seeing
is called augmented reality,

00:03:48.085 --> 00:03:51.036
but to me, it's part
of a much more important story --

00:03:51.512 --> 00:03:58.203
a story of how we can begin
to extend our bodies with digital devices,

00:03:58.227 --> 00:04:00.711
instead of the other way around.
