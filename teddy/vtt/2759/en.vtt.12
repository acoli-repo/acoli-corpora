Traditional file systems
are complex and abstract,

00:06:01.518 --> 00:06:04.109
and they take your brain
extra steps to decode them.

00:06:04.133 --> 00:06:06.938
We're going against the Neural Path
of Least Resistance.

00:06:06.962 --> 00:06:09.160
Meanwhile, in augmented reality,

00:06:09.184 --> 00:06:14.159
you can of course place
your holographic TED panel over here,

00:06:14.183 --> 00:06:17.734
and your holographic email
on the other side of the desk,

00:06:17.758 --> 00:06:23.581
and your spatial memory evolved just fine
to go ahead and retrieve them.

00:06:23.605 --> 00:06:26.633
You could put your holographic Tesla
that you're shopping for --

00:06:26.657 --> 00:06:30.162
or whatever model my legal team
told me to put in right before the show.
