He was swiping through
pictures on Instagram,

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.303
and these kids were laughing hysterically.

00:01:05.327 --> 00:01:08.846
And that dichotomy
between how crappy I was feeling

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.648
and how happy they were feeling
about the same technology,

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:13.050
really got me thinking.

00:01:13.074 --> 00:01:15.407
And the more I thought of it,
the more I realized

00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:19.203
it was clearly not the digital information
that was the bad guy here,

00:01:19.227 --> 00:01:22.934

that was separating me from my friend

00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.179
and that was binding those kids together.

00:01:25.608 --> 00:01:27.807
See, they were connected around something,

00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:31.229
just like our ancestors
who evolved their social cognitions
