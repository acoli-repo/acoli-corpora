00:06:59.487 --> 00:07:02.065
we're also going to understand
it much more deeply.

00:07:02.637 --> 00:07:04.299
Hence, touch to see.

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:06.718
But it's not enough
to experience things ourselves.

00:07:06.742 --> 00:07:08.969
We're inherently these social primates.

00:07:08.993 --> 00:07:11.105
And this leads me to our third guideline,

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:13.926
the holographic campfire
from our first story.

00:07:14.537 --> 00:07:16.451
Our mirror-neuron subsystem suggests

00:07:16.475 --> 00:07:20.023
that we can connect with each other
and with our work much better

00:07:20.047 --> 00:07:23.032
if we can see each other's
faces and hands in 3D.

00:07:23.056 --> 00:07:24.893
So if you look at the video behind me,

00:07:24.917 --> 00:07:29.226
you can see two Meta users
playing around with the same hologram,

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.965
making eye contact,
connected around this thing,
