00:06:26.657 --> 00:06:30.162
or whatever model my legal team
told me to put in right before the show.

00:06:30.186 --> 00:06:31.188
(Laughter)

00:06:31.212 --> 00:06:33.944
Perfect. And your brain knows
exactly how to get it back.

00:06:33.968 --> 00:06:37.216
The second interface guideline
we call "touch to see."

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.300
What do babies do when they see
something that grabs their interest?

00:06:42.712 --> 00:06:44.428
They try and reach out and touch it.

00:06:44.452 --> 00:06:47.519
And that's exactly how the natural
machine should work as well.

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:50.927
Turns out the visual system
gets a fundamental boost

00:06:50.951 --> 00:06:53.360
from a sense we call proprioception --

00:06:53.384 --> 00:06:55.629
that's the sense
of our body parts in space.

00:06:55.653 --> 00:06:59.463
So by touching our work directly,
we're not only going to control it better,

00:06:59.487 --> 00:07:02.065
we're also going to understand
it much more deeply.
