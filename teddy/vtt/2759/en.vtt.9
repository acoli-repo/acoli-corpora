00:04:27.751 --> 00:04:30.642
to imagine how we can
create this new reality

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:33.364
in a way that extends
the human experience,

00:04:33.388 --> 00:04:35.356
instead of gamifying our reality

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.443
or cluttering it with digital information.

00:04:37.467 --> 00:04:39.589
And that's what I'm very passionate about.

00:04:40.318 --> 00:04:42.479
Now, I want to tell you a little secret.

00:04:42.503 --> 00:04:43.670
In about five years --

00:04:43.694 --> 00:04:45.320
this is not the smallest device --

00:04:45.344 --> 00:04:46.512
in about five years,

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:49.464
these are all going to look like
strips of glass on our eyes

00:04:49.488 --> 00:04:50.807
that project holograms.

00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:54.736
And just like we don't care so much
about which phone we buy

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.181
in terms of the hardware -- we buy it
for the operating system --

00:04:58.205 --> 00:04:59.364
as a neuroscientist,

00:04:59.388 --> 00:05:03.431
I always dreamt of building
the iOS of the mind, if you will.
