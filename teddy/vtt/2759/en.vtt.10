I always dreamt of building
the iOS of the mind, if you will.

00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:07.417
And it's very, very important
that we get this right,

00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:09.735
because we might be living
inside of these things

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.447

interface out of infinity,

00:05:23.267 --> 00:05:25.947

our design guidelines,

00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:29.561
instead of letting a bunch of designers
fight it out in the boardroom.

00:05:29.585 --> 00:05:32.234
And the principle we all revolve around
