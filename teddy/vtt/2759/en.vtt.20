Chris Anderson: So help
me out on one thing,

00:10:00.796 --> 00:10:03.424
because there've been a few
augmented reality demos

00:10:03.448 --> 00:10:06.154
shown over the last year or so out there.

00:10:06.178 --> 00:10:08.587
And there's sometimes
a debate among technologists

00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:12.316
about, are we really seeing
the real thing on-screen?

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.080
There's this issue of field of view,

00:10:14.104 --> 00:10:17.570
that somehow the technology
is showing a broader view

00:10:17.594 --> 00:10:20.515
than you would actually see
wearing the glasses.

00:10:21.086 --> 00:10:22.809
Were we seeing the real deal there?

00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:24.246
MG: Absolutely the real deal.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.427
Not only that,

00:10:25.451 --> 00:10:28.788
we took extra measures to shoot it
with a GoPro through the actual lens

00:10:28.812 --> 00:10:30.865
in the various videos
that you've seen here.
