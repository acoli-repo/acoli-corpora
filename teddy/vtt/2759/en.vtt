Today's computers are so amazing

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.931
that we fail to notice
how terrible they really are.

00:00:10.172 --> 00:00:12.570
I'd like to talk to you today
about this problem,

00:00:12.594 --> 00:00:15.265
and how we can fix it with neuroscience.

00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:20.073
First, I'd like to take you back
to a frosty night in Harlem in 2011

00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:21.884
that had a profound impact on me.

00:00:22.437 --> 00:00:25.611
I was sitting in a dive bar
outside of Columbia University,

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.543
where I studied computer science
and neuroscience,

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:31.635
and I was having this great conversation
with a fellow student
