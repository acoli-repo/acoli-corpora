Around five years ago,

00:00:03.042 --> 00:00:05.434
it struck me that I was losing the ability

00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:07.958
to engage with people
who aren't like-minded.

00:00:08.917 --> 00:00:12.559
The idea of discussing hot-button issues
with my fellow Americans

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:14.976
was starting to give me more heartburn

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.125
than the times that I engaged
with suspected extremists overseas.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.351
It was starting to leave me feeling
more embittered and frustrated.

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:24.809
And so just like that,

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:26.643
I shifted my entire focus

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:29.101
from global national security threats

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:32.351
to trying to understand
what was causing this push
