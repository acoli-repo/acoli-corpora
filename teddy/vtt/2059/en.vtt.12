Can you imagine? From that stupid bacteria to us,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
with a microphone, with a computer, with an iPod: four billion years.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And we know, and especially Carolyn knows, that when the sun will implode,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
the earth will burn, explode, I don't know what,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and this is scheduled for four, four billion years?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Yes, she said, something like that. OK, that means we are at half of the story.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
