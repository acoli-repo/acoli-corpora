God is a trap. God is the answer when we don't know the answer.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.000
That means, when your brain is not enough big, when you don't understand,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
you go, "Ah, it's God, it's God." That's ridiculous.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
That's why -- jump, like that? No, don't jump.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Come back. Because, after, there is another trap.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
If you look like that, you look to the past,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
or you look inside if you are very flexible, inside yourself.
