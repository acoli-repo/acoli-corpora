From this to here, that, it's genius.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Ptolemy, Eratosthenes, Einstein, things like that.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Nobody's obliged to be a genius.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
It's better, but nobody.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Take care, in this training, to be a good mutant.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
There is some danger, there is some trap. One trap: the vertical.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Because at the vertical of us, if you look like that,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
"Ah! my God, there is God. Ah! God!"

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000
God is a trap. God is the answer when we don't know the answer.
