we completely miss the story.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Because every generation thinks we are the final one.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
We have a way to look at Earth like that, you know,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
"I am the man. The final man.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
You know, we mutate during four billion years before, but now, because it's me, we stop. Fin. (Laughter)

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
