forget design, even -- I'm sorry to say -- forget art.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Forget all that. There is priority; there is urgency.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
You must go back to fight, to battle.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
That's why I am here, to try to do it the best possible.
