I mean, yes, lemon squeezer, toilet brush, toothpick, beautiful toilet seats,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and why not -- a toothbrush?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I don't try to design the toothbrush.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I don't try to say, "Oh, that will be a beautiful object," or something like that.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That doesn't interest me.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Because there is different types of design.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The one, we can call it the cynical design,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that means the design invented by Raymond Loewy in the '50s,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.000
who said, what is ugly is a bad sale, la laideur se vend mal, which is terrible.
