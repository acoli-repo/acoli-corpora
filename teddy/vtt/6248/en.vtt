00:00:00.731 --> 00:00:03.066
So I'm a sports
and performance psychologist,

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.435
which means I get to work
with a lot of people

00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:06.770
like elite athletes,

00:00:06.803 --> 00:00:08.105
military professionals

00:00:08.138 --> 00:00:09.940
and top government agencies,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.110
whose career and safety
depend on peak performance.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.179
And I'll never forget
this one story a soldier told me

00:00:16.213 --> 00:00:18.715
about his time serving in Iraq.

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.217
It was around the early 2000s

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.389
when the United States had military
operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:00:25.422 --> 00:00:26.690
And during this time,

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.759
many locals were encouraged
to come forward

00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:31.028
and share information
about potential threats.
