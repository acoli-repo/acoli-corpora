When I was 10 years old,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.070
we traveled from Colorado
to New Jersey to visit relatives

00:00:07.104 --> 00:00:08.305
at Christmas time.

00:00:08.972 --> 00:00:11.241
We did a host of a variety of things.

00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:14.278
I actually got to see
the original cast in "The Wiz"

00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:16.246
and did a lot of sightseeing.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.950
But one of my favorite moments
was to stay up late at night

00:00:19.983 --> 00:00:22.052
and wait till everyone else
had gone to bed,

00:00:22.052 --> 00:00:24.621
and then I would sneak downstairs
to watch television.

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.760
A host of old movies
that I probably had no business watching,

00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:33.630
such as "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Oklahoma,"
