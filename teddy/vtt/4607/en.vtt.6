00:02:59.973 --> 00:03:01.334
Can you guys see that?

00:03:01.358 --> 00:03:04.110
Alright, so I'm going to go ahead
and turn this on.

00:03:06.833 --> 00:03:07.976
I'm going to plug it in.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.001
(Tuning sound)

00:03:09.025 --> 00:03:11.588
To me, this is the most beautiful
sound in the world.

00:03:11.612 --> 00:03:13.620
This is what your brain
is doing right now.

00:03:13.644 --> 00:03:16.576
You have 100 billion cells
making these raindrop-type noises.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.585
Let's take a look at what it looks like,

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.408
let's pull it up on the iPad screen.

00:03:20.432 --> 00:03:22.161
I plugged my iPad into here as well.

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:24.429
So remember we said
the axon looks like a spike.

00:03:24.453 --> 00:03:25.870
So we're going to take a look

00:03:25.894 --> 00:03:28.536
at what one of them
looks like in just a brief second.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.786
We're going to tap here,

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.515
so we can sort of average this guy.
