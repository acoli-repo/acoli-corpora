If you ever try to catch a cockroach,
it's hard because they can feel you coming

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.492
before you're even there,
they start running.

00:02:03.516 --> 00:02:06.285
These cells are zipping up
this information up to the brain

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:09.092
using those little axons
with electronic messages in there.

00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:11.698
We're going to record
by sticking a pin right in there.

00:02:11.722 --> 00:02:14.369
We need to take off the leg
of a cockroach --

00:02:14.393 --> 00:02:15.976
don't worry, they'll grow back --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.317
then we're going to put two pins in there.

00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:19.365
These are metal pins.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:23.020
One will pick up this electronic message,
this electric message is going by.

00:02:23.044 --> 00:02:26.524
So, we're now going to do the surgery,
let's see if you guys can see this.

00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:30.038
Yeah, it's gross ...
