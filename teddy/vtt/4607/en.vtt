00:00:13.952 --> 00:00:15.811
When you think about the brain,

00:00:15.835 --> 00:00:17.629
it's difficult to understand,

00:00:17.653 --> 00:00:20.891
because if I were to ask you right now,
how does the heart work,

00:00:20.915 --> 00:00:23.057
you would instantly tell me it's a pump.

00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:24.499
It pumps blood.

00:00:24.523 --> 00:00:26.199
If I were to ask about your lungs,

00:00:26.223 --> 00:00:28.799
you would say it exchanges
oxygen for carbon dioxide.

00:00:28.823 --> 00:00:29.837
That's easy.

00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:32.926
If I were to ask you how the brain works,
it's hard to understand
