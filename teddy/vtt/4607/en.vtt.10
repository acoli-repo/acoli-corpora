00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:00.681
we can actually see what happens
when we play music into the cockroach.

00:05:00.705 --> 00:05:01.827
Let's take a look.

00:05:03.523 --> 00:05:05.929
(Music beat)

00:05:05.953 --> 00:05:07.444
Can we turn it up? There we go.

00:05:07.468 --> 00:05:09.976
(Audience reacts and gasps)

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.730
GG: So what's happening?

00:05:11.754 --> 00:05:13.000
Audience: Wow!

00:05:13.024 --> 00:05:14.110
(Laughter)

00:05:14.134 --> 00:05:16.976
So you see what's moving.
It's moving on the bass.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.168
All those audiophiles out there,

00:05:19.192 --> 00:05:21.319
if you have awesome, kicking car stereos,

00:05:21.343 --> 00:05:23.937
you know, the bass speakers
are the biggest speakers.

00:05:23.961 --> 00:05:26.047
The biggest speakers
have the longest waves,

00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:27.412
which have the most current,

00:05:27.436 --> 00:05:30.023
and the current is what's causing
these things to move.
