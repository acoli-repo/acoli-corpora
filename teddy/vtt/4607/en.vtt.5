00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:30.038
Yeah, it's gross ...

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.880
All right. So there we go.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.673
You guys can see his leg right there.

00:02:37.697 --> 00:02:39.197
Now I'm going to take this leg,

00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:41.937
I'm going to put it in this invention
that we came up with

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.079
called the Spikerbox --

00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:46.609
and this replaces lots of expensive
equipment in a research lab,

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:49.809
so you guys can do this
in your own high schools,

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:52.087
or in your own basements if it's me.

00:02:53.418 --> 00:02:54.751
(Audience: Laughter)

00:02:55.552 --> 00:02:57.275
So, there.

00:02:59.973 --> 00:03:01.334
Can you guys see that?
