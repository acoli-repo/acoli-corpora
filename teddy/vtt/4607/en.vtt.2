00:00:57.738 --> 00:01:00.976
And we're going to eavesdrop
in on a conversation between two cells,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.858
and we're going to listen
to something called a spike.

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:07.775
But we're not going to record my brain
or your brain or your teachers' brains,

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.094
we're going to use our good
friend the cockroach.

00:01:10.118 --> 00:01:11.976
Not just because I think they're cool,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.378
but because they have brains
very similar to ours.

00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:17.070
So if you learn a little bit
about how their brains work,

00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:19.572
we're going to learn a lot
about how our brains work.

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:21.675
I'm going to put them
in some ice water here

00:01:22.612 --> 00:01:23.685
And then --

00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:26.619
Audience: Ew!
Greg Gabe: Yeah ...

00:01:26.643 --> 00:01:28.619
Right now they're becoming anesthetized.

00:01:28.643 --> 00:01:31.945
Because they're cold blooded,
they become the temperature of the water
