00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:32.926
If I were to ask you how the brain works,
it's hard to understand

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.003
because you can't just look
at a brain and understand what it is.

00:00:36.027 --> 00:00:38.831
It's not a mechanical object,
not a pump, not an airbag.

00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:41.718
It's just like, if you held it
in your hand when it was dead,

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:42.947
it's just a piece of fat.

00:00:43.885 --> 00:00:47.274
To understand how the brain works,
you have to go inside a living brain.

00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:50.976
Because the brain's not mechanical,
the brain is electrical and it's chemical.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.813
Your brain is made out of
100 billion cells, called neurons.

00:00:53.837 --> 00:00:57.714
And these neurons communicate
with each other with electricity.

00:00:57.738 --> 00:01:00.976
And we're going to eavesdrop
in on a conversation between two cells,
