00:05:27.436 --> 00:05:30.023
and the current is what's causing
these things to move.

00:05:30.047 --> 00:05:33.676
So it's not just speakers
that are causing electricity.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.590
Microphones also cause electricity.

00:05:35.614 --> 00:05:36.686
(Beat)

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.383
So I'm going to go ahead and invite
another person out on the stage here

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:41.615
to help me out with this.

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:42.763
So there we go.

00:05:42.787 --> 00:05:44.906
(Beatboxing)

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.429
This is the first time this has ever
happened in the history of mankind.

00:05:50.453 --> 00:05:52.976
Human beatbox to a cockroach leg.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.474
When you guys go back to your high school,
think about neuroscience

00:05:56.498 --> 00:05:58.976
and how you guys can begin
the neuro-revolution.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.701
Thank you very much. Bye bye.
