00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.515
so we can sort of average this guy.

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:33.976
So there we see it.
That's an action potential.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.048
You've got 100 billion cells
in your brain doing this right now,

00:03:37.072 --> 00:03:40.316
sending all this information back
about what you're seeing, hearing.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.641
We also said this is a cell

00:03:41.665 --> 00:03:44.976
that's going to be taking up information
about vibrations in the wind.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.715
So what if we do an experiment?

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.446
We can actually blow on this
and hear if we see a change.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.952
Are you guys going to be ready?

00:03:50.976 --> 00:03:53.271
If I blow on it you tell me
if you hear anything.

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:54.363
(Blowing)

00:03:55.007 --> 00:03:56.483
(Sound changes)

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.413
Let me just touch this
with a little pen here.

00:03:59.437 --> 00:04:00.586
(Noise)
