00:03:59.437 --> 00:04:00.586
(Noise)

00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:04.333
That was the neural firing rate.

00:04:04.357 --> 00:04:07.334
That actually took a while
in neuroscience to understand this.

00:04:07.358 --> 00:04:08.651
This is called rate coding:

00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:11.642
the harder you press on something,
the more spikes there are,

00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:14.097
and all that information
is coming up to your brain.

00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:15.603
That's how you perceive things.

00:04:15.627 --> 00:04:18.349
So that's one way of doing
an experiment with electricity.

00:04:18.373 --> 00:04:22.894
The other way is that your brain is not
only taking in electrical impulses,

00:04:22.918 --> 00:04:24.071
you're also sending out.

00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:26.044
That's how you move your muscles around.

00:04:26.068 --> 00:04:29.228
Let's see what happens if I've plugged in
something that's electric

00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:30.976
into the cockroach leg here.
