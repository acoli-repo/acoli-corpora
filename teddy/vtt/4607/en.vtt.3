00:01:28.643 --> 00:01:31.945
Because they're cold blooded,
they become the temperature of the water

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.095
and they can't control it
so they just basically "chillax," right?

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.976
They're not going to feel anything,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.775
which may tell you a little
about what we're going to do,

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.429
a scientific experiment
to understand the brain.

00:01:42.453 --> 00:01:43.474
So ...

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:45.976
This is the leg of a cockroach.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.143
And a cockroach
has all these beautiful hairs

00:01:48.167 --> 00:01:49.976
and pricklies all over it.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.976
Underneath each one of those is a cell,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.976
and this cell's a neuron
that is going to send information

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.439
about wind or vibration.

00:01:57.463 --> 00:02:01.309
If you ever try to catch a cockroach,
it's hard because they can feel you coming
