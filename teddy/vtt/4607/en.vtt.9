00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:30.976
into the cockroach leg here.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.744
I'm going to take two pins,
I'm going to plug them onto the cockroach.

00:04:34.768 --> 00:04:38.260
I'm going to take the other end,
I'm going to plug in into my iPod.

00:04:38.284 --> 00:04:39.737
It's my iPhone actually.

00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:42.872
Do you guys know how your earbuds
work in your ears?

00:04:42.896 --> 00:04:45.203
You have a battery
in your phone, or iPod, right?

00:04:45.227 --> 00:04:48.330
It's sending electrical current
into these magnets in your earbuds

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:50.976
which shake back and forth
and allow you to hear things.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.976
But that current's the same currency
that our brain uses,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.956
so we can send that to our cockroach leg

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.315
and hopefully if this works,

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:00.681
we can actually see what happens
when we play music into the cockroach.
