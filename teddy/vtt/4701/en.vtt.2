00:00:58.443 --> 00:01:00.452
Once he gets to the halfway point,

00:01:00.452 --> 00:01:02.841
he needs to walk half the remaining distance.

00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:05.868
Again, this takes a finite amount of time.

00:01:05.868 --> 00:01:08.140
Once he gets there, he still needs to walk

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.882
half the distance that's left,

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:12.371
which takes another finite amount of time.

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:15.522
This happens again and again and again.

00:01:15.522 --> 00:01:18.195
You can see that we can keep going like this forever,

00:01:18.195 --> 00:01:19.857
dividing whatever distance is left

00:01:19.857 --> 00:01:21.772
into smaller and smaller pieces,

00:01:21.772 --> 00:01:25.278
each of which takes some finite time to traverse.

00:01:25.278 --> 00:01:27.958
So, how long does it take Zeno to get to the park?

00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.317
Well, to find out, you need to add the times
