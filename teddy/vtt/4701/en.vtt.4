00:01:58.731 --> 00:02:01.618
Let's supposed that Zeno's house is one mile from the park

00:02:01.618 --> 00:02:04.341
and that Zeno walks at one mile per hour.

00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:06.692
Common sense tells us that the time for the journey

00:02:06.692 --> 00:02:08.205
should be one hour.

00:02:08.205 --> 00:02:10.867
But, let's look at things from Zeno's point of view

00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:13.196
and divide up the journey into pieces.

00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:15.656
The first half of the journey takes half an hour,

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:17.782
the next part takes quarter of an hour,

00:02:17.782 --> 00:02:20.064
the third part takes an eighth of an hour,

00:02:20.064 --> 00:02:20.969
and so on.

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:22.266
Summing up all these times,

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:24.372
we get a series that looks like this.

00:02:24.372 --> 00:02:25.624
"Now", Zeno might say,

00:02:25.624 --> 00:02:27.964
"since there are infinitely many of terms

00:02:27.964 --> 00:02:29.621
on the right side of the equation,

00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:31.883
and each individual term is finite,
