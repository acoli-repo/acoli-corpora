00:03:27.314 --> 00:03:30.742
as we take the limit as n tends to infinity,

00:03:30.742 --> 00:03:33.356
the entire square becomes covered with blue.

00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:35.427
But the area of the square is just one unit,

00:03:35.427 --> 00:03:38.700
and so the infinite sum must equal one.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.754
Going back to Zeno's journey,

00:03:39.754 --> 00:03:42.370
we can now see how how the paradox is resolved.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.713
Not only does the infinite series sum to a finite answer,

00:03:45.713 --> 00:03:47.745
but that finite answer is the same one

00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:50.172
that common sense tells us is true.

00:03:50.172 --> 00:03:52.877
Zeno's journey takes one hour.
