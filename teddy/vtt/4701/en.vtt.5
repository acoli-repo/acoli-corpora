00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:31.883
and each individual term is finite,

00:02:31.883 --> 00:02:34.518
the sum should equal infinity, right?"

00:02:34.518 --> 00:02:36.670
This is the problem with Zeno's argument.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.855
As mathematicians have since realized,

00:02:38.855 --> 00:02:42.618
it is possible to add up infinitely many finite-sized terms

00:02:42.618 --> 00:02:44.814
and still get a finite answer.

00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:45.989
"How?" you ask.

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.486
Well, let's think of it this way.

00:02:47.486 --> 00:02:50.390
Let's start with a square that has area of one meter.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.528
Now let's chop the square in half,

00:02:52.528 --> 00:02:54.909
and then chop the remaining half in half,

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.172
and so on.

00:02:56.172 --> 00:02:57.239
While we're doing this,

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.380
let's keep track of the areas of the pieces.
