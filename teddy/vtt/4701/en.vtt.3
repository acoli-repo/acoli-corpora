00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:30.317
Well, to find out, you need to add the times

00:01:30.317 --> 00:01:32.284
of each of the pieces of the journey.

00:01:32.284 --> 00:01:36.616
The problem is, there are infinitely many of these finite-sized pieces.

00:01:36.616 --> 00:01:39.750
So, shouldn't the total time be infinity?

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.548
This argument, by the way, is completely general.

00:01:42.548 --> 00:01:45.092
It says that traveling from any location to any other location

00:01:45.092 --> 00:01:47.254
should take an infinite amount of time.

00:01:47.254 --> 00:01:51.006
In other words, it says that all motion is impossible.

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:52.785
This conclusion is clearly absurd,

00:01:52.785 --> 00:01:54.784
but where is the flaw in the logic?

00:01:54.784 --> 00:01:55.966
To resolve the paradox,

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:58.731
it helps to turn the story into a math problem.

00:01:58.731 --> 00:02:01.618
Let's supposed that Zeno's house is one mile from the park
