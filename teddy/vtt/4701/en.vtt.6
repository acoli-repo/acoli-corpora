00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.380
let's keep track of the areas of the pieces.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.169
The first slice makes two parts,

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:04.028
each with an area of one-half

00:03:04.028 --> 00:03:06.545
The next slice divides one of those halves in half,

00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:07.796
and so on.

00:03:07.796 --> 00:03:10.227
But, no matter how many times we slice up the boxes,

00:03:10.227 --> 00:03:14.814
the total area is still the sum of the areas of all the pieces.

00:03:14.814 --> 00:03:17.442
Now you can see why we choose this particular way

00:03:17.442 --> 00:03:18.971
of cutting up the square.

00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:20.888
We've obtained the same infinite series

00:03:20.888 --> 00:03:23.356
as we had for the time of Zeno's journey.

00:03:23.356 --> 00:03:25.791
As we construct more and more blue pieces,

00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:27.314
to use the math jargon,

00:03:27.314 --> 00:03:30.742
as we take the limit as n tends to infinity,
