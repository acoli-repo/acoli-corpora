00:00:29.694 --> 00:00:31.310
mathematicians and philosophers

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.746
to better understand the nature of infinity.

00:00:33.746 --> 00:00:35.525
One of the best known of Zeno's problems

00:00:35.525 --> 00:00:37.741
is called the dichotomy paradox,

00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:41.527
which means, "the paradox of cutting in two" in ancient Greek.

00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:43.315
It goes something like this:

00:00:43.315 --> 00:00:46.154
After a long day of sitting around, thinking,

00:00:46.154 --> 00:00:48.950
Zeno decides to walk from his house to the park.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.397
The fresh air clears his mind

00:00:50.397 --> 00:00:51.920
and help him think better.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.075
In order to get to the park,

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:55.428
he first has to get half way to the park.

00:00:55.428 --> 00:00:56.601
This portion of his journey

00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:58.443
takes some finite amount of time.

00:00:58.443 --> 00:01:00.452
Once he gets to the halfway point,
