I know that this
is a sophisticated audience,

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.947
so you know about the rise of China.

00:02:05.403 --> 00:02:09.815
I'm going to focus, therefore,
on the impact of China's rise,

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:13.196
on the US, on the international order

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.633
and on the prospects for war and peace.

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:18.545
But having taught at Harvard
over many years,

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.570
I've learned that from time to time,
it's useful to take a short pause,

00:02:22.594 --> 00:02:25.230
just to make sure we're all
on the same page.

00:02:25.254 --> 00:02:27.602
The way I do this is, I call a time-out,

00:02:27.626 --> 00:02:31.117
I give students a pop quiz --
ungraded, of course.
