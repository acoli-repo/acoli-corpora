00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:01.633
So how does this work?

00:13:01.657 --> 00:13:05.902
What happens is,
a third party's provocation

00:13:05.926 --> 00:13:08.379
forces one or the other to react,

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:12.235
and that sets in motion a spiral,

00:13:12.259 --> 00:13:15.128
which drags the two somewhere
they don't want to go.

00:13:15.152 --> 00:13:17.342
If that seems crazy, it is.

00:13:17.366 --> 00:13:18.607
But it's life.

00:13:19.009 --> 00:13:20.695
Remember World War I.

00:13:21.953 --> 00:13:24.815
The provocation in that case

00:13:24.839 --> 00:13:28.188
was the assassination
of a second-level figure,

00:13:28.212 --> 00:13:30.137
Archduke Franz Ferdinand,
