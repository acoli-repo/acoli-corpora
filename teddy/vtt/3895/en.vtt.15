He said, "All this has happened so fast,

00:07:32.228 --> 00:07:34.648
(Laughter)

00:07:34.672 --> 00:07:38.442
To remind myself
how astonished I should be,

00:07:38.466 --> 00:07:42.656
I occasionally look out the window
in my office in Cambridge

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.426
at this bridge, which goes
across the Charles River,

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.331
between the Kennedy School
and Harvard Business School.

00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:52.864
In 2012, the State of Massachusetts said
they were going to renovate this bridge,

00:07:52.888 --> 00:07:54.443
and it would take two years.

00:07:55.053 --> 00:07:57.520
In 2014, they said it wasn't finished.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.339
In 2015, they said
it would take one more year.
