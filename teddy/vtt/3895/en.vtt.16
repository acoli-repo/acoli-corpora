00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.339
In 2015, they said
it would take one more year.

00:08:01.363 --> 00:08:03.141
In 2016, they said it's not finished,

00:08:03.165 --> 00:08:06.004
we're not going to tell you
when it's going to be finished.

00:08:06.004 --> 00:08:09.168
Finally, last year, it was finished --
three times over budget.

00:08:10.307 --> 00:08:15.815
Now, compare this to a similar bridge
that I drove across last month in Beijing.

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:17.587
It's called the Sanyuan Bridge.

00:08:18.284 --> 00:08:21.940
In 2015, the Chinese decided
they wanted to renovate that bridge.

00:08:21.964 --> 00:08:24.638
It actually has twice as many
lanes of traffic.

00:08:25.354 --> 00:08:28.095
How long did it take for them
to complete the project?

00:08:28.663 --> 00:08:30.415
Twenty fifteen, what do you bet?
