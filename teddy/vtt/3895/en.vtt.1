00:00:26.336 --> 00:00:30.086
The challenge is the impact
of China's rise --

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:34.776
the discombobulation
this will cause the Unites States

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.593
and the international order,

00:00:36.617 --> 00:00:40.898
of which the US has been
the principal architect and guardian.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.152
The past 100 years have been what
historians now call an "American Century."

00:00:46.568 --> 00:00:49.069
Americans have become
accustomed to their place

00:00:49.093 --> 00:00:51.110
at the top of every pecking order.

00:00:51.862 --> 00:00:54.776
So the very idea of another country

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.815
that could be as big and strong
as the US -- or bigger --

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.759
strikes many Americans
as an assault on who they are.
