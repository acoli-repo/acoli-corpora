00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:33.831
So just in November, we'll all pause
to mark the 100th anniversary

00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:38.363
of the final day of a war
that became so encompassing,

00:01:38.387 --> 00:01:42.699
that it required historians to create
an entirely new category: world war.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.345
So, on the 11th hour of the 11th day

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.061
of the 11th month in 1918,

00:01:51.085 --> 00:01:54.267
the guns of World War I fell silent,

00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:58.037
but 20 million individuals lay dead.
