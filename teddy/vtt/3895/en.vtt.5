I give students a pop quiz --
ungraded, of course.

00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:33.646
So, let's try this. Time-out, pop quiz.

00:02:34.173 --> 00:02:35.783
Question:

00:02:35.807 --> 00:02:40.506
forty years ago, 1978, China sets out
on its march to the market.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.005
At that point, what percentage
of China's one billion citizens

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:50.174
were struggling to survive
on less than two dollars a day?

00:02:50.704 --> 00:02:52.634
Take a guess -- 25 percent?

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.410
Fifty?

00:02:55.053 --> 00:02:56.203
Seventy-five?

00:02:57.998 --> 00:02:59.148
Ninety.
