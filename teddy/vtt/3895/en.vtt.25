00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:34.053
Harvard's "Thucydides's Trap Case File"
has reviewed the last 500 years of history

00:12:34.077 --> 00:12:37.831
and found 16 cases in which a rising power

00:12:37.855 --> 00:12:39.785
threatened to displace a ruling power.

00:12:40.344 --> 00:12:42.576
Twelve of these ended in war.

00:12:45.938 --> 00:12:51.231
And the tragedy of this
is that in very few of these

00:12:51.255 --> 00:12:54.035
did either of the protagonists want a war;

00:12:55.236 --> 00:12:58.538
few of these wars were initiated
by either the rising power

00:12:58.562 --> 00:12:59.921
or the ruling power.

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:01.633
So how does this work?
