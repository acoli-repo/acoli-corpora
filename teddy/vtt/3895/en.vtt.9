Now, I know his name is a mouthful,

00:04:31.344 --> 00:04:33.462
and some people
have trouble pronouncing it.

00:04:33.486 --> 00:04:35.506
So, let's do it, one,
two, three, together:

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.903
Thucydides.

00:04:36.927 --> 00:04:39.839
One more time: Thucydides.

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.529
So who was Thucydides?

00:04:41.942 --> 00:04:44.879
He was the father and founder of history.

00:04:44.903 --> 00:04:47.045
He wrote the first-ever history book.

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:51.180
It's titled "The History
of the Peloponnesian War,"

00:04:51.204 --> 00:04:54.526
about the war in Greece, 2500 years ago.

00:04:55.276 --> 00:04:58.466
So if nothing else today,
you can tweet your friends,

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.212
