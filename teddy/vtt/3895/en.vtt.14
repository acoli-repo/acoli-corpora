00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.403
Give me five minutes to unpack this,

00:07:00.427 --> 00:07:05.403
and later this afternoon, when the next
news story pops up for you

00:07:05.427 --> 00:07:08.837
about China doing this,
or the US reacting like that,

00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:12.280
you will be able to have a better
understanding of what's going on

00:07:12.304 --> 00:07:14.781
and even to explain it to your friends.

00:07:15.678 --> 00:07:20.179
So as we saw with this flipping
the pyramid of poverty,

00:07:20.203 --> 00:07:21.914
China has actually soared.

00:07:22.456 --> 00:07:23.606
It's meteoric.

00:07:24.354 --> 00:07:27.417
Former Czech president, Vaclav Havel,
I think, put it best.

00:07:27.441 --> 00:07:32.204
He said, "All this has happened so fast,
we haven't yet had time to be astonished."
