00:00:00.196 --> 00:00:01.996
Let's talk about regret.

00:00:02.596 --> 00:00:06.636
It is, to my mind,
our most misunderstood emotion,

00:00:06.676 --> 00:00:10.076
and so I decided to spend
a couple of years studying it.

00:00:10.116 --> 00:00:12.316
And one of the things
that I did is I went back

00:00:12.356 --> 00:00:15.356
and I looked at about 50 years
of social science on regret.

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:16.796
And here's what it tells you.

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:20.116
I'll save you the trouble of reading
a half century of social science.

00:00:20.156 --> 00:00:22.716
The research tells us
that everybody has regrets,

00:00:22.716 --> 00:00:24.076
regrets make us human.

00:00:24.116 --> 00:00:28.356
Truly, the only people
without regrets are five-year-olds,

00:00:28.396 --> 00:00:30.876
people with brain damage and sociopaths.
