00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:31.879
Is this what it's like to fantasize

00:01:31.903 --> 00:01:37.659
about a love that never was alive
outside my mind or distance?

00:01:37.683 --> 00:01:39.941
With time I clearly lost my sight,

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:42.291
thinkin' I was wrong
to ever leave your side.

00:01:42.315 --> 00:01:44.927
But time's the harshest judge,

00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:47.018
makes us think we were in love.

00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:48.198
And now

00:01:48.222 --> 00:01:49.742
I'm old with regret,

00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:52.444
wishin' I could hold you and just forget.

00:01:52.468 --> 00:01:55.205
Since I can't I'll just be
home but homesick,

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.273
wishin' you were mine
and I didn't hurt you like I did.

00:01:58.297 --> 00:02:00.730
Can't go back to when we had a chance,
