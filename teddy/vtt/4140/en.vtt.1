00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:32.646
and I don't know if I've been burned

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.476
from the burned bridges in my life,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.678
thinkin' you were wrong

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:37.867
and I was right.

00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:40.520
Maybe I messed up,

00:00:40.544 --> 00:00:42.734
either way it's too late for us.

00:00:42.758 --> 00:00:45.569
'Cause baby I'm old with regret,

00:00:45.593 --> 00:00:48.064
wishin' I could hold you and just forget.

00:00:48.088 --> 00:00:50.930
Since I can't I'll just be
home but homesick,

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:54.196
wishin' you were mine
and I didn't hurt you like I did.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.488
Can't go back to when we had a chance,

00:00:56.512 --> 00:00:58.940
wishin' I could have a shot
at real romance.

00:00:58.964 --> 00:01:03.006
Now I realize all the things
I could have had were in your cold hands.
