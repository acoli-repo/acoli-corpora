You know, there are very few things that
set us apart

00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:14.454
from the rest of life on Earth.

00:00:15.204 --> 00:00:21.079
At the heart of them, I believe, is our 
inexhaustible power of imagination.

00:00:23.746 --> 00:00:27.454
Imagination is the ability to bring 
into mind, things that arenâ€™t present.

00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:31.621
With imagination, we can
anticipate the future.
