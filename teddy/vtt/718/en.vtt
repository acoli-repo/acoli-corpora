00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Believe me or not, I come offering a solution

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to a very important part of this larger problem,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
with the requisite focus on climate.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And the solution I offer

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is to the biggest culprit

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in this massive mistreatment of the earth

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
by humankind,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and the resulting decline of the biosphere.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That culprit is business and industry,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956.
