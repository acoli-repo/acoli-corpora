00:11:26.296 --> 00:11:30.058
out of my tear gas resolution back then.

00:11:30.058 --> 00:11:32.348
But there's something
more significant here,

00:11:32.348 --> 00:11:37.794
something that I believe is more important
and more crucial than my personal example.

00:11:37.794 --> 00:11:42.629
I said that livestream could turn the web
into a colossal TV network,

00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:44.666
but I believe it does something else,

00:11:44.666 --> 00:11:47.627
because after watching people using it,

00:11:47.627 --> 00:11:53.651
not only to cover things but to express,
to organize themselves politically,

00:11:53.651 --> 00:12:00.405
I believe livestream can turn cyberspace
into a global political arena
