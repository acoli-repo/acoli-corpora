Street protests started
to erupt in São Paulo.

00:05:32.737 --> 00:05:34.917
They began as very local and specific.

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:40.227
They were against the bus fare hike
that had just happened in the city.

00:05:40.227 --> 00:05:42.138
This is a bus.

00:05:42.138 --> 00:05:45.102
It's written there, "Theft."

00:05:45.102 --> 00:05:50.161
But those kind of manifestations
started to grow,

00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:51.996
and they kept happening.

00:05:51.996 --> 00:05:56.803
So the police violence against them
started to grow as well.

00:05:56.803 --> 00:05:58.512
But there was another conflict,

00:05:58.512 --> 00:06:01.016
the one I believe that's
more important here
