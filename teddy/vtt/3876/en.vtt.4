00:01:54.709 --> 00:02:00.652
of sharing the raw experience
of what it's like to be there, actually.

00:02:00.652 --> 00:02:04.492
So in the following week,
I was back in the streets,

00:02:04.492 --> 00:02:08.555
but that time, I wasn't a member
of any media outlet anymore.

00:02:08.555 --> 00:02:13.176
I was there as an independent
livestreamer, and all I had with me

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:15.312
was basically borrowed equipment.

00:02:15.312 --> 00:02:21.366
I had a very simple camera
and a backpack with 3G modems.

00:02:21.366 --> 00:02:26.991
And I had this weblink
that could be shared through social media,

00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:29.868
could be put in any website,

00:02:29.868 --> 00:02:32.897
and that time,
the protest went along fine.
