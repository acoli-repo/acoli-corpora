00:07:27.488 --> 00:07:30.112
We are using basically this.

00:07:30.112 --> 00:07:32.111
We are using smartphones.

00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:37.019
And that, actually, allowed us to become
invisible in the middle of the protests,

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:39.701
but it allowed us to do something else:

00:07:39.701 --> 00:07:43.525
to show what it was like
to be in the protests,

00:07:43.525 --> 00:07:49.279
to present to people at home
a subjective perspective.

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:51.615
But there was something
that is more important,

00:07:51.615 --> 00:07:52.971
I think, than the equipment.

00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:55.699
It was our mindset,

00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:58.870
because we are not behaving
as a media outlet.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.808
We are not competing for news.
