with rubber bullets, bombs,

00:01:31.785 --> 00:01:33.544
and then the gas.

00:01:34.184 --> 00:01:36.202
But to make a long story short,

00:01:36.202 --> 00:01:40.091
I had entered that protest
as the editor-in-chief

00:01:40.091 --> 00:01:44.864
of a well-established printed magazine
where I'd worked for 11 years,

00:01:44.864 --> 00:01:49.776
and thanks to this unsolicited
effects of tear gas,

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:54.709
I left it as a journalist that was now
committed to new ways

00:01:54.709 --> 00:02:00.652
of sharing the raw experience
of what it's like to be there, actually.
