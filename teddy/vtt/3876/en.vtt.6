00:02:56.678 --> 00:03:01.059
but the most interesting part
was when I got back home, actually,

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:03.886
because I learned that I had been watched

00:03:03.886 --> 00:03:06.990
by more than 90,000 people,

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.895
and I got hundreds of emails and messages
of people asking me, basically,

00:03:11.895 --> 00:03:13.295
how did I do it,

00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:16.611
how it was possible to do such a thing.

00:03:16.611 --> 00:03:19.884
And I learned something else,
that that was actually the first time

00:03:19.884 --> 00:03:25.022
that somebody had ever done
a livestreaming in a street protest

00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:26.596
in the country.

00:03:27.216 --> 00:03:29.758
And that really shocked me,

00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:33.536
because I was no geek,
I was no technology guy,
