00:04:58.484 --> 00:05:01.188
But we had a very solid
and clear conviction,

00:05:01.188 --> 00:05:06.142
that we knew that the hyperconnected
environment of social media

00:05:06.142 --> 00:05:08.773
could maybe allow us to consolidate

00:05:08.773 --> 00:05:14.117
a network of experimental journalists
throughout the country.

00:05:14.117 --> 00:05:19.254
So we launched a Facebook page first,
and then a manifesto,

00:05:19.254 --> 00:05:22.992
and started to cover the streets
in a very simple way.

00:05:22.992 --> 00:05:27.310
But then something happened,
something that wasn't predicted,

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.817
that no one could have anticipated.

00:05:29.817 --> 00:05:32.737
Street protests started
to erupt in São Paulo.
