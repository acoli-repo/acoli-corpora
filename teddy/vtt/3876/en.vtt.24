I believe livestream can turn cyberspace
into a global political arena

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:02.803
where everyone might have a voice,

00:12:02.803 --> 00:12:04.347
a proper voice,

00:12:04.347 --> 00:12:09.832
because livestream takes the monopoly
of the broadcast political discourse,

00:12:09.832 --> 00:12:12.585
of the verbal aspect
of the political dialogue

00:12:12.585 --> 00:12:18.194
out of the mouths of just politicians
and political pundits alone,

00:12:18.194 --> 00:12:23.664
and it empowers the citizen
through this direct and non-mediated power

00:12:23.664 --> 00:12:26.647
of exchanging experiences and dialogue,

00:12:26.647 --> 00:12:30.697
empowers them to question
and to influence authorities
