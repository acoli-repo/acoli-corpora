I'm dedicating myself to another project.

00:11:00.589 --> 00:11:03.835
It's called Fluxo,
which is Portuguese for "stream."

00:11:03.835 --> 00:11:06.642
It's a journalism studio
in São Paulo downtown,

00:11:06.642 --> 00:11:09.969
where I used livestream to experiment

00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:13.474
with what I call post-television formats.

00:11:13.474 --> 00:11:18.852
But I'm also trying to come up with ways
to finance independent journalism

00:11:18.852 --> 00:11:21.664
through a direct relationship
with an audience,

00:11:21.664 --> 00:11:23.626
with an active audience,

00:11:23.626 --> 00:11:26.296
because now I really want
to try to make a living

00:11:26.296 --> 00:11:30.058
out of my tear gas resolution back then.
