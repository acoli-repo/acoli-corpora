I have a daughter, Mulan.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And when she was eight, last year,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
she was doing a report for school

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
or she had some homework about frogs.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And we were at this restaurant,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and she said, "So, basically,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
frogs lay eggs

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and the eggs turn into tadpoles,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and tadpoles turn into frogs."

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And I said, "Yeah. You know, I'm not really up on my frog reproduction that much.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's the females, I think, that lay the eggs,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and then the males fertilize them.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And then they become tadpoles and frogs."

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And she says, "What? Only the females have eggs?"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And I said, "Yeah."
