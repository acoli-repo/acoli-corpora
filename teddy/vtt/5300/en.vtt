Many of us like to start the day
with a cup of coffee

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:06.893
and perhaps end the day
with a glass of wine

00:00:06.917 --> 00:00:09.143
or some other kind of alcoholic drink.

00:00:09.167 --> 00:00:11.934
But it turns out
that these two substances,

00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:16.768
alcohol and caffeine,
can have surprising impacts on our sleep.

Let's start with caffeine.

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:26.309
Caffeine is in a class of drugs

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.684
that we call the psychoactive stimulants.

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:33.101
And everyone knows that caffeine
can make them more alert.
