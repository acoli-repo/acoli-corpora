Hawa Abdi: Many people -- 20 years for Somalia --

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
[were] fighting.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So there was no job, no food.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Children, most of them,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
became very malnourished, like this.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Deqo Mohamed: So as you know,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
always in a civil war,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the ones affected most [are] the women and children.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So our patients are women and children.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And they are in our backyard.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's our home. We welcome them.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That's the camp that we have in now
