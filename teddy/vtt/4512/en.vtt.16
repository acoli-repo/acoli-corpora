00:07:58.574 --> 00:08:01.017
We're looking at millimeter accuracy

00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:04.357
with regard to spatial
and millisecond accuracy

00:08:04.381 --> 00:08:07.003
using 306 SQUIDs --

00:08:07.027 --> 00:08:10.127
these are superconducting
quantum interference devices --

00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:13.782
to pick up the magnetic fields
that change as we do our thinking.

00:08:14.249 --> 00:08:19.858
We're the first in the world
to record babies in an MEG machine

00:08:19.882 --> 00:08:22.273
while they are learning.

00:08:22.297 --> 00:08:23.976
So this is little Emma.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.908
She's a six-monther.

00:08:25.932 --> 00:08:31.050
And she's listening to various languages
in the earphones that are in her ears.
