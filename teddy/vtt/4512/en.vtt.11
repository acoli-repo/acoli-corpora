00:05:29.587 --> 00:05:31.276
who'd never heard a second language

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.016
to Mandarin for the first time
during the critical period.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.577
We knew that, when monolinguals
were tested in Taipei and Seattle

00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:40.263
on the Mandarin sounds,
they showed the same pattern.

00:05:40.287 --> 00:05:42.758
Six to eight months,
they're totally equivalent.

00:05:42.782 --> 00:05:45.318
Two months later,
something incredible happens.

00:05:45.342 --> 00:05:48.894
But the Taiwanese babies are getting
better, not the American babies.

00:05:48.918 --> 00:05:53.800
What we did was expose American babies,
during this period, to Mandarin.

00:05:53.824 --> 00:05:56.832
It was like having Mandarin relatives
come and visit for a month

00:05:56.856 --> 00:06:00.653
and move into your house
and talk to the babies for 12 sessions.
