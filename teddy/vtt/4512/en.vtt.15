It takes a human being

The social brain is controlling

00:07:35.812 --> 00:07:37.917
when the babies
are taking their statistics.

00:07:37.941 --> 00:07:41.434
We want to get inside the brain
and see this thing happening

00:07:41.458 --> 00:07:45.396
as babies are in front of televisions,
as opposed to in front of human beings.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:50.117
Thankfully, we have a new machine,
magnetoencephalography,

00:07:50.141 --> 00:07:51.434
that allows us to do this.

00:07:51.458 --> 00:07:54.043
It looks like a hair dryer from Mars.

00:07:54.067 --> 00:07:58.550
But it's completely safe,
completely noninvasive and silent.

00:07:58.574 --> 00:08:01.017
We're looking at millimeter accuracy
