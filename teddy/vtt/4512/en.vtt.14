the human being played
in this learning exercise.

00:07:04.168 --> 00:07:08.484
So we ran another group of babies
in which the kids got the same dosage,

00:07:08.508 --> 00:07:10.976
the same 12 sessions,
but over a television set.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.661
And another group of babies
who had just audio exposure

00:07:14.685 --> 00:07:16.773
and looked at a teddy bear on the screen.

00:07:16.797 --> 00:07:18.976
What did we do to their brains?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.375
What you see here is the audio result --

00:07:22.923 --> 00:07:24.661
no learning whatsoever --

00:07:24.685 --> 00:07:26.443
and the video result --

00:07:27.236 --> 00:07:29.081
no learning whatsoever.

00:07:29.105 --> 00:07:33.246
It takes a human being
for babies to take their statistics.
