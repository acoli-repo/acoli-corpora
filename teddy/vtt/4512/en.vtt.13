00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.671
We had to run a control group to make sure

00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:34.907
that coming into the laboratory
didn't improve your Mandarin skills.

00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:37.584
So a group of babies came in
and listened to English.

00:06:37.608 --> 00:06:39.010
And we can see from the graph

00:06:39.034 --> 00:06:41.617
that exposure to English
didn't improve their Mandarin.

00:06:41.641 --> 00:06:45.236
But look at what happened to the babies
exposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.660
They were as good as the babies in Taiwan

00:06:47.684 --> 00:06:50.660
who'd been listening
for 10 and a half months.

00:06:50.684 --> 00:06:54.508
What it demonstrated is that babies
take statistics on a new language.

00:06:54.532 --> 00:06:57.976
Whatever you put in front of them,
they'll take statistics on.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.590
But we wondered what role

00:06:59.614 --> 00:07:03.851
the human being played
in this learning exercise.
