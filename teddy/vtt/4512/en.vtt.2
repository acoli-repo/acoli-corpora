00:00:57.356 --> 00:01:00.231
And therein lies a critical puzzle.

00:01:00.255 --> 00:01:02.505
Why is it that you can't
preserve a language

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:05.764
by speaking to you and I, to the adults?

00:01:05.788 --> 00:01:07.976
Well, it's got to do with your brain.

00:01:08.538 --> 00:01:12.976
What we see here is that language
has a critical period for learning.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.800
The way to read this slide is to look
at your age on the horizontal axis.

00:01:16.824 --> 00:01:19.507
(Laughter)

00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:23.170
And you'll see on the vertical
your skill at acquiring a second language.

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.648
The babies and children are geniuses
until they turn seven,

00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:29.976
and then there's a systematic decline.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.497
After puberty, we fall off the map.
