00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:30.637
Just as the poets and writers described,

00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:34.815
we're going to be able to see, I think,
that wondrous openness,

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:38.263
utter and complete openness,
of the mind of a child.

00:09:39.024 --> 00:09:41.700
In investigating the child's brain,

00:09:41.724 --> 00:09:45.720
we're going to uncover deep truths
about what it means to be human,

00:09:45.744 --> 00:09:46.899
and in the process,

00:09:46.923 --> 00:09:49.994
we may be able to help keep
our own minds open to learning

00:09:50.018 --> 00:09:51.709
for our entire lives.

00:09:51.733 --> 00:09:52.976
Thank you.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
