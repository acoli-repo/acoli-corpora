00:08:25.932 --> 00:08:31.050
And she's listening to various languages
in the earphones that are in her ears.

00:08:31.074 --> 00:08:33.298
You can see, she can move around.

00:08:33.322 --> 00:08:37.092
We're tracking her head
with little pellets in a cap,

00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:40.091
so she's free to move
completely unconstrained.

00:08:40.115 --> 00:08:42.328
It's a technical tour de force.

00:08:42.352 --> 00:08:43.936
What are we seeing?

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.854
We're seeing the baby brain.

00:08:45.878 --> 00:08:51.164
As the baby hears a word in her language,
the auditory areas light up,

00:08:51.188 --> 00:08:55.976
and then subsequently areas surrounding it
that we think are related to coherence,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.976
getting the brain coordinated
with its different areas, and causality,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.976
one brain area
causing another to activate.
