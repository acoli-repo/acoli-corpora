00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:32.574
They can discriminate
all the sounds of all languages,

00:02:32.598 --> 00:02:35.830
no matter what country we're testing
and what language we're using,

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:38.849
and that's remarkable
because you and I can't do that.

00:02:38.873 --> 00:02:40.844
We're culture-bound listeners.

00:02:40.868 --> 00:02:43.263
We can discriminate the sounds
of our own language,

00:02:43.287 --> 00:02:45.134
but not those of foreign languages.

00:02:45.158 --> 00:02:48.325
So the question arises:
When do those citizens of the world

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.233
turn into the language-bound
listeners that we are?

00:02:51.257 --> 00:02:54.394
And the answer:
before their first birthdays.

00:02:54.418 --> 00:02:57.550
What you see here is performance
on that head-turn task

00:02:57.574 --> 00:03:00.037
for babies tested in Tokyo
and the United States,
