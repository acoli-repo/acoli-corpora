00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.233
is changing our models
of what the critical period is about.

00:05:01.257 --> 00:05:04.026
We're arguing from
a mathematical standpoint

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.190
that the learning of language
material may slow down

00:05:07.214 --> 00:05:09.594
when our distributions stabilize.

00:05:09.618 --> 00:05:12.480
It's raising lots of questions
about bilingual people.

00:05:12.918 --> 00:05:16.949
Bilinguals must keep two sets
of statistics in mind at once

00:05:16.973 --> 00:05:19.856
and flip between them,
one after the other,

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.652
depending on who they're speaking to.

00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:22.830
So we asked ourselves,

00:05:22.854 --> 00:05:26.261
can the babies take statistics
on a brand new language?

00:05:26.285 --> 00:05:29.563
And we tested this
by exposing American babies

00:05:29.587 --> 00:05:31.276
who'd never heard a second language
