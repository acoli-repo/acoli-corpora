00:00:28.197 --> 00:00:34.095
on what the romantic writers and poets
described as the "celestial openness"

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:35.976
of the child's mind.

00:00:37.013 --> 00:00:40.471
What we see here is a mother in India,

00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:44.399
and she's speaking Koro,
which is a newly discovered language.

00:00:44.797 --> 00:00:46.604
And she's talking to her baby.

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:48.245
What this mother --

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:51.488
and the 800 people who speak
Koro in the world --

00:00:51.512 --> 00:00:54.722
understands is that,
to preserve this language,

00:00:54.746 --> 00:00:57.332
they need to speak it to the babies.

00:00:57.356 --> 00:01:00.231
And therein lies a critical puzzle.
