00:04:29.864 --> 00:04:32.865
where we see a group
of intermediate sounds,

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.304
which is known as the Japanese "R."

00:04:35.328 --> 00:04:39.436
So babies absorb
the statistics of the language

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.138
and it changes their brains;

00:04:41.162 --> 00:04:43.313
it changes them
from the citizens of the world

00:04:43.337 --> 00:04:46.283
to the culture-bound
listeners that we are.

00:04:46.307 --> 00:04:51.020
But we as adults are no longer
absorbing those statistics.

00:04:51.044 --> 00:04:53.601
We are governed
by the representations in memory

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:56.174
that were formed early in development.

00:04:56.198 --> 00:04:57.976
So what we're seeing here

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.233
is changing our models
of what the critical period is about.
