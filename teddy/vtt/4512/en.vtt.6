00:02:57.574 --> 00:03:00.037
for babies tested in Tokyo
and the United States,

00:03:00.061 --> 00:03:01.499
here in Seattle,

00:03:01.523 --> 00:03:03.272
as they listened to "ra" and "la" --

00:03:03.296 --> 00:03:06.102
sounds important to English,
but not to Japanese.

00:03:06.126 --> 00:03:09.504
So at six to eight months,
the babies are totally equivalent.

00:03:09.528 --> 00:03:12.082
Two months later,
something incredible occurs.

00:03:12.106 --> 00:03:14.786
The babies in the United States
are getting a lot better,

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.734
babies in Japan are getting a lot worse,

00:03:16.758 --> 00:03:20.208
but both of those groups of babies
are preparing for exactly the language

00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:21.724
that they are going to learn.

00:03:21.748 --> 00:03:26.372
So the question is: What's happening
during this critical two-month period?

00:03:26.396 --> 00:03:28.739
This is the critical period
for sound development,

00:03:28.763 --> 00:03:30.178
but what's going on up there?
