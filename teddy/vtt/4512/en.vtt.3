00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.497
After puberty, we fall off the map.

00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:35.466
No scientists dispute this curve,

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.445
but laboratories all over the world

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.976
are trying to figure out
why it works this way.

00:01:40.518 --> 00:01:44.552
Work in my lab is focused on the first
critical period in development,

00:01:44.576 --> 00:01:46.421
and that is the period in which babies

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:49.810
try to master which sounds
are used in their language.

00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:52.324
We think, by studying
how the sounds are learned,

00:01:52.348 --> 00:01:54.613
we'll have a model
for the rest of language,

00:01:54.637 --> 00:01:57.575
and perhaps for critical periods
that may exist in childhood

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:00.462
for social, emotional
and cognitive development.
