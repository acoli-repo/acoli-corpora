00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:00.462
for social, emotional
and cognitive development.

00:02:01.035 --> 00:02:02.976
So we've been studying the babies

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.503
using a technique
that we're using all over the world

00:02:05.527 --> 00:02:07.383
and the sounds of all languages.

00:02:07.407 --> 00:02:09.198
The baby sits on a parent's lap,

00:02:09.222 --> 00:02:12.143
and we train them to turn
their heads when a sound changes --

00:02:12.167 --> 00:02:13.625
like from "ah" to "ee."

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:17.082
If they do so at the appropriate time,
the black box lights up

00:02:17.106 --> 00:02:19.090
and a panda bear pounds a drum.

00:02:19.114 --> 00:02:21.532
A six-monther adores the task.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.321
What have we learned?

00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:25.505
Well, babies all over the world

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:29.187
are what I like to describe
as "citizens of the world."

00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:32.574
They can discriminate
all the sounds of all languages,
