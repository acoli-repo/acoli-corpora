but what's going on up there?

00:03:30.202 --> 00:03:32.181
So there are two things going on.

00:03:32.205 --> 00:03:35.081
The first is that the babies
are listening intently to us,

00:03:35.105 --> 00:03:38.838
and they're taking statistics
as they listen to us talk --

00:03:38.862 --> 00:03:40.843
they're taking statistics.

00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:43.406
So listen to two mothers
speaking motherese --

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.472
the universal language
we use when we talk to kids --

00:03:46.496 --> 00:03:48.707
first in English and then in Japanese.

00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:52.170
(Video) Ah, I love your big blue eyes --

00:03:52.194 --> 00:03:55.000
so pretty and nice.
