00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.254
I'm going to take you
on a journey very quickly.

00:00:02.278 --> 00:00:05.127
To explain the wish, I'm going
to have to take you somewhere

00:00:05.151 --> 00:00:07.980
where many people haven't been,
and that's around the world.

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:12.113
When I was about 24 years old, Kate Stohr
and myself started an organization

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:15.777
to get architects and designers
involved in humanitarian work,

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:18.444
not only about responding
to natural disasters,

00:00:18.468 --> 00:00:20.222
but involved in systemic issues.

00:00:21.436 --> 00:00:26.015
We believe that where the resources
and expertise are scarce,

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.785
innovative, sustainable design can really
make a difference in people's lives.
