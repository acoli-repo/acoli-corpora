00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.716
paleontologists started digging up

00:01:00.716 --> 00:01:03.346
some compelling support for that idea:

00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:04.966
dinosaurs with bits of feathers

00:01:04.966 --> 00:01:07.051
still preserved on their bodies.

00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:08.470
Since then, scientists have found

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.429
dozens of species of dinosaurs

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:12.308
with remnants of feathers.

00:01:12.308 --> 00:01:14.349
Some were as small as pigeons,

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:17.061
and some were the size of a school bus.

00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:19.862
If you look at how they are related on a family tree,

00:01:19.862 --> 00:01:20.994
the evolution of feathers

00:01:20.994 --> 00:01:23.333
doesn't seem quite so impossible.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.339
The most distant feathered relatives of birds

00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:28.532
had straight feathers that looked like wires.

00:01:28.532 --> 00:01:30.420
Then these wires split apart,
