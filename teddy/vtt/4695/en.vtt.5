00:02:29.027 --> 00:02:31.734
A peacock displays its magnificent tail feathers

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:33.152
to attract peahens.

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:34.648
Feathers could have served these functions

00:02:34.648 --> 00:02:36.258
for dinosaurs too.

00:02:36.258 --> 00:02:38.627
Exactly how feathered dinosaurs took flight

00:02:38.627 --> 00:02:40.454
is still a bit of a mystery.

00:02:40.454 --> 00:02:42.538
But if a small-feathered dinosaur flapped

00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:45.072
its arms as it ran up an incline,

00:02:45.072 --> 00:02:47.067
its feathers would have provided extra lift

00:02:47.067 --> 00:02:48.787
to help it run faster.

00:02:48.787 --> 00:02:51.174
This accident of physics might have led

00:02:51.174 --> 00:02:53.619
to the evolution of longer dinosaur arms,

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:55.376
which would let them run faster

00:02:55.376 --> 00:02:58.292
and even leap short distances through the air.

00:02:58.292 --> 00:03:01.707
Eventually, their arms stretched out into wings.
