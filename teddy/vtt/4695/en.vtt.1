00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.562
feathers evolved over millions of years

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:32.610
into their modern form.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.483
It could be hard to imagine

00:00:34.483 --> 00:00:36.609
how this could have happened.

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:39.488
After all, what did the intermediate forms look like?

00:00:39.488 --> 00:00:40.864
What good is half a wing,

00:00:40.864 --> 00:00:43.272
festooned with half-feathers?

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:44.413
Thanks to science,

00:00:44.413 --> 00:00:47.740
we now know that birds are living dinosaurs.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.743
You can see the kinship in their skeletons.

00:00:50.743 --> 00:00:54.373
Certain dinosaurs share some anatomical details with birds

00:00:54.373 --> 00:00:57.790
found in no other animals, such as wish bones.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.333
And in the late 1990s,

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.716
paleontologists started digging up
