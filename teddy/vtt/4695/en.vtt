Feathers are some of the most remarkable things

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.112
ever made by an animal.

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:20.422
They are gorgeous in their complexity,

00:00:20.422 --> 00:00:22.361
delicate in their construction,

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:24.311
and yet strong enough to hold a bird

00:00:24.311 --> 00:00:26.357
thousands of feet in the air.

00:00:26.357 --> 00:00:27.940
Like all things in nature,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.562
