alternating strips of black and white,

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:05.242
or splashes of bright red.

00:02:05.242 --> 00:02:08.003
Some dinosaurs had high crests on their heads,

00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:11.071
and others had long, dramatic tail feathers.

00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:12.619
Now, none of these dinosaurs

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:14.618
could use their feathers to fly -

00:02:14.618 --> 00:02:15.712
their arms were too short

00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:17.798
and the rest of their bodies were far too heavy.

00:02:17.798 --> 00:02:21.071
But, birds don't just use feathers to fly.

00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:23.760
A woodcock uses feathers to blend in perfectly

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.311
with its forest backdrop.

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.558
An ostrich stretches its wings over its nest

00:02:27.558 --> 00:02:29.027
to shade its young.
