00:01:28.532 --> 00:01:30.420
Then these wires split apart,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.079
producing simple branches.

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.418
In many dinosaur lineages,

00:01:33.418 --> 00:01:35.045
these simple feathers evolved

00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:36.670
into more intricate ones,

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.152
including some that we see today on birds.

00:01:39.152 --> 00:01:40.024
At the same time,

00:01:40.024 --> 00:01:42.673
the feathers spread across the bodies of dinosaurs,

00:01:42.673 --> 00:01:45.259
turning from sparse patches of fuzz

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.218
into dense plumage,

00:01:47.218 --> 00:01:49.471
which even extended down to their legs.

00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:52.220
A few fossils even preserved some of the molecules

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.842
that give feathers color.

00:01:53.842 --> 00:01:56.150
They reveal a beautiful range of colors:

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.855
glossy, dark plumage, reminiscent of crows,

00:01:59.855 --> 00:02:02.505
alternating strips of black and white,
