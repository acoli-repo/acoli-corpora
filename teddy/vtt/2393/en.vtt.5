he was listed as a highly paid
speaker to a drug company,

00:02:33.493 --> 00:02:35.417
and in fact often spoke on behalf

00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:38.973
of the same chemo regimen
that he had prescribed her.

00:02:38.973 --> 00:02:40.570
She called me in a panic,

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.288
and I didn't know what to believe.

00:02:42.288 --> 00:02:44.541
Maybe this was the right
chemo regimen for her,

00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:46.822
but maybe it wasn't.

00:02:46.822 --> 00:02:49.972
It made her scared and it made her doubt.

00:02:49.972 --> 00:02:51.682
When it comes to medicine,

00:02:51.682 --> 00:02:54.292
having that trust is a must,

00:02:54.292 --> 00:02:58.391
and when that trust is gone,
then all that's left is fear.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.817
There's another side to this fear.
