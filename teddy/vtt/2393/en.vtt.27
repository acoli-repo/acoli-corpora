00:13:29.739 --> 00:13:31.429
will increase patient trust,

00:13:31.429 --> 00:13:33.150
improve health outcomes,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.210
and reduce malpractice.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:36.690
That openness, that trust,

00:13:36.749 --> 00:13:38.383
is only going to be more important

00:13:38.423 --> 00:13:42.013
as we move from the infectious
to the behavioral model of disease.

00:13:42.013 --> 00:13:45.487
Bacteria may not care so much
about trust and intimacy,

00:13:45.487 --> 00:13:49.430
but for people to tackle
the hard lifestyle choices,

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.728
to address issues like smoking cessation,

00:13:51.728 --> 00:13:54.765
blood-pressure management
and diabetes control,

00:13:54.765 --> 00:13:57.495
well, that requires us to establish trust.

00:13:59.003 --> 00:14:01.873
