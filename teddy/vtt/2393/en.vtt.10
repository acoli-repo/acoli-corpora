00:04:57.316 --> 00:05:01.135
between what patients need
and what doctors do?

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:03.051
Can we overcome the sickness of fear?

00:05:03.913 --> 00:05:05.280
Let me ask you differently:

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.103
If hiding isn't the answer,
what if we did the opposite?

00:05:09.103 --> 00:05:13.142
What if doctors were to become
totally transparent with their patients?

00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:17.272
Last fall, I conducted
a research study to find out

00:05:17.272 --> 00:05:20.125
what it is that people want
to know about their healthcare.

00:05:20.128 --> 00:05:22.513
I didn't just want to study
patients in a hospital,

00:05:22.514 --> 00:05:23.964
but everyday people.

00:05:23.965 --> 00:05:27.137
So my two medical students,
Suhavi Tucker and Laura Johns,

00:05:27.137 --> 00:05:29.532
literally took their research
to the streets.

00:05:29.532 --> 00:05:33.271
They went to banks,
coffee shops, senior centers,
