00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:30.644
"Too bad it wasn't a real bomb."

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:34.600
I never thought that I would do something

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.369
that would provoke this level of anger
among other doctors.

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:40.574
Becoming a doctor was my dream.

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:41.855
I grew up in China,

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.243
and my earliest memories
are of being rushed to the hospital

00:00:45.243 --> 00:00:48.588
because I had such bad asthma
that I was there nearly every week.

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:52.517
I had this one doctor, Dr. Sam,
who always took care of me.

00:00:52.517 --> 00:00:54.556
She was about the same age as my mother.

00:00:54.556 --> 00:00:56.626
She had this wild, curly hair,

00:00:56.626 --> 00:01:00.027
and she always wore
these bright yellow flowery dresses.
