00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:01.256
it can be an extraordinary benefit
to the practice of medicine.

00:15:01.256 --> 00:15:03.664
When doctors are willing
to step off our pedestals,

00:15:03.664 --> 00:15:05.140
take off our white coats,

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.521
and show our patients who we are
and what medicine is all about,

00:15:08.521 --> 00:15:11.786
that's when we begin
to overcome the sickness of fear.

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:13.715
That's when we establish trust.

00:15:13.715 --> 00:15:16.175
That's when we change
the paradigm of medicine

00:15:16.175 --> 00:15:17.985
from one of secrecy and hiding

00:15:17.985 --> 00:15:20.344
to one that is fully open and engaged

00:15:20.344 --> 00:15:21.718
for our patients.

00:15:23.027 --> 00:15:24.924
Thank you.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:28.924
