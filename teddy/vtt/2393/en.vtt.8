00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.340
we have to put on our white coats,

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.534
put up a wall, and hide behind it.

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.367
There's a hidden epidemic in medicine.

00:04:08.367 --> 00:04:11.182
Of course, patients are scared
when they come to the doctor.

00:04:11.182 --> 00:04:13.556
Imagine you wake up
with this terrible bellyache,

00:04:13.556 --> 00:04:14.742
you go to the hospital,

00:04:14.742 --> 00:04:17.993
you're lying in this strange place,
you're on this hospital gurney,

00:04:17.994 --> 00:04:19.550
you're wearing this flimsy gown,

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.709
strangers are coming
to poke and prod at you.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.553
You don't know what's going to happen.

00:04:23.554 --> 00:04:27.532
You don't even know if you're going to get
the blanket you asked for 30 minutes ago.

00:04:27.532 --> 00:04:29.793
But it's not just patients who are scared;

00:04:29.793 --> 00:04:31.660
doctors are scared too.
