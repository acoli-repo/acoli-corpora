00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.998
"My colleagues are astounded
by what I'm doing.

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:36.584
They ask me how I could be so brave.

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:39.472
I said, I'm not being brave,

00:14:39.552 --> 00:14:40.941
it's my job."

00:14:43.024 --> 00:14:45.218
I leave you today with a final thought.

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:49.732
Being totally transparent is scary.

00:14:49.772 --> 00:14:53.102
You feel naked, exposed and vulnerable,

00:14:53.102 --> 00:14:56.740
but that vulnerability, that humility,

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:01.256
it can be an extraordinary benefit
to the practice of medicine.
