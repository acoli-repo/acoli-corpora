00:08:28.288 --> 00:08:30.548
From a gastroenterologist in Portland:

00:08:30.548 --> 00:08:33.760
"I devoted 12 years of my life
to being a slave.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.707
I have loans and mortgages.

00:08:35.707 --> 00:08:38.517
I depend on lunches from
drug companies to serve patients."

00:08:39.985 --> 00:08:42.251
Well, times may be hard for everyone,

00:08:42.251 --> 00:08:43.972
but try telling your patient

00:08:43.972 --> 00:08:46.986
making 35,000 dollars a year
to serve a family of four

00:08:46.986 --> 00:08:48.664
that you need the free lunch.

00:08:50.708 --> 00:08:53.041
From an orthopedic surgeon in Charlotte:

00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:57.639
"I find it an invasion of my privacy
to disclose where my income comes from.

00:08:57.639 --> 00:08:59.932
My patients don't disclose
their incomes to me."
