00:07:29.883 --> 00:07:32.887
and we talk about how we're paid.

00:07:32.887 --> 00:07:34.431
Incentives matter.

00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:36.618
If you go to your doctor
because of back pain,

00:07:36.618 --> 00:07:40.447
you might want to know he's getting paid
5,000 dollars to perform spine surgery

00:07:40.447 --> 00:07:44.141
versus 25 dollars to refer you
to see a physical therapist,

00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:47.665
or if he's getting paid the same thing
no matter what he recommends.

00:07:48.549 --> 00:07:51.247
Then, we go one step further.

00:07:51.247 --> 00:07:53.959
We add our values
when it comes to women's health,

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:56.180
LGBT health, alternative medicine,

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.191
preventive health,
and end-of-life decisions.

00:07:59.191 --> 00:08:02.711
We pledge to our patients
that we are here to serve you,
