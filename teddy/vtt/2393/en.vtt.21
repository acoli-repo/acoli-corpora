"If doctors are doing something
they're that ashamed of,

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.990
they shouldn't be doing it."

00:10:34.121 --> 00:10:37.175
"Elected officials have to disclose
campaign contributions.

00:10:37.175 --> 00:10:39.960
Lawyers have to disclose
conflicts of interests.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.782
Why shouldn't doctors?"

00:10:41.782 --> 00:10:44.510
And finally, many people wrote and said,

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.678
"Let us patients decide

00:10:46.678 --> 00:10:48.991
what's important
when we're choosing a doctor."

00:10:50.439 --> 00:10:51.833
In our initial trial,

00:10:51.833 --> 00:10:55.436
over 300 doctors have taken
the total transparency pledge.

00:10:56.289 --> 00:10:58.841
What a crazy new idea, right?

00:10:58.841 --> 00:11:01.822
But actually, this is not
that new of a concept at all.
