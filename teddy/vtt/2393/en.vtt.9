00:04:29.793 --> 00:04:31.660
doctors are scared too.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.526
We're scared of patients
finding out who we are

00:04:34.526 --> 00:04:36.656
and what medicine is all about.

00:04:36.656 --> 00:04:38.247
And so what do we do?

00:04:38.247 --> 00:04:41.253
We put on our white coats
and we hide behind them.

00:04:41.253 --> 00:04:42.962
Of course, the more we hide,

00:04:42.962 --> 00:04:45.761
the more people want to know
what it is that we're hiding.

00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:49.213
The more fear then spirals
into mistrust and poor medical care.

00:04:49.213 --> 00:04:51.489
We don't just have a fear of sickness,

00:04:51.489 --> 00:04:53.723
we have a sickness of fear.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.316
Can we bridge this disconnect

00:04:57.316 --> 00:05:01.135
between what patients need
and what doctors do?
