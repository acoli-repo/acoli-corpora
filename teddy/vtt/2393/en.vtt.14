00:06:57.627 --> 00:07:00.585
Just because doctors
have to see every patient

00:07:00.585 --> 00:07:03.170
doesn't mean that patients
have to see every doctor.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.388
People want to know
about their doctors first

00:07:05.388 --> 00:07:07.344
so that they can make an informed choice.

00:07:08.792 --> 00:07:10.968
As a result of this, I formed a campaign,

00:07:10.968 --> 00:07:12.442
Who's My Doctor?

00:07:12.442 --> 00:07:15.302
that calls for total
transparency in medicine.

00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:17.534
Participating doctors voluntarily disclose

00:07:17.534 --> 00:07:18.927
on a public website

00:07:18.927 --> 00:07:21.683
not just information
about where we went to medical school

00:07:21.683 --> 00:07:23.029
and what specialty we're in,

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:24.982
but also our conflicts of interest.

00:07:24.982 --> 00:07:27.446
We go beyond
the Government in the Sunshine Act

00:07:27.446 --> 00:07:29.883
about drug company affiliations,

00:07:29.883 --> 00:07:32.887
and we talk about how we're paid.
