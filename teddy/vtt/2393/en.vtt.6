00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.817
There's another side to this fear.

00:03:01.817 --> 00:03:05.000
As a medical student, I was taking care
of this 19-year-old

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.499
who was biking back to his dorm

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:08.638
when he got struck and hit,

00:03:08.638 --> 00:03:11.166

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:12.852
He had seven broken ribs,

00:03:12.852 --> 00:03:14.225
shattered hip bones,

00:03:14.225 --> 00:03:17.424

00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:21.368
who flew in from Seattle,
2,000 miles away,

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:23.764
to find their son in a coma.

00:03:23.764 --> 00:03:26.770
I mean, you'd want to find out
what's going on with him, right?

00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:28.689
They asked to attend our bedside rounds

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.891
where we discussed
his condition and his plan,
