00:12:57.413 --> 00:13:01.884
That was the single hardest
decision I ever made,

00:13:01.884 --> 00:13:03.503
to let her die in peace,

00:13:04.933 --> 00:13:07.633
and I carry those words
of those doctors with me

00:13:07.633 --> 00:13:08.934
every single day.

00:13:11.142 --> 00:13:13.296
We can bridge the disconnect

00:13:13.356 --> 00:13:17.137
between what doctors do
and what patients need.

00:13:18.157 --> 00:13:20.838
We can get there,
because we've been there before,

00:13:20.838 --> 00:13:23.331
and we know that transparency
gets us to that trust.

00:13:23.331 --> 00:13:26.096
Research has shown us
that openness also helps doctors,

00:13:26.096 --> 00:13:27.702
that having open medical records,

00:13:27.702 --> 00:13:29.739
being willing to talk
about medical errors,

00:13:29.739 --> 00:13:31.429
will increase patient trust,
