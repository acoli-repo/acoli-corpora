00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:30.891
where we discussed
his condition and his plan,

00:03:30.891 --> 00:03:32.888
which I thought was a reasonable request,

00:03:32.888 --> 00:03:34.938
and also would give us
a chance to show them

00:03:34.938 --> 00:03:37.128
how much we were trying
and how much we cared.

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.290
The head doctor, though, said no.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.932
He gave all kinds of reasons.

00:03:41.932 --> 00:03:43.814
Maybe they'll get in the nurse's way.

00:03:43.814 --> 00:03:47.950
Maybe they'll stop students
from asking questions.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.387
He even said,

00:03:49.387 --> 00:03:52.593
"What if they see mistakes and sue us?"

00:03:53.595 --> 00:03:56.777
What I saw behind every excuse
was deep fear,

00:03:56.777 --> 00:03:59.499
and what I learned
was that to become a doctor,

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.340
we have to put on our white coats,
