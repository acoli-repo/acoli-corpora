00:04:59.843 --> 00:05:01.678
you can potentially blow the brain up

00:05:01.702 --> 00:05:05.079
to where you could distinguish
those tiny biomolecules from each other.

00:05:05.103 --> 00:05:07.973
You would see those connections
and get maps of the brain.

00:05:07.997 --> 00:05:09.985
This could potentially be quite dramatic.

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.017
We brought a little demo here.

00:05:13.538 --> 00:05:16.113
We got some purified baby diaper material.

00:05:16.137 --> 00:05:18.411
It's much easier
just to buy it off the Internet

00:05:18.435 --> 00:05:21.910
than to extract the few grains
that actually occur in these diapers.

00:05:21.934 --> 00:05:24.159
I'm going to put just one teaspoon here

00:05:24.706 --> 00:05:26.500
of this purified polymer.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.422
And here we have some water.

00:05:29.446 --> 00:05:30.608
What we're going to do
