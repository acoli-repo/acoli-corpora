00:00:28.076 --> 00:00:30.242
maybe a thousand times in volume.

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:33.502
And this is a very useful,
industrial kind of polymer.

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:36.345
But what we're trying to do
in my group at MIT

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:39.582
is to figure out if we can do
something similar to the brain.

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:40.765
Can we make it bigger,

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:42.467
big enough that you
can peer inside

00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:45.109
and see all the tiny building blocks,
the biomolecules,

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.284
how they're organized in three dimensions,

00:00:47.308 --> 00:00:50.793
the structure, the ground truth
structure of the brain, if you will?

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:51.975
If we could get that,

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:55.508
maybe we could have a better understanding
of how the brain is organized

00:00:55.532 --> 00:00:57.191
to yield thoughts and emotions

00:00:57.215 --> 00:00:58.934
and actions and sensations.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.373
Maybe we could try to pinpoint
the exact changes in the brain
