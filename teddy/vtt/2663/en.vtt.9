00:04:29.153 --> 00:04:31.321
to get down to the ground truth structure,

00:04:31.345 --> 00:04:34.625
we're going to need to have
even better technologies.

00:04:35.611 --> 00:04:37.835
My group, a couple years ago,
started thinking:

00:04:37.859 --> 00:04:39.271
Why don't we do the opposite?

00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:41.756
If it's so darn complicated
to zoom in to the brain,

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.723
why can't we make the brain bigger?

00:04:44.166 --> 00:04:45.321
It initially started

00:04:45.345 --> 00:04:48.341
with two grad students in my group,
Fei Chen and Paul Tillberg.

00:04:48.365 --> 00:04:51.085
Now many others in my group
are helping with this process.

00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:53.871
We decided to try to figure out
if we could take polymers,

00:04:53.895 --> 00:04:55.524
like the stuff in the baby diaper,

00:04:55.548 --> 00:04:57.554
and install it physically
within the brain.

00:04:57.578 --> 00:04:59.819
If we could do it just right,
and you add water,

00:04:59.843 --> 00:05:01.678
you can potentially blow the brain up
