Hello, everybody.

00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.976
I brought with me today a baby diaper.

00:00:06.793 --> 00:00:08.515
You'll see why in a second.

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:10.549
Baby diapers have interesting properties.

00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:13.264
They can swell enormously
when you add water to them,

00:00:13.288 --> 00:00:16.272
an experiment done
by millions of kids every day.

00:00:16.296 --> 00:00:17.446
(Laughter)

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.964
But the reason why

00:00:18.988 --> 00:00:21.178
is that they're designed
in a very clever way.

00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:23.837
They're made out of a thing
called a swellable material.

00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:26.598
It's a special kind of material that,
when you add water,

00:00:26.622 --> 00:00:28.052
it will swell up enormously,

00:00:28.076 --> 00:00:30.242
maybe a thousand times in volume.
