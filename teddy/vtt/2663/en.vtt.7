00:03:27.793 --> 00:03:31.036
We've all seen lots of different
technologies over the last century

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.226
to try to confront this.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.130
I think we've all seen brain scans

00:03:34.154 --> 00:03:36.188
taken using MRI machines.

00:03:36.212 --> 00:03:39.559
These, of course, have the great power
that they are noninvasive,

00:03:39.583 --> 00:03:41.938
they can be used on living human subjects.

00:03:42.407 --> 00:03:44.638
But also, they're spatially crude.

00:03:44.662 --> 00:03:47.652
Each of these blobs that you see,
or voxels, as they're called,

00:03:47.676 --> 00:03:50.365
can contain millions
and millions of neurons.

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.239
So it's not at the level of resolution

00:03:52.263 --> 00:03:54.801
where it can pinpoint
the molecular changes that occur

00:03:54.825 --> 00:03:57.111
or the changes in the wiring
of these networks

00:03:57.135 --> 00:04:01.081
that contributes to our ability
to be conscious and powerful beings.
