00:03:57.135 --> 00:04:01.081
that contributes to our ability
to be conscious and powerful beings.

00:04:01.797 --> 00:04:04.978
At the other extreme,
you have microscopes.

00:04:05.002 --> 00:04:08.297
Microscopes, of course, will use light
to look at little tiny things.

00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:11.396
For centuries, they've been used
to look at things like bacteria.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.571
For neuroscience,

00:04:12.595 --> 00:04:16.007
microscopes are actually how neurons
were discovered in the first place,

00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:17.323
about 130 years ago.

00:04:17.347 --> 00:04:19.665
But light is fundamentally limited.

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:22.987
You can't see individual molecules
with a regular old microscope.

00:04:23.011 --> 00:04:25.163
You can't look at these tiny connections.

00:04:25.187 --> 00:04:29.129
So if we want to make our ability
to see the brain more powerful,

00:04:29.153 --> 00:04:31.321
to get down to the ground truth structure,
