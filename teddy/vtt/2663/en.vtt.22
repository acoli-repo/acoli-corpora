00:10:57.476 --> 00:11:00.181
It turns out that throughout biomedicine,

00:11:00.205 --> 00:11:02.871
there are other problems
that expansion might help with.

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:06.129
This is an actual biopsy
from a human breast cancer patient.

00:11:06.505 --> 00:11:08.693
It turns out that if you look at cancers,

00:11:08.717 --> 00:11:10.328
if you look at the immune system,

00:11:10.352 --> 00:11:12.865
if you look at aging,
if you look at development --

00:11:12.889 --> 00:11:17.386
all these processes are involving
large-scale biological systems.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:21.434
But of course, the problems begin
with those little nanoscale molecules,

00:11:21.458 --> 00:11:25.327
the machines that make the cells
and the organs in our body tick.

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.573
So what we're trying
to do now is to figure out

00:11:27.597 --> 00:11:31.063
if we can actually use this technology
to map the building blocks of life
