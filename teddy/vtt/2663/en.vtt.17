00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:30.565
And much like drawing
a picture on a balloon,

00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:32.176
and then you blow up the balloon,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.490
the image is the same,

00:08:33.514 --> 00:08:36.062
but the ink particles have moved
away from each other.

00:08:36.086 --> 00:08:39.553
And that's what we've been able
to do now, but in three dimensions.

00:08:39.577 --> 00:08:41.576
There's one last trick.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.818
As you can see here,

00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:44.951
we've color-coded
all the biomolecules brown.

00:08:44.975 --> 00:08:47.145
That's because they all
kind of look the same.

00:08:47.169 --> 00:08:49.274
Biomolecules are made
out of the same atoms,

00:08:49.298 --> 00:08:51.538
but just in different orders.

00:08:51.562 --> 00:08:53.062
So we need one last thing

00:08:53.086 --> 00:08:54.781
in order to make them visible.

00:08:54.805 --> 00:08:56.384
We have to bring in little tags,

00:08:56.408 --> 00:08:59.427
with glowing dyes
that will distinguish them.

00:08:59.451 --> 00:09:02.124
So one kind of biomolecule
might get a blue color.
