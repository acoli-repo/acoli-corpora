00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:00.502
The density of the brain is incredible.

00:02:00.526 --> 00:02:02.833
In a cubic millimeter of your brain,

00:02:02.857 --> 00:02:05.314
there are about 100,000 of these neurons

00:02:05.338 --> 00:02:07.855
and maybe a billion of those connections.

00:02:08.887 --> 00:02:10.269
But it's worse.

00:02:10.293 --> 00:02:12.598
So, if you could zoom in to a neuron,

00:02:12.622 --> 00:02:15.372
and, of course, this is just
our artist's rendition of it.

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:19.603
What you would see are thousands
and thousands of kinds of biomolecules,

00:02:19.627 --> 00:02:24.027
little nanoscale machines
organized in complex, 3D patterns,

00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:26.679
and together they mediate
those electrical pulses,

00:02:26.703 --> 00:02:30.640
those chemical exchanges
that allow neurons to work together
