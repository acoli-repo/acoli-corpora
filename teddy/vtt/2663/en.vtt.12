00:05:59.982 --> 00:06:02.576
in a way that you can't do
with past technologies.

00:06:03.227 --> 00:06:05.281
OK. So a little bit of chemistry now.

00:06:05.305 --> 00:06:07.747
What's going on
in the baby diaper polymer?

00:06:07.771 --> 00:06:09.447
If you could zoom in,

00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:12.144
it might look something like
what you see on the screen.

00:06:12.168 --> 00:06:16.660
Polymers are chains of atoms
arranged in long, thin lines.

00:06:16.684 --> 00:06:18.051
The chains are very tiny,

00:06:18.075 --> 00:06:19.939
about the width of a biomolecule,

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:21.710
and these polymers are really dense.

00:06:21.734 --> 00:06:23.234
They're separated by distances

00:06:23.258 --> 00:06:25.510
that are around the size of a biomolecule.

00:06:25.534 --> 00:06:26.699
This is very good

00:06:26.723 --> 00:06:29.764
because we could potentially
move everything apart in the brain.

00:06:29.788 --> 00:06:31.636
If we add water, what will happen is,
