00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.373
Maybe we could try to pinpoint
the exact changes in the brain

00:01:02.397 --> 00:01:04.173
that result in diseases,

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:07.409
diseases like Alzheimer's
and epilepsy and Parkinson's,

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:10.011
for which there are few
treatments, much less cures,

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:13.652
and for which, very often,
we don't know the cause or the origins

00:01:13.676 --> 00:01:15.811
and what's really causing them to occur.

00:01:16.613 --> 00:01:18.353
Now, our group at MIT

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:21.063
is trying to take
a different point of view

00:01:21.087 --> 00:01:24.317
from the way neuroscience has
been done over the last hundred years.

00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:25.920
We're designers. We're inventors.

00:01:25.944 --> 00:01:28.488
We're trying to figure out
how to build technologies

00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:30.968
that let us look at and repair the brain.
