00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:30.111
and to exert their force.

00:07:31.278 --> 00:07:34.439
Now, if you just take baby diaper
polymer and dump it on the brain,

00:07:34.463 --> 00:07:36.500
obviously, it's going to sit there on top.

00:07:36.524 --> 00:07:39.052
So we need to find a way
to make the polymers inside.

00:07:39.076 --> 00:07:40.864
And this is where we're really lucky.

00:07:40.888 --> 00:07:43.076
It turns out, you can
get the building blocks,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.472
monomers, as they're called,

00:07:44.496 --> 00:07:46.280
and if you let them go into the brain

00:07:46.304 --> 00:07:48.340
and then trigger the chemical reactions,

00:07:48.364 --> 00:07:51.066
you can get them to form
those long chains,

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:52.888
right there inside the brain tissue.

00:07:53.325 --> 00:07:55.722
They're going to wind their way
around biomolecules

00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:56.967
and between biomolecules,

00:07:56.991 --> 00:07:58.616
forming those complex webs

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.502
that will allow you, eventually,
to pull apart the molecules
