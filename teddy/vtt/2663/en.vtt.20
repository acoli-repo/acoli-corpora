00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:01.509
So now we can take
actual brain circuitry --

00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:04.667
here's a piece of the brain
involved with, for example, memory --

00:10:04.691 --> 00:10:05.954
and we can zoom in.

00:10:05.978 --> 00:10:08.868
We can start to actually look at
how circuits are configured.

00:10:08.892 --> 00:10:10.860
Maybe someday we could read out a memory.

00:10:10.884 --> 00:10:13.663
Maybe we could actually look
at how circuits are configured

00:10:13.687 --> 00:10:14.839
to process emotions,

00:10:14.863 --> 00:10:17.785
how the actual wiring
of our brain is organized

00:10:17.809 --> 00:10:20.376
in order to make us who we are.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.447
And of course, we can pinpoint, hopefully,

00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:25.630
the actual problems in the brain
at a molecular level.

00:10:25.654 --> 00:10:28.223
What if we could actually
look into cells in the brain

00:10:28.247 --> 00:10:31.330
and figure out, wow, here are the 17
molecules that have altered
