00:08:59.451 --> 00:09:02.124
So one kind of biomolecule
might get a blue color.

00:09:02.148 --> 00:09:04.499
Another kind of biomolecule
might get a red color.

00:09:04.523 --> 00:09:05.799
And so forth.

00:09:05.823 --> 00:09:07.375
And that's the final step.

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:09.677
Now we can look at something like a brain

00:09:09.701 --> 00:09:11.497
and look at the individual molecules,

00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:14.228
because we've moved them
far apart enough from each other

00:09:14.252 --> 00:09:15.950
that we can tell them apart.

00:09:15.974 --> 00:09:18.808
So the hope here is that
we can make the invisible visible.

00:09:18.832 --> 00:09:21.398
We can turn things that might seem
small and obscure

00:09:21.422 --> 00:09:22.573
and blow them up

00:09:22.597 --> 00:09:25.774
until they're like constellations
of information about life.

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:28.173
Here's an actual video
of what it might look like.

00:09:28.197 --> 00:09:30.568
We have here a little brain in a dish --
