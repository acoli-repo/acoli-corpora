00:01:28.512 --> 00:01:30.968
that let us look at and repair the brain.

00:01:30.992 --> 00:01:32.143
And the reason is,

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:34.968
the brain is incredibly,
incredibly complicated.

00:01:35.484 --> 00:01:38.371
So what we've learned
over the first century of neuroscience

00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:40.698
is that the brain is a very
complicated network,

00:01:40.722 --> 00:01:43.202
made out of very specialized
cells called neurons

00:01:43.226 --> 00:01:44.893
with very complex geometries,

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:49.154
and electrical currents will flow
through these complexly shaped neurons.

00:01:49.653 --> 00:01:52.437
Furthermore, neurons
are connected in networks.

00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:56.296
They're connected by little junctions
called synapses that exchange chemicals

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.538
and allow the neurons
to talk to each other.

00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:00.502
The density of the brain is incredible.
