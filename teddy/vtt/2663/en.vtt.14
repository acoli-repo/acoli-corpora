00:06:58.777 --> 00:07:00.166
We could look at the wiring.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.347
We can peer inside
and see the molecules within.

00:07:03.925 --> 00:07:06.406
To explain this, we made some animations

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.033
where we actually look
at, in these artist renderings,

00:07:09.057 --> 00:07:12.598
what biomolecules might look
like and how we might separate them.

00:07:12.622 --> 00:07:15.171
Step one: what we'd have
to do, first of all,

00:07:15.195 --> 00:07:18.584
is attach every biomolecule,
shown in brown here,

00:07:18.608 --> 00:07:20.767
to a little anchor, a little handle.

00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:23.886
We need to pull the molecules
of the brain apart from each other,

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.236
and to do that, we need
to have a little handle

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.545
that allows those polymers to bind to them

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:30.111
and to exert their force.
