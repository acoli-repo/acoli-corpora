00:05:29.446 --> 00:05:30.608
What we're going to do

00:05:30.632 --> 00:05:33.643
is see if this teaspoon
of the baby diaper material

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.376
can increase in size.

00:05:36.687 --> 00:05:40.383
You're going to see it increase in volume
by about a thousandfold

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:41.693
before your very eyes.

00:05:49.597 --> 00:05:51.569
I could pour much more of this in there,

00:05:51.593 --> 00:05:53.151
but I think you've got the idea

00:05:53.175 --> 00:05:55.677
that this is a very,
very interesting molecule,

00:05:55.701 --> 00:05:57.613
and if can use it in the right way,

00:05:57.637 --> 00:05:59.958
we might be able
to really zoom in on the brain

00:05:59.982 --> 00:06:02.576
in a way that you can't do
with past technologies.
