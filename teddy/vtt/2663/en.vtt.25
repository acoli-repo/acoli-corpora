You know, my wife and I
have two young kids,

00:12:31.602 --> 00:12:34.836
and one of my hopes as a bioengineer
is to make life better for them

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.589
than it currently is for us.

00:12:36.613 --> 00:12:40.343
And my hope is, if we can
turn biology and medicine

00:12:40.367 --> 00:12:44.724
from these high-risk endeavors
that are governed by chance and luck,

00:12:44.748 --> 00:12:48.675
and make them things
that we win by skill and hard work,

00:12:48.699 --> 00:12:50.597
then that would be a great advance.

00:12:50.621 --> 00:12:51.827
Thank you very much.
