00:09:28.197 --> 00:09:30.568
We have here a little brain in a dish --

00:09:30.592 --> 00:09:32.339
a little piece of a brain, actually.

00:09:32.363 --> 00:09:33.959
We've infused the polymer in,

00:09:33.983 --> 00:09:35.450
and now we're adding water.

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:37.832
What you'll see is that,
right before your eyes --

00:09:37.856 --> 00:09:39.779
this video is sped up about sixtyfold --

00:09:39.803 --> 00:09:42.528
this little piece of brain tissue
is going to grow.

00:09:42.552 --> 00:09:45.732
It can increase by a hundredfold
or even more in volume.

00:09:45.756 --> 00:09:48.705
And the cool part is, because
those polymers are so tiny,

00:09:48.729 --> 00:09:51.288
we're separating biomolecules
evenly from each other.

00:09:51.312 --> 00:09:52.970
It's a smooth expansion.

00:09:52.994 --> 00:09:55.681
We're not losing the configuration
of the information.

00:09:55.705 --> 00:09:58.405
We're just making it easier to see.

00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:01.509
So now we can take
actual brain circuitry --
