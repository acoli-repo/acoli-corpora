00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.596
from sensory regions,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.356
mixes it with emotion and feeling,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.774
and generates our decisions and actions.

00:03:05.131 --> 00:03:08.920
Maybe we could pinpoint the exact set
of molecular changes that occur

00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:10.146
in a brain disorder.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.992
And once we know how
those molecules have changed,

00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:15.796
whether they've increased in number
or changed in pattern,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.759
we could use those
as targets for new drugs,

00:03:18.783 --> 00:03:21.054
for new ways of delivering
energy into the brain

00:03:21.078 --> 00:03:24.958
in order to repair the brain
computations that are afflicted

00:03:24.982 --> 00:03:27.281
in patients who suffer
from brain disorders.

00:03:27.793 --> 00:03:31.036
We've all seen lots of different
technologies over the last century
