00:10:28.247 --> 00:10:31.330
and figure out, wow, here are the 17
molecules that have altered

00:10:31.354 --> 00:10:34.809
in this brain tissue that has been
undergoing epilepsy

00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:36.483
or changing in Parkinson's disease

00:10:36.507 --> 00:10:38.024
or otherwise being altered?

00:10:38.048 --> 00:10:41.091
If we get that systematic list
of things that are going wrong,

00:10:41.115 --> 00:10:43.314
those become our therapeutic targets.

00:10:43.338 --> 00:10:45.015
We can build drugs that bind those.

00:10:45.039 --> 00:10:47.666
We can maybe aim energy
at different parts of the brain

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.377
in order to help people
with Parkinson's or epilepsy

00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:52.952
or other conditions that affect
over a billion people

00:10:52.976 --> 00:10:54.189
around the world.

00:10:55.246 --> 00:10:57.452
Now, something interesting
has been happening.

00:10:57.476 --> 00:11:00.181
It turns out that throughout biomedicine,
