00:11:59.414 --> 00:12:00.755
we understood aerodynamics.

00:12:00.779 --> 00:12:02.174
We knew how to build rockets.

00:12:02.198 --> 00:12:04.666
The science risk was under control.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.443
It was still a great, great
feat of engineering.

00:12:07.467 --> 00:12:10.112
But in medicine, we don't
necessarily have all the laws.

00:12:10.136 --> 00:12:13.245
Do we have all the laws
that are analogous to gravity,

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:15.613
that are analogous to aerodynamics?

00:12:15.637 --> 00:12:17.367
I would argue that with technologies

00:12:17.391 --> 00:12:19.263
like the kinds I'm talking about today,

00:12:19.287 --> 00:12:20.980
maybe we can actually derive those.

00:12:21.004 --> 00:12:23.861
We can map the patterns
that occur in living systems,

00:12:23.885 --> 00:12:28.443
and figure out how to overcome
the diseases that plague us.

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.578
You know, my wife and I
have two young kids,
