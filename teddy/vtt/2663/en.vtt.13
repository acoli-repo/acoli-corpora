00:06:29.788 --> 00:06:31.636
If we add water, what will happen is,

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.175
this swellable material
is going to absorb the water,

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.599
the polymer chains will move
apart from each other,

00:06:36.623 --> 00:06:39.257
and the entire material
is going to become bigger.

00:06:39.615 --> 00:06:41.429
And because these chains are so tiny

00:06:41.453 --> 00:06:43.658
and spaced by biomolecular distances,

00:06:43.682 --> 00:06:45.721
we could potentially blow up the brain

00:06:45.745 --> 00:06:47.378
and make it big enough to see.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.260
Here's the mystery, then:

00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:52.894
How do we actually make
these polymer chains inside the brain

00:06:52.918 --> 00:06:55.157
so we can move all the biomolecules apart?

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:56.332
If we could do that,

00:06:56.356 --> 00:06:58.753
maybe we could get
ground truth maps of the brain.

00:06:58.777 --> 00:07:00.166
We could look at the wiring.
