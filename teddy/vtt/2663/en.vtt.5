00:02:26.703 --> 00:02:30.640
those chemical exchanges
that allow neurons to work together

00:02:30.664 --> 00:02:34.333
to generate things like thoughts
and feelings and so forth.

00:02:34.357 --> 00:02:38.121
Now, we don't know how
the neurons in the brain are organized

00:02:38.145 --> 00:02:39.319
to form networks,

00:02:39.343 --> 00:02:41.843
and we don't know how
the biomolecules are organized

00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:43.041
within neurons

00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:45.470
to form these complex, organized machines.

00:02:45.918 --> 00:02:47.738
If we really want to understand this,

00:02:47.762 --> 00:02:49.579
we're going to need new technologies.

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:51.387
But if we could get such maps,

00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:54.354
if we could look at the organization
of molecules and neurons

00:02:54.378 --> 00:02:55.944
and neurons and networks,

00:02:55.968 --> 00:02:59.405
maybe we could really understand
how the brain conducts information

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.596
from sensory regions,
