00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:04.346
I met 273 start-up founders last year.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:06.952
And each one was looking for money.

00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:08.413
As a tech investor,

00:00:08.437 --> 00:00:11.101
my goal was to sort through
everyone that I met

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:12.760
and make a quick determination

00:00:12.784 --> 00:00:16.267
about which ones had the potential
to make something really big.

00:00:16.887 --> 00:00:18.591
But what makes a great founder?

00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:20.824
This is a question I ask myself daily.

00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:23.043
Some venture capitalists place bets

00:00:23.067 --> 00:00:25.472
based on a founder's previous background.

00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:27.448
Did they go to an Ivy League school?

00:00:27.472 --> 00:00:29.395
Have they worked at a blue-chip company?

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:31.363
Have they built out a big vision before?
