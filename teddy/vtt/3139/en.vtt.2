00:00:56.815 --> 00:01:01.539
and risk of exposure to mycotoxin,
poison produced by fungi.

00:01:02.318 --> 00:01:03.580
The problems that we face

00:01:03.604 --> 00:01:06.321
is that the current method
used to prevent and treat

00:01:06.345 --> 00:01:07.887
those dreadful diseases,

00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:12.220
such as genetic control,
exploiting natural sources of resistance,

00:01:12.244 --> 00:01:15.625
crop rotation or seed
treatment, among others,

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.331
are still limited or ephemeral.

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:21.299
They have to be constantly renewed.

00:01:21.323 --> 00:01:25.577
Therefore, we urgently need
to develop more efficient strategies

00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:30.720
and for this, research is required
to identify biological mechanisms
