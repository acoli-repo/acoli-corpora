As well, we could characterize

00:03:02.085 --> 00:03:05.000
the fungal receptor
receiving those signals

00:03:05.024 --> 00:03:08.720
and part of the underlying reaction
occurring within the fungus

00:03:08.744 --> 00:03:11.963
and leading to its direct growth
toward the plant.

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.553
(Applause)

00:03:15.577 --> 00:03:16.728
Thank you.

00:03:16.752 --> 00:03:18.006
(Applause)

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.793
The understanding
of such molecular processes

00:03:20.817 --> 00:03:23.315
offers a panel of potential molecules

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:27.139
that can be used to create
novel antifungal treatments.

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:30.002
And those treatments would disrupt
