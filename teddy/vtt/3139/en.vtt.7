00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:30.002
And those treatments would disrupt

00:03:30.026 --> 00:03:32.765
the interaction between
the fungus and the plant

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:35.487
either by blocking the plant signal

00:03:35.511 --> 00:03:39.852
or the fungal reception system
which receives those signals.

00:03:39.876 --> 00:03:43.042
Fungal infections have devastated
agriculture crops.

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:45.788
Moreover, we are now in an era

00:03:45.812 --> 00:03:49.363
where the demand of crop production
is increasing significantly.

00:03:49.387 --> 00:03:53.252
And this is due to population growth,
economic development,

00:03:53.276 --> 00:03:55.942
climate change and demand for bio fuels.

00:03:56.751 --> 00:03:59.823
Our understanding
of the molecular mechanism

00:03:59.847 --> 00:04:02.879
of interaction between
a fungus and its host plant,
