00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:30.720
and for this, research is required
to identify biological mechanisms

00:01:30.744 --> 00:01:34.410
that can be targeted
by novel antifungal treatments.

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:40.663
One feature of fungi
is that they cannot move

00:01:40.687 --> 00:01:44.212
and only grow by extension
to form a sophisticated network,

00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:45.386
the mycelium.

00:01:46.284 --> 00:01:50.537
In 1884, Anton de Bary,
the father of plant pathology,

00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:54.117
was the first to presume
that fungi are guided by signals

00:01:54.141 --> 00:01:56.077
sent out from the host plant,

00:01:56.101 --> 00:02:00.235
meaning a plant upon which
it can lodge and subsist,
