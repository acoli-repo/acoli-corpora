prevented him from identifying
this mechanism at the molecular level.

00:02:33.323 --> 00:02:36.450
Using purification and mutational
genomic approaches,

00:02:36.474 --> 00:02:37.998
as well as a technique

00:02:38.022 --> 00:02:41.355
allowing the measurement
of directed hyphal growth,

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.744
today I'm glad to tell you
that after 130 years,

00:02:45.768 --> 00:02:50.592
my former team and I
could finally identify such plant signals

00:02:50.616 --> 00:02:53.973
by studying the interaction
between a pathogenic fungus

00:02:53.997 --> 00:02:55.680
called Fusarium oxysporum

00:02:55.704 --> 00:02:58.878
and one of its host plants,
the tomato plant.
