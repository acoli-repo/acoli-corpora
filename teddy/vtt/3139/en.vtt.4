00:01:56.101 --> 00:02:00.235
meaning a plant upon which
it can lodge and subsist,

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.617
so signals act as a lighthouse

00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:07.807
for fungi to locate, grow toward, reach

00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:11.037
and finally invade and colonize a plant.

00:02:11.427 --> 00:02:14.373
He knew that the identification
of such signals

00:02:14.397 --> 00:02:19.022
would unlock a great knowledge
that then serves to elaborate strategy

00:02:19.046 --> 00:02:22.426
to block the interaction
between the fungus and the plant.

00:02:22.752 --> 00:02:26.172
However, the lack of an appropriate
method at that moment

00:02:26.196 --> 00:02:31.093
prevented him from identifying
this mechanism at the molecular level.
