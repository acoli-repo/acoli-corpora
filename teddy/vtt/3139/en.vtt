"Will the blight end the chestnut?

00:00:03.857 --> 00:00:05.857
The farmers rather guess not.

00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:08.119
It keeps smouldering at the roots

00:00:08.143 --> 00:00:10.151
And sending up new shoots

00:00:10.175 --> 00:00:11.841
Till another parasite

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:14.269
Shall come to end the blight."

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.549
At the beginning of the 20th century,

00:00:18.573 --> 00:00:23.220
the eastern American chestnut population,
counting nearly four billion trees,

00:00:23.244 --> 00:00:26.345
was completely decimated
by a fungal infection.

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.577
Fungi are the most destructive
pathogens of plants,

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:32.323
including crops of major
economic importance.
