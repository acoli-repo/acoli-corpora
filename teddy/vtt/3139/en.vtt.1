00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:32.323
including crops of major
economic importance.

00:00:32.673 --> 00:00:34.234
Can you imagine that today,

00:00:34.258 --> 00:00:37.125
crop losses associated
with fungal infection

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.065
are estimated at billions of dollars
per year, worldwide?

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:45.283
That represents enough food calories
to feed half a billion people.

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:47.967
And this leads to severe repercussions,

00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:51.411
including episodes of famine
in developing countries,

00:00:51.435 --> 00:00:54.839
large reduction of income
for farmers and distributors,

00:00:54.863 --> 00:00:56.791
high prices for consumers

00:00:56.815 --> 00:01:01.539
and risk of exposure to mycotoxin,
poison produced by fungi.
