00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.761
And sometimes, that's the loss
of someone they love,

00:12:00.785 --> 00:12:05.475
sometimes days ago or weeks ago,
years ago, even decades ago.

00:12:06.373 --> 00:12:08.903
And these people that I interview,

00:12:08.927 --> 00:12:11.235
they haven't closed themselves
around this loss

00:12:11.259 --> 00:12:13.609
and made it the center of their lives.

00:12:13.911 --> 00:12:18.212
They've lived, their worlds
have kept spinning.

00:12:19.478 --> 00:12:22.620
But they're talking to me,
a total stranger,

00:12:22.644 --> 00:12:24.579
about the person they love who has died,

00:12:24.603 --> 00:12:27.743
because these are the experiences

00:12:27.767 --> 00:12:32.854
that mark us and make us
just as much as the joyful ones.
