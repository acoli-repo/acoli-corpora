00:00:00.896 --> 00:00:03.437
So, 2014 was a big year for me.

00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:04.627
Do you ever have that,

00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:06.896
just like a big year, like a banner year?

00:00:07.198 --> 00:00:08.635
For me, it went like this:

00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:11.958
October 3, I lost my second pregnancy.

00:00:11.982 --> 00:00:15.077
And then October 8, my dad died of cancer.

00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:17.871
And then on November 25,
my husband Aaron died

00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:20.673
after three years
with stage-four glioblastoma,

00:00:20.697 --> 00:00:23.132
which is just a fancy word
for brain cancer.

00:00:24.822 --> 00:00:25.972
So, I'm fun.

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:28.012
(Laughter)

00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:31.877
People love to invite me out all the time.
