00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:02.696
and the research
that I have seen will stun you:

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.330
everyone you love has
a 100 percent chance of dying.

00:01:06.354 --> 00:01:08.950
(Laughter)

00:01:08.974 --> 00:01:10.545
And that's why you came to TED.

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:12.631
(Laughter)

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:15.967
(Applause)

00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:18.022
So, since all of this loss happened,

00:01:18.046 --> 00:01:22.339
I've made it a career
to talk about death and loss,

00:01:22.363 --> 00:01:24.783
not just my own,
because it's pretty easy to recap,

00:01:24.807 --> 00:01:28.853
but the losses and tragedies
that other people have experienced.

00:01:28.877 --> 00:01:31.216
It's a niche, I have to say.
