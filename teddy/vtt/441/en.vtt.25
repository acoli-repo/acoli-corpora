00:12:27.767 --> 00:12:32.854
that mark us and make us
just as much as the joyful ones.

00:12:33.355 --> 00:12:35.212
And just as permanently.

00:12:36.895 --> 00:12:39.466
Long after you get your last sympathy card

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.957
or your last hot dish.

00:12:41.546 --> 00:12:43.577
Like, we don't look
at the people around us

00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:48.100
experiencing life's joys and wonders
and tell them to "move on," do we?

00:12:48.124 --> 00:12:51.680
We don't send a card that's like,
"Congratulations on your beautiful baby,"

00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:55.395
and then, five years later, think like,
"Another birthday party? Get over it."

00:12:55.419 --> 00:12:57.085
(Laughter)

00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:58.768
Yeah, we get it, he's five.

00:12:58.792 --> 00:13:00.220
(Laughter)
