00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:01.696
"What if it's one
of the Property Brothers?"

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.266
Less normal, but I'll accept it.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.424
(Laughter)

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.751
Things like, "Look, when I'm out in public
and I see old people holding hands,

00:03:10.775 --> 00:03:13.361
couples who have clearly
been together for decades,

00:03:13.385 --> 00:03:15.712
and then I look at them and I imagine

00:03:15.736 --> 00:03:17.982
all of the things they've been
through together,

00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:19.545
the good things, the bad things,

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.640
the arguments they've had
over who should take out the trash ...

00:03:22.664 --> 00:03:25.696
I just find my heart filled with rage."

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.721
(Laughter)

00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:28.552
And that example is personal to me.
