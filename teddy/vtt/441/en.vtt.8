00:03:59.118 --> 00:04:00.289
"Oh, yeah."

00:04:00.313 --> 00:04:02.076
"Which ones did you hate the most?"

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.307
I got a lot of comments, lot of answers,
people say a lot of things,

00:04:05.331 --> 00:04:07.931
but two rose to the top pretty quickly.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.140
"Moving on."

00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:14.171
Now, since 2014,

00:04:14.195 --> 00:04:18.243
I will tell you I have remarried
a very handsome man named Matthew,

00:04:18.267 --> 00:04:21.370
we have four children
in our blended family,

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:24.887
we live in the suburbs
of Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.

00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:26.331
We have a rescue dog.

00:04:26.355 --> 00:04:27.662
(Laughter)

00:04:27.686 --> 00:04:29.098
I drive a minivan,

00:04:29.122 --> 00:04:31.938
like the kind where doors open
and I don't even touch them.
