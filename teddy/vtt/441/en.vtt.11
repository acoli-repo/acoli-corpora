00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:30.791
And when I talk about Aaron,
I slip so easily into the present tense,

00:05:30.815 --> 00:05:33.371
and I've always thought
that made me weird.

00:05:33.395 --> 00:05:35.819
And then I noticed that everybody does it.

00:05:36.595 --> 00:05:40.762
And it's not because we are in denial
or because we're forgetful,

00:05:40.786 --> 00:05:43.047
it's because the people
we love, who we've lost,

00:05:43.071 --> 00:05:45.229
are still so present for us.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.400
So, when I say, "Oh, Aaron is ..."

00:05:50.276 --> 00:05:52.521
It's because Aaron still is.

00:05:53.831 --> 00:05:55.871
And it's not in the way
that he was before,

00:05:55.895 --> 00:05:57.078
which was much better,

00:05:57.102 --> 00:06:00.744
and it's not in the way that churchy
people try to tell me that he would be.
