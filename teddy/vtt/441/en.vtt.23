00:11:29.053 --> 00:11:30.821
But I'm not, I'm not special.

00:11:30.845 --> 00:11:32.903
I know that, I'm fully aware

00:11:32.927 --> 00:11:35.434
that all day, every day,
all around the world,

00:11:35.458 --> 00:11:37.236
terrible things are happening.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:38.411
All the time.

00:11:38.435 --> 00:11:40.180
Like I said, fun person.

00:11:40.204 --> 00:11:42.690
But terrible things are happening,

00:11:42.714 --> 00:11:49.108
people are experiencing deeply formative
and traumatic losses every day.

00:11:49.132 --> 00:11:51.720
And as part of my job,

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:53.426
this weird podcast that I have,

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:54.698
I sometimes talk to people

00:11:54.722 --> 00:11:57.706
about the worst thing
that's ever happened to them.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.761
And sometimes, that's the loss
of someone they love,
