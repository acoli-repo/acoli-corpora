just so he can stay alive
a little bit longer with you,

00:07:30.047 --> 00:07:31.791
that stays with you.

00:07:33.196 --> 00:07:37.846
When you watch him fade from the healthy
person he was the night you met

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.453
to nothing, that stays with you.

00:07:39.477 --> 00:07:42.314
When you watch your son,
who isn't even two years old yet,

00:07:42.338 --> 00:07:45.029
walk up to his father's bed
on the last day of his life,

00:07:45.053 --> 00:07:47.323
like he knows what's coming
in a few hours,

00:07:47.347 --> 00:07:52.363
and say, "I love you. All done. Bye, bye."

00:07:53.776 --> 00:07:55.751
That stays with you.

00:07:57.347 --> 00:08:02.037
Just like when you fall in love,
finally, like really fall in love
