00:01:57.323 --> 00:02:01.545
So part of that work is this group
that I started with my friend Moe,

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:02.791
who is also a widow;

00:02:02.815 --> 00:02:05.350
we call it the Hot Young Widows Club.

00:02:05.374 --> 00:02:06.748
(Laughter)

00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:09.247
And it's real, we have membership cards

00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:10.644
and T-shirts.

00:02:11.272 --> 00:02:14.952
And when your person dies,
your husband, wife, girlfriend, boyfriend,

00:02:14.976 --> 00:02:16.967
literally don't care if you were married,

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:19.742
your friends and your family
are just going to look around

00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:22.122
through friends of friends
of friends of friends

00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:25.010
until they find someone
who's gone through something similar,

00:02:25.034 --> 00:02:27.395
and then they'll push you
towards each other

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:31.786
so you can talk amongst yourselves
and not get your sad on other people.
