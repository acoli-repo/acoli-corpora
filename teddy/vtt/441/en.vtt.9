00:04:29.122 --> 00:04:31.938
like the kind where doors open
and I don't even touch them.

00:04:31.962 --> 00:04:33.146
(Laughter)

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.363
Like, by any "mezhure," life is good.

00:04:36.387 --> 00:04:39.459
I've also never said "mezhure,"
I've never once said it that way.

00:04:39.483 --> 00:04:44.762
(Laughter)

00:04:44.786 --> 00:04:46.437
I don't know where that came from.

00:04:46.461 --> 00:04:48.222
(Laughter)

00:04:48.246 --> 00:04:50.521
I've never heard
anyone else say it that way.

00:04:50.545 --> 00:04:52.522
It looks like it should be said that way,

00:04:52.546 --> 00:04:55.103
and that's why the English
language is trash, so ...

00:04:55.127 --> 00:04:56.181
(Laughter)

00:04:56.205 --> 00:04:58.331
So impressed with anyone
who, like, speaks it

00:04:58.355 --> 00:05:01.228
in addition to a language
that makes sense -- good job.
