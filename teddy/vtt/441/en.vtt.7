00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:33.228
Most of the conversations
that we have in the group

00:03:33.252 --> 00:03:35.229
can and will just stay amongst ourselves,

00:03:35.253 --> 00:03:37.172
but there are things that we talk about

00:03:37.196 --> 00:03:40.379
that the rest of the world --
the world that is grief-adjacent

00:03:40.403 --> 00:03:41.917
but not yet grief-stricken --

00:03:41.941 --> 00:03:43.847
could really benefit from hearing.

00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:45.149
And if you can't tell,

00:03:45.173 --> 00:03:49.553
I'm only interested in / capable
of unscientific studies,

00:03:49.577 --> 00:03:51.951
so what I did was go to
The Hot Young Widows Club

00:03:51.975 --> 00:03:56.585
and say, "Hello, friends, remember
when your person died?" They did.

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.094
"Do you remember all the things
people said to you?"

00:03:59.118 --> 00:04:00.289
"Oh, yeah."
