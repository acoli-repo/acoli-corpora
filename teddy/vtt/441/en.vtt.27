00:13:27.315 --> 00:13:31.451
You understand what you're experiencing
is not a moment in time,

00:13:31.475 --> 00:13:33.417
it's not a bone that will reset,

00:13:33.441 --> 00:13:36.307
but that you've been touched
by something chronic.

00:13:36.919 --> 00:13:38.117
Something incurable.

00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:40.997
It's not fatal, but sometimes
grief feels like it could be.

00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:46.848
And if we can't prevent it in one another,

00:13:46.872 --> 00:13:48.189
what can we do?

00:13:50.554 --> 00:13:54.874
What can we do other than try
to remind one another

00:13:54.898 --> 00:13:57.604
that some things can't be fixed,

00:13:58.136 --> 00:14:01.318
and not all wounds are meant to heal?
