00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:31.786
so you can talk amongst yourselves
and not get your sad on other people.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.969
(Laughter)

00:02:33.993 --> 00:02:35.394
So that's what we do.

00:02:35.418 --> 00:02:38.910
It's just a series of small groups,

00:02:38.934 --> 00:02:42.483
where men, women, gay, straight,
married, partnered,

00:02:42.507 --> 00:02:46.776
can talk about their dead person,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.046
and say the things

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.789
that the other people in their lives
aren't ready or willing to hear yet.

00:02:51.813 --> 00:02:54.291
Huge range of conversations.

00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:56.103
Like, "My husband died two weeks ago,

00:02:56.127 --> 00:02:58.445
I can't stop thinking
about sex, is that normal?"

00:02:58.469 --> 00:02:59.623
Yeah.

00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:01.696
"What if it's one
of the Property Brothers?"
