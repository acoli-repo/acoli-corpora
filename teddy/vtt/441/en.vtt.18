00:08:58.374 --> 00:09:01.881
And I can't even tell you
if my hands were cold,

00:09:01.905 --> 00:09:03.461
but I can tell you

00:09:03.485 --> 00:09:06.413
that I knew it was the last time
I would ever do that.

00:09:08.209 --> 00:09:11.409
And that that memory
is always going to be sad.

00:09:11.733 --> 00:09:13.666
That memory will always hurt.

00:09:14.051 --> 00:09:16.895
Even when I'm 600 years old
and I'm just a hologram.

00:09:16.919 --> 00:09:19.196
(Laughter)

00:09:20.204 --> 00:09:25.897
Just like the memory of meeting him
is always going to make me laugh.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.654
Grief doesn't happen in this vacuum,

00:09:29.678 --> 00:09:36.146
it happens alongside of and mixed in
with all of these other emotions.
