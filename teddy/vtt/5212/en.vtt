00:00:07.163 --> 00:00:09.746
Wars are a tragic part of our history

00:00:09.746 --> 00:00:12.913
and they will surely be 
a tragic element of our future.

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.621
After the creation of the United Nation,

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:18.829
offensive wars have been outlawed

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:23.204
and multilateral conventions refer 
to armed conflict instead of war.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.079
But wars of the future
will not resemble our past wars.

00:00:27.454 --> 00:00:29.121
Flanked to the traditional warfare

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:31.663
the cyber-war 
will be part of our future.
