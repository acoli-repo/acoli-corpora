My name is Shari Davis,

00:00:02.587 --> 00:00:03.874
and let's be honest,

00:00:03.898 --> 00:00:05.898
I'm a recovering government employee.

00:00:06.722 --> 00:00:10.594
And I say that with a huge shout-out
to the folks that work in government

00:00:10.618 --> 00:00:12.474
and on systems change.

00:00:12.498 --> 00:00:13.839
It's hard.

00:00:13.863 --> 00:00:15.609
It can be isolating.

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:18.233
And the work can feel impossible.

00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:21.796
But government is the people that show up.

00:00:22.614 --> 00:00:25.498
Really, it's the people that can show up

00:00:25.522 --> 00:00:29.085
and are committed to the promise
that public service offers:

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.839
service to people,
