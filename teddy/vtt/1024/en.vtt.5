00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So there's about 86 billion neurons in our brain.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And as you can see, they're very non-uniformly distributed.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And how they're distributed really contributes

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
to their underlying function.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And of course, as I mentioned before,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
since we can now start to map brain function,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
we can start to tie these into the individual cells.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So let's take a deeper look.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Let's look at neurons.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So as I mentioned, there are 86 billion neurons.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
There are also these smaller cells as you'll see.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
These are support cells -- astrocytes glia.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And the nerves themselves

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
are the ones who are receiving input.
