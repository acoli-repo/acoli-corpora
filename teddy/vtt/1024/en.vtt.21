00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and either turn them off, etc.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
So if you want to understand the action of drugs,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
you want to understand how they're acting in the ways you want them to,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and also in the ways you don't want them to.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
In the side effect profile, etc.,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
you want to see where those genes are turned on.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And for the first time, we can actually do that.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
We can do that in multiple individuals that we've assayed too.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
So now we can look throughout the brain.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
We can see this unique fingerprint.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And we get confirmation.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
We get confirmation that, indeed, the gene is turned on --

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
for something like Prozac,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
in serotonergic structures, things that are already known be affected --
