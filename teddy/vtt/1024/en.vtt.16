WEBVTT

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and then we put a florescent tag on it.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
We take that tagged material

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and we put it on to something called a microarray.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Now this may look like a bunch of dots to you,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
but each one of these individual dots

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
is actually a unique piece of the human genome

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
that we spotted down on glass.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
This has roughly 60,000 elements on it,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
so we repeatedly measure various genes

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
of the 25,000 genes in the genome.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
we get a unique fingerprint, if you will,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Now we do this over and over again,
