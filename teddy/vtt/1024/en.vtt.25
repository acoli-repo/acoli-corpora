00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
we all have different genetic backgrounds,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
we all have lived separate lives.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
But the fact is

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
our genomes are greater than 99 percent similar.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
We're similar at the genetic level.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And what we're finding

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
is actually, even at the brain biochemical level,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
we are quite similar.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And so this shows it's not 99 percent,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
but it's roughly 90 percent correspondence

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
at a reasonable cutoff,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
so everything in the cloud is roughly correlated.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And then we find some outliers,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
some things that lie beyond the cloud.
