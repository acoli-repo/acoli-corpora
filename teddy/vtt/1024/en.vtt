00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Humans have long held a fascination

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
for the human brain.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We chart it, we've described it,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we've drawn it,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
we've mapped it.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now just like the physical maps of our world

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that have been highly influenced by technology --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
think Google Maps,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
think GPS --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the same thing is happening for brain mapping

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
through transformation.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So let's take a look at the brain.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Most people, when they first look at a fresh human brain,
