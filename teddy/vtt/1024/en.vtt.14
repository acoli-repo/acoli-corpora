00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Then we very carefully melt onto the slide.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
This will then go onto a robot

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
that's going to apply one of those stains to it.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So again this is what they can see under the microscope.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
You can see collections and configurations

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
of large and small cells

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
in clusters and various places.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And from there it's routine. They understand where to make these assignments.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And they can make basically what's a reference atlas.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
This is a more detailed map.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Our scientists then use this
