00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
is a medical examiner's office.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
This a place where the dead are brought in.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
We are seeking normal human brains.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
There's a lot of criteria by which we're selecting these brains.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
We want to make sure

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that we have normal humans between the ages of 20 to 60,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
they died a somewhat natural death

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
with no injury to the brain,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
no history of psychiatric disease,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
no drugs on board --

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
we do a toxicology workup.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And we're very careful

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
about the brains that we do take.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We're also selecting for brains

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
in which we can get the tissue,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
we can get consent to take the tissue
