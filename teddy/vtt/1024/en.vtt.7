00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
They're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And they're controlling

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
basically everything that the nervous system has to do.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So if we zoom in to an even deeper level,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
all of those proteins

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
are encoded by our genomes.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
We each have 23 pairs of chromosomes.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
We get one from mom, one from dad.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And on these chromosomes

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
are roughly 25,000 genes.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
They're encoded in the DNA.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And the nature of a given cell

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
driving its underlying biochemistry

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
is dictated by which of these 25,000 genes
