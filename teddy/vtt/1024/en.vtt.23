00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
an entire listing of what the genome has on offer

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
to find perhaps better drug targets and optimize.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Most of you are probably familiar

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
with genome-wide association studies

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
in the form of people covering in the news

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
saying, "Scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
which affect X."

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And so these kinds of studies

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
are routinely published by scientists

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and they're great. They analyze large populations.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
They look at their entire genomes,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and they try to find hot spots of activity

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
that are linked causally to genes.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
But what you get out of such an exercise
