00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So about a hundred years ago,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And that's shown here in the the very light blue.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You can see areas

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
where neuronal cell bodies are being stained.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And what you can see is it's very non-uniform. You see a lot more structure there.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So the outer part of that brain

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
is the neocortex.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
It's one continuous processing unit, if you will.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
But you can also see things underneath there as well.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And all of these blank areas

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
are the areas in which the wires are running through.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
They're probably less cell dense.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So there's about 86 billion neurons in our brain.
