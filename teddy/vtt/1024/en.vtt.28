00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
that's telling us a gene is turned on there.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Whether or not that's due

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
to an individual's genetic background or their experiences,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
we don't know.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Those kinds of studies require much larger populations.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
So I'm going to leave you with a final note

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
about the complexity of the brain

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
and how much more we have to go.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
I think these resources are incredibly valuable.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
They give researchers a handle

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
on where to go.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
But we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
We're certainly going to be looking at more.
