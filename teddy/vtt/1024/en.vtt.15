00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Our scientists then use this

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
to go back to another piece of that tissue

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and do what's called laser scanning microdissection.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So the technician takes the instructions.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
They scribe along a place there.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And then the laser actually cuts.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
You can see that blue dot there cutting. And that tissue falls off.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
You can see on the microscope slide here,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
that's what's happening in real time.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
There's a container underneath that's collecting that tissue.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
We take that tissue,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
we purify the RNA out of it

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
using some basic technology,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and then we put a florescent tag on it.
