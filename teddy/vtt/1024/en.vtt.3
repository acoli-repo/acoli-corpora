00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Towards the front of the brain

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is the place in which all of the more complex thought, decision making --

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
it's the last to mature in late adulthood.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
This is where all your decision-making processes are going on.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's the place where you're deciding right now

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
you probably aren't going to order the steak for dinner.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So if you take a deeper look at the brain,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
one of the things, if you look at it in cross-section,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
what you can see

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
is that you can't really see a whole lot of structure there.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But there's actually a lot of structure there.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It's cells and it's wires all wired together.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So about a hundred years ago,
