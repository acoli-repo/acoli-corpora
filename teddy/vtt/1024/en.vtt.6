00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And the nerves themselves

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
are the ones who are receiving input.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
They're storing it, they're processing it.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Each neuron is connected via synapses

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
to up to 10,000 other neurons in your brain.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And each neuron itself

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is largely unique.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
The unique character of both individual neurons

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and neurons within a collection of the brain

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
are driven by fundamental properties

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
of their underlying biochemistry.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
These are proteins.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
They're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
They're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with.
