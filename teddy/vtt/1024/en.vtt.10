00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
in which we can get the tissue,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
we can get consent to take the tissue

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
within 24 hours of time of death.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Because what we're trying to measure, the RNA --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
which is the readout from our genes --

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
is very labile,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and so we have to move very quickly.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
One side note on the collection of brains:

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
because of the way that we collect,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and because we require consent,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Males are much more likely to die an accidental death in the prime of their life.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And men are much more likely

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
to have their significant other, spouse, give consent
