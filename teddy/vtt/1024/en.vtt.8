00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
driving its underlying biochemistry

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
is dictated by which of these 25,000 genes

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
are turned on

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and at what level they're turned on.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And so our project

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
is seeking to look at this readout,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
understanding which of these 25,000 genes is turned on.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So in order to undertake such a project,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
we obviously need brains.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So we sent our lab technician out.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
We were seeking normal human brains.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
What we actually start with

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
is a medical examiner's office.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
This a place where the dead are brought in.
