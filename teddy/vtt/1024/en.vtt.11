00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
to have their significant other, spouse, give consent

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
than the other way around.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
(Laughter)

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So the first thing that we do at the site of collection

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
is we collect what's called an MR.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
This is magnetic resonance imaging -- MRI.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
It's a standard template by which we're going to hang the rest of this data.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So we collect this MR.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And you can think of this as our satellite view for our map.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
The next thing we do

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
is we collect what's called a diffusion tensor imaging.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
This maps the large cabling in the brain.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And again, you can think of this

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
as almost mapping our interstate highways, if you will.
