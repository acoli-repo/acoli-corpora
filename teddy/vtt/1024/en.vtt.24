00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
But what you get out of such an exercise

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
is simply a list of genes.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
It tells you the what, but it doesn't tell you the where.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And so it's very important for those researchers

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
that we've created this resource.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Now they can come in

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and they can start to get clues about activity.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
They can start to look at common pathways --

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
other things that they simply haven't been able to do before.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
So I think this audience in particular

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
can understand the importance of individuality.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
And I think every human,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
we all have different genetic backgrounds,
