00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
as almost mapping our interstate highways, if you will.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The brain is removed from the skull,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and then it's sliced into one-centimeter slices.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And those are frozen solid,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and they're shipped to Seattle.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And in Seattle, we take these --

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
this is a whole human hemisphere --

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and we put them into what's basically a glorified meat slicer.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
There's a blade here that's going to cut across

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
a section of the tissue

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and transfer it to a microscope slide.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
We're going to then apply one of those stains to it,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and we scan it.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And then what we get is our first mapping.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So this is where experts come in
