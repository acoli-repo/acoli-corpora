00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
in serotonergic structures, things that are already known be affected --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
but we also get to see the whole thing.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
We also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and we see these genes turned on there.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
It's as interesting a side effect as it could be.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
One other thing you can do with such a thing

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
is you can, because it's a pattern matching exercise,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
because there's unique fingerprint,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
we can actually scan through the entire genome

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and find other proteins

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
that show a similar fingerprint.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
So if you're in drug discovery, for example,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
you can go through

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
an entire listing of what the genome has on offer

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
to find perhaps better drug targets and optimize.
