Scientists, sort of at the end of the 20th century,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
learned that they could track blood flow

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to map non-invasively

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
where activity was going on in the human brain.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So for example, they can see in the back part of the brain,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
which is just turning around there.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
There's the cerebellum; that's keeping you upright right now.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's keeping me standing. It's involved in coordinated movement.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
On the side here, this is temporal cortex.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This is the area where primary auditory processing --

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
so you're hearing my words,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
you're sending it up into higher language processing centers.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
