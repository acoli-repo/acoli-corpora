00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Here's the MR. It provides the framework.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
There's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
it allows you to zoom in,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
it allows you to highlight individual structures.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
But most importantly,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
we're now mapping into this anatomic framework,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
which is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
So the red levels

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
are where a gene is turned on to a great degree.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And each gene gives us a fingerprint.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And remember that we've assayed all the 25,000 genes in the genome

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and have all of that data available.
