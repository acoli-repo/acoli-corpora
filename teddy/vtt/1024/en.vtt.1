Most people, when they first look at a fresh human brain,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
they say, "It doesn't look what you're typically looking at

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
when someone shows you a brain."

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Typically, what you're looking at is a fixed brain. It's gray.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And this outer layer, this is the vasculature,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
which is incredible, around a human brain.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This is the blood vessels.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
20 percent of the oxygen

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
coming from your lungs,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
20 percent of the blood pumped from your heart,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
is servicing this one organ.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
That's basically, if you hold two fists together,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
it's just slightly larger than the two fists.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Scientists, sort of at the end of the 20th century,
