00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So this is where experts come in

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and they make basic anatomic assignments.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
You could consider this state boundaries, if you will,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
those pretty broad outlines.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
From this, we're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
which then we can put on a smaller cryostat.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And this is just showing this here --

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
this frozen tissue, and it's being cut.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
This is 20 microns thin, so this is about a baby hair's width.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And remember, it's frozen.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And so you can see here,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
old-fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
We take a microscope slide.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Then we very carefully melt onto the slide.
