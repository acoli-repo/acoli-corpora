00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And remember that we've assayed all the 25,000 genes in the genome

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and have all of that data available.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
So what can scientists learn about this data?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
We're just starting to look at this data ourselves.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
There's some basic things that you would want to understand.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Two great examples are drugs,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Prozac and Wellbutrin.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
These are commonly prescribed antidepressants.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Now remember, we're assaying genes.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Genes send the instructions to make proteins.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Proteins are targets for drugs.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So drugs bind to proteins

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and either turn them off, etc.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
So if you want to understand the action of drugs,
