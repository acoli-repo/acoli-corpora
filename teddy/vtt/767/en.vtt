00:00:00.468 --> 00:00:05.071
As a magician, I try to create images
that make people stop and think.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.976
I also try to challenge myself

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.976
to do things that doctors
say are not possible.

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:16.976
I was buried alive
in New York City in a coffin,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.853
buried alive in a coffin
in April, 1999, for a week.

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:25.123
I lived there with nothing but water.

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:28.976
And it ended up being so much fun

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.976
that I decided I could pursue
doing more of these things.
