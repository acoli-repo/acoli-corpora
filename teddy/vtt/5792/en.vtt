00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.777
Fighting climate change has become
the greatest responsibility of our times.

00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:09.833
And this is why in Europe,
we have set our objective:

00:00:09.857 --> 00:00:13.930
to become the first
carbon-neutral continent by 2050.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.226
This means leading an entire continent
towards transitioning to clean energy,

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.986
reinventing our infrastructure,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.713
and much, much more.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.952
It may sound abstract, and it sounds huge.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.690
And yes, it's actually both.
