00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.212
And hundreds of thousands
lost their souls and their mental health

00:01:01.236 --> 00:01:03.839
due to this cruel
and traumatic experience.

00:01:05.203 --> 00:01:07.204
I want to tell you about Omar,

00:01:07.522 --> 00:01:09.545
a five-year-old Syrian refugee boy

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:12.911
who arrived to the shore on Lesbos
on a crowded rubber boat.

00:01:14.204 --> 00:01:17.593
Crying, frightened, unable to understand
what's happening to him,

00:01:17.617 --> 00:01:20.728
he was right on the verge
of developing a new trauma.

00:01:21.077 --> 00:01:23.926
I knew right away
that this was a golden hour,

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.482
a short period of time
in which I could change his story,

00:01:27.506 --> 00:01:29.006
I could change the story

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.934
that he would tell himself
for the rest of his life.
