It's here to photograph you
with big cameras,

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:06.667
because only the great
and the powerful heroes,

00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:08.920
like you, Omar, can cross the sea."

00:02:10.413 --> 00:02:15.027
Omar looked at me,
stopped crying and asked me,

00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:16.827

I talked to Omar for 15 minutes.

00:02:22.577 --> 00:02:25.276

of post-traumatic stress disorder
