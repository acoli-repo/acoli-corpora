00:00:01.437 --> 00:00:03.817
For the last two and a half years,

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:07.262
I'm one of the few, if not the only,
child psychiatrist

00:00:07.286 --> 00:00:10.791
operating in refugee camps,
shorelines and rescue boats

00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:12.974
in Greece and the Mediterranean Sea.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.649
And I can say, with great confidence,

00:00:15.673 --> 00:00:19.125
that we are witnessing
a mental-health catastrophe

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:22.712
that will affect most of us,
and it will change our world.

00:00:23.784 --> 00:00:27.772
I live in Haifa, but nowadays,
I spend most of my time abroad.

00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:31.180
During my time
on the Greek island of Lesbos
