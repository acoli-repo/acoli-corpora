00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:30.641
decreases the prevalence
of post-traumatic stress disorder

00:02:30.665 --> 00:02:33.149
and other mental health
issues in the future,

00:02:33.173 --> 00:02:35.601
preparing Omar to get an education,

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:38.664
join the workforce,
raise a family and beyond.

00:02:38.688 --> 00:02:39.842
How?

00:02:39.866 --> 00:02:43.122
By stimulating the good memories
that will be stored in the amygdala,

00:02:43.146 --> 00:02:45.266
the emotional storage of the human brain.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.418
These memories
will fight the traumatic ones,

00:02:47.442 --> 00:02:49.976
if they are reactivated in the future.

00:02:50.532 --> 00:02:53.295
To Omar, the smell of the sea
will not just remind him

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.477
of his traumatic journey from Syria.

00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:59.818
Because to Omar, this story
is now a story of bravery.
