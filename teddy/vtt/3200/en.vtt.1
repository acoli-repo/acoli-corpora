During my time
on the Greek island of Lesbos

00:00:31.204 --> 00:00:33.593
and on the rescue boats
in the Mediterranean,

00:00:33.617 --> 00:00:36.672
thousands of refugee boats
arrived to the shoreline,

00:00:36.696 --> 00:00:40.149
crowded with more
than 1.5 million refugees.

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:42.235
One-fourth of them are children,

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:43.859
fleeing war and hardship.

00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:47.799
Each boat carries
different sufferings and traumas

00:00:47.823 --> 00:00:51.597
from Syria, Iraq, Afganistan
and different countries in Africa.

00:00:52.116 --> 00:00:53.952
In the last three years alone,

00:00:53.976 --> 00:00:57.355
more than 12,000 refugees
lost their lives.

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.212
And hundreds of thousands
lost their souls and their mental health
