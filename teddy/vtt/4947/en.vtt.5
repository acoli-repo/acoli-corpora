00:02:27.808 --> 00:02:30.461
the biblical figure who rose 
from the dead.

00:02:30.461 --> 00:02:34.861
She writes, “and I a smiling woman/
I am only thirty/

00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:38.325
And like the cat I have
nine times to die.”

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:41.135
But the poem is also a testament 
to survival:

00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:45.115
“I rise with my red hair/
And I eat men like air.”

00:02:45.115 --> 00:02:48.825
This unflinching language has made Plath 
an important touchstone

00:02:48.825 --> 00:02:51.305
for countless other readers and writers

00:02:51.305 --> 00:02:52.815
who sought to break the silence

00:02:52.815 --> 00:02:57.355
surrounding issues of trauma, 
frustration, and sexuality.

00:02:57.355 --> 00:03:01.962
"Ariel" is also filled with moving 
meditations on heartbreak and creativity.
