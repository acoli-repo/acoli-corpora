00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:30.599
In this passage from Sylvia Plath’s 
"The Bell Jar,"

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.819
a young woman imagines 
an uncertain future–

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:35.909
and speaks to the universal fear

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:37.269
of becoming paralyzed

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.799
by the prospect of making 
the wrong choice.

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:42.799
Although she considered other careers,

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:44.989
Plath chose the artist’s way.

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.749
Poetry was her calling.

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:48.779
Under her shrewd eye and pen,

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:51.409
everyday objects became haunting images:

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.559
a “new statue in a drafty museum,”

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.709
a shadow in a mirror, a slab of soap.

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:59.749
Fiercely intelligent, 
penetrating and witty,

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.799
Plath was also diagnosed 
with clinical depression.
