Plath was also diagnosed 
with clinical depression.

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.029
She used poetry to explore her own states

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:07.859
in the most intimate terms,

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:10.589
and her breathtaking perspectives 
on emotion,

00:01:10.589 --> 00:01:14.969
nature and art continue 
to captivate and resonate.

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:16.784
In her first collection of poems,

00:01:16.784 --> 00:01:17.804
"The Colossus,"

00:01:23.454 --> 00:01:24.274
At the same time,

00:01:24.274 --> 00:01:26.194
she found solace in nature,

00:01:26.194 --> 00:01:28.334
from “a blue mist” “dragging the lake,”

00:01:28.334 --> 00:01:30.974
to white flowers that “tower and topple,”
