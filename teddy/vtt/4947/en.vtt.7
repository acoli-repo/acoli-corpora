This darkness is echoed throughout 
the collection,

00:03:31.112 --> 00:03:35.892
which includes controversial references 
to the holocaust and the Kamikazes.

00:03:35.892 --> 00:03:40.680
Even the relics of seemingly happier times
are described as crucifying the author:

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.394
“My husband and child smiling out 
of the family photo;

00:03:44.394 --> 00:03:49.484
Their smiles catch onto my skin, 
little smiling hooks.”

00:03:49.484 --> 00:03:53.051
Her domestic dissatisfaction and her 
husband’s mistreatment of her

00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:55.981
are constant themes in her later poetry.

00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:58.911
After her death, he inherited her estate,

00:03:58.911 --> 00:04:03.261
and has been accused of excluding 
some of her work from publication.
