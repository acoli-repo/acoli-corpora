00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:08.811
“From the tip of every branch,

00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:10.691
like a fat purple fig,

00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:13.381
a wonderful future beckoned and winked…

00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:16.571
but choosing one meant 
losing all the rest,

00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:19.541
and, as I sat there, unable to decide,

00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:22.951
the figs began to wrinkle and go black,

00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:27.461
and, one by one, they plopped 
to the ground at my feet.”

00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:30.599
