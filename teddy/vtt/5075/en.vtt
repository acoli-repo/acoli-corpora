00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:15.544
Meet our chemist, Harriet.

00:00:15.568 --> 00:00:18.926
She has a chemical reaction
that needs to occur more quickly.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.031
A chemist has some processes
at her disposal

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:22.999
that can help her speed up her reaction,

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.673
and she knows of five ways.

00:00:24.697 --> 00:00:25.848
And to remember them,

00:00:25.872 --> 00:00:28.403
she thinks back to her days
as a high school student,

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:30.406
and the day she got a date for the dance.
