00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but more importantly, we can look into his mind.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
When Peter moves his arm, that yellow spot you see there

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
is the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
What's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second.
