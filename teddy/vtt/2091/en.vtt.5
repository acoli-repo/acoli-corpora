This may shock you, but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
They're watching their own brain activation,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
They're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
As they do it, in the upper left is a display

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
When they control their brain, they can control their pain.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
This is an investigational technology,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
but, in clinical trials, we're seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
This is not "The Matrix." You can only do this to yourself. You take control.
