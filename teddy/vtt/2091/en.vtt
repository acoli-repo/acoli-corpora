Hi. I'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You can mimic what you can see.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Soon, you'll be able to look inside your brain and program,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm going to tell you about that technology.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
People have wanted to look inside the human mind,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the human brain, for thousands of years.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Well, coming out of the research labs just now, for our generation, is the possibility to do that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
People envision this as being very difficult.
