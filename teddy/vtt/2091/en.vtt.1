00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Well, coming out of the research labs just now, for our generation, is the possibility to do that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
People envision this as being very difficult.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You had to take a spaceship, shrink it down, inject it into the bloodstream.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It was terribly dangerous. (Laughter)

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But now, we have a real technology to do this.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We're going to fly into my colleague Peter's brain.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We're going to do it non-invasively using MRI.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We don't have to inject anything. We don't need radiation.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain -- literally, fly into his body --

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but more importantly, we can look into his mind.
