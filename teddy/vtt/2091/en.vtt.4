00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and then we can select the areas that produce the pain.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and select brain areas to do that same thing.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
What you're seeing here is, we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This may shock you, but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time.
