If he can see this pattern in his own brain, he can learn how to control it.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
There have been three ways to try to impact the brain:

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the therapist's couch, pills and the knife.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We all know that as we form thoughts, they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Chronic pain is an example. If you burn yourself, you pull your hand away.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you.
