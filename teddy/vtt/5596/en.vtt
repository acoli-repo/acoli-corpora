00:00:07.837 --> 00:00:11.207
We live in a vast universe, 
on a small wet planet,

00:00:11.207 --> 00:00:12.677
where billions of years ago

00:00:12.677 --> 00:00:16.017
single-celled life forms evolved
from the same elements

00:00:16.017 --> 00:00:18.722
as all non-living material 
around them,

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:23.312
proliferating and radiating into an 
incredible ray of complex life forms.

00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:27.242
All of this— living and inanimate, 
microscopic and cosmic—

00:00:27.242 --> 00:00:31.402
is governed by mathematical laws with 
apparently arbitrary constants.
