Fifteen years ago,
I was doing my graduate research

00:00:04.697 --> 00:00:07.197
on the lynching of Mexicans
and Latin Americans

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.063
in gold rush California.

00:00:09.097 --> 00:00:11.230
And I was having a very hard time

00:00:11.263 --> 00:00:14.363
finding the evidence
I needed to make my claim.

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:16.563
I don't know how much
you know about lynching,

00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:18.530
but they are, by definition,

00:00:18.563 --> 00:00:22.497
public executions that happen
off the official record.

00:00:22.497 --> 00:00:25.530
These deaths aren't technically
sanctioned by the state,

00:00:25.563 --> 00:00:28.930
and often, towns and communities
would deny they even happened,

00:00:28.963 --> 00:00:32.197
which made it harder
to prove that they did.
