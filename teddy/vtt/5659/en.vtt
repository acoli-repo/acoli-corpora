00:00:00.821 --> 00:00:05.793
In 1994, the Violent Crime Control
and Law Enforcement Act passed.

00:00:05.817 --> 00:00:07.736
You probably know it as the crime bill.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.166
It was a terrible law.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.504
It ushered in an era of mass incarceration

00:00:12.528 --> 00:00:15.405
that allowed mandatory minimums,

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:16.595
three-strikes laws,

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.565
the expansion of the death penalty --

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:20.178
it was terrible.

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:22.137
But it passed with bipartisan support.

00:00:22.578 --> 00:00:24.348
GOP House Speaker Newt Gingrich,

00:00:24.372 --> 00:00:26.290
architect of the Republican Revolution,

00:00:26.314 --> 00:00:27.483
led the way --

00:00:27.507 --> 00:00:30.461
signed into law by Democratic
President, Bill Clinton.
