00:00:00.564 --> 00:00:05.207
My job is to design, build and study
robots that communicate with people.

00:00:05.231 --> 00:00:08.850
But this story doesn't start with robotics
at all, it starts with animation.

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:11.243
When I first saw Pixar's "Luxo Jr.,"

00:00:11.267 --> 00:00:13.973
I was amazed by how much
emotion they could put

00:00:13.997 --> 00:00:16.825
into something as trivial as a desk lamp.

00:00:17.477 --> 00:00:19.822
I mean, look at them --
at the end of this movie,

00:00:19.846 --> 00:00:22.625
you actually feel something
for two pieces of furniture.

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:23.930
(Laughter)

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:25.982
And I said, I have
to learn how to do this.

00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:28.233
So I made a really bad career decision.

00:00:28.257 --> 00:00:29.451
(Laughter)

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:31.668
And that's what my mom
was like when I did it.
