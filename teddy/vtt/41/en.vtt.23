Well, companies need to realize
that by prioritizing privacy and security,

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.280
they can build trust
and loyalty to their users.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.616
Governments must create a safer internet

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.520
by ensuring enforcement
and up-to-date rules.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.616
And us, the citizens?

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.456
We can use our voice

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:50.576
to remind the world that technology
can only truly benefit society

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.200
if it respects basic rights.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.296
Thank you so much.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.400
(Applause)
