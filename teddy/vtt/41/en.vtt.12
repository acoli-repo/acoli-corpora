00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.800
more than 900 pages,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.400
and sat down in our office
and read them out loud ourselves,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.336
streaming the experiment
live on our websites.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.896
As you can see, it took quite a long time.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.336
It took us 31 hours,
49 minutes and 11 seconds

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.936
to read the terms on an average phone.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.336
That is longer than a movie marathon
of the "Harry Potter" movies

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.856
and the "Godfather" movies combined.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.280
(Laughter)

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.536
And reading is one thing.
