That means I, or any stranger,
can connect to the doll

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.536
while being outside the room
where Cayla and her friends are.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.736
And to illustrate this,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.896
I'm going to turn Cayla on now.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.720
Let's see, one, two, three.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.016
There. She's on. And I asked a colleague

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.136
to stand outside with his smartphone,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.400
and he's connected,

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.416
and to make this a bit creepier ...

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.496
(Laughter)

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.440
let's see what kids could hear Cayla say
in the safety of their room.
