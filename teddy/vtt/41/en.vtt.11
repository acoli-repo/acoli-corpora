And now, the power
imbalance is established,

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.176
because we have agreed
to our personal information

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.320
being gathered and used
on a scale we could never imagine.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.336
This is why my colleagues and I
decided to take a deeper look at this.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.696

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.176
And to show the world
how unrealistic it is

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.416
to expect consumers
to actually read the terms,

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.936
we printed them,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.800
more than 900 pages,
