Do you think it's fair to put the burden

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.736

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.856
I think we should demand
less take-it-or-leave-it

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.056
and more understandable terms
before we agree to them.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.616
(Applause)

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.840
Thank you.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:21.080
Now, I would like to tell you
a story about love.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.616
Some of the world's
most popular apps are dating apps,

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.280
an industry now worth more than,
or close to, three billion dollars a year.
