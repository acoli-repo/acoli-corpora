Some are just flawed or need more work,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.680
and some are truly great.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.256
And there is some good news as well.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.576
The dating companies
changed their policies globally

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.280
after we filed a legal complaint.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.416
But organizations such as mine

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.416
that fight for consumers' rights
can't be everywhere.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.976
Nor can consumers fix this on their own,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.576
because if we know
that something innocent we said

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.056
will come back to haunt us,

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.976
we will stop speaking.
