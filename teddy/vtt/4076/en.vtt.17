00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.105
So that night, as I sat wondering

00:08:32.105 --> 00:08:33.437
how I should respond,

00:08:33.437 --> 00:08:35.847
I found myself filled with doubt.

00:08:35.847 --> 00:08:39.208
You see, as a writer, I approached this issue

as an Indian, I felt embarrassment and disbelief,

00:08:45.964 --> 00:08:50.443

but as a citizen journalist,

00:08:52.578 --> 00:08:55.852
I suddenly felt very vulnerable.

00:08:55.852 --> 00:08:58.183
I mean, here she was, a young woman

00:08:58.183 --> 00:08:59.583
who was using a channel to talk about

00:08:59.583 --> 00:09:01.721
her experience just as I was,
