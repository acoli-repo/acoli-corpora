does not invite rape.

00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:03.075
When I reported about these events,

00:06:03.075 --> 00:06:06.168
I felt I had charge, I felt like I had a channel

00:06:06.168 --> 00:06:10.337
to release all the emotions I had inside me.

00:06:10.337 --> 00:06:12.409
I attended the town hall march

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:14.343
when students held up signs saying

00:06:14.343 --> 00:06:16.872
"Kill them, hang them."

00:06:16.872 --> 00:06:20.699
"You wouldn't do this to your mothers or sisters."

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:22.177
I went to a candlelight vigil

00:06:22.177 --> 00:06:24.280
where citizens gathered together

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.237
to talk about the issue of sexual violence openly,

00:06:28.237 --> 00:06:30.277
and I recorded a lot of blogs
