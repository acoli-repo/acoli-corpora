00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.483
Now, as a woman watching this day after day,

00:04:32.483 --> 00:04:34.283
I was tired.

00:04:34.283 --> 00:04:35.927
So as a writer and gender activist,

00:04:35.927 --> 00:04:39.176
I have written extensively on women,

00:04:39.176 --> 00:04:41.822
but this time, I realized it was different,

00:04:41.822 --> 00:04:43.403
because a part of me realized

00:04:43.403 --> 00:04:45.751
I was a part of that young woman too,

00:04:45.751 --> 00:04:47.929
and I decided I wanted to change this.

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:51.960
So I did something spontaneous, hasty.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.506
I logged on to a citizen journalism platform

00:04:54.506 --> 00:04:55.962
called iReport,

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.713
and I recorded a video talking about

00:04:58.713 --> 00:05:00.693
what the scene was like in Bangalore.
