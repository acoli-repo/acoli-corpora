00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.659
Talking about empowerment is odd,

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.761
because when we talk about empowerment,

00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:08.967
what affects us most are the stories.

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:12.179
So I want to begin with an everyday story.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.702
What is it really like to be a young woman in India?

00:00:16.702 --> 00:00:18.974
Now, I've spent the last 27 years of my life

00:00:18.974 --> 00:00:21.073
in India, lived in three small towns,

00:00:21.073 --> 00:00:22.889
two major cities,

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:26.118
and I've had several experiences.

00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:27.974
When I was seven,

00:00:27.974 --> 00:00:29.931
a private tutor who used to come home

00:00:29.931 --> 00:00:34.646
to teach me mathematics molested me.
