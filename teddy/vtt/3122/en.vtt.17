00:08:28.533 --> 00:08:31.073
is that we all are against hate

00:08:31.097 --> 00:08:33.104
and we all think hate is a problem.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:35.668
We think it's their problem,

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:37.993
not our problem.

00:08:38.824 --> 00:08:40.126
They're hateful.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.219
I mean, if I think the people
who didn't vote like me

00:08:43.243 --> 00:08:46.720
are stupid racist monsters who don't
deserve to call themselves Americans,

00:08:46.744 --> 00:08:48.423
alright, fine, I'm not being nice,

00:08:48.447 --> 00:08:49.694
I get it.

00:08:49.718 --> 00:08:51.115
(Laughter)

00:08:51.139 --> 00:08:54.409
I'm not hateful, I'm just right, right?

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:56.116
(Laughter)

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.290
Wrong.

00:08:59.346 --> 00:09:01.695
We all hate.
