00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:30.586
is that I was a bully.

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:35.121
Honestly, I didn't think
about it much myself.

00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:38.623
I buried the memories for years,

00:00:38.647 --> 00:00:42.179
and even still, a lot of it's really hazy.

00:00:42.203 --> 00:00:44.846
Denial, by the way, apparently
is also one of my things.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.099
(Laughter)

00:00:46.123 --> 00:00:48.679
But the more people started to praise me

00:00:48.703 --> 00:00:51.466
for being a liberal who could
get along with conservatives,

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.641
and the more I wrote articles
about being nice

00:00:53.665 --> 00:00:56.689
and gave talks about being nice,

00:00:56.713 --> 00:01:00.868
the more I felt this hypocrisy
creeping up inside me.
