00:02:58.691 --> 00:03:01.026
and I did everything I could
to try to find Vicky.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.852
I needed to know that she was OK,

00:03:03.876 --> 00:03:05.546
and that I hadn't ruined her life.

00:03:07.471 --> 00:03:08.510
(Sigh)

00:03:08.534 --> 00:03:10.054
But what I quickly realized

00:03:10.078 --> 00:03:13.030
was I wasn't just trying to figure out
what happened to Vicky.

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:15.656
I was trying to figure out
what happened to me.

00:03:17.802 --> 00:03:19.096
When I was 10 years old,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.889
I treated another human being
like some worthless other ...

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.296
like I was better than her,

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:28.568
and she was garbage.
