00:01:56.634 --> 00:02:00.993
My clearest memory
is standing in the empty hallway

00:02:01.017 --> 00:02:02.947
outside the fifth grade classrooms

00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:05.771
waiting for Vicky
to come out of the bathroom,

00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:08.986
and I have a clipboard and a pen
and a survey I've made up,

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.776
asking about shampoo preferences,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.915
like I'm doing a study
for science class or something.

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.340
And when Vicky comes out of the bathroom,

00:02:16.364 --> 00:02:19.174
I pounce on her and I ask her
what shampoo she uses.

00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:21.404
Now, to put this in perspective,

00:02:21.428 --> 00:02:23.471
I can't remember the names of my teachers,

00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:26.512
I can't remember the names
of any of the books I read that year,

00:02:26.536 --> 00:02:29.108
I pretty much can't remember
anything from fifth grade,

00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:32.079
but I remember that Vicky told me
she used White Rain shampoo.
