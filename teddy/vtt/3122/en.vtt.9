00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:30.274
And as I felt more hateful --

00:04:30.298 --> 00:04:32.586
rageful, really --

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.850
I noticed the world around me
seemed to be getting more hateful, too.

00:04:35.874 --> 00:04:38.428
Like there was this steady
undercurrent of hate

00:04:38.452 --> 00:04:40.557
bubbling up all around us

00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:42.288
and increasingly overflowing.

00:04:43.973 --> 00:04:46.461
So the plus side, I guess,

00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:51.703
is that I realized that hate
was not just my problem,

00:04:51.727 --> 00:04:54.822
which is like, the most
selfish plus side ever --

00:04:54.846 --> 00:04:56.373
(Laughter)

00:04:56.813 --> 00:05:02.329
because now instead of just my own hate
and cruelty to try to figure out,
