00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:01.190
That's hate.

00:07:03.554 --> 00:07:05.925
I am defining hate in a broad way

00:07:07.451 --> 00:07:10.340
because I think we have a big problem.

00:07:11.214 --> 00:07:14.873
And we need to solve all of it,
not just the most extremes.

00:07:14.897 --> 00:07:16.148
So for instance,

00:07:16.172 --> 00:07:18.736
we probably all agree
that marching down the street,

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.038
chanting about you should take away
rights from some group of people

00:07:22.062 --> 00:07:24.112
because of their skin color
or their gender,

00:07:24.136 --> 00:07:26.085
we'd all agree that's hate, right? OK.

00:07:27.594 --> 00:07:31.387
What if you believe
that group of people is inferior,
