00:09:59.828 --> 00:10:01.076
in the West Bank.

00:10:01.719 --> 00:10:04.569
When Bassam Aramin was 16 years old,

00:10:05.692 --> 00:10:10.017
he tried to blow up an Israeli
military convoy with a grenade.

00:10:11.828 --> 00:10:14.202
He failed, fortunately,

00:10:14.226 --> 00:10:16.656
but he was still sentenced
to seven years in prison.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.617
When he was in prison,
they showed a film about the Holocaust.

00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:20.792
Up until that point,

00:10:20.816 --> 00:10:23.685
Bassam had thought the Holocaust
was mostly a myth.

00:10:23.709 --> 00:10:25.509
He went to go watch the film

00:10:25.533 --> 00:10:28.619
because he thought he would enjoy
seeing Jews get killed.
