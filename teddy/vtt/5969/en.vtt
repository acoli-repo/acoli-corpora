00:00:08.871 --> 00:00:11.204
As a breeze blows through the savannah,

00:00:11.204 --> 00:00:17.538
a snake-shaped tube stretches into the air
and scans the horizon like a periscope.

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:20.746
But it’s not seeing— 
it’s sniffing for odors

00:00:20.746 --> 00:00:25.163
like the scent of a watering hole 
or the musk of a dangerous predator.

00:00:25.163 --> 00:00:28.746
The trunk’s owner 
is a young African elephant.

00:00:28.746 --> 00:00:33.204
At only 8 years old, she still has 
a lot to learn about her home.
