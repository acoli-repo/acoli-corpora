00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
in over 40 years.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So they've managed to both restore the local ecology

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and the local economy at the same time.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
This is another re-greening example.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
It also makes sense in very strong markets.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
This one in Seattle

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
is on the site of a mall parking lot

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
adjacent to a new transit stop.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And the wavy line

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
The creek had been culverted under the parking lot.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
But daylighting our creeks

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
really improves their water quality
