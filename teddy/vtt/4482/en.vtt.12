00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
The other big dynamic of change

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
is the sheer performance of

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
underperforming asphalt.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Now I keep thinking this would be a great name

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
for an indie rock band,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
but developers generally use it

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
to refer to underused parking lots --

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and suburbia is full of them.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
When the postwar suburbs were first built

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
out on the cheap land

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
away from downtown,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
it made sense to just build

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
surface parking lots.
