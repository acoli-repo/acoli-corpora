really tend to do the math on our transportation costs,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and they're not going down

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
any time soon.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
But is it practical?

for over a decade,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000

varied projects.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
But that they're really all market driven,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and what's driving the market in particular --
