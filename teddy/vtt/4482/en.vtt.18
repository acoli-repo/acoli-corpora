00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
"a third place."

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
If home is the first place

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and work is the second place,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
the third place is where you go to hang out

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and build community.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And especially as suburbia is becoming

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
there's a real hunger

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
for more third places.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So the most dramatic retrofits

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
are really those in the next category,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
the next strategy: redevelopment.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Now, during the boom, there were several

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
really dramatic redevelopment projects
