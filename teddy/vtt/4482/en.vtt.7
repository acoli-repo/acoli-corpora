00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
which is basically our model --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
those savings are wiped out

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
when you consider the transportation costs.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
For instance, here in Atlanta,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
about half of households

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
make between $20,000 and $50,000 a year,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and they are spending 29 percent of their income

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
on housing

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and 32 percent

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
on transportation.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I mean, that's 2005 figures.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
That's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
You know, none of us

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
really tend to do the math on our transportation costs,
