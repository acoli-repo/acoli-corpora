00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
with public streets,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
two public parks, eight bus lines

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and a range of housing types,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and so it's really given Lakewood, Colorado

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
the downtown

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
that this particular suburb never had.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Here was the mall in its heyday.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
They had their prom in the mall. They loved their mall.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
So here's the site in 1975

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
with the mall.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
By 1995, the mall has died.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
The department store has been kept --

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and we found this was true in many cases.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
The department stores are multistory; they're better built.
