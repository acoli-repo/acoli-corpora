00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And those have been linked then

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
with the rather alarming,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
growing rates of obesity,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
shown in these maps here,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and that obesity has also been triggering

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
great increases in heart disease

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and diabetes

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
to the point where a child born today

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
has a one-in-three chance

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
of developing diabetes.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And that rate has been escalating at the same rate

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
as children not walking

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to school anymore,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
again, because of our development patterns.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And then there's finally -- there's the affordability question.
