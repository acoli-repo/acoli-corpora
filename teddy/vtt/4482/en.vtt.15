00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
It's keeping the lights on.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
It's becoming, I think, a really great institution.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Other malls have been re-inhabited

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
as nursing homes,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
as universities,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and as all variety of office space.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
We also found a lot of examples

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
of dead big-box stores

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
that have been converted into

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
all sorts of community-serving uses as well --

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
lots of schools, lots of churches

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and lots of libraries like this one.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
This was a little grocery store, a Food Lion grocery store,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that is now a public library.
