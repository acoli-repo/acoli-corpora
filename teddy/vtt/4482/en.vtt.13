00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
it made sense to just build

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
surface parking lots.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
But those sites have now been leapfrogged

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and leapfrogged again,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
as we've just continued to sprawl,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and they now have

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
a relatively central location.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
It no longer just makes sense.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
It now makes sense to go back in,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
build a deck and build up

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
on those sites.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
So what do you do

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
with a dead mall,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
dead office park?
