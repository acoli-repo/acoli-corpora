00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
really dramatic redevelopment projects

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
where the original building

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
at significantly greater density,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
a sort of compact, walkable urban neighborhoods.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But some of them have been much more incremental.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
This is Mashpee Commons,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
the oldest retrofit that we've found.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And it's just incrementally, over the last 20 years,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
built urbanism

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
on top of its parking lots.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
So the black and white photo shows

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
the simple 60's strip shopping center.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And then the maps above that

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
show its gradual transformation
