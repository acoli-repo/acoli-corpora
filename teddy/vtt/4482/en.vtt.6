00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And then there's finally -- there's the affordability question.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I mean, how affordable is it

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
to continue to live in suburbia

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
with rising gas prices?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Suburban expansion to cheap land,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
for the last 50 years --

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
you know the cheap land out on the edge --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
has helped generations of families

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
enjoy the American dream.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
But increasingly,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
the savings promised

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
by drive-till-you-qualify affordability --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
which is basically our model --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
those savings are wiped out
