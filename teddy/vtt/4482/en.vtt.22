00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
By 1980, it had been subdivided

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
into a big mall on one side

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and the office park on the other

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and then some buffer sites for a library

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and a church to the far right.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Today, the transit,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
the Main Street and the new housing

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
have all been built.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Eventually, I expect that the streets

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Plans have already been announced

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
for a lot of those garden apartments

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
above the mall to be redeveloped.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Transit is a big driver of retrofits.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So here's what it looks like.
