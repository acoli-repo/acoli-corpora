So here's what it looks like.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
in between the office buildings

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and the public space and the new Main Street.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
This one is one of my favorites, Belmar.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
I think they really built an attractive place here

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and have just employed all-green construction.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
There's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
as well as wind turbines.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
This was a very large mall

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
on a hundred-acre superblock.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
It's now 22

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
walkable urban blocks

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
with public streets,
