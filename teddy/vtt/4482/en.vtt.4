00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the suburbs.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
All that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
we have doubled the amount of miles we drive.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It's increased our dependence

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
on foreign oil

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
despite the gains in fuel efficiency.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We're just driving so much more;

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
we haven't been able to keep up technologically.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Public health is another reason

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
to consider retrofitting.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Researchers at the CDC and other places

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
have increasingly been linking

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
suburban development patterns

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
with sedentary lifestyles.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And those have been linked then
