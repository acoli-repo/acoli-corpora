00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or reconstructing wetlands

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
out of parking lots,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I think the fact is

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the growing number

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
of empty and under-performing,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
especially retail, sites

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
throughout suburbia

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
gives us actually a tremendous opportunity

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
to take our least-sustainable

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
landscapes right now

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and convert them into

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
more sustainable places.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And in the process, what that allows us to do

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is to redirect a lot more of our growth

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
back into existing communities
