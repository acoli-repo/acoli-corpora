00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
The department stores are multistory; they're better built.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
They're easy to be re-adapted.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
But the one story stuff ...

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
that's really history.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
So here it is at projected build-out.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
This project, I think, has great connectivity

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
to the existing neighborhoods.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
It's providing 1,500 households with the option

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
of a more urban lifestyle.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
It's about two-thirds built out right now.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Here's what the new Main Street looks like.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
It's very successful,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and it's helped to prompt --

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
eight of the 13

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
regional malls in Denver
