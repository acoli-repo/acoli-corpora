00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
with a dead mall,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
dead office park?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
It turns out, all sorts of things.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
In a slow economy like ours,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
re-inhabitation is

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
one of the more popular strategies.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So this happens to be

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
a dead mall in St. Louis

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
that's been re-inhabited as art-space.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
It's now home to artist studios,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
theater groups, dance troupes.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
It's not pulling in as much tax revenue

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
as it once was,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
but it's serving its community.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
It's keeping the lights on.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
It's becoming, I think, a really great institution.
