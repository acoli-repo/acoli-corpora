00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is to redirect a lot more of our growth

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
back into existing communities

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that could use a boost,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and have the infrastructure in place,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
instead of continuing

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to tear down trees

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and to tear up the green space out at the edges.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So why is this important?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I think there are any number of reasons,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Just from the perspective of climate change,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
the average urban dweller in the U.S.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
has about one-third the carbon footprint

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
of the average suburban dweller,
