00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
These slides just show two images

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
from a larger project

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
that looked at trying to do that for Atlanta.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I led a team that was asked to imagine

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Atlanta 100 years from now.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And we chose to try to reverse sprawl

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
through three simple moves -- expensive, but simple.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
One, in a hundred years,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
transit on all major

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
rail and road corridors.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Two, in a hundred years,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
thousand foot buffers

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
on all stream corridors.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
It's a little extreme, but we've got a little water problem.
