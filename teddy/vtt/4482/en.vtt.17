Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
a gourmet grocery,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and they put up a restaurant in the old post office.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Never underestimate the power of food

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
to turn a place around

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and make it a destination.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
It's been so successful, they've now taken over the strip across the street.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
The real estate ads in the neighborhood

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
all very proudly proclaim,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
"Walking distance to Le Grande Orange,"

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
because it provided its neighborhood

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
with what sociologists like to call

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
"a third place."
