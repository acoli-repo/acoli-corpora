00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
to becoming a beautiful,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
attractive, dignified sort of good address.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I mean now we're hoping we start to see it;

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
they've already built City Hall, attracted two hotels.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
without tearing down another tree.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
So there's a lot of great things,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
but I'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
But densification

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
is not going to work everywhere.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Sometimes re-greening

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
is really the better answer.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
There's a lot to learn from successful
