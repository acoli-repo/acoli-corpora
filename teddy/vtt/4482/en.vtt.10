00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
demographic groups right now:

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
the Baby Boomers retiring --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and then there's a gap,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Generation X, which is a small generation.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
They're still having kids --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
but Generation Y hasn't even started

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
hitting child-rearing age.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
They're the other big generation.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
So as a result of that,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
demographers predict

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that through 2025,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
75 to 85 percent of new households

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
will not have kids in them.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And the market research, consumer research,
