00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
of the average suburban dweller,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and living in detached buildings,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
you have that much more exterior surface

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
to leak energy out of.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So strictly from

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
a climate change perspective,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
the cities are already

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
relatively green.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The big opportunity

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
is actually in urbanizing

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the suburbs.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
All that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs,
