00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
to just create pockets of walkability.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
You want to also try to get more systemic transformation.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
So this is one that has been

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
retrofitted in California.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
They took the commercial strip

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
shown on the black-and-white images below,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and they built a boulevard

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
that has become the Main Street for their town.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And it's transformed from being

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
an ugly, unsafe,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
undesirable address,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
to becoming a beautiful,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
attractive, dignified sort of good address.
