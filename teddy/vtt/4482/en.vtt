00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In the last 50 years,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
we've been building the suburbs

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
with a lot of unintended consequences.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And I'm going to talk about some of those consequences

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that I think give us tremendous reasons

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to be really optimistic

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that the big design and development project of the next 50 years

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is going to be retrofitting suburbia.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So whether it's redeveloping dying malls

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or reconstructing wetlands
