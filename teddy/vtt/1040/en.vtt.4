00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So it's no surprise, guys, that 62 percent of Bulgarians

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
are not optimistic about the future.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We're unhappy, we have bad education,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and we have the worst businesses.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And these are facts, guys.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
This isn't story tale; it's not make-believe.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It's not.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It's not a conspiracy I have got against Bulgaria. These are facts.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So I think it should be really, really clear

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
that our system is broken.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The way we think, the way we behave,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
our operating system of behaving is broken.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We need a drastic change in the way we think and behave

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to transform Bulgaria for the better,
