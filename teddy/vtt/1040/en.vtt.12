00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
But no, now our meme goes into work where we don't value play.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
We create robotic workers that we treat like assets,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
to lever and just throw away.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
What are qualities of a Bulgarian work?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Autocratic --

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
do what I say because I'm the chef.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
I'm the boss and I know better than you.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Untrusting -- you're obviously a criminal, so I'm going to install cameras.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
(Laughter)

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Controlling --

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
you're obviously an idiot, so I'm going to make

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
a zillion little processes for you to follow so you don't step out of the box.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So they're restrictive -- don't use your mobile phone,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
don't use your laptop, don't search the Internet,
