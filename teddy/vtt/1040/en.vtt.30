00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
You guys have to, and if you're not feeling it,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
your colleagues, your employees, aren't going to feel it.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
You've got to go back and say, "Hey, I'm going to trust you."

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Weird concept: I hired you; I should trust you.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
I'm going to let you make decisions. I'm going to empower you,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
and I'm going to delegate to the lowest level, rather than the top.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
I'm going to encourage constructive criticism.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I'm going to let you challenge authority.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Because it's by challenging the way things are always done

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
is that we are able to break out of the rut that we're in

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
and create innovative solutions

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
to problems of today.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
We're not always right as leaders.
