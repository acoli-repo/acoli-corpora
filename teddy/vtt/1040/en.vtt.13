00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So they're restrictive -- don't use your mobile phone,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
don't use your laptop, don't search the Internet,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
don't be on I.M.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
That's somehow unprofessional and bad.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And at the end of the day, it's unfulfilling

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
because you're controlled, you're restricted, you're not valued

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and you're not having any fun.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
In social, in education and in our business,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
don't value play.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And that's why we're last,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
because we don't value play.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And you can say, "That's ridiculous, Steve. What a dumb idea.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
It can't be because of play.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Just play, that's a stupid thing."

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
We have the serious meme in us.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Well I'm going to say no.
