00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm here today

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to start a revolution.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now before you get up in arms,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
or you break into song,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
or you pick a favorite color,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I want to define what I mean by revolution.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
By revolution,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I mean a drastic and far-reaching change

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in the way we think and behave --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the way we think and the way we behave.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now why, Steve, why do we need a revolution?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We need a revolution

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
because things aren't working; they're just not working.
