00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We're last place in health care,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and that's important for a sense of well-being.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And there we are, not just last in the E.U.,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
we're last in Europe, at the very bottom.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And worst of all,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000

relative to GDP per capita --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000

Where do we rank three weeks ago

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
in another report by the OECD?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Last in reading, math and science. Last.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
