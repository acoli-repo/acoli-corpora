00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
that we shouldn't let our kids play so much

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
because life is serious

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and we need to train them for the seriousness of life.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
We have a serious meme running through.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It's a social gene running through us.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
It's a serious gene.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
It's 45 years of it

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
that's created what I call the "baba factor."

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
(Laughter)

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
(Applause)

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And here's how it works.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Step one: woman says, "I want to have a baby. Iskam baby."

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Step two: we get the baby. Woohoo!

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
But then what happens in step three?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I want to go back to work
