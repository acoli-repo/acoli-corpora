00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
We don't value play.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
In fact, we devalue play.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And we devalue it in three areas.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Let's go back to the same three areas.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Social: 45 years of what?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Of communism --

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
of valuing the society and the state over the individual

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and squashing, inadvertently,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
creativity, individual self-expression and innovation.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And instead, what do we value?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Because it's shown

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
the way we apply, generate and use knowledge

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
is affected by our social and institutional context,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
which told us what in communism?
