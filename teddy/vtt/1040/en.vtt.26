There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
besides the serious meme that we have to kick out.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Two, I've tried it. I've tried at Sciant.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
When I got there, we had zero happy customers.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Not one customer would refer us.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I asked them all.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
We had marginal profit -- I did.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
We had marginal profits,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and we had unhappy stakeholders.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Through some basic change,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
change like improving transparency,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
change like promoting self-direction

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and collaboration, encouraging collaboration,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
not autocracy,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
the things like having a results-focus.
