00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
not autocracy,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
the things like having a results-focus.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I don't care when you get in in the morning. I don't care when you leave.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I care that your customer and your team is happy

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and you're organized with that.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Why do I care if you get in at nine o'clock?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Basically promoting fun.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Through promoting fun and a great environment,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
we were able to transform Sciant

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and, in just three short years --

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
sounds like a long time, but change is slow --

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
every customer, from zero to every customer referring us,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
above average profits for the industry

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and happy stakeholders.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And you can say, "Well how do you know they're happy?"
