00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
For example, it's been shown

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
to stimulate neural growth in the amygdala,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
in the area where it controls emotions.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
It's been shown to promote pre-frontal cortex development

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
where a lot of cognition is happening.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
As a result, what happens?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
We develop more emotional maturity if we play more.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
We develop better decision-making ability

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
if we play more.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
These guys are facts.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
It's not fiction, it's not story tales, it's not make-believe;

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
it's cold, hard science.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
These are the benefits to play.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
It is a genetic birthright that we have,
