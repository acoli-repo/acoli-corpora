00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to transform Bulgaria for the better,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
for ourselves, for our friends,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
for our family and for our future.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
How did this happen?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Let's be positive now. We're going to get positive. How did this happen?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I think we're last because --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and this is going to be drastic to some of you --

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
because we are handicapping ourselves.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
We're holding ourselves back

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
because we don't value play.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I said "play," all right.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
In case some of you forgot what play is, this is what play looks like.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Babies play, kids play,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
adults play.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
We don't value play.
