00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and they're dealing with happy people that can make decisions and are fulfilled,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
how do the customers feel? They feel great.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And what do great customers do, great-feeling customers?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
but it can't work in Bulgaria.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
No way. We're different."

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
It does work in Bulgaria, you guys. Two reasons.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
One, play is universal.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
There's nothing weird about Bulgarians that we can't play,
