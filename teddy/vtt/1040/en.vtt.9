00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
But then what happens in step three?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I want to go back to work

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
because I need to further my career or I just want to go have coffees.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I'm going to give bebko to baba.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But we need to remember

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
that baba's been infected by the serious meme for 45 years.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So what happens?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
for that serious meme

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
to get out of our operating system.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
What happens then?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It goes into education where we have an antiquated education system
