00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And we said, "Well what about play and recess?"

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And they said, "Ha. There won't be a single moment in the schedule."

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
(Laughter)

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And we said, "He's five."

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
What a crime. What a crime.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And it's a crime

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
that our education system is so serious because education is serious

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that we're creating mindless, robotic workers

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
to put bolts in pre-drilled holes.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
But I'm sorry, the problems of today

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
are not the problems of the Industrial Revolution.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
We need adaptability,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
the ability to learn how to be creative and innovative.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
We don't need mechanized workers.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
But no, now our meme goes into work where we don't value play.
