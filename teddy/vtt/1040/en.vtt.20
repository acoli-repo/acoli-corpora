00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
It is a genetic birthright that we have,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
like walking or speaking or seeing.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And if we handicap ourselves with play,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
we handicap ourselves

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
as if we would with any other birthright that we have.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
We hold ourselves back.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Little exercise just for a second:

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
close your eyes

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and try to imagine a world without play.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Imagine a world without theater, without the arts,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
without song, without dancing,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
without soccer, without football,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
without laughter.
