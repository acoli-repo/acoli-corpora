00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
The more you play, the bigger the brains there are.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Dolphins, pretty big brains, play a lot.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
But who do you think

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
with the biggest brains are the biggest players?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Yours truly: humans.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Kids play, we play --

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
of every nationality, of every race,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
of every color, of every religion.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
It's a universal thing -- we play.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And it's not just kids, it's adults too.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Really cool term: neoteny --

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And who are the biggest neotenists?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Humans. We play sports.
