00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
We have the serious meme in us.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Well I'm going to say no.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And I will prove it to you in the next part of the speech --

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
that play is the catalyst, it is the revolution,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
that we can use to transform Bulgaria for the better.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Play:

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
our brains

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
are hardwired for play.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
over millions and billions of years,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
for play in animals and in humans.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And you know what?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Evolution does a really, really good job

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
of deselecting traits that aren't advantageous to us
