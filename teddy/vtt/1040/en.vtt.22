We even feel guilty if we're seen playing at work.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
"Oh, my colleagues see me laughing. I must not have enough work,"

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
or, "Oh, I've got to hide because my boss might see me.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
He's going to think I'm not working hard."

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
But I have news for you: our thinking is backwards.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
The opposite of play

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
is not work.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
The opposite of play

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
is depression. It's depression.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
In fact,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
play improves our work.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Just like there's benefits for humans and animals,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
there's benefits for play at work.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
For example, it stimulates creativity.
