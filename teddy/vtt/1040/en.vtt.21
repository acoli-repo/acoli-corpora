00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
without laughter.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
What does this world look like?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
It's pretty bleak.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
It's pretty glum.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Now imagine your workplace.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Is it fun? Is it playful?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Or maybe the workplace of your friends -- here we're forward thinking.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Is it fun? Is it playful?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Or is it crap? Is it autocratic, controlling,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
restrictive and untrusting and unfulfilling?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
We have this concept

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
that the opposite of play is work.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
We even feel guilty if we're seen playing at work.
