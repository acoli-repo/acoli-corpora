00:00:07.218 --> 00:00:11.687
Two perfectly rational gingerbread men,
Crispy and Chewy,

00:00:11.687 --> 00:00:15.027
are out strolling 
when they’re caught by a fox.

00:00:15.027 --> 00:00:17.613
Seeing how happy they are, 
he decides that,

00:00:17.613 --> 00:00:19.613
instead of simply eating them,

00:00:19.613 --> 00:00:23.700
he’ll put their friendship 
to the test with a cruel dilemma.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.290
He’ll ask each gingerbread man whether
he’d opt to Spare or Sacrifice the other.
