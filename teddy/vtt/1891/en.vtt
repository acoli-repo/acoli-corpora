I'm a huge believer in hands-on education.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
But you have to have the right tools.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If I'm going to teach my daughter about electronics,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm not going to give her a soldering iron.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And similarly, she finds prototyping boards

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
really frustrating for her little hands.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So my wonderful student Sam and I

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of:

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Play-Doh.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And so we spent a summer

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
looking at different Play-Doh recipes.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And these recipes probably look really familiar

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to any of you who have made homemade play-dough --
