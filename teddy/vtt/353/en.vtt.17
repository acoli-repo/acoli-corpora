00:08:28.952 --> 00:08:30.810
It would give us an unfair advantage against battling

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.802
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and other epidemics.

00:08:34.802 --> 00:08:36.498
Over time, we would hope it would become

00:08:36.498 --> 00:08:38.672
a new platform for economic transactions,

00:08:38.672 --> 00:08:41.133
lifting millions of people out of poverty.

00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:43.343
In the developed world and the emerging world,

00:08:43.343 --> 00:08:44.811
we would hope it would become a new mode

00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:48.532
of transportation that could help make our cities

00:08:48.532 --> 00:08:50.385
more livable.

00:08:50.385 --> 00:08:53.728
So for those that still believe
that this is science fiction,

00:08:53.728 --> 00:08:56.543
I firmly say to you that it is not.

00:08:56.543 --> 00:08:58.212
We do need to engage, though,

00:08:58.212 --> 00:09:01.280
in social fiction to make it happen.
