00:05:58.006 --> 00:06:01.163
We think this can be -- this is the power

00:06:01.163 --> 00:06:03.882
of a new paradigm.

00:06:03.882 --> 00:06:06.365
So here we are: a new idea

00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.235
about a network for transportation

00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:10.881
that is based on the ideas of the Internet.

00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:13.110
It's decentralized, it's peer-to-peer,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.813
it's bidirectional, highly adaptable,

00:06:15.813 --> 00:06:18.323
with very low infrastructure investment,

00:06:18.323 --> 00:06:22.456
very low ecological footprint.

00:06:22.456 --> 00:06:24.740
If it is a new paradigm, though,

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.886
there must be other uses for it.

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:29.052
It can be used perhaps in other places in the world.

00:06:29.052 --> 00:06:33.230
So let's look at the other end of the spectrum:
