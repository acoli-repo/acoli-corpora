00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.078
looks like.

00:04:01.078 --> 00:04:05.020
Here we are flying in Haiti last summer,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.463
where we've done our first field trials.

00:04:07.463 --> 00:04:09.607
We're modeling here a medical delivery

00:04:09.607 --> 00:04:14.447
in a camp we set up after the 2010 earthquake.

00:04:14.447 --> 00:04:16.998
People there love this.

00:04:16.998 --> 00:04:19.127
And I want to show you

00:04:19.127 --> 00:04:24.003
what one of those vehicles looks like up close.

00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:26.011
So this is a $3,000 vehicle.

00:04:26.011 --> 00:04:30.028
Costs are coming down very rapidly.
