00:02:56.443 --> 00:03:00.137
to navigate between ground stations.

00:03:00.137 --> 00:03:02.562
Every vehicle is equipped with an automatic

00:03:02.562 --> 00:03:05.600
payload and battery exchange mechanism,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.006
so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations,

00:03:08.006 --> 00:03:10.122
they dock, swap a battery automatically,

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:11.826
and go out again.

00:03:11.826 --> 00:03:14.582
The ground stations are located on safe locations

00:03:14.582 --> 00:03:16.144
on the ground.

00:03:16.144 --> 00:03:18.143
They secure the most vulnerable part of the mission,

00:03:18.143 --> 00:03:19.997
which is the landing.

00:03:19.997 --> 00:03:22.089
They are at known locations on the ground,

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:24.009
so the paths between them are also known,

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:26.747
which is very important from a reliability perspective

00:03:26.747 --> 00:03:28.298
from the whole network.

00:03:28.298 --> 00:03:31.122
Apart from fulfilling the energy
requirements of the vehicles,
