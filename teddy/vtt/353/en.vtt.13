00:06:29.052 --> 00:06:33.230
So let's look at the other end of the spectrum:

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.235
our cities and megacities.

00:06:35.235 --> 00:06:38.107
Half of the Earth's population lives in cities today.

00:06:38.107 --> 00:06:40.827
Half a billion of us live in megacities.

00:06:40.827 --> 00:06:43.507
We are living through an amazing urbanization trend.

00:06:43.507 --> 00:06:45.480
China alone is adding a megacity

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.587
the size of New York City every two years.

00:06:48.587 --> 00:06:51.240
These are places that do have road infrastructure,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.554
but it's very inefficient.

00:06:53.554 --> 00:06:55.686
Congestion is a huge problem.

00:06:55.686 --> 00:06:57.626
So we think it makes sense in those places

00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:59.996
to set up a network of transportation

00:06:59.996 --> 00:07:02.162
that is a new layer that sits between the road
