00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:03.053
It's an ultra-flexible, automated logistics network.

00:02:03.053 --> 00:02:05.988
It's a network for a transportation of matter.

00:02:05.988 --> 00:02:07.765
We call it Matternet.

00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:09.279
We use three key technologies.

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:11.914
The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles.

00:02:11.914 --> 00:02:14.625
The second is automated ground stations

00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:16.604
that the vehicles fly in and out of

00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:18.862
to swap batteries and fly farther,

00:02:18.862 --> 00:02:20.604
or pick up or deliver loads.

00:02:20.604 --> 00:02:22.335
And the third is the operating system

00:02:22.335 --> 00:02:25.078
that manages the whole network.

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:28.417
Let's look at each one of those
technologies in a bit more detail.

00:02:28.417 --> 00:02:30.662
First of all, the UAVs.
