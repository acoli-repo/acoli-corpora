00:00:59.764 --> 00:01:02.884
that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog

00:01:02.884 --> 00:01:05.239
in the same way they've done with mobile telephones

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.114
in the last 10 years?

00:01:07.114 --> 00:01:10.059
Many of those nations have excellent telecommunications today

00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:13.036
without ever putting copper lines in the ground.

00:01:13.036 --> 00:01:16.386
Could we do the same for transportation?

00:01:16.386 --> 00:01:18.701
Imagine this scenario.

00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:21.859
Imagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali,

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:25.089
and have a newborn in need of urgent medication.

00:01:25.089 --> 00:01:27.321
What would you do today?

00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:29.718
Well, you would place a request via mobile phone,

00:01:29.718 --> 00:01:32.582
and someone would get the request immediately.
