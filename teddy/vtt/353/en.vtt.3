00:01:29.718 --> 00:01:32.582
and someone would get the request immediately.

00:01:32.582 --> 00:01:34.575
That's the part that works.

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:36.612
The medication may take days to arrive, though,

00:01:36.612 --> 00:01:38.022
because of bad roads.

00:01:38.022 --> 00:01:40.378
That's the part that's broken.

00:01:40.378 --> 00:01:42.895
We believe we can deliver it within hours

00:01:42.895 --> 00:01:45.476
with an electric autonomous flying vehicle

00:01:45.476 --> 00:01:46.881
such as this.

00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:49.766
This can transport a small payload
today, about two kilograms,

00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:52.400
over a short distance, about 10 kilometers,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.755
but it's part of a wider network that may cover

00:01:54.755 --> 00:01:58.715
the entire country, maybe even the entire continent.

00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:03.053
It's an ultra-flexible, automated logistics network.
