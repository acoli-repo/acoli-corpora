00:03:28.298 --> 00:03:31.122
Apart from fulfilling the energy
requirements of the vehicles,

00:03:31.122 --> 00:03:33.494
eventually they're going to be becoming

00:03:33.494 --> 00:03:36.194
commercial hubs where people can take out loads

00:03:36.194 --> 00:03:39.257
or put loads into the network.

00:03:39.257 --> 00:03:41.480
The last component is the operating system

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.374
that manages the whole network.

00:03:43.374 --> 00:03:46.115
It monitors weather data from all the ground stations

00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:49.456
and optimizes the routes of
the vehicles through the system

00:03:49.456 --> 00:03:52.047
to avoid adverse weather conditions,

00:03:52.047 --> 00:03:54.050
avoid other risk factors,

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.770
and optimize the use of the resources

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.668
throughout the network.

00:03:57.668 --> 00:03:59.310
I want to show you what one of those flights

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.078
looks like.
