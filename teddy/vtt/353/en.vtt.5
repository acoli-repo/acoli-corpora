00:02:28.417 --> 00:02:30.662
First of all, the UAVs.

00:02:30.662 --> 00:02:32.746
Eventually, we're going to be
using all sorts of vehicles

00:02:32.746 --> 00:02:35.200
for different payload capacities and different ranges.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.456
Today, we're using small quads.

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:39.799
These are able to transport two kilograms

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.612
over 10 kilometers in just about 15 minutes.

00:02:42.612 --> 00:02:45.138
Compare this with trying to trespass a bad road

00:02:45.138 --> 00:02:46.552
in the developing world,

00:02:46.552 --> 00:02:48.772
or even being stuck in traffic

00:02:48.772 --> 00:02:50.817
in a developed world country.

00:02:50.817 --> 00:02:52.527
These fly autonomously.

00:02:52.527 --> 00:02:54.083
This is the key to the technology.

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:56.443
So they use GPS and other sensors on board

00:02:56.443 --> 00:03:00.137
to navigate between ground stations.
