00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.659
Investments are being made,

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:33.204
but at the current level,

00:00:33.204 --> 00:00:34.601
it's estimated it's going to take them

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:37.707
50 years to catch up.

00:00:37.707 --> 00:00:40.001
In the U.S. alone, there's more than four million

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:43.132
miles of roads, very expensive to build,

00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:46.503
very expensive to maintain infrastructure,

00:00:46.503 --> 00:00:48.772
with a huge ecological footprint,

00:00:48.772 --> 00:00:52.444
and yet, very often, congested.

00:00:52.444 --> 00:00:54.826
So we saw this and we thought,

00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:56.309
can there be a better way?

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.764
Can we create a system using today's
most advanced technologies

00:00:59.764 --> 00:01:02.884
that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog
