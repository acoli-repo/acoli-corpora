As an architect, I often ask myself,

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:05.759
what is the origin of the forms that we design?

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.664
What kind of forms could we design

00:00:08.664 --> 00:00:11.487
if we wouldn't work with references anymore?

00:00:11.487 --> 00:00:14.872
If we had no bias, if we had no preconceptions,

00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:17.079
what kind of forms could we design

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:18.679
if we could free ourselves from

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.815
our experience?

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:25.549
If we could free ourselves from our education?

00:00:25.549 --> 00:00:28.576
What would these unseen forms look like?

00:00:28.576 --> 00:00:32.287
Would they surprise us? Would they intrigue us?
