00:00:00.108 --> 00:00:03.487
We conventionally divide space

00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:05.049
into private and public realms,

00:00:05.073 --> 00:00:08.316
and we know these legal
distinctions very well

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.324
because we've become experts

00:00:10.348 --> 00:00:14.184
at protecting our private
property and private space.

00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:16.088
But we're less attuned

00:00:16.112 --> 00:00:19.643
to the nuances of the public.

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:23.566
What translates generic public
space into qualitative space?

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.972
I mean, this is something

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:26.797
that our studio has been working on

00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:28.305
for the past decade.

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.568
And we're doing this
through some case studies.
