00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:31.601
our biodiversity,

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:34.228
our culture, our education.

00:04:34.688 --> 00:04:37.561
I invite you all,

00:04:37.585 --> 00:04:39.950
I invite all companies,

00:04:39.974 --> 00:04:43.966
I invite all governments,
all civil society,

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.879
to listen to indigenous peoples,

00:04:45.903 --> 00:04:48.370
to go back to our roots.

00:04:48.776 --> 00:04:53.950
We have been here
for many, many ... for centuries.

00:04:53.974 --> 00:04:56.831
And we have been trying
to scream to the world

00:04:56.855 --> 00:04:59.633
that we need to protect
our territory, our nature.

00:04:59.657 --> 00:05:01.506
And you never listen to us.
