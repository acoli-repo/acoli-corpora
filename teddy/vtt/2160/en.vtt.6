00:02:56.474 --> 00:03:01.966
today is a time to wake, unite us.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.849
We Yawanawá are doing our part.

00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:06.465
We take care of Mother Earth.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.280
And now, I will give to my wife.

00:03:11.844 --> 00:03:15.947
Laura Yawanawá: We are here
with our hearts crying.

00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:19.756
I am smiling here, but my heart is crying,

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.864
because a lot of our forests
are being destroyed.

00:03:24.748 --> 00:03:27.803
And I just want to give you a message.

00:03:28.328 --> 00:03:33.390
This crisis is giving
humanity two options.
