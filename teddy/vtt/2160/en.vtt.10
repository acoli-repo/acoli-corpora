00:04:59.657 --> 00:05:01.506
And you never listen to us.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.696
Never.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.664
I guess this crisis is teaching humanity

00:05:06.688 --> 00:05:08.974
that now you need to listen to us

00:05:08.998 --> 00:05:11.807
and to support indigenous
peoples directly,

00:05:11.831 --> 00:05:14.871
to support their initiatives directly.

00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:20.339
So that's the message
that I would love to leave to you.

00:05:20.363 --> 00:05:22.649
That indigenous people have the answer,

00:05:22.673 --> 00:05:24.934
and if you want to save the Amazon,

00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.648
we have to take action now.

00:05:29.927 --> 00:05:31.127
