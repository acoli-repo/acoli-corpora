to reconnect us
to the spirit of the rainforest.

00:01:33.173 --> 00:01:35.427
From immemorial time,

00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:39.061
my people live in the Yawanawá territory.

00:01:39.998 --> 00:01:43.467
We see this holistic way

00:01:44.584 --> 00:01:46.855
of how nature is.

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:52.418
Nature, to us, belongs
to the whole of humanity.

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:55.149
And we Yawanawá see

00:01:56.276 --> 00:01:58.809
the environment, the forest, as alive.

00:01:59.807 --> 00:02:03.310
But everything is always a challenge.
