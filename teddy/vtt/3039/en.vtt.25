So it's all very important
for not just industrializing

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.761
and being able to meet people's needs,

00:12:33.785 --> 00:12:36.706
but also making sure
that the environment is taken care of.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.881
We're also really interested in culture.

00:12:38.905 --> 00:12:42.287
We have lots of discussions in our space
around who we were as Africans,

00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:44.223
who we are today, and who we want to be

00:12:44.247 --> 00:12:48.262
vis-à-vis things like consumerism
and ethnicity and corruption and so on.

00:12:48.745 --> 00:12:52.564
So we see ourselves as providing,
adding value to people

00:12:52.588 --> 00:12:56.191
by teaching them to add value
to things or materials

00:12:56.215 --> 00:12:58.366
so that they can build things that matter.

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.249
Thank you very much for your attention.
