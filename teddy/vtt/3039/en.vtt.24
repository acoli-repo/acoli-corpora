00:11:59.863 --> 00:12:01.514
as you can see there,

00:12:01.538 --> 00:12:04.499
and this other famous guy
actually presented the same idea,

00:12:04.523 --> 00:12:07.144
but as far as we're concerned,
if it was after us, so --

00:12:07.168 --> 00:12:08.212
(Laughter)

00:12:08.236 --> 00:12:12.514
(Applause)

00:12:12.538 --> 00:12:16.760
So in closing, going forward,
of course being able to prototype

00:12:16.784 --> 00:12:19.156
and do low manufacturing
in this kind of a setting

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.704
is very important
for the industrialization process,

00:12:21.728 --> 00:12:24.967
but we're also taking advantage
of a lot of new ways of doing things:

00:12:24.991 --> 00:12:26.247
the open source movement,

00:12:26.271 --> 00:12:28.563
distributive manufacturing,
circular production.

00:12:28.587 --> 00:12:31.926
So it's all very important
for not just industrializing
