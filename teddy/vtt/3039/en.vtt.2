00:00:59.187 --> 00:01:01.425
So the challenge
is a lot greater, in many ways,

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.571
than it even was when Asia
was industrializing, for example.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.668
To add to this, one of the kinds
of person that you need

00:01:09.692 --> 00:01:11.843
for industrialization is an engineer,

00:01:11.867 --> 00:01:14.319
and they're really in short supply
on the continent.

00:01:14.343 --> 00:01:16.840
If you compare, for example,
the number of engineers

00:01:16.864 --> 00:01:18.622
that those same Asian countries had

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:21.294
a couple of decades ago
when they were industrializing,

00:01:21.318 --> 00:01:23.264
we fall far short.

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:25.655
And I've taught for a while,

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.177
and many of the students
who are studying engineering

00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:31.476
end up actually working
in auditing firms and banks,
