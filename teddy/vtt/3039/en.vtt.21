00:10:28.571 --> 00:10:32.032
and breaking it down
is unhygienic at the retail level,

00:10:32.056 --> 00:10:34.738
and packaging each one
of them is too expensive.

00:10:34.762 --> 00:10:37.937
So she thought up an idea,
which is brilliant, and simple.

00:10:37.961 --> 00:10:39.820
Why don't we just use vending machines?

00:10:39.844 --> 00:10:43.035
And she, in a very clean environment,
can break down the bundles

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:44.932
and fill up the vending machines,

00:10:44.956 --> 00:10:47.981
and then girls can buy
these sanitary towels

00:10:48.005 --> 00:10:52.171
in the privacy of a toilet,
in a public space, in a school, and so on.

00:10:52.195 --> 00:10:55.148
She was able to pilot this
and it worked really very well,

00:10:55.172 --> 00:10:57.888
and she's been able to sort of
get the bugs out and so on.

00:10:57.912 --> 00:11:01.373
So the significance here
is that the piloting process is possible.
