00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:00.493
and then populate the board
using this robot.

00:06:00.517 --> 00:06:05.208
And so what would normally take him maybe
a day or something to solder by hand,

00:06:05.232 --> 00:06:07.431
he can do in a few minutes
using this machine.

00:06:07.455 --> 00:06:10.248
So he was able to complete
the entire order within Gearbox,

00:06:10.272 --> 00:06:11.692
and this is really important,

00:06:11.716 --> 00:06:14.479
because if it wasn't for
what we provided right now,

00:06:14.503 --> 00:06:18.386
he would have had to have hired
a company in China to do this,

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.670
and because it's such a small order,
it would have taken a long time.

00:06:21.694 --> 00:06:23.210
It would be a small company,

00:06:23.234 --> 00:06:25.559
because big companies
wouldn't take small orders,

00:06:25.583 --> 00:06:27.584
and even then, if they got a bigger order,

00:06:27.608 --> 00:06:29.742
they'd bump him off in favor of that.

00:06:29.766 --> 00:06:31.672
And there's language problems and so on,
