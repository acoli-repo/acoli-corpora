By the year 2050, the population
of Africa will have doubled.

00:00:05.406 --> 00:00:08.786
One in four people on Earth
will be African at that point,

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.663

for the first time in the modern era,

00:00:15.687 --> 00:00:18.870

to bully everybody else.

00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:20.084

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:25.107
But it's daunting, because we're going
to have to have economies

00:00:25.131 --> 00:00:27.069
that can sustain this population growth,

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:29.597
and many of the people
are going to be very young.

00:00:29.621 --> 00:00:33.291
Now most of governments in Africa
have a plan for this economic growth --
