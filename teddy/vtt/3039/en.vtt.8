00:03:59.613 --> 00:04:02.217
So we needed to scale this,

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:05.423
and at the university,
things were a bit too bureaucratic,

00:04:05.447 --> 00:04:08.662
and so I moved out and I hooked up
with people who, in Nairobi,

00:04:08.686 --> 00:04:11.336
were providing spaces for IT experts

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.043
to share fast internet
and things like that.

00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:16.390
And some of these places
are really quite famous.

00:04:16.414 --> 00:04:18.836
They've made Kenya famous for IT.

00:04:19.774 --> 00:04:24.282
And together we set up a space
which we are setting up right now.

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:25.895
We've moved from where we were.

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.439
We are in a much larger space,

00:04:27.463 --> 00:04:30.967
and we're sort of making available
a wide range of equipment,
