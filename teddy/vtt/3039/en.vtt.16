00:07:59.451 --> 00:08:00.969
Now this is really important --

00:08:00.993 --> 00:08:03.750
(Applause)

00:08:03.774 --> 00:08:07.972
and it's really important because
the population growth being what it is,

00:08:07.996 --> 00:08:10.695
a lot of very large companies
are looking very closely

00:08:10.719 --> 00:08:12.785
at the market that's developing in Africa.

00:08:12.809 --> 00:08:15.634
So in Kenya right now, we have
Volkswagen, Peugeot, Renault,

00:08:15.658 --> 00:08:17.203
we have Mercedes doing lorries,

00:08:17.227 --> 00:08:19.970
and we've also got Toyota,
they've been there a long time.

00:08:19.994 --> 00:08:22.853
And these are all manufacturers
planning to assemble vehicles

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:25.179
and in the future,
to manufacture in the country.

00:08:25.203 --> 00:08:28.347
Many of them are planning
to train lots of people that they'd hire,

00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:30.420
and that's really important
for the economy,
