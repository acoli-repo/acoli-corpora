So the significance here
is that the piloting process is possible.

She's not an engineer.

00:11:02.654 --> 00:11:06.287
She was able to engage people in our space
to be able to help her to do this,

00:11:06.311 --> 00:11:09.039
and she's off and running now
with a business accelerator,

00:11:09.063 --> 00:11:10.704
so we expect to see great results.

the result of a master's project
that was done at University of Nairobi

00:11:19.805 --> 00:11:21.731
by Tony Nyagah, an engineering student,

00:11:21.755 --> 00:11:24.862
and he just integrated
a solar cell into a roof tile

00:11:24.886 --> 00:11:26.569
and decided to make it a business.

00:11:26.593 --> 00:11:28.891
He joined up with his sister
who is an architect,

00:11:28.915 --> 00:11:30.262
and they have this business,
