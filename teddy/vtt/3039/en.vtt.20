00:09:56.775 --> 00:10:01.653
should be able to jump by a quantum
amount, quite significantly,

00:10:01.677 --> 00:10:03.232
because of this kind of machine.

00:10:03.256 --> 00:10:06.848

00:10:22.523 --> 00:10:24.555
And the reason that she described

00:10:24.579 --> 00:10:28.547
was that the manufacturers
packaged these in bundles of seven to 10,

00:10:28.571 --> 00:10:32.032
