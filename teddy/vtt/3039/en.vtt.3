00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:31.476
end up actually working
in auditing firms and banks,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.556
and many of them spend half their time
doing accounting and so on

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.929
as they're preparing.

00:01:36.538 --> 00:01:40.825
Now, I was fortunate enough
to do my undergrad and postgrad education

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:43.388
in the UK and the US,
in countries, environments,

00:01:43.412 --> 00:01:46.094
where there was all the equipment
that you required,

00:01:46.118 --> 00:01:48.221
all the sophistication in the systems,

00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:50.539
and then I worked
for about three years in Japan

00:01:50.563 --> 00:01:52.499
doing R&amp;D for a large firm.

00:01:52.523 --> 00:01:54.785
And so I was very used
to having good equipment,

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:55.973
and went back home

00:01:55.997 --> 00:01:59.175
and joined the Faculty of Engineering
at the University of Nairobi,

00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:01.355
wanting to contribute
and be on the continent.
