00:00:29.621 --> 00:00:33.291
Now most of governments in Africa
have a plan for this economic growth --

00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:35.923
in Kenya, we call ours Vision2030 --

00:00:35.947 --> 00:00:38.454
and they're all predicated
on industrialization.

00:00:39.327 --> 00:00:41.102
The thing is, though, that the world

00:00:41.126 --> 00:00:43.968
is going through the Fourth
Industrial Revolution right now,

00:00:43.992 --> 00:00:45.565
which means that there's a merger

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:47.764
of the physical, cyber,
and biological worlds.

00:00:47.788 --> 00:00:51.550
It means that because of
massive interconnectivity

00:00:51.574 --> 00:00:55.091
and the availability
of artificial intelligence and robotics,

00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:57.688
many of the jobs that we know
and are used to right now

00:00:57.712 --> 00:00:59.163
won't exist in the future.

00:00:59.187 --> 00:01:01.425
So the challenge
is a lot greater, in many ways,
