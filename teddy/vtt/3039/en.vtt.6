00:02:57.487 --> 00:03:01.098
engineering students
from different disciplines

00:03:01.122 --> 00:03:05.025
were doing the lab and practical exercises
together in the same space.

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.900
Normally, they'd be siloed.

00:03:06.924 --> 00:03:09.800
And not just that, but students
who weren't engineers at all

00:03:09.824 --> 00:03:11.726
were also working in the same place,

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.933
and non-students, people
who had nothing to do with the university,

00:03:14.957 --> 00:03:16.560
were also coming into this space.

00:03:16.584 --> 00:03:18.251
So you had this rich mix of people,

00:03:18.275 --> 00:03:20.420
people who think
differently from one another,

00:03:20.444 --> 00:03:22.829
and this always
is really good for innovation.

00:03:22.853 --> 00:03:24.941
I was really proud of what we were seeing.

00:03:24.965 --> 00:03:26.409
So you can imagine my surprise

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:29.447
when one day the dean of engineering
came and said to me,

00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:33.368
"Kamau, the students
who spend most of the time in the Fab Lab
