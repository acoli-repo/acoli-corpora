00:05:27.954 --> 00:05:30.341
And so this is a model for business

00:05:30.365 --> 00:05:35.166
that's made accessibility to goods
and services for very poor people

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.103
really much easier,
because they're able to pay a little bit,

00:05:38.127 --> 00:05:39.922
like a dollar a day, for example,

00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:41.594
for a specific service.

00:05:41.618 --> 00:05:44.603
And so this company wanted
to pilot a new idea that they had,

00:05:44.627 --> 00:05:46.412
and so they just needed 50 circuits,

00:05:46.436 --> 00:05:47.914
so they hired him to make them,

00:05:47.938 --> 00:05:50.017
and what you're seeing him doing there is,

00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:53.357
he's able to design on the computer
what the circuit will be

00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:55.485
and then transfer it
to an etching process --

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:57.225
that's the image on the top right --

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:00.493
and then populate the board
using this robot.
