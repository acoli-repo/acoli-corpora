00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:32.693
And I heard about a concept
out of MIT, called the Fab Labs.

00:02:33.072 --> 00:02:35.075
These are digital fabrication labs

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.687
that allow, in a rather small space
with not very expensive equipment,

00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:40.826
people to have access to these tools

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.978
to be able to make almost anything,

00:02:43.002 --> 00:02:44.175
as the slogan goes.

00:02:44.728 --> 00:02:47.430
And so I was able to convince
a government official

00:02:47.454 --> 00:02:50.288
to buy one of these for the university
where I was teaching.

00:02:50.312 --> 00:02:52.312
And immediately, we had wonderful results.

00:02:52.336 --> 00:02:54.629
We saw all kinds
of innovations coming through,

00:02:54.653 --> 00:02:57.463
and for the first time
in this context at the university,

00:02:57.487 --> 00:03:01.098
engineering students
from different disciplines
