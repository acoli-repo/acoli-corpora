00:09:30.131 --> 00:09:32.600
And the result is that some of them

00:09:32.624 --> 00:09:36.585
are going to be able to get loans
to buy the machine for themselves.

00:09:36.609 --> 00:09:40.108
Others will be able to go to centers
where they can carry their material,

00:09:40.132 --> 00:09:41.403
get the design done,

00:09:41.427 --> 00:09:44.927
and take the materials back
that have been made really, really fast

00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:46.809
and assemble them in their own spaces.

00:09:46.833 --> 00:09:49.618
So somebody making a gate,
for example, out of metal,

00:09:49.642 --> 00:09:51.578
may take a week to make just one gate,

00:09:51.602 --> 00:09:54.055
but with this machine,
they might make 10 in a day.

00:09:54.079 --> 00:09:56.751
So the productivity of a large swathe
of our population

00:09:56.775 --> 00:10:01.653
should be able to jump by a quantum
amount, quite significantly,
