WEBVTT

00:04:27.463 --> 00:04:30.967
and we're sort of making available
a wide range of equipment,

00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:33.824
including the digital fabrication
tools that I mentioned,

00:04:33.848 --> 00:04:35.325
and analog tools,

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:37.865
to anybody really, on a membership basis.

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.144
It's a bit like a gym,
so you come in, you pay,

00:04:40.168 --> 00:04:42.082
you get taught how to use the equipment,

00:04:42.106 --> 00:04:45.821
and then you're set free to innovate
and do whatever it is that you want,

00:04:45.845 --> 00:04:48.474
and you don't have to be
an engineer, necessarily.

00:04:48.498 --> 00:04:51.689
And some of the people in the space
are setting up a small company.

00:04:51.713 --> 00:04:53.383
They just need a space at a desk,

00:04:53.407 --> 00:04:54.980
and so we provide that at a fee,

00:04:55.004 --> 00:04:58.290
and others take up bigger spaces
and are able to set up their offices.

00:04:58.314 --> 00:04:59.546
They're further along.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.666
Maybe their company has been running
for a certain period of time.
