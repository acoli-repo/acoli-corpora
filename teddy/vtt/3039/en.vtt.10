Maybe their company has been running
for a certain period of time.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.759
And so we're able
to accommodate all of this

00:05:04.783 --> 00:05:08.512
in an innovation space
that is really quite active.

00:05:08.966 --> 00:05:11.761
What you're seeing in this image
over here is Douglas,

00:05:11.785 --> 00:05:13.681
and Douglas is an electrical engineer,

00:05:13.705 --> 00:05:16.355
one of the people
who was really active in the Fab Lab.

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:18.197
I'm pretty sure he passed his exams.

00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:21.460
And the image on the top left

00:05:21.857 --> 00:05:24.842
And he designed a circuit
that the client came to him and said,

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:27.930
"I need this circuit
for a pay-as-you-go system."

00:05:27.954 --> 00:05:30.341
And so this is a model for business
