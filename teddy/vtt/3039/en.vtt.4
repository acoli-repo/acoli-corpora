00:01:59.199 --> 00:02:01.355
wanting to contribute
and be on the continent.

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:03.863
And I quickly found
I was really quite useless,

00:02:03.887 --> 00:02:08.548
because there wasn't all the equipment
that I had become accustomed to available.

00:02:08.572 --> 00:02:12.596
And I was teaching students who I would
find very bright ideas in their minds

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.621
and they'd be presenting
things that I knew

00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:16.422
if only we had sufficient equipment,

00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:21.271
they'd be able to really contribute
to the challenge of industrialization.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:25.677
So I kind of had to change hats,
and became quite entrepreneurial

00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:29.177
and started looking for money
to buy the equipment that we required.

00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:32.693
And I heard about a concept
out of MIT, called the Fab Labs.
