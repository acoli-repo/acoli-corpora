00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I live and work from Tokyo, Japan.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And I specialize in human behavioral research,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and to design for that future.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And you know, to be honest, I've been doing this for seven years,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and I haven't got a clue what the future is going to be like.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But I've got a pretty good idea

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
how people will behave when they get there.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This is my office. It's out there.
