00:01:56.572 --> 00:02:00.017
are those ultimately
just your personal moral values?

00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:03.580
Or might there be a sense
in which they can objectively be judged

00:02:03.604 --> 00:02:05.428
to be true or false?

00:02:05.452 --> 00:02:08.802
If you believe in God, there's
an easy enough answer to this question.

00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:11.483
Good is what God
has revealed to us is good.

00:02:11.927 --> 00:02:13.991
He's created human beings with consciences

00:02:14.015 --> 00:02:17.244
and with a holy book that sets out
what is right and what is wrong.

00:02:17.268 --> 00:02:19.800
But most modern philosophers,
academic scientists,

00:02:19.824 --> 00:02:22.521
don't think you can outsource
morality to God.

00:02:23.067 --> 00:02:26.004
They would say there is
a fundamental difference in the world

00:02:26.028 --> 00:02:28.279
between facts and values.

00:02:28.303 --> 00:02:30.821
Facts are statements about the real world.
