00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:01.868
through an ever-deeper
knowledge of science --

00:03:01.892 --> 00:03:05.398
of psychology, for example,
of how human societies operate --

00:03:05.422 --> 00:03:07.138
and the exercise of reason.

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:09.875
There's a lot at stake here.

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:11.470
If Sam Harris is wrong,

00:03:11.494 --> 00:03:14.279
and the majority of scientists
and philosophers are right,

00:03:14.303 --> 00:03:18.223
then it's hard to see how there can be
such a thing as moral progress.

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:23.126
If a moral system is simply the subjective
values that a culture creates,

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.422
it puts a limit on how much you can argue
against views you disagree with,

00:03:27.446 --> 00:03:31.261
like the sanctity of life
or child marriage.
