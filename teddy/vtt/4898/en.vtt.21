00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.185
is that even the most
hard-headed scientist

00:10:32.209 --> 00:10:34.089
could use a totally different standard,

00:10:34.113 --> 00:10:36.573
and so to give you an analogy here,

00:10:36.597 --> 00:10:40.338
if you take something like physics
as the prototypical case,

00:10:40.362 --> 00:10:43.046
so if someone shows up
at a physics conference

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.864
with his cockamamy view of physics

00:10:45.888 --> 00:10:49.057
that can't be integrated
with standard physics,

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:52.915
if someone wants to argue
for a biblical physics, say,

00:10:52.939 --> 00:10:55.858
that person just doesn't get invited
back to the conference.

00:10:55.882 --> 00:10:59.222
There's no burden upon mainstream physics

00:10:59.246 --> 00:11:01.993
to incorporate that view into physics,
