00:15:59.159 --> 00:16:04.217
is that the root from science
to morality, as it were --

00:16:04.241 --> 00:16:06.654
you've described it
as sort of a reason-based root.

00:16:06.678 --> 00:16:09.059
There's another root
that people might give,

00:16:09.083 --> 00:16:11.989
which is a sort of an evolution-based
route to morality,

00:16:12.013 --> 00:16:16.672
which would say that it's completely
credible to believe that apes,

00:16:16.696 --> 00:16:19.069
and, certainly, our ancestors,

00:16:19.093 --> 00:16:22.367
evolved a conscience
or perhaps multiple consciences,

00:16:22.391 --> 00:16:25.145
if you like, moral instincts
that guided behavior

00:16:25.169 --> 00:16:27.351
which turn out to be really helpful

00:16:27.375 --> 00:16:31.692
for surviving or promoting
group collaboration and so forth.
