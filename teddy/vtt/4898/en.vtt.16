00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:03.346
but there was also
this beautiful artwork in the sky

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.759
that was somehow
some creation of perfection.

00:08:05.783 --> 00:08:10.506
Like, people could disagree about which
of those two was the worst, couldn't they?

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:14.045
SH: Yes, what you're saying is true
of my picture of morality in general,

00:08:14.069 --> 00:08:16.316
and that's why I called it
a moral landscape,

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.211
where you have peaks and valleys

00:08:18.235 --> 00:08:20.956
and some of these peaks
could be equivalent

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.017
and some of the valleys
could be equivalent, but yet different.

00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:27.834
So you could have societies of people
functioning by very different principles

00:08:27.858 --> 00:08:30.596
and moral intuitions
and senses of what's right and wrong,
