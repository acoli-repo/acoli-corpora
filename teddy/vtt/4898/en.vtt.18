00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.991
So if you're telling me there's somebody

00:09:02.015 --> 00:09:05.868
who would consider
a universe of dirt to be worse

00:09:05.892 --> 00:09:09.043
than a universe of painful torment,

00:09:09.067 --> 00:09:11.623
well then, that's the universe he gets.

00:09:11.647 --> 00:09:15.656
So however your mind is constituted

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.132
so as to suffer to the ultimate degree
for as long as possible,

00:09:19.156 --> 00:09:21.217
that's what you get in this universe.

00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:23.362
CA: And so someone who said,

00:09:23.386 --> 00:09:27.466
"But suffering isn't the point,
injustice is the point.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:31.832
So I think a worse universe than that
is one where people may not be suffering,
