and some of these states
are better than others,

00:06:34.392 --> 00:06:40.587

and that every other state
of the universe is better,

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.065

in reasoning about anything.

00:06:48.694 --> 00:06:51.763

00:06:57.851 --> 00:07:02.582
and we know there are
many other conditions on offer
