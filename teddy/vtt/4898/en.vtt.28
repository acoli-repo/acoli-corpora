00:13:59.267 --> 00:14:01.434
CA: I mean, by presenting
the ISIS case there,

00:14:01.458 --> 00:14:07.003
you've started with the awkward
larger implication of moral relativism.

00:14:07.027 --> 00:14:08.908
Most people wouldn't start there.

00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:11.577
They would say what they're
protecting is, for example,

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:14.003
if we discover a culture
in the Amazon Rain Forest

00:14:14.027 --> 00:14:17.233
that's never been discovered,
and we discover they have certain ways

00:14:17.257 --> 00:14:20.119
and certain moral preferences
in how they run their society,

00:14:20.143 --> 00:14:23.238
who are we to judge
and say our Western ways are better?

00:14:23.262 --> 00:14:27.654
But that kind of anthropology-driven
moral relativism,

00:14:27.678 --> 00:14:29.749
as championed
by people like Margaret Mead,

00:14:29.773 --> 00:14:31.867
becomes, quickly,
kind of an absurd position
