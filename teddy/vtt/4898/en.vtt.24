00:11:57.996 --> 00:12:00.896
that doesn't continually
undermine our conversation.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.994
Whereas with morality, it does.

00:12:03.018 --> 00:12:06.257
And so when you find another group

00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:10.194
behaving by a totally
divergent moral code,

00:12:10.218 --> 00:12:11.838
a group like ISIS, say.

00:12:11.862 --> 00:12:15.036
So ISIS thinks that the best thing to do

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:20.662
is kill apostates, kill blasphemers,
throw homosexuals from rooftops,

00:12:20.686 --> 00:12:22.117
take sex slaves,

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:25.029
and in the even best case,

00:12:25.053 --> 00:12:28.745
dying for the privilege of doing all this
in an act of martyrdom.

00:12:28.769 --> 00:12:31.427
So this is their conception
of a life well lived.
