00:01:30.054 --> 00:01:32.605
CA: So the debate
is over the nature of morality.

00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:37.756
Specifically, is there such a thing
as objective moral truth?

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.388
Or is morality inherently subjective,

00:01:41.412 --> 00:01:43.389
in which case all moral statements

00:01:43.413 --> 00:01:45.631
are ultimately just statements
about the values

00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:48.263
an individual or a culture
happens to hold?

00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:50.231
So let's give an example here.

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:53.041
I mean, look, if I say something
like, "It's wrong to lie,"

00:01:53.065 --> 00:01:56.548
or "We should all stop eating animals,"

00:01:56.572 --> 00:02:00.017
are those ultimately
just your personal moral values?
