00:08:27.858 --> 00:08:30.596
and moral intuitions
and senses of what's right and wrong,

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.639
and they could be enjoying
equivalent states of well-being

00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:34.978
that are irreconcilable.

00:08:35.002 --> 00:08:39.661
So you could have an island of perfectly
matched sadists and masochists, say,

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:42.027
and they might be happy
by their own lights,

00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:43.673
but we would look at them and say,

00:08:43.697 --> 00:08:46.597
"That's a completely bizarre
and undesirable way of living."

00:08:46.621 --> 00:08:49.595
So there is a kind of moral diversity
possible in my picture,

00:08:49.619 --> 00:08:52.026
but for this example,
this thought experiment,

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:56.487
just imagine that every conscious
system in that universe

00:08:56.511 --> 00:08:59.966
suffers as much as it possibly can
for as long as it can.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.991
So if you're telling me there's somebody
