00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:03.057
and he's also famed for his book
called "The Moral Landscape."

00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:05.630
That was the subject
of his first TED Talk.

00:01:06.309 --> 00:01:08.910
Sam Harris (from TED2010):
Most people, probably, here,

00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:10.935
think that science will never answer

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:13.389
the most important questions
in human life,

00:01:13.413 --> 00:01:16.882
questions like what is worth living for,
what is worth dying for,

00:01:16.906 --> 00:01:18.714
what constitutes a good life.

00:01:19.598 --> 00:01:22.622
So I'm going to argue
that this is an illusion,

00:01:22.646 --> 00:01:25.867
that the separation between
science and human values is an illusion,

00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:29.216
and actually quite a dangerous one
at this point in human history.
