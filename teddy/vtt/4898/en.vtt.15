CA: Let me push on one sort
of philosophical point back there.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.786
In describing the worst possible state
for all people, though,

00:07:37.064 --> 00:07:40.208
couldn't two different people
look at two universes

00:07:40.232 --> 00:07:43.117
and disagree about which one
was actually a worse state?

00:07:43.141 --> 00:07:49.030
In one, let's say, everyone
was making this God Almighty mess,

00:07:49.054 --> 00:07:50.975
they were just creating mud everywhere,

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:55.123
it was the ultimate pigsty,
and it was disgusting to look at.

00:07:55.147 --> 00:07:59.655
And in another, there were people
being hurt really badly,

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:03.346
but there was also
this beautiful artwork in the sky
