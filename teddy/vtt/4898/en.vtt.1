Politically, I would place him
at what you might call the radical center,

00:00:34.396 --> 00:00:39.324
a stern critic of Donald Trump, but also
of political correctness, for example.

00:00:40.152 --> 00:00:43.066
He has infuriated people
on both left and right

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.979
in almost equal measure,

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:48.119
but he has also delighted
many, many people

00:00:48.143 --> 00:00:51.573
because of his clarity of thought
and his fearlessness

00:00:51.597 --> 00:00:53.650
in how he expresses those thoughts.

00:00:54.605 --> 00:00:57.347
Sam's podcast, "Waking Up,"
is superpopular --

00:00:57.371 --> 00:00:59.310
I'm a regular listener --

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:03.057
and he's also famed for his book
called "The Moral Landscape."
