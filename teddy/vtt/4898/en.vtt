Chris Anderson: Welcome
to the TED Interview.

00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:07.260
I'm Chris Anderson,

00:00:07.284 --> 00:00:11.069
and this is the podcast series
where I sit down with a TED speaker

00:00:11.093 --> 00:00:13.975
and we get to dive
much deeper into their ideas

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:16.483
than was possible during their TED Talk.

00:00:16.507 --> 00:00:18.158

00:00:18.182 --> 00:00:20.954
My guest today is Sam Harris,

00:00:20.978 --> 00:00:24.344
philosopher, neuroscientist,
author, podcaster.

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.439
Sam has been at the heart of many
of the most provocative conversations

00:00:28.463 --> 00:00:29.613
out there today.
