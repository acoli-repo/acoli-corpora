00:06:57.851 --> 00:07:02.582
and we know there are
many other conditions on offer

00:07:02.606 --> 00:07:04.988
which are far better than that.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.706
Some are sublimely rapturous

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.584
and filled with beauty
and apparent meaning

00:07:10.608 --> 00:07:15.204
and all the satisfaction
that the luckiest people we know,

00:07:15.228 --> 00:07:17.489
and ourselves in our best moments,

00:07:17.513 --> 00:07:19.355
have enjoyed while alive.

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:20.912
And so what I would argue

00:07:20.936 --> 00:07:23.672
is that what we have on our hands
is a navigation problem.

00:07:23.696 --> 00:07:27.276
We are navigating in the space
of all possible experiences, and so --

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.636
CA: Let me push on one sort
of philosophical point back there.
