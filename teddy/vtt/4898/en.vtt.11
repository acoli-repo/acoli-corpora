00:05:26.928 --> 00:05:30.693
is one in which conscious
minds like our own

00:05:30.717 --> 00:05:35.209
are susceptible to a vast range
of experiences.

00:05:35.233 --> 00:05:37.606
And some of these experiences suck.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.575
Right? Unambiguously.

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.281
And if you doubt that, just imagine

00:05:42.305 --> 00:05:48.622
having every variable that conspires
to make you miserable turned up to 11.

00:05:48.646 --> 00:05:52.768
So if you doubt this, go to a hot stove
and put your hand on it.

00:05:52.792 --> 00:05:55.814
That is a powerful philosophical argument.

00:05:55.838 --> 00:06:00.473
The experience you will have there
is deeper than your doubts
