and it entails vomiting continuously
and being in continuous pain

This person is working with a conception
of health that doesn't matter to us,

00:11:39.684 --> 00:11:41.015
for good reason.

00:11:41.039 --> 00:11:43.283
There are, obviously,
controversies in science,

00:11:43.307 --> 00:11:45.244
and those are debated, even for decades,

00:11:45.268 --> 00:11:49.799
and sometimes, they overturn
our standard conception of what is true,

00:11:49.823 --> 00:11:52.856
but the radical skepticism

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.895
with respect to "maybe there's no
such thing as science"

00:11:55.919 --> 00:11:57.972
and "maybe there's
no such thing as truth,"

00:11:57.996 --> 00:12:00.896
that doesn't continually
undermine our conversation.
