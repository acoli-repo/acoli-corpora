00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:31.832
So I think a worse universe than that
is one where people may not be suffering,

00:09:31.856 --> 00:09:34.339
but there is greater injustice."

00:09:34.363 --> 00:09:37.205
SH: Yeah, the reason why justice
seems important to you

00:09:37.229 --> 00:09:39.224
is because it seems important to you.

00:09:39.248 --> 00:09:41.249
There's an experiential component to this.

00:09:41.273 --> 00:09:46.051
CA: Right. One simple way, it seems to me,
almost, of getting to your argument,

00:09:46.075 --> 00:09:51.083
is just to imagine a scientific comparison
between: here are two universes,

00:09:51.107 --> 00:09:54.222
and they're actually
identical in every regard,

00:09:54.246 --> 00:09:55.837
except that in one,

00:09:55.861 --> 00:10:01.433
one child is suffering, and in the other,
that same child is not suffering.
