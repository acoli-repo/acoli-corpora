00:02:28.303 --> 00:02:30.821
Facts are statements about the real world.

00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:33.105
They can be true or false.

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.822
Values are human creations.

00:02:35.846 --> 00:02:38.137
They differ between different cultures.

00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:39.423
We can debate them,

00:02:39.447 --> 00:02:42.392
but ultimately,
there is no objective arbiter

00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:44.526
of the truth of a moral statement.

00:02:45.742 --> 00:02:47.433
What's interesting about Sam Harris

00:02:47.457 --> 00:02:50.187
is that although he definitely
doesn't believe in God,

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.801
he does believe that statements
about moral values

00:02:52.825 --> 00:02:55.155
are ultimately objective statements.

00:02:55.605 --> 00:02:58.717
In his view, we can discover
the truth about those statements

00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:01.868
through an ever-deeper
knowledge of science --
