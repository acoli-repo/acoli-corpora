SH: Well, I would say that it is anchored

00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:37.561
to the fact that we are in relationship
with one another.

00:04:37.585 --> 00:04:42.481
So if you're in a universe of one,
if you're on a desert island,

00:04:42.505 --> 00:04:46.125
the ethics of your living
don't come into play,

00:04:46.149 --> 00:04:50.300
because there's no other conscious system
that can be affected by what you do.

00:04:50.324 --> 00:04:53.769
So if you're truly alone
and can't harm or benefit anyone,

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.827
then we don't really talk in moral terms,

00:04:55.851 --> 00:04:57.936
we talk just in terms of well-being.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.743
CA: So a moral system is the rules
by which we should treat each other
