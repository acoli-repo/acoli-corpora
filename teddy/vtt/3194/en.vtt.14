00:06:59.108 --> 00:07:02.830
This is why, for the first time,
we were able to calculate

00:07:02.854 --> 00:07:05.792
the costs of fishing on the high seas.

00:07:06.253 --> 00:07:09.355
The darker the red, the higher the cost.

00:07:09.983 --> 00:07:12.432
Colleagues from the University
of British Columbia

00:07:12.456 --> 00:07:17.175
have illustrated how much
each country is fishing.

00:07:17.477 --> 00:07:20.301
We also know the price of the fish
when it leaves the ship.

00:07:20.612 --> 00:07:22.393
Combined with the effort data,

00:07:22.417 --> 00:07:25.105
we have been able to calculate,
also for the first time,

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:28.870
the profit, the income
from fishing on the high seas.

00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:32.173
We have cost and we have income,
