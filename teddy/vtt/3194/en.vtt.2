00:00:58.776 --> 00:01:01.529
We saw it come back to its pristine state

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:03.607
in just ten years

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.782
including the return
of the biggest predators

00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:09.741
such as groupers, sharks,

00:01:09.765 --> 00:01:10.915
horse mackerel...

00:01:12.101 --> 00:01:14.525
Wow! It's an extraordinary place.

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.803
If you scuba dive, go to Cabo Pulmo.

00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:19.707
Those visionary fishermen

00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:22.554
are now earning more money
through tourism.

00:01:22.877 --> 00:01:26.519
When we can align economic needs
with conservation

00:01:26.543 --> 00:01:28.041
miracles can happen.

00:01:28.065 --> 00:01:31.367
And we have seen similar recoveries
throughout the world.
