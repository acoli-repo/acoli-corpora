00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:01.477
the wildest places at sea

00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:03.685
and working with government
to protect them.

00:02:04.038 --> 00:02:06.412
All these places are already protected,

00:02:06.436 --> 00:02:10.327
and they cover a total surface
of the size of half Canada.

00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:16.672
These places are the Yellowstones
and the Serengetis of the sea.

00:02:17.555 --> 00:02:20.586
They are places where you
jump into the water

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.104
and immediately are surrounded by sharks.

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:26.636
And that's good, it's good!

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.590
Because sharks are a sign
of a healthy ecosystem.
