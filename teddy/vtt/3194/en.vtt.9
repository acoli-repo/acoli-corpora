00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.529
and can be thousands of years old.

00:04:30.918 --> 00:04:35.887
Surface fishing focuses mostly on species
that migrate from the high seas

00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:38.413
to the coastal waters,
to the water of countries,

00:04:38.774 --> 00:04:40.330
such as tunas and sharks.

00:04:40.354 --> 00:04:42.405
Many of those are endangered species

00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:44.342
because they have been fished too much.

00:04:44.366 --> 00:04:47.264
But who fishes them?
Who fishes at the high seas?

00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:50.172
Until now, it was difficult
to know it exactly.

00:04:50.196 --> 00:04:52.771
Countries have not been transparent

00:04:52.795 --> 00:04:54.990
concerning long-distance fishing.

00:04:55.014 --> 00:04:58.371
Today, however, satellite technology

00:04:58.395 --> 00:05:01.785
allows us to track ships individually.
