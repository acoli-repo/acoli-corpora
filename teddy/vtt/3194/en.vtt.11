around Madagascar.

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:36.282
This other ship is a Russian trawler

00:05:36.306 --> 00:05:38.268
that fishes cod in Russian waters

00:05:38.292 --> 00:05:42.176
and also in international waters
in the North Atlantic.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.495
Thanks to Global Fishing Watch

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:48.312
we have been able to track
more than 3,600 ships

00:05:48.336 --> 00:05:51.289
from more than 20 countries
that were fishing at the high seas.

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:55.535
Global Fishing Watch uses
satellite positioning

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:59.284
and artificial intelligence
to automatically detect

00:05:59.604 --> 00:06:02.070
whether a ship is fishing or navigating.
