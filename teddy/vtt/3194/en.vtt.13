00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:32.801
China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea and Spain

00:06:33.397 --> 00:06:37.428
represent almost 80 percent
of the fishing effort in the high seas.

00:06:38.035 --> 00:06:42.035
When we join all the countries,
this is what we get:

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:43.889
the global map of fishing effort.

00:06:43.913 --> 00:06:46.757
We know the identity of each ship
on the database --

00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:47.926
that's how we know

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.686
the length of the ship, the tonnage,

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.916
the engine power,
how many crew members are on board...

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.580
With this, we can calculate

00:06:54.604 --> 00:06:57.991
the staff cost, the fuel cost, etc.

00:06:59.108 --> 00:07:02.830
This is why, for the first time,
we were able to calculate
