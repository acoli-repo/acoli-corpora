00:11:56.873 --> 00:12:00.826
but they decided that protecting
that unique place

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:04.483
was more beneficial than exploiting it
for little profit.

00:12:05.006 --> 00:12:09.582
That is exactly the kind
of international cooperation we will need.

00:12:09.606 --> 00:12:11.669
We can do it again.

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:16.157
If in 20 years our children

00:12:17.034 --> 00:12:20.466
randomly jumped in any place of the sea,

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:21.657
what would they see?

00:12:22.277 --> 00:12:23.622
An underwater desert,

00:12:24.094 --> 00:12:26.193
like most of our ocean today,

00:12:27.015 --> 00:12:28.588
or an abundance of life?

00:12:28.612 --> 00:12:30.649
Our legacy for the future.
