"Is there any way of accelerating
sea protection?"

00:03:02.552 --> 00:03:06.294
Because today
just the 2 percent of the sea is protected

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:08.411
and that's not enough.

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:13.371
Studies suggest that we need to protect
at least 30 percent of the sea,

00:03:13.395 --> 00:03:16.526
not just to save sea life,
but ourselves, too.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.989
Because the sea gives us food,

00:03:18.013 --> 00:03:21.142
and it gives us over the half
of the oxygen we breathe.

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:24.871
It absorbs much of the carbon pollution
we release into the atmosphere.

00:03:24.895 --> 00:03:28.606
We need a healthy sea to survive.

00:03:28.995 --> 00:03:31.424
So, is there a way to accelerate
protecting the sea?
