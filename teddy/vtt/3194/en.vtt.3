00:01:28.065 --> 00:01:31.367
And we have seen similar recoveries
throughout the world.

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:34.615
I spent 20 years studying
human impact on the sea.

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:37.905
But seeing with my own eyes

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.359
the regeneration of places
like Cabo Pulmo gave me hope,

00:01:41.873 --> 00:01:44.428
so I decided, ten years ago,

00:01:44.452 --> 00:01:47.801
to abandon my position
as a university professor

00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:52.042
to dedicate my life to protecting
more places at sea, like these.

00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:53.337
In the past ten years

00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:56.853
our National Geographic,
Pristine Seas team

00:01:56.877 --> 00:01:59.897
have been exploring, studying, documenting

00:01:59.921 --> 00:02:01.477
the wildest places at sea
