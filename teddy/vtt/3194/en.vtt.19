Studies from the University of California
suggest that such reserve

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:37.070
would help the species in the high seas
that migrate, such as tuna,

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.004
and part of that growth in abundance

00:09:41.028 --> 00:09:44.167
would help to repopulate
the coastal waters of the countries

00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:46.947
and the catch of those species
would also rise,

00:09:46.971 --> 00:09:48.367
as well as the benefits,

00:09:48.391 --> 00:09:50.934
because the cost of fishing would decrease

00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:53.084
and the fish that large countries

00:09:53.108 --> 00:09:55.108
are now fishing in the wild west

00:09:55.132 --> 00:09:57.085
would be fished by the coastal countries.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.645
And well, the ecological benefits
would be huge:
