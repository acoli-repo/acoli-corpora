00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:32.173
We have cost and we have income,

00:07:32.197 --> 00:07:35.755
thus, for the first time, too,
we were able to calculate

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:38.987
the profitability of fishing
on the high seas,

00:07:39.618 --> 00:07:41.871
the net economic profit.

00:07:42.205 --> 00:07:43.881
I'm going to show you another map.

00:07:43.905 --> 00:07:46.356
The red color means
that we are losing money

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.226
by fishing in that area of the ocean.

00:07:48.753 --> 00:07:51.547
The blue color means that fishing
is profitable there.

00:07:52.026 --> 00:07:53.177
There it is.

00:07:53.838 --> 00:07:55.592
It seems pretty profitable, right?

00:07:56.596 --> 00:08:00.372
But there are two important factors
that we have to take into account.
