00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.590
Because sharks are a sign
of a healthy ecosystem.

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:33.993
These places are time machines

00:02:34.017 --> 00:02:37.329
that show us the sea from 500 years ago,
from 1,000 years ago.

00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:41.792
But they also show us
how the sea of the future could be.

00:02:42.164 --> 00:02:45.648
Because the sea has
an extraordinary regenerative capacity.

00:02:45.672 --> 00:02:49.461
We have seen incredible recoveries
in just a few years.

00:02:49.485 --> 00:02:53.803
What we have to do is protect
more endangered places

00:02:53.827 --> 00:02:56.580
so they can be wild
and full of life again.

00:02:56.996 --> 00:02:58.695
So, the question is:

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.528
"Is there any way of accelerating
sea protection?"
