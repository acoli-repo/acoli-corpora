that people are paid minimum wage,

00:08:33.207 --> 00:08:37.541
and deduct the government subsidies
from our calculation,

00:08:37.565 --> 00:08:39.681
the map becomes this.

00:08:41.186 --> 00:08:46.861
Half of fishing on the high seas
is not profitable.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.154
In fact, subsidies

00:08:49.178 --> 00:08:52.945
are four times bigger than the benefits.

00:08:53.789 --> 00:08:57.046
What this economic analysis reveals
is that, practically,

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.853
the entirety of fishing
on the high seas makes no sense.
