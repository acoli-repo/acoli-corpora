00:09:00.856 --> 00:09:03.750
What country, what government
in its right mind

00:09:04.356 --> 00:09:08.285
would subsidize and support
an industry cling to exploitation

00:09:08.309 --> 00:09:10.549
and fundamentally destructive?

00:09:10.573 --> 00:09:13.378
And it's not that profitable either.

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:15.136
So...

00:09:16.549 --> 00:09:18.961
Why don't we close

00:09:20.033 --> 00:09:22.484
all international waters to fishing?

00:09:23.308 --> 00:09:26.895
Let's create a gigantic marine reserve
on the high seas.

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:29.410
Two thirds of the global ocean.
