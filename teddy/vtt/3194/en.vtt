If you randomly jumped in
any point of the sea

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:06.874
today, surely you would see
something like this.

00:00:07.198 --> 00:00:09.283
No big fishes, no fishes at all

00:00:09.307 --> 00:00:12.523
because we have fished them
quicker than they reproduce.

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:16.294
Today, I want to propose a strategy
to save sea life

00:00:16.318 --> 00:00:18.967
and the idea has a lot to do
with economics.

00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:23.192
In 1999, there was a little place
called Cabo Pulmo

00:00:23.216 --> 00:00:24.772
in Baja California, in Mexico

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.143
which was an underwater desert.

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:29.304
Fishermen were frustrated

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:31.624
by not having enough fishing.
