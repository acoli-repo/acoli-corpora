00:05:59.604 --> 00:06:02.070
whether a ship is fishing or navigating.

00:06:02.094 --> 00:06:06.020
Depending on the kind of moves,
we also know what kind of fishing it is.

00:06:06.044 --> 00:06:08.624
So, along with a group
of international colleagues,

00:06:08.648 --> 00:06:09.887
scientists and economists,

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:12.578
we decided to investigate
who is fishing at the high seas

00:06:13.109 --> 00:06:14.475
and who benefits from it.

00:06:15.137 --> 00:06:16.328
My colleague Juan Mayorga

00:06:16.352 --> 00:06:18.686
from the University of California
in Santa Barbara

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.990
has produced detailed maps
of fishing effort.

00:06:21.014 --> 00:06:23.754
Effort means how much time and fuel

00:06:23.778 --> 00:06:26.000
it takes to fish in each point of the sea.

00:06:26.024 --> 00:06:29.374
We have maps for each country
that fishes in the high seas:

00:06:29.961 --> 00:06:32.801
China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea and Spain
