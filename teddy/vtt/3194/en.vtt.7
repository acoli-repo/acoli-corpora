00:03:28.995 --> 00:03:31.424
So, is there a way to accelerate
protecting the sea?

00:03:31.998 --> 00:03:33.148
I think there is.

00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:37.732
And one of the solutions involves
looking at international waters.

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:42.760
Coastal countries have the authority
over 200 nautical miles from the coast.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.805
Everything beyond that
is called international waters

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.205
or the high seas, too,

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:49.811
shown in dark blue on this map.

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.705
It's two-thirds of the ocean.

00:03:53.256 --> 00:03:56.251
No country is in charge of the high seas,
but everyone is.

00:03:56.275 --> 00:03:57.973
Since it's a bit like the wild west,

00:03:57.997 --> 00:04:00.759
a lot of stuff happens there,
and nobody controls anything.
