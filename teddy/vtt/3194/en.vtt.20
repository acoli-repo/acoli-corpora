to provide a refuge of two-thirds
of the ocean

00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:06.575
for species of predators,
such as tunas and sharks,

00:10:06.599 --> 00:10:09.596
which are essential
to the health of the ecosystem.

00:10:10.075 --> 00:10:12.974
So, protecting the high seas,

00:10:12.998 --> 00:10:17.243
would have ecological, economic
and social benefits.

00:10:17.267 --> 00:10:21.856
But, the truth is
