There are two kinds of fishing,
mainly, at the high seas:

00:04:04.227 --> 00:04:06.400
at the bottom and at the surface.

00:04:06.824 --> 00:04:08.668
Bottom trawling

00:04:08.692 --> 00:04:11.825
is the most destructive practice
on the planet.

00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:15.042
Supertrawlers, the biggest ships
on the sea,

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:20.493
have nets so large
they can hold a dozen 747 planes.

00:04:20.517 --> 00:04:24.681
Those huge nets destroy
everything in their path

00:04:24.705 --> 00:04:28.205
including deep-sea coral,
which lives in submarine mountains

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.529
and can be thousands of years old.
