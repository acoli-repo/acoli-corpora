WEBVTT

00:04:58.395 --> 00:05:01.785
allows us to track ships individually.

00:05:02.312 --> 00:05:03.768
And this is a revolution.

00:05:04.582 --> 00:05:08.035
This is the first time we are presenting
the data you're about to see.

00:05:08.627 --> 00:05:09.829
I'm going to show you

00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:12.845
the routes of two ships fishing
throughout a year

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.230
using an automatic satellite
positioning system.

00:05:17.805 --> 00:05:21.046
This is a ship fishing tunas and sharks

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.048
for months around the south coast
of the African continent.

00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:26.855
A few months later,

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:29.353
the ship goes to Japan
to replenish supplies

00:05:29.377 --> 00:05:32.455
and a while after, it's fishing
around Madagascar.
