00:01:29.826 --> 00:01:34.355
where scrap collected
from city- and nationwide is brought.

For so many of us,

00:01:36.473 --> 00:01:38.694
our devices are black boxes.

00:01:38.718 --> 00:01:40.133
We know what they do,

00:01:40.157 --> 00:01:42.847
but not how they work or what's inside.

00:01:43.792 --> 00:01:46.277
In Agbogbloshie, people
make it their business

00:01:46.301 --> 00:01:48.358
to know exactly what's inside.

00:01:48.382 --> 00:01:53.918
Scrap dealers recover copper,
aluminum, steel, glass, plastic

00:01:53.942 --> 00:01:55.882
and printed circuit boards.

00:01:55.906 --> 00:01:57.828
It's called "urban mining."

00:01:57.852 --> 00:02:03.056
It's now more efficient for us
to mine materials from our waste.
