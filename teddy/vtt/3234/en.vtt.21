But it's for a good cause,

00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:32.544
because based on
the results of that testing,

00:10:32.568 --> 00:10:37.883
we've been able to redesign
an upgraded version of this makerspace.

00:10:37.907 --> 00:10:43.526
If a fab lab is large, expensive,
and fixed in place,

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.574
think of this as the counterpoint:

00:10:46.273 --> 00:10:48.091

00:10:48.828 --> 00:10:51.991
which can be locally manufactured,

00:10:52.015 --> 00:10:55.610
which can be expanded
and kitted out incrementally

00:10:55.634 --> 00:10:57.929
as makers acquire resources.

00:10:57.953 --> 00:11:00.803
You can think of it as a toolshed,
