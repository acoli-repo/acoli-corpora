Make no mistake about it,
there are young hackers in Agbogbloshie --

00:03:01.701 --> 00:03:04.545
and I mean that in the very best
sense of that word --

00:03:05.315 --> 00:03:08.011
that know not only
how to take apart computers

00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:11.286
but how to put them back together,
how to give them new life.

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:15.596
Agbogbloshie reminds us
that making is a cycle.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.872
It extends to remaking and unmaking

00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:22.829
in order to recover the materials
that enable us to make something anew.

00:03:23.472 --> 00:03:25.400
We can learn from Agbogbloshie,

00:03:25.424 --> 00:03:29.275
where cobblers remake work boots,

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.639
where women collect plastic
from all over the city,
