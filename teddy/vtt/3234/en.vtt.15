00:07:29.351 --> 00:07:33.858
They've joined hands together
to develop a platform

00:07:34.665 --> 00:07:37.621
which they call Spacecraft,

00:07:37.645 --> 00:07:41.262
a hybrid physical and digital
space for crafting,

00:07:41.286 --> 00:07:44.227
more of a process than a product,

00:07:44.251 --> 00:07:48.135
an open architecture for making,

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:49.840
which involves three parts:

00:07:49.864 --> 00:07:52.868
a makerspace kiosk,
which is prefab and modular;

00:07:52.892 --> 00:07:57.094
tool kits which can be customized
based on what makers want to make;

00:07:57.118 --> 00:07:58.650
and a trading app.

00:07:58.674 --> 00:08:02.366
We built the app specifically
with the needs of the scrap dealers
