They're made in roadside workshops
like this one by welders like Mohammed,

00:04:40.173 --> 00:04:42.692
who recover materials
from the waste stream

00:04:42.716 --> 00:04:44.724
and use them to make all kinds of things,

00:04:44.748 --> 00:04:47.708
like dumbbells for working out
out of old car parts.

00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:55.846

by specially coiling copper

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.924
around electrical steel
recovered from old transformer scrap.
