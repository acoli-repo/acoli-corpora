WEBVTT

00:05:57.033 --> 00:06:01.779
with the technical knowledge
of students and young professionals

00:06:01.803 --> 00:06:03.196
in STEAM fields --

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.017
science, technology, engineering,
arts and mathematics --

00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:10.406
to build a STEAM-powered innovation engine

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.487
to drive what we call
"Sankofa Innovation," which I'll explain.

00:06:15.656 --> 00:06:19.413
We took forays into the scrapyard

00:06:19.437 --> 00:06:22.281
to look for what could be repurposed,

00:06:22.305 --> 00:06:25.226
like DVD writers that could
become laser etchers,

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.912
or the power supplies of old servers

00:06:28.936 --> 00:06:32.891
for a start-up in Kumasi
making 3D printers out of e-waste.
