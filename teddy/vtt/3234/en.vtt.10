that power local fabrication.

00:05:11.549 --> 00:05:15.358
What's really cool as well is that

00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:16.812
across generations,

but it's done through active learning,
through heuristic learning,

00:05:22.577 --> 00:05:24.524

00:05:24.548 --> 00:05:26.765
And this stands in sharp contrast

where lecturers lecture,
