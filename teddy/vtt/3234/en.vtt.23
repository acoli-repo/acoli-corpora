00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.167
In totality, this entire
makerspace system

00:11:37.191 --> 00:11:38.905
tries to do five things:

00:11:38.929 --> 00:11:44.129
to enable emerging makers
to gather the resources they need

00:11:44.153 --> 00:11:46.317
and the tools to make
what they want to make;

00:11:46.341 --> 00:11:49.199
to learn by doing and from others;

00:11:49.223 --> 00:11:52.194
to produce more and better products;

00:11:52.218 --> 00:11:54.942
to be able to trade
to generate steady income;

00:11:54.966 --> 00:11:58.803
and ultimately, to amplify
not only their reputation as a maker,

00:11:58.827 --> 00:12:00.377
but their maker potential.
