00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.310
Come with me to Agbogbloshie,

00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:07.120
a neighborhood in the heart of Accra,

00:00:07.144 --> 00:00:10.648
named after a god that lives
in the Odaw River.

00:00:11.503 --> 00:00:14.317
There's a slum, Old Fadama,

00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:18.116
built on land reclaimed
from the Korle Lagoon,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.844
just before it opens
into the Gulf of Guinea.

00:00:21.908 --> 00:00:26.016
There's a scrapyard here where people
take apart all kinds of things,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.370
from mobile phones to computers,

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:31.151
automobiles to even entire airplanes.
