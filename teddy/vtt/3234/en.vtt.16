00:07:58.674 --> 00:08:02.366
We built the app specifically
with the needs of the scrap dealers

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.811
in mind first,

00:08:03.835 --> 00:08:08.309
because we realized that it was not enough
to arm them with information

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:09.947
and upgraded technology

00:08:09.971 --> 00:08:13.191
if we wanted them to green
their recycling processes;

00:08:13.215 --> 00:08:15.127
they needed incentives.

00:08:15.151 --> 00:08:18.794
Scrap dealers are always looking
for new scrap and new buyers

00:08:18.818 --> 00:08:22.999
and what interests them
is finding buyers who will pay more

00:08:23.023 --> 00:08:25.388
for clean copper than for burnt.

00:08:26.213 --> 00:08:28.963
We realized that in the entire ecosystem,

00:08:28.987 --> 00:08:31.456
everyone was searching for something.
