00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:33.245
So we're going to play a little game
I like to call "Which is which?"

00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:35.959
I play this with new doctors
and astronomers I work with.

00:01:35.983 --> 00:01:38.212
I'm going to show you
two images on the screen.

00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:41.510
One of them is biomedical
and one of them is astronomical,

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:44.857
and you have to pick them
correctly in your head.

00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:46.498
So here is the first set.

00:01:46.522 --> 00:01:50.171
And again, one of these is biomedical
and one is astronomical.

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:53.842
I'll give you a second
to make your little vote mentally.

00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:00.860
So it turns out the one on the left
is some of the raw data
