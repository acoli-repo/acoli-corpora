WEBVTT

00:08:29.765 --> 00:08:31.904
and their recruitment
of a very adventurous,

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:33.866
open-minded, young student. (Laughter)

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:37.897
And from there, it has exploded:
we've pulled in cardiologists

00:08:37.921 --> 00:08:40.503
and computer scientists and radiologists

00:08:40.527 --> 00:08:44.861
and astronomers, physicists,
chemists, computational physicists --

00:08:44.885 --> 00:08:47.076
I mean, we've brought
so many people together.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.723
And it's been enlightening

00:08:48.747 --> 00:08:52.635
to share domains and information
across borders.

00:08:52.659 --> 00:08:53.841
And we're still going.

00:08:53.865 --> 00:08:57.074
And although most of the people
up on the screen are from Harvard

00:08:57.098 --> 00:08:58.249
or Harvard Med,

00:08:58.273 --> 00:09:01.701
now we cross different institutions
and continents to work together.
