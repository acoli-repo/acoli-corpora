WEBVTT

00:08:58.273 --> 00:09:01.701
now we cross different institutions
and continents to work together.

00:09:01.725 --> 00:09:04.349
All I can say is,
it has just been wonderful.

00:09:04.373 --> 00:09:06.574
We're continuing to make new discoveries.

00:09:06.598 --> 00:09:08.495
And I just urge you:

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:11.500
attend conferences not in your own domain,

00:09:11.524 --> 00:09:14.443
read books and journals not
in your own discipline,

00:09:14.467 --> 00:09:17.109
watch TED talks and come
to events like this

00:09:17.133 --> 00:09:19.887
and say hi to the neighbor
sitting next to you,

00:09:19.911 --> 00:09:21.408
because you really never know

00:09:21.432 --> 00:09:24.428
where your next great idea
is going to come from.

00:09:24.452 --> 00:09:25.651
Thank you.

00:09:25.675 --> 00:09:28.589
(Applause)
