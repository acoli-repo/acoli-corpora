00:06:27.936 --> 00:06:31.213
where we've been using these
tree diagrams along the bottom

00:06:31.237 --> 00:06:33.353
to understand the structure of nebulae.

00:06:33.377 --> 00:06:35.050
Well, we were inspired in that work

00:06:35.074 --> 00:06:37.439
from the bioinformatics
and genome community,

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:41.098
where they use these tree diagrams
to understand their gene expression data.

00:06:41.122 --> 00:06:43.960
They were inspired
by the evolutionary biologists,

00:06:43.984 --> 00:06:47.878
who use these tree diagrams to understand
how species evolve and are related,

00:06:47.902 --> 00:06:50.940
the first of which was drawn
by Sir Charles Darwin.

00:06:50.964 --> 00:06:53.799
Here's an example
from his "Origin of the Species."

00:06:53.823 --> 00:06:58.198
So, straight from Darwin,
through biology, physics, astronomy,

00:06:58.222 --> 00:06:59.564
back to medical imaging.
