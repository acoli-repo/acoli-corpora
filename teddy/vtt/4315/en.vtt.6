00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.715
So you can see
the patient's nose, their eyes;

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.429
it kind of progresses
towards the middle of the head;

00:03:04.453 --> 00:03:06.542
you can start to see the cortex,

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:09.601
and it steps through
to the back of the brain.

00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:10.942
Now, believe it or not,

00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:15.585
telescopes, and particularly radio
telescopes, operate in a similar manner.

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.677
If we were to look at the raw data
from these telescopes ...

00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:21.956
We're going to look
at a nebula called M16.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.208
We start with this radio telescope
at the front of the nebula,

00:03:25.232 --> 00:03:27.556
stepping back towards
the middle of the nebula,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.923
just like the middle
of the patient's brain --

00:03:29.947 --> 00:03:32.997
those bright regions
are where young stars are forming --
