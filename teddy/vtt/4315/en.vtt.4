00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:00.860
So it turns out the one on the left
is some of the raw data

00:02:00.884 --> 00:02:03.221
of the supernova remnant
we were just looking at,

00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:06.108
and on the right, we have
an angiogram of a patient's heart

00:02:06.132 --> 00:02:07.297
and coronary arteries.

00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:08.997
OK, we're going to try another one.

00:02:09.021 --> 00:02:12.351
Now, this one is much closer
to my daily bread and butter.

00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:14.673
Tell me which is which.

00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:17.324
And one of these is literally
millimeters across,

00:02:17.348 --> 00:02:19.914
and the other is billions of miles.

00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:29.427
So, it turns out the one on the left
is a confocal microscopy image

00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:30.607
of a human cornea,
