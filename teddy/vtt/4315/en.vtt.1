00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:31.644
and she had over eight years
of magnificent data,

00:00:31.668 --> 00:00:34.959
just trying to understand
the 3-D structure of this nebula,

00:00:34.983 --> 00:00:36.497
the supernova remnant.

00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:38.294
But she had no way to look at it.

00:00:39.078 --> 00:00:43.677
So I looked at the data with her
and said, "I think I can help you."

00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:45.726
And although -- and this is all real data

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.193
you're seeing on the screen above me --

00:00:48.217 --> 00:00:50.282
this is the Hollywood rendering version,

00:00:50.306 --> 00:00:54.754
but the rough draft I made with her
looks something more like this.

00:00:54.778 --> 00:00:58.635
And she was able to make novel discoveries
about how supernovas explode

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.216
and how shells explode within it,
