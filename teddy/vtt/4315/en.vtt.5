00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:30.607
of a human cornea,

00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:33.705
and on the right, we have
a radio telescope image

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.349
of the star-forming region NGC-1333.

00:02:36.373 --> 00:02:39.106
Now, aside from the fact
that these images look similar

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.053
and that doctors trying to find
a tumor in a patient's brain

00:02:42.077 --> 00:02:43.823
or a young star forming is similar,

00:02:43.847 --> 00:02:46.590
the way the data comes
from the machine or the telescope

00:02:46.614 --> 00:02:48.216
is remarkably similar.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.720
Here's an MRI scanner.

00:02:50.744 --> 00:02:53.731
And if you've never seen
the raw data of a patient's brain,

00:02:53.755 --> 00:02:55.085
this is what it looks like.

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.636
When the MRI scanner
is acquiring the data,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.945
it goes in slices.

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.715
So you can see
the patient's nose, their eyes;
