00:04:29.155 --> 00:04:31.972
to study the impact
of a young group of stars.

00:04:31.996 --> 00:04:33.179
And he had this theory

00:04:33.203 --> 00:04:36.347
that there's this wind crashing
and tossing the pillars over,

00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:40.004
and it took him months to prove this
with conventional visualization.

00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:43.656
But in one shot, you can
see the shock wave of wind

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.645
blasting through across
to the left-hand side of the screen.

00:04:47.388 --> 00:04:50.484
Now, I don't think myself
or any of my collaborators

00:04:50.508 --> 00:04:53.413
would've anticipated
how far this has gone,

00:04:53.437 --> 00:04:55.936
and by sharing the medical
technology with astronomy

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.314
and astronomy with medical,

00:04:57.338 --> 00:05:00.231
we've been able to find
new stars and supernova remnants,
