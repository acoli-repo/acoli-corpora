00:05:58.269 --> 00:06:01.130
originally developed
for physics simulations.

00:06:01.154 --> 00:06:02.689
Interdisciplinary.

00:06:02.713 --> 00:06:06.460
My assignment was to try and come up with
a new way of looking at this

00:06:06.484 --> 00:06:09.169
to make it optimal
for the doctors and hospital:

00:06:09.193 --> 00:06:12.757
How can we make it the most efficient
for them for a diagnosis?

00:06:12.781 --> 00:06:14.693
And I came up with this image.

00:06:15.038 --> 00:06:16.197
It's 2-D;

00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:20.320
I took the whole artery and collapsed
everything into a 2-D plane.

00:06:20.783 --> 00:06:22.308
I got some very quizzical looks

00:06:22.332 --> 00:06:24.497
when I showed this
to the doctors originally.

00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:27.912
But I was inspired to do this
representation from my astronomy work,

00:06:27.936 --> 00:06:31.213
where we've been using these
tree diagrams along the bottom
