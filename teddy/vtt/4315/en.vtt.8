So, you might recognize
this nebula more like this:

00:04:01.615 --> 00:04:05.742
the famous Hubble image of the Pillars
of Creation or the Eagle Nebula.

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:08.799
And, I'm going to fade this
out onto a radio image,

00:04:08.823 --> 00:04:11.007
it's a false color in the background,

00:04:11.031 --> 00:04:13.751
and fade away the Hubble image
you're used to.

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.945
But we don't need to just look
at this in 3-D, we can look at it in 2-D,

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:22.003
and here I'm using a radiology
tool kit called OsiriX.

00:04:22.027 --> 00:04:24.399
When I showed this
to astronomer Marc Pound,

00:04:24.423 --> 00:04:25.748
whose data this is,

00:04:25.772 --> 00:04:29.131
he was amazed, because he had
been trying so hard

00:04:29.155 --> 00:04:31.972
to study the impact
of a young group of stars.
