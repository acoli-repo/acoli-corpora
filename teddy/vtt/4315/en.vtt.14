Interdisciplinary.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.732
One may say, "Well, is this
2-D representation better?"

00:07:05.756 --> 00:07:09.669
I did a study at Harvard Medical School
to answer just that question.

00:07:09.693 --> 00:07:14.380
And it turns out, if you present
the image on the left to a doctor,

00:07:14.404 --> 00:07:18.825
on average, they find about 39%
of the high-risk regions

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:21.750
that could explode or block
your heart and kill you.

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:23.957
On the right, we can do a little better,

00:07:23.981 --> 00:07:28.371
and they're able to find 62% of these
high-risk, dangerous regions.

00:07:28.395 --> 00:07:30.813
But we can do even better,
