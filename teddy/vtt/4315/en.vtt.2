00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.216
and how shells explode within it,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.129
using a piece of software developed
at Brigham and Women's Hospital

00:01:05.153 --> 00:01:06.462
here in Boston,

00:01:06.486 --> 00:01:08.308
called 3D Slicer.

00:01:08.332 --> 00:01:12.546
It was originally developed
for looking at patients' brain scans,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.024
doing surgical planning

00:01:14.048 --> 00:01:16.678
and doing 3-D renderings of anatomy.

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:21.428
Who knew our solution was lurking
just across the river?

00:01:21.452 --> 00:01:23.955
Now, people don't believe me

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.846
when I tell them that astronomy
and medical imaging --

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.768
these two seemingly different fields --

00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:29.947
are really similar.

00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:33.245
So we're going to play a little game
I like to call "Which is which?"
