00:03:29.947 --> 00:03:32.997
those bright regions
are where young stars are forming --

00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:34.889
all the way to the back of the nebula,

00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:37.442
just like the back of the patient's head.

00:03:37.466 --> 00:03:41.659
Now, although the doctors
are able to then take this data

00:03:41.683 --> 00:03:44.371
and look at it in 3-D
and do surgical planning,

00:03:44.395 --> 00:03:46.027
this is cutting-edge,

00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:48.435
just about as good as you get
with any astronomer,

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.515
and this is what they have to look at
to understand the 3-D structure

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:56.513
and velocity's momentum in our universe.

00:03:56.537 --> 00:03:58.222
But we can do better.

00:03:58.246 --> 00:04:01.591
So, you might recognize
this nebula more like this:
