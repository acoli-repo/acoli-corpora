00:03:58.246 --> 00:04:00.429
of hitting me out of the way.

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:02.235
So as soon as I tried to get near the piano,

00:04:02.235 --> 00:04:04.383
I was firmly shoved off.

00:04:04.383 --> 00:04:07.067
And having said to your dad, Nic,

00:04:07.067 --> 00:04:09.562
that I would try to teach you, I was then slightly confused

00:04:09.562 --> 00:04:11.149
as to how I might go about that

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:13.550
if I wasn't allowed near the piano.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.727
But after a while, I thought, well, the only way

00:04:15.727 --> 00:04:19.828
is to just pick you up, shove Derek over to the other side of the room,

00:04:19.828 --> 00:04:22.972
and in the 10 seconds that I got before Derek came back,

00:04:22.972 --> 00:04:25.149
I could just play something very quickly

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:27.141
for him to learn.

00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:28.543
And in the end, Derek, I think you agreed

00:04:28.543 --> 00:04:32.523
that we could actually have some fun playing the piano together.
