Adam Ockelford: I promise there won't be too much

00:00:01.836 --> 00:00:04.248
of me talking, and a lot of Derek playing,

00:00:04.248 --> 00:00:06.692
but I thought it would just be nice to recap

00:00:06.692 --> 00:00:10.628
on how Derek got to where he is today.

00:00:10.628 --> 00:00:13.119
It's amazing now, because he's so much bigger than me,

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:14.737
but when Derek was born,

00:00:14.737 --> 00:00:17.376
he could have fitted on the palm of your hand.

00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:20.340
He was born three and a half months premature,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.556
and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive.

00:00:25.556 --> 00:00:26.776
He had to have a lot of oxygen,

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:28.776
and that affected your eyes, Derek,

00:00:28.776 --> 00:00:30.604
and also the way you understand language
