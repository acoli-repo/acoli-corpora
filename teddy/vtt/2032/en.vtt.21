The other wonderful thing about you is memory.

00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:36.935
DP: Memory.
AO: Your memory is truly amazing, and every concert we do,

00:10:36.935 --> 00:10:39.765
we ask the audience to participate, of course,

00:10:39.765 --> 00:10:43.529
by suggesting a piece Derek might like to play.

00:10:43.529 --> 00:10:45.051
And people say, "Well, that's terribly brave

00:10:45.051 --> 00:10:47.276
because what happens if Derek doesn't know it?"

00:10:47.276 --> 00:10:48.288
And I say, "No, it's not brave at all,

00:10:48.288 --> 00:10:50.940
because if you ask for something that Derek doesn't know,

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.541
you're invited to come and sing it first,

00:10:52.541 --> 00:10:55.027
and then he'll pick it up." (Laughter)

00:10:55.027 --> 00:10:59.742
So just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish.

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:03.459
But seriously, would anyone like to choose a piece?
