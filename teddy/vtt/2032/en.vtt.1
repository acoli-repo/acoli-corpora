00:00:28.776 --> 00:00:30.604
and also the way you understand language

00:00:30.604 --> 00:00:33.575
and the way you understand the world.

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:35.642
But that was the end of the bad news,

00:00:35.657 --> 00:00:38.648
because when Derek came home from the hospital,

00:00:38.648 --> 00:00:41.830
his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.201
who was going to look after you, Derek,

00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:46.849
really for the rest of your childhood.

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:49.425
And Nanny's great insight, really,

00:00:49.425 --> 00:00:52.110
was to think, here's a child who can't see.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.031
Music must be the thing for Derek.

00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:59.298
And sure enough, she sang, or as Derek called it, warbled,

00:00:59.298 --> 00:01:02.843
to him for his first few years of life.
