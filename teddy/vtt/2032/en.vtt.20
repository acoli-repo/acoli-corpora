00:09:57.899 --> 00:10:01.598
that can instantly recalibrate, recalculate,

00:10:01.598 --> 00:10:03.770
all the pieces in the world that are out there.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.197
Most pianists would have a heart attack if you said,

00:10:06.197 --> 00:10:08.014
"Sorry, do you mind playing 'Flight of the Bumblebee'

00:10:08.014 --> 00:10:11.244
in B minor instead of A minor?" as we went on.

00:10:11.244 --> 00:10:14.665
In fact, the first time, Derek, you played that with an orchestra,

00:10:14.665 --> 00:10:16.754
you'd learned the version that you'd learned,

00:10:16.754 --> 00:10:18.983
and then the orchestra, in fact, did have a different version,

00:10:18.983 --> 00:10:21.461
so while we were waiting in the two hours

00:10:21.461 --> 00:10:23.463
before the rehearsal and the concert,

00:10:23.463 --> 00:10:25.703
Derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly

00:10:25.703 --> 00:10:28.180
and then was able to play it with the orchestra.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.640
Fantastic chap.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.099
The other wonderful thing about you is memory.
