that we could actually have some fun playing the piano together.

00:04:32.523 --> 00:04:35.348
As you can see, there's me in my early,

00:04:35.348 --> 00:04:37.587
pre-marriage days with a brown beard,

00:04:37.587 --> 00:04:41.233
and little Derek concentrating there.

00:04:41.233 --> 00:04:43.777
I just realized this is going to be recorded, isn't it? Right. Okay.

00:04:43.777 --> 00:04:45.079
(Laughter)

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:49.300
Now then, by the age of 10, Derek really

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.352
had taken the world by storm.

00:04:51.352 --> 00:04:54.370
This is a photo of you, Derek, playing at the Barbican

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.081
with the Royal Philharmonic Pops.

00:04:56.081 --> 00:05:00.650
Basically it was just an exciting journey, really.
