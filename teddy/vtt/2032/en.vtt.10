00:04:56.081 --> 00:05:00.650
Basically it was just an exciting journey, really.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.791
And in those days, Derek, you didn't speak very much,

00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:05.102
and so there was always a moment of tension

00:05:05.102 --> 00:05:08.063
as to whether you'd actually understood what it was we were going to play

00:05:08.063 --> 00:05:10.574
and whether you'd play the right piece in the right key,

00:05:10.574 --> 00:05:12.033
and all that kind of thing.

00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:14.858
But the orchestra were wowed as well,

00:05:14.858 --> 00:05:18.715
and the press of the world were fascinated by your ability

00:05:18.715 --> 00:05:22.052
to play these fantastic pieces.

00:05:22.052 --> 00:05:25.114
Now the question is, how do you do it, Derek?

00:05:25.114 --> 00:05:27.685
And hopefully we can show the audience now

00:05:27.685 --> 00:05:30.737
how it is you do what you do.
