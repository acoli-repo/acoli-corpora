00:05:27.685 --> 00:05:30.737
how it is you do what you do.

00:05:30.737 --> 00:05:32.570
I think that one of the first things that happened

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.847
when you were very little, Derek,

00:05:33.847 --> 00:05:36.183
was that by the time you were two,

00:05:36.183 --> 00:05:41.162
your musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults.

00:05:41.162 --> 00:05:43.960
And so whenever you heard any note at all --

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.864
if I just play a random note --

00:05:45.864 --> 00:05:48.277
(Piano notes) --

00:05:48.292 --> 00:05:50.183
you knew instantly what it was,

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:54.421
and you'd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano.

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:56.009
Now that's called perfect pitch,

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.246
and some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes

00:05:59.246 --> 00:06:00.396
in the middle of the piano.
