00:05:59.246 --> 00:06:00.396
in the middle of the piano.

00:06:00.396 --> 00:06:06.424
(Piano notes)

00:06:06.424 --> 00:06:09.850
You can see how -- you get a sense of playing with Derek.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.398
(Applause)

00:06:13.398 --> 00:06:16.424
But Derek, your ear is so much more than that.

00:06:16.424 --> 00:06:17.851
If I just put the microphone down for a bit,

00:06:17.851 --> 00:06:20.571
I'm going to play a cluster of notes.

00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:22.887
Those of you who can see will know how many notes,

00:06:22.887 --> 00:06:23.896
but Derek, of course, can't.

00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:26.798
Not only can you say how many notes,

00:06:26.798 --> 00:06:32.222
it's being able to play them all at the same time. Here we are.
