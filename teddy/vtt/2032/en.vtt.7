00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:31.113
You know, there's this little child who can't see,

00:03:31.113 --> 00:03:33.320
can't really understand much about the world,

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.026
has no one in the family who plays an instrument,

00:03:36.026 --> 00:03:38.327
and yet he taught himself to play that.

00:03:38.327 --> 00:03:39.559
And as you can see from the picture,

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:41.918
there was quite a lot of body action going on

00:03:41.918 --> 00:03:43.719
while you were playing, Derek.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:48.289
Now, along -- Derek and I met when he was four and a half years old,

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:52.107
and at first, Derek, I thought you were mad, to be honest,

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.921
because when you played the piano,

00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:56.838
you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard,

00:03:56.838 --> 00:03:58.246
and also you had this little habit

00:03:58.246 --> 00:04:00.429
of hitting me out of the way.
