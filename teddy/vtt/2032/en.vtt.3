00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:32.342
and sure enough, she dragged this little keyboard

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:34.923
out of the loft, never thinking really

00:01:34.938 --> 00:01:37.281
that anything much would come of it.

00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:40.269
But Derek, your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:41.890
and actually bashed it,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.679
bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break.

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.671
But out of all the bashing, after a few months,

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:51.840
emerged the most fantastic music,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.206
and I think there was just a miracle moment, really, Derek,

00:01:55.206 --> 00:01:59.721
when you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world

00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:03.321
out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard.
