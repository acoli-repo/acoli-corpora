00:09:11.408 --> 00:09:15.480
Well done.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.403
Now the truly amazing thing was, with all those scales, Derek,

00:09:19.403 --> 00:09:21.638
you could not only play "Flight of the Bumblebee"

00:09:21.638 --> 00:09:24.304
in the usual key, but any note I play,

00:09:24.304 --> 00:09:26.297
Derek can play it on.

00:09:26.297 --> 00:09:28.765
So if I just choose a note at random, like that one.

00:09:28.765 --> 00:09:30.580
