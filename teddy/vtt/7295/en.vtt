00:00:00.676 --> 00:00:03.476
So the climate crisis,
in my way of thinking about it,

00:00:03.516 --> 00:00:05.876
is the most serious manifestation

00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:09.876
of an underlying collision
between human civilization

00:00:09.916 --> 00:00:11.836
as weâ€™ve presently organized it

00:00:11.876 --> 00:00:14.596
and the Earth's ecological systems.

00:00:15.036 --> 00:00:16.916
And the system most in jeopardy

00:00:16.956 --> 00:00:20.876
is the very thin shell of atmosphere
surrounding our planet,

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:26.716
because we're spewing 162 million tons
of human-caused global warming pollution

00:00:26.756 --> 00:00:32.556
into it every single day,
as if this is an open sewer.
