00:11:29.667 --> 00:11:31.980
because although we all think
we can catch a liar

00:11:32.004 --> 00:11:34.182
from their body language
and speech patterns,

00:11:34.206 --> 00:11:37.646
hundreds of psychological tests
over the years have shown that all of us,

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.649
including police officers and detectives,

00:11:39.673 --> 00:11:43.193
are basically at chance when it comes
to detecting lies from body language

00:11:43.217 --> 00:11:44.369
and verbal patterns.

00:11:44.393 --> 00:11:46.307
Interestingly, there is one exception:

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:48.479
TV appeals for missing relatives.

00:11:48.503 --> 00:11:51.618
It's quite easy to predict
when the relatives are missing

00:11:51.642 --> 00:11:55.071
and when the appealers have, in fact,
murdered the relatives themselves.

00:11:55.095 --> 00:11:58.637
So hoax appealers are more likely
to shake their heads, to look away,

00:11:58.661 --> 00:12:00.364
and to make errors in their speech,
