00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:31.736
on which men and women really do differ

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.037
and plotting some psychological
gender differences on the same scale.

00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:37.092
One thing men and women
do really differ on

00:00:37.116 --> 00:00:38.697
is how far they can throw a ball.

00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:40.614
So if we look at the data for men here,

00:00:40.638 --> 00:00:43.105
we see what is called
a normal distribution curve.

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.215
A few men can throw a ball really far,
a few men, not far at all,

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.041
but most, a kind of average distance.

00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:50.223
And women share
the same distribution as well,

00:00:50.247 --> 00:00:52.398
but actually, there's
quite a big difference.

00:00:52.422 --> 00:00:54.749
In fact, the average man
can throw a ball further

00:00:54.773 --> 00:00:56.596
than about 98 percent of all women.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.046
Now let's look at what some psychological
gender differences look like
