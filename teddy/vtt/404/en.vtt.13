00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.593
The idea is that listening
to Mozart makes you smarter

00:06:32.617 --> 00:06:35.177
and improves your performance on IQ tests.

00:06:35.503 --> 00:06:37.612
Now again, what's interesting
about this myth

00:06:37.636 --> 00:06:41.048
is that although it's basically a myth,
there is a grain of truth to it.

00:06:41.072 --> 00:06:43.332
So the original study found that

00:06:43.356 --> 00:06:46.409
participants who were played
Mozart music for a few minutes

00:06:46.433 --> 00:06:48.400
did better on a subsequent IQ test

00:06:48.424 --> 00:06:51.575
than participants who simply
sat in silence.

00:06:52.026 --> 00:06:55.636
But a follow-up study recruited
some people who liked Mozart music

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.217
and then another group of people

00:06:57.241 --> 00:06:59.748
who were fans of
the horror stories of Stephen King.

00:06:59.772 --> 00:07:03.491
And they played the people
the music or the stories.
