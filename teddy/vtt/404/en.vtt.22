00:10:58.673 --> 00:11:01.080
all the participants said
that they firmly believed

00:11:01.104 --> 00:11:04.637
that the learning and punishment study
served a worthy scientific purpose

00:11:04.661 --> 00:11:06.786
which would have
enduring gains for science,

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:12.953
as opposed to the momentary, nonfatal
discomfort caused to the participants.

00:11:13.929 --> 00:11:16.719
OK, so I've been talking
for about 12 minutes now,

00:11:16.743 --> 00:11:19.332

sitting there listening to me,

00:11:19.356 --> 00:11:21.611
analyzing my speech patterns
and body language

00:11:21.635 --> 00:11:25.062
and trying to work out if you should
take any notice of what I'm saying,

00:11:25.086 --> 00:11:27.500
whether I'm telling the truth
or whether I'm lying.

00:11:27.524 --> 00:11:29.643
But if so, you've probably
completely failed,

00:11:29.667 --> 00:11:31.980
because although we all think
we can catch a liar
