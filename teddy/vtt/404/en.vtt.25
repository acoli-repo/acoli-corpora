What I hope to have shown you
in the past few minutes

00:12:30.773 --> 00:12:32.064
is that this isn't true.

00:12:32.088 --> 00:12:35.481
What we need to do is assess
psychological theories

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:37.311
by seeing what predictions they make,

00:12:37.335 --> 00:12:40.112
whether that is that listening to Mozart
makes you smarter,

00:12:40.136 --> 00:12:44.597
that you learn better when information is
presented in your preferred learning style

00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:45.796
or whatever it is,

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.365
all of these are testable
empirical predictions,

00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:50.200
and the only way we can make progress

00:12:50.224 --> 00:12:52.326
is to test these predictions
against the data

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.501
in tightly controlled
experimental studies.

00:12:54.525 --> 00:12:57.430
And it's only by doing so
that we can hope to discover

00:12:57.454 --> 00:13:00.054
which of these theories
are well supported,
