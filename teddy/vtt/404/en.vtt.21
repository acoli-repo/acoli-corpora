just because someone
in a white coat told them to.

00:10:31.354 --> 00:10:33.653
But this story is a myth
for three reasons.

00:10:33.677 --> 00:10:38.557
Firstly, and most crucially, the lab coat
wasn't white. It was, in fact, grey.

00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:43.318
Secondly, the participants
were told before the study

00:10:43.342 --> 00:10:45.685
and reminded any time

and indeed caused
no permanent damage whatsoever.

00:10:51.432 --> 00:10:53.798
And thirdly, participants
didn't give the shocks

00:10:53.822 --> 00:10:56.620

in the coat told them to.

00:10:56.644 --> 00:10:58.649
When they were interviewed
after the study,

00:10:58.673 --> 00:11:01.080
all the participants said
that they firmly believed
