00:03:28.924 --> 00:03:31.215
that will have recently gotten
your GCSE results.

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.716
And if you didn't quite get
what you were hoping for,

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.032
then you can't really blame
your learning style.

00:03:36.056 --> 00:03:39.491
But one thing that you might want
to think about blaming is your genes.

00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:43.414
So what this is all about is that a recent
study at University College London

00:03:43.438 --> 00:03:47.567
found that 58 percent of the variation
between different students

00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.112
and their GCSE results

00:03:49.136 --> 00:03:50.890
was down to genetic factors.

00:03:50.914 --> 00:03:54.211
That sounds like a very precise figure.
So how can we tell?

00:03:54.235 --> 00:03:57.457
Well, when we want to unpack
the relative contributions

00:03:57.481 --> 00:03:59.581
of genes and the environment,

00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:01.612
what we can do is a twin study.
