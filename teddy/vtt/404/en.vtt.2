00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.046
Now let's look at what some psychological
gender differences look like

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.579
on the same standardized scale.

00:01:02.504 --> 00:01:04.066
Any psychologist will tell you

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.661
that men are better
at spatial awareness than women --

00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:09.266
things like map-reading,
for example -- and it's true.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.793
But let's have a look
at the size of this difference.

00:01:11.817 --> 00:01:14.974
It's tiny; the lines are so close
together, they almost overlap.

00:01:14.998 --> 00:01:18.802
In fact, the average woman is better
than 33 percent of all men,

00:01:18.826 --> 00:01:20.938
and of course, if that was 50 percent,

00:01:20.962 --> 00:01:23.173
then the two genders
would be exactly equal.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.292
It's worth bearing in mind that this
difference and the next one I'll show you

00:01:27.316 --> 00:01:30.161
are pretty much the biggest
psychological gender differences
