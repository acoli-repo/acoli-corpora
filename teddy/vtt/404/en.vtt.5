And if you said C, it means
that you're a kinesthetic learner,

00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:33.450
that you learn best when you get stuck in
and do things with your hands.

00:02:33.474 --> 00:02:35.658
Except, of course,
as you've probably guessed,

00:02:35.682 --> 00:02:38.496
that it doesn't, because
the whole thing is a complete myth.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.258
Learning styles are made up and are not
supported by scientific evidence.

00:02:42.282 --> 00:02:45.702
We know this because in tightly
controlled experimental studies

00:02:45.726 --> 00:02:47.896
when learners are given material to learn,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.549
either in their preferred style
or an opposite style,

00:02:50.573 --> 00:02:54.238
it makes no difference at all
to the amount of information they retain.

00:02:54.262 --> 00:02:56.328
And if you think about it
for just a second,

00:02:56.352 --> 00:02:58.178
it's obvious that this has to be true.

00:02:58.202 --> 00:03:02.609
It's obvious that the best presentation
format depends not on you,
