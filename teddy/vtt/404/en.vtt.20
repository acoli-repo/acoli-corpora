00:09:58.894 --> 00:10:00.710
Which raises the question

00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:03.763
of if there's any way we could improve
people's performance.

00:10:03.787 --> 00:10:05.763
And one thing you might think about doing

00:10:05.787 --> 00:10:09.172
is punishing people for their misses
and seeing if that improves them.

00:10:09.196 --> 00:10:12.735
This idea, the effect that punishment
can improve performance,

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:14.971
was what participants
thought they were testing

00:10:14.995 --> 00:10:17.595
in Milgram's famous learning
and punishment experiment

00:10:17.619 --> 00:10:20.627
that you've probably heard about
if you're a psychology student.

00:10:20.651 --> 00:10:23.194
The story goes that participants
were prepared to give

00:10:23.218 --> 00:10:26.514
what they believed to be fatal
electric shocks to a fellow participant

00:10:26.538 --> 00:10:28.575
when they got a question wrong,

00:10:28.599 --> 00:10:31.330
just because someone
in a white coat told them to.
