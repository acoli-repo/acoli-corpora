00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:30.755
is going to make you any smarter
in the long run.

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:33.913
Another version of the Mozart myth

00:07:33.937 --> 00:07:38.986
is that listening to Mozart can make you
not only cleverer but healthier, too.

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:41.565
Unfortunately, this doesn't
seem to be true

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:44.610
of someone who listened
to the music of Mozart almost every day,

00:07:44.634 --> 00:07:45.796
Mozart himself,

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.975
who suffered from gonorrhea,
smallpox, arthritis,

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:53.065
and, what most people think eventually
killed him in the end, syphilis.

00:07:53.851 --> 00:07:57.246
This suggests that Mozart should have been
a bit more careful, perhaps,

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.416
when choosing his sexual partners.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.313
But how do we choose a partner?
