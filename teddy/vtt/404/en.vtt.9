00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:31.390
And it turns out that it's about
58 percent due to genes.

00:04:31.897 --> 00:04:35.909
This isn't to undermine the hard work
that you and your teachers here put in.

00:04:35.933 --> 00:04:39.072
If you didn't quite get the GCSE results
that you were hoping for,

00:04:39.096 --> 00:04:41.218
then you can always try
blaming your parents,

00:04:41.242 --> 00:04:42.828
or at least their genes.

00:04:43.392 --> 00:04:45.037
One thing that you shouldn't blame

00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:47.609
is being a left-brained
or right-brained learner,

00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:49.569
because again, this is a myth.

00:04:49.593 --> 00:04:52.860
The myth here is that
the left brain is logical,

00:04:52.884 --> 00:04:54.573
it's good with equations like this,

00:04:54.597 --> 00:04:58.229
and the right brain is more creative,
so the right brain is better at music.

00:04:58.253 --> 00:04:59.513
But again, this is a myth,

00:04:59.537 --> 00:05:01.068
because nearly everything you do
