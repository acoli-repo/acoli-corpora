00:05:58.034 --> 00:06:01.140
so a grain of truth in the idea
of the creative left-hander,

00:06:01.164 --> 00:06:02.427
but not much.

00:06:02.967 --> 00:06:05.058
A related myth that you've
probably heard of

00:06:05.082 --> 00:06:07.374
is that we only use
10 percent of our brains.

00:06:07.398 --> 00:06:08.974
This is, again, a complete myth.

00:06:08.998 --> 00:06:11.738
Nearly everything that we do,
even the most mundane thing,

00:06:11.762 --> 00:06:13.614
uses nearly all of our brains.

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:17.234
That said, it is of course true

00:06:17.258 --> 00:06:21.814
that most of us don't use our brainpower
quite as well as we could.

00:06:22.273 --> 00:06:24.728
So what could we do
to boost our brainpower?

00:06:24.752 --> 00:06:27.007
Maybe we could listen
to a nice bit of Mozart.

00:06:27.031 --> 00:06:29.636
Have you heard of the idea
of the Mozart effect?

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.593
The idea is that listening
to Mozart makes you smarter
