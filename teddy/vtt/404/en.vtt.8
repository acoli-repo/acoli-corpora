00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:01.612
what we can do is a twin study.

00:04:01.636 --> 00:04:05.315
Identical twins share
100 percent of their environment

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:07.386
and 100 percent of their genes,

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.856
whereas nonidentical twins
share 100 percent of their environment,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.430
but just like any brother and sister,
share only 50 percent of their genes.

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:18.745
So by comparing how similar
GCSE results are in identical twins

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.840
versus nonidentical twins

00:04:20.864 --> 00:04:22.240
and doing some clever maths,

00:04:22.264 --> 00:04:26.235
we can get an idea of how much variation
in performance is due to the environment,

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:27.942
and how much is due to genes.

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:31.390
And it turns out that it's about
58 percent due to genes.
