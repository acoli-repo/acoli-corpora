00:09:27.774 --> 00:09:30.365
we look at these streaks
and attribute meaning to them

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:32.414
and say, "Yeah he's really on form today,"

00:09:32.438 --> 00:09:34.670
whereas actually you would
get the same pattern

00:09:34.694 --> 00:09:37.111
if you were just getting
hits and misses at random.

00:09:38.591 --> 00:09:41.745
An exception to this, however,
is penalty shootouts.

00:09:41.769 --> 00:09:44.690
A recent study looking at
penalty shootouts in football

00:09:44.714 --> 00:09:46.808
showed that players
who represent countries

00:09:46.832 --> 00:09:49.142
with a very bad record
in penalty shootouts,

00:09:49.166 --> 00:09:51.325
like, for example, England,

00:09:51.349 --> 00:09:55.236
tend to be quicker to take their shots
than countries with a better record,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.505
and presumably as a result,
they're more likely to miss.

00:09:58.894 --> 00:10:00.710
Which raises the question
