00:04:59.537 --> 00:05:01.068
because nearly everything you do

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:03.816
involves nearly all parts
of your brain talking together,

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.136
even just the most mundane thing
like having a normal conversation.

00:05:07.692 --> 00:05:10.569
However, perhaps one reason
why this myth has survived

00:05:10.593 --> 00:05:12.961
is that there is
a slight grain of truth to it.

00:05:12.985 --> 00:05:16.720
A related version of the myth is that
left-handed people are more creative

00:05:16.744 --> 00:05:17.993
than right-handed people,

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:21.450
which kind of makes sense because
your brain controls the opposite hand.

00:05:21.474 --> 00:05:25.163
So in left-handed people, the right side
of the brain is slightly more active

00:05:25.187 --> 00:05:26.985
than the left side of the brain,

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.515
and the idea is the right-hand side
is more creative.

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.765
Now, it isn't true per se
that left-handed people are more creative
