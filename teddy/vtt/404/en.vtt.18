The myth here is that sportsmen go through
"hot hand" streaks, Americans call them,

00:09:04.017 --> 00:09:06.321
or "purple patches,"
we sometimes say in England,

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:08.853
where they just can't miss,
like this guy here.

00:09:08.877 --> 00:09:12.763
But in fact, what happens is that
if you analyze the pattern

00:09:12.787 --> 00:09:14.406
of hits and misses statistically,

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.861
it turns out that it's
nearly always at random.

00:09:16.885 --> 00:09:19.230
Your brain creates patterns
from the randomness.

00:09:19.254 --> 00:09:20.770
If you toss a coin,

00:09:20.794 --> 00:09:24.593
a streak of heads or tails is going
to come out somewhere in the randomness,

00:09:24.617 --> 00:09:27.750
and because the brain likes to see
patterns where there are none,

00:09:27.774 --> 00:09:30.365
we look at these streaks
and attribute meaning to them
