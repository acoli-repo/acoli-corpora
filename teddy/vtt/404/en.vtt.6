It's obvious that the best presentation
format depends not on you,

00:03:02.633 --> 00:03:04.323
but on what you're trying to learn.

00:03:04.347 --> 00:03:07.803
Could you learn to drive a car,
for example, just by listening to someone

00:03:07.827 --> 00:03:08.999
telling you what to do,

00:03:09.023 --> 00:03:10.508
with no kinesthetic experience?

00:03:10.532 --> 00:03:14.157
Could you solve simultaneous equations
by talking them through in your head,

00:03:14.181 --> 00:03:15.454
without writing them down?

00:03:15.478 --> 00:03:18.757
Could you revise for your architecture
exams using interpretive dance

00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:20.328
if you're a kinesthetic learner?

00:03:20.352 --> 00:03:23.147
No; what you need to do is match
the material to be learned

00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:24.478
to the presentation format,

00:03:24.502 --> 00:03:25.819
not you.

00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:28.900
I know many of you are A-level students

00:03:28.924 --> 00:03:31.215
that will have recently gotten
your GCSE results.
