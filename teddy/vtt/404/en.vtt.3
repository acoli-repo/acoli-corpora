00:01:27.316 --> 00:01:30.161
are pretty much the biggest
psychological gender differences

00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:31.628
ever discovered in psychology.

00:01:31.652 --> 00:01:32.804
Here's the next one.

00:01:32.828 --> 00:01:34.283
Any psychologist will tell you

00:01:34.307 --> 00:01:36.992
that women are better
with language and grammar than men.

00:01:37.016 --> 00:01:39.447
Here's performance
on the standardized grammar test.

00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:41.171
There, the women. There go the men.

00:01:41.195 --> 00:01:43.145
Again, yes, women are better on average,

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.416
but the lines are so close

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.554
that 33 percent of men
are better than the average woman.

00:01:47.578 --> 00:01:49.122
And again, if it was 50 percent,

00:01:49.146 --> 00:01:51.923
that would represent
complete gender equality.

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:54.424
So it's not really
a case of Mars and Venus.

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:56.997
It's more a case of, if anything,
Mars and Snickers:

00:01:57.021 --> 00:02:00.686
basically the same, but one's maybe
slightly nuttier than the other.
