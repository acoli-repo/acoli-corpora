You get a couple hundred kids
each picking up five pieces,

00:00:31.983 --> 00:00:34.556
and pretty soon, you've got
a much cleaner camp.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.739
So I thought,

00:00:35.763 --> 00:00:40.300
why not apply that crowdsourced
cleanup model to the entire planet?

00:00:40.324 --> 00:00:43.275
And that was the inspiration
for Litterati.

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:46.648
The vision is to create
a litter-free world.

00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:48.180
Let me show you how it started.

00:00:48.204 --> 00:00:51.590
I took a picture of a cigarette
using Instagram.

00:00:52.222 --> 00:00:54.089
Then I took another photo ...

00:00:54.113 --> 00:00:55.670
and another photo ...

00:00:55.694 --> 00:00:56.861
and another photo.

00:00:56.885 --> 00:00:58.171
And I noticed two things:

00:00:58.195 --> 00:01:01.667
one, litter became artistic
and approachable;
