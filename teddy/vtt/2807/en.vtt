This story starts with these two --

00:00:04.032 --> 00:00:05.290
my kids.

00:00:05.314 --> 00:00:06.996
We were hiking in the Oakland woods

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.154
when my daughter noticed
a plastic tub of cat litter in a creek.

00:00:11.647 --> 00:00:13.309
She looked at me and said,

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.840
"Daddy?

00:00:15.864 --> 00:00:17.514
That doesn't go there."

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:19.960
When she said that,
it reminded me of summer camp.

00:00:19.984 --> 00:00:21.482
On the morning of visiting day,

00:00:21.506 --> 00:00:25.169
right before they'd let our anxious
parents come barreling through the gates,

00:00:25.193 --> 00:00:26.562
our camp director would say,

00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:28.895
"Quick! Everyone pick up
five pieces of litter."

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.959
You get a couple hundred kids
each picking up five pieces,
