00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.310
And that's when I realized

00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:34.600
that Litterati was more
than just pretty pictures;

00:01:34.624 --> 00:01:37.993
we were becoming a community
that was collecting data.

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.759
Each photo tells a story.

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:43.472
It tells us who picked up what,

00:01:43.496 --> 00:01:45.507
a geotag tells us where

00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:47.561
and a time stamp tells us when.

00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:50.435
So I built a Google map,

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.512
and started plotting the points
where pieces were being picked up.

00:01:54.536 --> 00:01:58.454
And through that process,
the community grew

00:01:58.478 --> 00:02:00.117
and the data grew.
