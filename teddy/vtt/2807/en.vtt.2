00:00:58.195 --> 00:01:01.667
one, litter became artistic
and approachable;

00:01:02.244 --> 00:01:03.395
and two,

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:05.934
at the end of a few days,
I had 50 photos on my phone

00:01:05.958 --> 00:01:07.545
and I had picked up each piece,

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:09.954
and I realized that I was keeping a record

00:01:09.978 --> 00:01:13.129
of the positive impact
I was having on the planet.

00:01:13.153 --> 00:01:15.341
That's 50 less things that you might see,

00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:16.608
or you might step on,

00:01:16.632 --> 00:01:18.090
or some bird might eat.

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:21.421
So I started telling people
what I was doing,

00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:23.801
and they started participating.

00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:26.524
One day,

00:01:26.548 --> 00:01:29.076
this photo showed up from China.
