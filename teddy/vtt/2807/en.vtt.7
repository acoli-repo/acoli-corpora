00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:30.236
Now, during that process
I learned two things:

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.814
one, Instagram is not the right tool --

00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:33.869
(Laughter)

00:03:33.893 --> 00:03:35.396
so we built an app.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.053
And two, if you think about it,

00:03:37.077 --> 00:03:40.694
every city in the world
has a unique litter fingerprint,

00:03:40.718 --> 00:03:44.554
and that fingerprint provides
both the source of the problem

00:03:44.578 --> 00:03:46.499
and the path to the solution.

00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:50.024
If you could generate a revenue stream

00:03:50.048 --> 00:03:52.511
just by understanding
the percentage of cigarettes,

00:03:52.535 --> 00:03:54.631
well, what about coffee cups

00:03:54.655 --> 00:03:56.361
or soda cans

00:03:56.385 --> 00:03:57.799
or plastic bottles?

00:03:58.501 --> 00:04:01.702
If you could fingerprint San Francisco,
well, how about Oakland
