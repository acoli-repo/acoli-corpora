00:01:58.478 --> 00:02:00.117
and the data grew.

00:02:00.806 --> 00:02:04.267
My two kids go to school
right in that bullseye.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.336
Litter:

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.064
it's blending into
the background of our lives.

00:02:09.088 --> 00:02:11.187
But what if we brought it
to the forefront?

00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:14.123
What if we understood exactly
what was on our streets,

00:02:14.147 --> 00:02:15.536
our sidewalks

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.098
and our school yards?

00:02:17.122 --> 00:02:20.369
How might we use that data
to make a difference?

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:22.387
Well, let me show you.

00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:23.796
The first is with cities.

00:02:24.418 --> 00:02:29.057
San Francisco wanted to understand
what percentage of litter was cigarettes.

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:30.243
Why?
