00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:30.243
Why?

00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:31.476
To create a tax.

00:02:32.073 --> 00:02:34.208
So they put a couple of people
in the streets

00:02:34.232 --> 00:02:35.593
with pencils and clipboards,

00:02:35.617 --> 00:02:37.680
who walked around collecting information

00:02:37.704 --> 00:02:40.815
which led to a 20-cent tax
on all cigarette sales.

00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:43.940
And then they got sued

00:02:43.964 --> 00:02:45.140
by big tobacco,

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:48.380
who claimed that collecting information
with pencils and clipboards

00:02:48.404 --> 00:02:50.735
is neither precise nor provable.

00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:55.134
The city called me and asked
if our technology could help.

00:02:55.158 --> 00:02:56.407
I'm not sure they realized

00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:58.679
that our technology
was my Instagram account --

00:02:58.703 --> 00:02:59.742
(Laughter)

00:02:59.766 --> 00:03:01.032
But I said, "Yes, we can."
