If you really want to create change,

00:05:01.518 --> 00:05:04.392
there's no better place to start
than with our kids.

00:05:04.416 --> 00:05:07.819
A group of fifth graders picked up
1,247 pieces of litter

00:05:07.843 --> 00:05:09.691
just on their school yard.

00:05:09.715 --> 00:05:12.247
And they learned that the most
common type of litter

00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:15.505
were the plastic straw wrappers
from their own cafeteria.

00:05:15.947 --> 00:05:18.476
So these kids went
to their principal and asked,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.160
"Why are we still buying straws?"

00:05:21.166 --> 00:05:22.921
And they stopped.

00:05:22.945 --> 00:05:26.599
And they learned that individually
they could each make a difference,

00:05:26.623 --> 00:05:28.961
but together they created an impact.

00:05:29.503 --> 00:05:33.515
It doesn't matter
if you're a student or a scientist,
