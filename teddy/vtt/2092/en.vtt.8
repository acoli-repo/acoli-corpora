some of them are very old-school.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
to store food in.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And I know that I am doing a service

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
to myself and my family.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
It's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
or a glass bottle,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and fill that up with water or filtered water,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
versus purchasing plastic bottled water.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I guess what I want to say to everybody here --

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue --

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
is that this is a huge problem in the oceans,
