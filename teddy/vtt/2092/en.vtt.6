of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean -- is plastic,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
then why don't we call it what it is.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It's plastic pollution.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Recycling -- everybody kind of ends their books

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
or incinerated, or shipped to China.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It is down-cycled and turned into lesser things,
