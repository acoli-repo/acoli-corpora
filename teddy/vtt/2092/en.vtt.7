00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It is down-cycled and turned into lesser things,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
or can be used again --

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So this is a big issue for us.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
is we've added a fourth R

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
onto the front

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
of the "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," three R's,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and that is refuse.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Whenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Alternatives exist;

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
some of them are very old-school.
