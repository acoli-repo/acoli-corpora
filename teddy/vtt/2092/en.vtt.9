00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
is that this is a huge problem in the oceans,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
but this is a problem that we've created as consumers

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and we can solve.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and teaching people to choose alternatives.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So whenever possible, to choose alternatives

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
to single-use plastics.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
We can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
into our oceans

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and in doing so,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
save our oceans, save our planet, save ourselves.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Thank you. (Applause)
