00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
is, "Oh my God!

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We've got to go out there and clean this thing up."

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So I actually developed a proposal

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
to go out with a cargo ship

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and two decommissioned fishing trawlers,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
a crane, a chipping machine

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and a cold-molding machine.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And my intention was to go out to the gyre,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
raise awareness about this issue

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and begin to pick up the plastic,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that could potentially be used as building materials

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
in underdeveloped communities.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I began talking with people
