00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm a visual artist,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and I'm also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I've been working with plastic bags,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
for the last 20 years.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and sculptures and installations.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Upon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
some of my work started to fissure

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and break down into smaller little bits of plastic.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And I thought, "Great.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It's ephemeral just like us."
