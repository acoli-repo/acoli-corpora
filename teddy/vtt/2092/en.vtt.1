00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And I thought, "Great.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It's ephemeral just like us."

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Upon educating myself a little further about plastics,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I actually realized this was a bad thing.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000

And what we're finding

is that a lot of it is in the marine environment.

I then, in the last few years,

learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre.

And my initial reaction --

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to learning about it --

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
is, "Oh my God!
