00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I began talking with people

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
who actually had been out to the gyre

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and upon doing so,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I realized actually that cleaning it up

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
would be a very small drop in the bucket

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
relative to how much is being generated

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
every day around the world,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And the bigger picture is:

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
we need to find a way to turn off the faucet.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We need to cut the spigot

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
of single-use and disposable plastics,
