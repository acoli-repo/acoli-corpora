00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.336
so I built him a website, it's over here.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.296
And in 2001, there was no Tumblr,

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.576
there was no Facebook,
there was no Pinterest.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.736
So I needed to learn to code

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.136
in order to express
all of this longing and loving.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.496
And that is how programming
started for me.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.056
It started as a means of self-expression.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.696
Just like when I was smaller,
I would use crayons and legos.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.320
And when I was older, I would use
guitar lessons and theater plays.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.896
But then, there were other things
to get excited about,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.336
like poetry and knitting socks
