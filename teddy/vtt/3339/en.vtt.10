00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.056
And even the biggest of the problems

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.576
are a group of tiny problems
stuck together.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.336
And Ruby also introduced
me to her friends,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.256
the colorful side of the Internet culture.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.136
She has friends like the Snow Leopard,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.096
who is beautiful but doesn't want
to play with the other kids.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.736
And she has friends like the green robots
that are really friendly but super messy.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.936
And she has friends like Linux the penguin

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.616
who's really ruthlessly efficient,
but somewhat hard to understand.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.880
And idealistic foxes, and so on.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.536
In Ruby's world, you learn
technology through play.
