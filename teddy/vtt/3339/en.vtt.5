There's a lot of syntax
and controls and data structures

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.816
and algorithms and practices,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.416
protocols and paradigms in programming.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.736
And we as a community,
we've made computers smaller and smaller.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.296
We've built layers and layers
of abstraction on top of each other

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.816
between the man and the machine

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.056
to the point that we no longer
have any idea how computers work

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.256
or how to talk to them.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.056
And we do teach our kids

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.176
we teach them how
the combustion engine functions

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.216
and we even tell them
that if you want to really be an astronaut
