00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.336
about how things get made
don't only include

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.776
the twentysomething-year-old
Silicon Valley boys,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.200
but also Kenyan schoolgirls
and Norwegian librarians.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.216
Imagine a world where
the little Ada Lovelaces of tomorrow,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.456
who live in a permanent
reality of 1s and 0s,

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.096
they grow up to be very optimistic
and brave about technology.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.496
They embrace the powers
and the opportunities

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.120
and the limitations of the world.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.816
A world of technology
that is wonderful, whimsical

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.480
and a tiny bit weird.
