and "How?" and "What if?"

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.040
And they don't know that they

It's the parents who do.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.015

as, say, nuclear physics.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.616
And they are partly right about that.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.136
There's a lot of syntax
and controls and data structures
