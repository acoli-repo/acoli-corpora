00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.216
and we even tell them
that if you want to really be an astronaut

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.696
you can become one.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.896
But when the kid comes to us and asks,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.656
"So, what is a bubble sort algorithm?"

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.096
Or, "How does the computer know
what happens when I press 'play,'

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.976
how does it know which video to show?"

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.576
Or, "Linda, is Internet a place?"

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.320
We adults, we grow oddly silent.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.856
"It's magic," some of us say.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.600
"It's too complicated," the others say.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.016
Well, it's neither.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.616
It's not magic and it's not complicated.
