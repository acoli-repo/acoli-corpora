Her name is Ruby, she is six years old.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.816
She is completely fearless,
imaginative and a little bit bossy.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.296
And every time
I would run into a problem

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.576
in trying to teach
myself programming like,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.576
"What is object-oriented design
or what is garbage collection?",

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.016
I would try to imagine how a six-year-old
little girl would explain the problem.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.696
And I wrote a book about her
and I illustrated it

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.096
and the things
Ruby taught me go like this.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.576
Ruby taught me that you're
not supposed to be afraid

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.976
of the bugs under your bed.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.056
And even the biggest of the problems
