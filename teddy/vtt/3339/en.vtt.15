00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.416
But you kids,
you are going to be the ones

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.816
who are really going to live up in a world
where everything is a computer."

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.056
And then I had this little girl
who came to me

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.376
and took a bicycle lamp

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.616
and she said, "This bicycle lamp,
if it were a computer,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.656
it would change colors."

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.696
And I said, "That's a really good idea,
what else could it do?"

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.456
And she thinks and she thinks,

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.496
and she goes, "If this bicycle lamp
were a computer,

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.256
we could go on a biking trip
with my father

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.896
and we would sleep in a tent

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.760
and this biking lamp
could also be a movie projector."
