"None of these is a computer.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.696
I know what a computer is:

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.056

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.696
in front of which mom or dad

like the cashier system
and the burglar alarms.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.416
And kids, you know what?

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.976
In Japan, toilets are computers
