00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.480
and a tiny bit weird.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.616
When I was a girl,

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.656
I wanted to be a storyteller.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.256
I loved make-believe worlds

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.896
and my favorite thing to do

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.976
was to wake up in the mornings
in Moominvalley.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.120
In the afternoons,
I would roam around the Tatooines.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.200
And in the evenings,
I would go to sleep in Narnia.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.600
And programming turned out
to be the perfect profession for me.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.656
I still create worlds.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.640
Instead of stories, I do them with code.
