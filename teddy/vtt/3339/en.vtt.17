00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.416
And after we've assembled
our computer together,

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.096
we also design an application for it.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.135
And my favorite story is this little boy,

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.416
he's six years old

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.559
and his favorite thing in the world
is to be an astronaut.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.376
And the boy, he has
these huge headphones on

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.656
and he's completely immersed
in his tiny paper computer

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.696
because you see, he's built his own

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.016
intergalactic planetary
navigation application.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.176
And his father, the lone astronaut
in the Martian orbit,

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.056
is on the other side of the room

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.696
and the boy's important mission

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.640
is to bring the father
safely back to earth.
