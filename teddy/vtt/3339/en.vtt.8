00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.896
I actually was following
a sequence of symbolic commands

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.656
that included loops inside of them.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.096
And that Bertrand Russell's lifelong quest

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.096
to find an exact language
between English and mathematics

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.440
found its home inside of a computer.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.280
I was a programmer, but no one knew it.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.536
The kids of today, they tap, swipe
and pinch their way through the world.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.776
But unless we give them tools
to build with computers,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.736
we are raising only consumers
instead of creators.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.296
This whole quest
led me to this little girl.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.696
Her name is Ruby, she is six years old.
