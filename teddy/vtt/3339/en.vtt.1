00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.296
to not see computers as mechanical
and lonely and boring and magic,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.296
to see them as things
that they can tinker

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.760
and turn around and twist,
and so forth.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.496
My personal journey into the world
of programming and technology

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.496
started at the tender age of 14.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.616
I had this mad teenage crush
on an older man,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.976
and the older man in question
just happened to be

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.416
the then Vice President
of the United States, Mr. Al Gore.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.496
And I did what every single
teenage girl would want to do.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.736
I wanted to somehow
express all of this love,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.336
so I built him a website, it's over here.
