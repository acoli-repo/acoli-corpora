for Ruby's world,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.376
I needed to really ask the kids
how they see the world

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.416
and what kind of questions they have

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.520

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.216

very conservative and go,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.016
"None of these is a computer.
