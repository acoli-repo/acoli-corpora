00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:03.204
I want you to imagine this for a moment.

00:00:03.204 --> 00:00:06.099
Two men, Rahul and Rajiv,

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:07.957
living in the same neighborhood,

00:00:07.957 --> 00:00:11.252
from the same educational background, similar occupation,

00:00:11.252 --> 00:00:14.020
and they both turn up at their local accident emergency

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.836
complaining of acute chest pain.

00:00:16.836 --> 00:00:19.960
Rahul is offered a cardiac procedure,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.771
but Rajiv is sent home.

00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:25.281
What might explain the difference in the experience

00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:28.533
of these two nearly identical men?

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:32.020
Rajiv suffers from a mental illness.
