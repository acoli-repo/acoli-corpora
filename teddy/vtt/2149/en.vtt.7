00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
was that an entire galaxy could be contained

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
within a single marble.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And so over here,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
each book and each world

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
becomes a little marble

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
that I drag in

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
to this magical device within the device.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And it opens up a map.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
All along, all fantasy books have always had maps,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
but these maps have been static.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
This is a map that grows and glows

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well.
