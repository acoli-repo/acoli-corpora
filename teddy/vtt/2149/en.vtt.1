00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
when Arjuna, the great Indian warrior prince,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
when he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now we do the same

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000

I was terrified by this idea

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that I would lose the ability

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to enjoy and appreciate the sunset

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
