00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
that you can then put up online.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
A child in London puts up a picture of a fox

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and says, "Oh, I saw a fox today."

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
A child in India says, "I saw a monkey today."

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And it creates this kind of social network

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
around a collection of digital photographs

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
that you've actually taken.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
In the possibilities of linking together

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
magic, the earth and technology,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
there are multiple possibilities.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
In the next book, we plan on having an interaction

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
where you take your iPad out with the video on

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and through augmented reality,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
you see this layer of animated pixies
