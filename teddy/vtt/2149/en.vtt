00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My story begins right here actually in Rajasthan

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about two years ago.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I was in the desert, under the starry skies

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Back then,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
when Arjuna, the great Indian warrior prince,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
when he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow,
