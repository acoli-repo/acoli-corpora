00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And it felt like technology

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
should enable magic, not kill it.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
When I was a little girl,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So I felt like our cellphones

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and our fancy watches and our cameras

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
had stopped us from dreaming.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
They stopped us from being inspired.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology,
