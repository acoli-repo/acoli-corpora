00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
you see this layer of animated pixies

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
appear on a houseplant that's outside your house.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
At one point, your screen is filled up with leaves.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and read the rest of the book.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
We're moving, we're all moving here,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
to a world where the forces of nature

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
come closer together to technology,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and magic and technology can come closer together.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
We're harnessing energy from the sun.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
We're bringing our children and ourselves

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
closer to the natural world
