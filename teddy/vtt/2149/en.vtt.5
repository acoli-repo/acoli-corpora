It says, "This box belongs to ... "

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And so I type in my name.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And actually I become a character in the book.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
At various points, a little letter drops down to me --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and the iPad knows where you live because of GPS --

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
which is actually addressed to me.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The child in me is really excited

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
by these kinds of possibilities.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Now I've been talking a lot about magic.
