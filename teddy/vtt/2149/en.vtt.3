They stopped us from being inspired.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And so I jumped in, I jumped into this world of technology,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
to see how I could use it to enable magic

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
as opposed to kill it.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I've been illustrating books since I was 16.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And so when I saw the iPad,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I saw it as a storytelling device

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that could connect readers all over the world.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It can know how we're holding it.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It can know where we are.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
It brings together image and text

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and animation and sound and touch.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Storytelling is becoming

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
more and more multi-sensorial.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But what are we doing with it?
