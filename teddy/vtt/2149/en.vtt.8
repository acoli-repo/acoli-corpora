It reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
So I'm just going to enter in.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Another thing that's actually really important to me

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
is creating content that is Indian

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and yet very contemporary.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Over here, these are the Apsaras.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So we've all heard about fairies and we've all heard about nymphs,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
but how many people outside of India

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
know about their Indian counterparts, the Apsaras?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
These poor Apsaras have been trapped inside Indra's chambers for thousands of years

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
in an old and musty book.
