Speaking of the environmental crisis,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
is that children have been locked inside their rooms,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
glued to their PCs, they haven't been able to get out.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
But now with mobile technology,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
we can actually take our children outside into the natural world

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
with their technology.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
