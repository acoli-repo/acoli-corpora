00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in the jungles of Congo.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
your living closest relative.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
That means we all share a common ancestor,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
an evolutionary grandmother,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
who lived around six million years ago.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now, chimpanzees are well-known

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
for their aggression.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
(Laughter)

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But unfortunately,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we have made too much of an emphasis

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
of this aspect

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
in our narratives of human evolution.
