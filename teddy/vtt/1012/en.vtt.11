00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
into the insights that bonobo give us

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
to our past and present.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
But they also hold a secret for our future,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
a future where we need to adapt

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
to an increasingly challenging world

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
through greater creativity

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and greater cooperation.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
The secret is that play is the key

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
to these capacities.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
In other words,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
play is our adaptive wildcard.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
In order to adapt successfully

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
to a changing world,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
we need to play.
