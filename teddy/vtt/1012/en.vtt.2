00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
in our narratives of human evolution.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But bonobos show us

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the other side of the coin.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
While chimpanzees

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
are dominated by big, scary guys,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
bonobo society

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
is run by empowered females.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
These guys have really worked something out,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
since this leads to a highly tolerant society

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
where fatal violence

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
has not been observed yet.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But unfortunately,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
bonobos are the least understood
