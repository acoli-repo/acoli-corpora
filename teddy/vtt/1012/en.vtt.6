00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
For us and them,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
play is foundational for bonding relationships

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and fostering tolerance.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It's where we learn to trust

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and where we learn about the rules of the game.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Play increases creativity

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and resilience,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and it's all about the generation of diversity --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
diversity of interactions,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
diversity of behaviors,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
diversity of connections.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And when you watch bonobo play,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
you're seeing the very evolutionary roots
