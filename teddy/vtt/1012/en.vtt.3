00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
bonobos are the least understood

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
of the great apes.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and it has been very difficult to study them.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The Congo is a paradox --

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
but also the heart of darkness itself --

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the scene of a violent conflict

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that has raged for decades

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and claimed nearly as many lives

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
as the First World War.
