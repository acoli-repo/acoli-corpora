Who are these cousins?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We know them as the "make love, not war" apes

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
since they have frequent, promiscuous

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and bisexual sex

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
love to play throughout their entire lives.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Play is not just child's games.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
For us and them,
