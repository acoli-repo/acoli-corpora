00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
as the First World War.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Not surprisingly,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
this destruction also endangers bonobo survival.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Bushmeat trades and forest loss

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
means we couldn't fill a small stadium

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
with all the bonobos that are left in the world --

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and we're not even sure of that to be honest.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Yet, in this land of violence and chaos,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
you can hear hidden laughter

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
swaying the trees.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Who are these cousins?
