00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
you're seeing the very evolutionary roots

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
of human laughter, dance

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and ritual.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Play is the glue

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
that binds us together.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Now, I don't know how you play,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
but I want to show you a couple of unique clips

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
fresh from the wild.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
First, it's a ball game bonobo-style --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and I do not mean football.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So here,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
we have a young female and a male

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
engaged in a chase game.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Have a look what she's doing.
