00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
we need to play.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
But will we make the most of our playfulness?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Play is not frivolous.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Play's essential.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
For bonobos and humans alike,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
life is not just red in tooth and claw.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
In times when it seems least appropriate to play,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
it might be the times when it is most urgent.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And so, my fellow primates,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
let us embrace this gift from evolution

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and play together,
