00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And I want you to see,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
this is Fuku, a young female,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and she is quietly playing with water.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I think, like her,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
we sometimes play alone,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and we explore the boundaries

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
of our inner and our outer worlds.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And it's that playful curiosity

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
that drives us to explore, drives us to interact,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and then the unexpected connections we form

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
are the real hotbed for creativity.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So these are just small tasters

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
into the insights that bonobo give us
