Everything I need to know about politics,

00:00:03.412 --> 00:00:06.246
I learned from cheese.

00:00:06.288 --> 00:00:08.329
For the last decade of my business career,

00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:11.621
I ran a 250-million-dollar
food company in Wisconsin.

00:00:11.663 --> 00:00:14.788
And yes, we made cheese.

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.204
If customers liked my cheese, I did well.

00:00:18.246 --> 00:00:23.621
If they didn't, they bought cheese
from someone else and I did less well.

00:00:23.663 --> 00:00:26.204
That's healthy competition.

00:00:26.246 --> 00:00:31.204
Healthy competition incentivizes
businesses to make better products.
