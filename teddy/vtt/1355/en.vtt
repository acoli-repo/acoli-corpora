00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Good morning everybody.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I work with really amazing,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
little, itty-bitty creatures called cells.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And let me tell you what it's like

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to grow these cells in the lab.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I work in a lab where we take cells out of their native environment.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We plate them into dishes

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that we sometimes call petri dishes.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And we feed them -- sterilely of course --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
with what we call cell culture media -- which is like their food --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and we grow them in incubators.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Why do I do this?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We observe the cells in a plate,
