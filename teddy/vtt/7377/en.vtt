00:00:00.955 --> 00:00:05.209
So today I'm going to talk
about the word goodwill.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.297
Goodwill, did you know,
is a technical accounting term.

00:00:09.797 --> 00:00:11.215
It's an asset

00:00:11.215 --> 00:00:14.594
that's literally only created
when a buyer shows up

00:00:14.594 --> 00:00:17.180
and pays a purchase price for a company

00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:21.225
that's more than the fair value
of that company's net assets.

00:00:21.267 --> 00:00:25.813
So this unexplained differential
is named goodwill.

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.943
And with it, accountants actually
can make balance sheets balance.
