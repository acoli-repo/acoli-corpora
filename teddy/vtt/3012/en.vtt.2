00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.896
Now, these roles don't represent
the kind of man I am in my real life,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.736
but that's what I love about acting.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.160
I get to live inside characters
very different than myself.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.256
But every time I got
one of these roles, I was surprised,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.216
because most of the men
I play ooze machismo,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.976
charisma and power,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.456
and when I look in the mirror,
that's just not how I see myself.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.416
But it was how Hollywood saw me,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.736
and over time, I noticed a parallel

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.856
between the roles I would play as a man

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.320
both on-screen and off.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.520
I've been pretending to be
a man that I'm not my entire life.
