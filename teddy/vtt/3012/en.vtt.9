00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.016
he's here.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.000
(Applause)

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.816
He's crying.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.576
(Laughter)

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.776
But, sorry, Dad,
as a kid I resented him for it,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.416
because I blamed him for making me soft,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.776
which wasn't welcomed
in the small town in Oregon

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.136
that we had moved to.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.208
Because being soft
meant that I was bullied.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.296
See, my dad wasn't
traditionally masculine,

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.936
so he didn't teach me how to use my hands.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.320
He didn't teach me
how to hunt, how to fight,
