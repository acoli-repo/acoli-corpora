00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.520
I've been pretending to be
a man that I'm not my entire life.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.560
I've been pretending
to be strong when I felt weak,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.040
confident when I felt insecure

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.000
and tough when really I was hurting.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.320
I think for the most part
I've just been kind of putting on a show,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.440
but I'm tired of performing.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.056
And I can tell you right now

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.400
that it is exhausting trying to be
man enough for everyone all the time.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.776
Now -- right?
