00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.496
Thx."

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.536
(Laughter)

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.120
As if being gay makes you
less of a man, right?

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.720
So I took a deep breath,

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.400
and I responded.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.256
I said,

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.176
very politely, that I was just curious,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.416
because I'm on an exploration
of masculinity,

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.736
and I wanted to know
why my love for my wife

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.856
qualified as gay shit.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.536
And then I said,
honestly I just wanted to learn.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.536
(Laughter)
