00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.296
And I believe the only way that can happen

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.816
is if men learn to not only
embrace the qualities

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.136
that we were told
are feminine in ourselves

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.176
but to be willing to stand up,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.480
to champion and learn
from the women who embody them.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.336
Now, men --

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.976
(Laughter)

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.656
I am not saying that everything
we have learned is toxic. OK?

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.696
I'm not saying there's anything
inherently wrong with you or me,

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.120
and men, I'm not saying
we have to stop being men.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.920
But we need balance, right?
