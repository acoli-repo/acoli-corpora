00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.136
Now, I'm not here
to give a history lesson.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.856
We likely all know how we got here, OK?

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.696
But I'm just a guy that woke up
after 30 years and realized

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.696
that I was living in a state of conflict,

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.136
conflict with who I feel I am in my core

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.160
and conflict with who the world
tells me as a man I should be.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.576
But I don't have a desire

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.680
to fit into the current
broken definition of masculinity,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.880
because I don't just want
to be a good man.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.120
I want to be a good human.
