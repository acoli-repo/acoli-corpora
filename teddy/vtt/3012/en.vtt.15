00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.936
that I finally found
the strength to talk to them

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.440
about what I was going through.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.536
But when I did,
something amazing happened.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.040
I realized that I wasn't alone,

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.200
because my guys had also been struggling.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.256
And as soon as I found the strength
and the courage to share my shame,

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.480
it was gone.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.016
Now, I've learned over time

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.056
that if I want to practice vulnerability,

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.840
then I need to build myself
a system of accountability.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.400
So I've been really blessed as an actor.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.416
I've built a really wonderful fan base,
