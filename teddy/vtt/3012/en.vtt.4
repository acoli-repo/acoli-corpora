00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.776
Now -- right?

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.976
(Laughter)

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.096
My brother heard that.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.936
Now, for as long
as I can remember, I've been told

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.039
the kind of man
that I should grow up to be.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.016
As a boy, all I wanted was to be
accepted and liked by the other boys,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.096
but that acceptance meant I had to acquire

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.576
this almost disgusted view
of the feminine,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.736
and since we were told that feminine
is the opposite of masculine,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.936
I either had to reject
embodying any of these qualities

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.560
or face rejection myself.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.720
This is the script that we've been given.
