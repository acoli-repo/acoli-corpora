He didn't teach me
how to hunt, how to fight,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.200
you know, man stuff.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.136
Instead he taught me what he knew:

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.440
that being a man was about sacrifice

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.496
and doing whatever you can

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.600
to take care of
and provide for your family.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.936
But there was another role
I learned how to play from my dad,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.016
who, I discovered,
learned it from his dad,

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.896
a state senator

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.616
who later in life

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.440
had to work nights as a janitor
to support his family,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.560
and he never told a soul.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.896
That role was to suffer in secret.
