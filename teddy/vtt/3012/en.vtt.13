00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.200
are by creating experiences
that force me to be vulnerable.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.136
So if there's something
I'm experiencing shame around in my life,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
I practice diving straight into it,

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.176
no matter how scary it is --

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.536
and sometimes, even publicly.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.616
Because then in doing so

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.496
I take away its power,

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.856
and my display of vulnerability

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.080
can in some cases give other men
permission to do the same.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.856
As an example, a little while ago

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.816
I was wrestling with an issue in my life
