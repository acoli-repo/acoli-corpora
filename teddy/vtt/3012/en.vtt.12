It's not. A lot of us men are really good
at making friends, and talking,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.136
just not about anything real.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.016
(Laughter)

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.536
If it's about work or sports
or politics or women,

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.560
we have no problem sharing our opinions,

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.200
but if it's about
our insecurities or our struggles,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.280
our fear of failure,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.600
then it's almost like we become paralyzed.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.120
At least, I do.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.976
So some of the ways
that I have been practicing

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.456
breaking free of this behavior

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.200
are by creating experiences
that force me to be vulnerable.
