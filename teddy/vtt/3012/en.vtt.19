00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.536
(Laughter)

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.696
Now, he immediately wrote me back.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.960
I thought he was going to go off on me,
but instead he apologized.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.776
He told me how, growing up,

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.256
public displays of affection
were looked down on.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.560
He told me that he was wrestling
and struggling with his ego,

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.296
and how much he loved his girlfriend

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.000
and how thankful he was for her patience.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.256
And then a few weeks later,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.600
he messaged me again.
