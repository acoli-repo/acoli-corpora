00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.816
I was wrestling with an issue in my life

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.840
that I knew I needed
to talk to my guy friends about,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.216
but I was so paralyzed by fear

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.296
that they would judge me
and see me as weak

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.680
and I would lose my standing as a leader

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.456
that I knew I had to take them
out of town on a three-day guys trip --

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.496
(Laughter)

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.136
Just to open up. And guess what?

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.776
It wasn't until the end of the third day

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.936
that I finally found
the strength to talk to them
