00:01:27.938 --> 00:01:30.874
and right now, he's trying
to figure out his next steps.

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:34.424
In a country where money equals power,

00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:39.142
quick money, at least for a while,
gives young men and women like him

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.622
a sense of control over their lives,

00:01:41.646 --> 00:01:44.869
though he said he mainly did it
because he wanted stability.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.178
"I wanted a good life," he told me.

00:01:47.202 --> 00:01:49.415
"I got greedy and I got caught."

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.142

00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:54.757

in the American dream.

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.922
He still believes that with hard work,

00:01:56.946 --> 00:01:58.635
despite being arrested,

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.386
that he can move on up.
