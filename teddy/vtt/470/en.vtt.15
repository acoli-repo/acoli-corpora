00:07:27.734 --> 00:07:30.861
that these wins are too few
and far between

00:07:30.885 --> 00:07:33.541
for a people that's been here
for over 400 years.

00:07:33.565 --> 00:07:35.177
Like, that's insane, right?

00:07:35.201 --> 00:07:39.287
And most people still don't
really understand the full picture, right?

00:07:39.311 --> 00:07:41.550
Our stories are still misunderstood,

00:07:41.574 --> 00:07:43.581
our bodies are still taken advantage of,

00:07:43.605 --> 00:07:44.756
and our voices?

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.224
Our voices are silenced

00:07:46.248 --> 00:07:50.194
in a world that still shows little concern
for our everyday struggles.

00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:52.439
So our stories need to be told

00:07:52.463 --> 00:07:54.294
in a multitude of ways

00:07:54.318 --> 00:07:55.811
by a range of voices

00:07:55.835 --> 00:07:58.341
talking about diverse and nuanced topics,

00:07:58.365 --> 00:08:00.233
and they really need to be listened to.
