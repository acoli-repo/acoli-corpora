Now black millennials,

00:04:03.788 --> 00:04:07.723
a group that I have researched

00:04:07.747 --> 00:04:10.900
are the perfect example
of the blind spot that we have

00:04:10.924 --> 00:04:12.701
when it comes to this group.

00:04:12.725 --> 00:04:14.455
For example,

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.780
we have lower rates of homeownership,

00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:19.344
we have higher student debt,

00:04:19.933 --> 00:04:23.090
we get ID'd more
at voter registration booths,

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.748
we are incarcerated at higher rates ...

00:04:27.557 --> 00:04:29.033
we make less money,
