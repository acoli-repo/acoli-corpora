and they really need to be listened to.

And it is not just here in America, right?

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.201

Millennials make up 27 percent

00:08:07.905 --> 00:08:10.220
That's around two billion people.

00:08:10.244 --> 00:08:14.129
And with countries like India,
China, Indonesia and Brazil,

is only telling half the story.

00:08:26.436 --> 00:08:29.029
Now, there's many people
trying to broaden the palette.

00:08:29.053 --> 00:08:32.793
They're fighting to get their stories told
and bust the millennial stereotype.
