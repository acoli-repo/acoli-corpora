00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.714
Or actor AB,

00:09:30.738 --> 00:09:34.594
who knows that the roles he takes
and gets in Hollywood are different

00:09:34.618 --> 00:09:36.008
because of his skin color.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.610
And then there's Simon.

00:09:38.634 --> 00:09:42.855
So Simon, by all means, would be
an example of someone who's made it.

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:46.090
He's a CFO at a tech company
in San Francisco,

00:09:46.114 --> 00:09:48.355
he has a degree from MIT

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:51.714
and he's worked at some of the hottest
tech companies in the world.

00:09:52.487 --> 00:09:58.796
But when I asked Simon
if he had achieved the American dream,

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.134
it took him a while to respond.
