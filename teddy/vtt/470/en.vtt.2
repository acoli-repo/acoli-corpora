who often never even
acknowledged his existence.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.547
Before that, he sold sneakers on Facebook.

00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:09.100
He even tried selling candy bars
and water bottles,

00:01:09.124 --> 00:01:12.553
but he wasn't making enough money
to help his parents out

00:01:12.577 --> 00:01:15.240
or save up for a car any time soon.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.677
So Troy saw how hard his immigrant
mother from Jamaica worked

00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:21.948
and how little she got back in return,

00:01:21.972 --> 00:01:23.206
and he vowed --

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.014
Troy vowed to take a different path.

00:01:25.038 --> 00:01:26.691
So he ended up selling drugs.

00:01:26.715 --> 00:01:27.914
And then he got caught,

00:01:27.938 --> 00:01:30.874
and right now, he's trying
to figure out his next steps.
