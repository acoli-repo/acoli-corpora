that he can move on up.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:04.303
Now, I don't know

00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:08.561
He disappeared from the program
for troubled youth that he was involved in

00:02:08.585 --> 00:02:10.249
and slipped through the cracks,

00:02:10.273 --> 00:02:12.048

when it comes to realizing their dreams.

00:02:29.796 --> 00:02:31.375
I think about all the challenges
