00:10:32.669 --> 00:10:36.781
that show how even dreaming
may differ between communities.

00:10:36.805 --> 00:10:40.617
So we really need to listen
and hear the stories of this generation,

00:10:40.641 --> 00:10:42.173
now more than ever,

00:10:42.197 --> 00:10:45.501
as the baby boomers age
and millennials come to prominence.

00:10:45.525 --> 00:10:51.681
We can talk all we want to
about pickling businesses in Brooklyn

00:10:51.705 --> 00:10:53.489

and the voices of black millennials,

00:10:56.546 --> 00:10:58.235
large swaths of the population --

00:10:58.259 --> 00:11:00.103
it will only increase divisions.
