00:00:28.617 --> 00:00:32.927
Now Troy also embodies
the many positive qualities

00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:34.788
his generation is known for.

00:00:34.812 --> 00:00:36.522
An entrepreneurial spirit,

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:37.993
an independent streak

00:00:38.017 --> 00:00:40.149
and a dedication to his parents.

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:41.629
He believes in hard work

00:00:41.653 --> 00:00:46.073
and has tried gigs in both the licit
and underground economies,

00:00:46.097 --> 00:00:47.468
but he hasn't had any luck

00:00:47.492 --> 00:00:49.255
and is just trying to find his way

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:51.399
and still dances between both worlds.

00:00:52.055 --> 00:00:54.579
When I met Troy a few years ago,

00:00:54.603 --> 00:00:57.501
he had been employed as a golf caddy
at a local country club,

00:00:57.525 --> 00:00:59.848
carrying bags for rich men and women

00:00:59.872 --> 00:01:02.695
who often never even
acknowledged his existence.
