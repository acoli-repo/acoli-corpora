00:08:57.396 --> 00:09:00.653
and it certainly doesn't mean
that a post-racial society,

00:09:00.677 --> 00:09:02.673
that thing that we talked about so much,

00:09:02.697 --> 00:09:05.065
ever became close to being a reality.

00:09:05.943 --> 00:09:07.094
I think of Joelle,

00:09:07.118 --> 00:09:10.798
a middle-class 20-something
who did everything the "right way,"

00:09:10.822 --> 00:09:14.704
but she couldn't go to her dream school,
because it was simply too expensive.

00:09:14.728 --> 00:09:15.990
Or Jalessa,

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:18.634
who knows she can't be mediocre at her job

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:21.555
the same way that her white peers can.

00:09:22.202 --> 00:09:26.423
Or Trina, who knows that people judge
her unconventional family choices

00:09:26.447 --> 00:09:29.126
in a different way
than if she were a white woman.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.714
