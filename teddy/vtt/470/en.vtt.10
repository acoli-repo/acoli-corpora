00:04:57.416 --> 00:05:00.002
so young people moved
to the North and the West

00:05:00.026 --> 00:05:02.482
to escape discriminatory
Jim Crow policies.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.107
Then, as segregation raged
in much of the country,

00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:08.880
young black people helped
spearhead civil rights campaigns

00:05:08.904 --> 00:05:11.093
in the 1950s and 1960s.

00:05:11.117 --> 00:05:15.903
After that, some people embraced
black power and then became Black Panthers

00:05:15.927 --> 00:05:17.311
and then the next generation,

00:05:17.335 --> 00:05:20.209
they turned to hip-hop to make sure
their voices were heard.

00:05:20.233 --> 00:05:21.413
And then Barack Obama,

00:05:21.437 --> 00:05:23.727
hopeful that he, too,
may bring about change.

00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:25.215
And when that failed,

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:27.981
when we realized we were still
brutalized and battered,

00:05:28.005 --> 00:05:31.524
we had to let the world know
that our lives still mattered.
