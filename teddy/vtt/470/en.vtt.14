00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.024
broke all sorts of records.

00:07:01.048 --> 00:07:04.693
There's a crop of television shows
by creatives like Donald Glover,

00:07:04.717 --> 00:07:06.511
Lena Waithe and Issa Rae.

00:07:06.535 --> 00:07:08.257
Beyoncé is, like, the queen, right?

00:07:08.282 --> 00:07:09.910
She is, like, everything.

00:07:10.352 --> 00:07:12.307
Young black authors are winning awards,

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:15.698
Serena Williams is still
dominating on the tennis court

00:07:15.722 --> 00:07:17.278
despite all her haters,

00:07:17.302 --> 00:07:20.747
and there's a crop of new politicians
and activists running for office.

00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:24.198
So I don't want to, like,
kill these moments of black joy

00:07:24.222 --> 00:07:26.107
that I too revel in,

00:07:26.131 --> 00:07:27.710
but I want to make it clear

00:07:27.734 --> 00:07:30.861
that these wins are too few
and far between
