00:00:00.894 --> 00:00:02.822
So on the surface,

00:00:02.846 --> 00:00:06.163
Troy is the kind of millennial
that think pieces are made of.

00:00:06.187 --> 00:00:08.425
He's arrogant, self-centered

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:11.538
and convinced that he is smarter
than people give him credit for.

00:00:11.562 --> 00:00:16.365
His favorite topics of conversation
are girls, sneakers and cars --

00:00:16.389 --> 00:00:19.788
not a surprise for someone
who was a teenager just a few years ago.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.018
But Troy's mannerisms --

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:25.900
they reveal the patterns
of someone who is scared,

00:00:25.924 --> 00:00:28.161
troubled and unsure of the future.

00:00:28.617 --> 00:00:32.927
Now Troy also embodies
the many positive qualities
