00:03:26.882 --> 00:03:31.620
In fact, millennials are the largest
and most diverse adult population

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:32.886
in this country.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.858
44 percent of all American
millennials are nonwhite,

00:03:36.882 --> 00:03:39.198
but often, you wouldn't
even know it at all.

00:03:39.638 --> 00:03:42.677
Now sure, there are similarities
within this population

00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:45.482
born between 1981 and 1996.

00:03:45.914 --> 00:03:48.876
Perhaps many of us do love
avocado toast and lattes --

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.246
I know I do, right?

00:03:50.712 --> 00:03:53.526
But there are also extreme differences,

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.082
often between millennials of color
and white millennials.

00:03:57.106 --> 00:03:58.910
In fact, all too often,

00:03:58.934 --> 00:04:02.010
it seems as though we're virtually
living in different worlds.
