00:02:57.542 --> 00:03:00.893
let's go do something
to make this world a better place."

00:03:00.917 --> 00:03:03.143
His hands were wide and calloused,

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:08.643
and they always reminded me
of displaced tree roots.

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:12.018
As we worked he would talk with folks

00:03:12.042 --> 00:03:15.976
about the change he was sure
was just around the corner.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.351
I saw him mend flagging hopes

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:23.101
and leave folks
with their heads held high.

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:26.042
His hands stirred the sunshine.

00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:31.018
And now he was about
to break my piggy bank.
