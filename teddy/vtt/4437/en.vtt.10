You know, the kids in my gardening group?

00:05:01.583 --> 00:05:04.226
They didn't bat an eye
when I had Uncle Freeman get down

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.684
and put his hands in the earth again

00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:09.726
and start breaking up
that soil for our seeds.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.559
And my little friend Taesha even came over
and started slapping him on the back

00:05:13.583 --> 00:05:15.309
saying, "Cry it out, Uncle Freeman.

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:16.583
Cry it out."

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.292
"I can't fix this," he sobbed.

00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:26.125
It's an ancient-future truism, that.

00:05:27.042 --> 00:05:30.625
He wasn't the first to feel that way,
and he wouldn't be the last.
