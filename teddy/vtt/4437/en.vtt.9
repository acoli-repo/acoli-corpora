00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:31.934
"Well, one of these numbers
is gonna hit, little girl.

00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.018
You got a quarter for your uncle Free -- "

00:04:34.042 --> 00:04:36.518
Now some of y'all have that relative.

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:40.101
But I knew right then and there
I had to do something.

00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:41.934
I jumped up and I grabbed that hammer

00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:44.184
and I brought it
crashing down on that pig.

00:04:44.208 --> 00:04:48.309
And Uncle Freeman started to weep
as I gathered up all the coins.

00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:50.851
"We're not buying
no lottery ticket, Uncle Freeman.

00:04:50.875 --> 00:04:52.125
C'mon."

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:58.583
We spent every last cent
at the seed store.

00:04:59.542 --> 00:05:01.559
You know, the kids in my gardening group?
