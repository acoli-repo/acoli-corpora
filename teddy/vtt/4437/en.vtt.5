00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:34.684
He was standing over my piggy bank
with his hammer raised high.

00:02:34.708 --> 00:02:36.958
He was fixing to steal my coins.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:38.976
And you see,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.476
my uncle Freeman was a handyman.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.851
He could fix anything --

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:45.059
a broken chair, a shattered pot --

00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:48.351
even bring grandmother's
plants back to life.

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:52.476
He had that magic touch
with broken things ...

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.184
and broken people.

00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:56.184
He would take me with him on his jobs

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:57.518
and say, "C'mon Jo,

00:02:57.542 --> 00:03:00.893
let's go do something
to make this world a better place."
