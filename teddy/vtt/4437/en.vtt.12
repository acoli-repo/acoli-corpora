Uncle Freeman cried so much that day
as we planted our seeds,

00:06:02.667 --> 00:06:05.667
he was our very own irrigation system.

00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:10.476
"I don't know who I am
anymore, little girl,"

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.833
he said to me at sundown.

00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:16.643
"Good, Uncle Freeman.

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:17.958
Good.

00:06:18.833 --> 00:06:21.518
You're new again,

00:06:21.542 --> 00:06:24.792
and that's just how we need you."
