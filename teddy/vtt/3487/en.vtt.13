00:06:29.528 --> 00:06:34.213
average IQ is rising
at .36 points of IQ per year.

00:06:34.237 --> 00:06:36.960
What's been very interesting
is that in some countries --

00:06:36.984 --> 00:06:39.338
not to call anyone out,
but Denmark and Norway --

00:06:39.362 --> 00:06:42.377
in some countries, overall crystalline IQ

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:45.440
has stopped or slowed down or declined.

00:06:45.464 --> 00:06:46.913
In other countries, though,

00:06:46.937 --> 00:06:50.090
particularly when looking at fluid IQ,
fluid intelligence,

00:06:50.114 --> 00:06:51.368
the number is increasing,

00:06:51.392 --> 00:06:55.192
and the rate of fluid intelligence
increase is increasing,

00:06:55.216 --> 00:06:57.316
starting in the 1990s.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.851
Coincidence? I think not.

00:06:59.875 --> 00:07:00.891
