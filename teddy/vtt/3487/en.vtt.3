Anti-Bush political humor
goes a long way in Western Europe.

00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:32.600
(Laughter)

00:01:32.624 --> 00:01:35.329
So, between 1987 and now,

00:01:35.353 --> 00:01:37.691
I played a lot of this game
called "Civilization,"

00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:39.798
which was designed by a guy
named Sid Meier.

00:01:39.822 --> 00:01:44.099
In fact, I spent about 8- to 10,000
hours of my life playing "Civilization,"

00:01:44.123 --> 00:01:46.907
which is a long time I probably
should have spent studying.

00:01:46.931 --> 00:01:50.429
But nonetheless, I managed to turn
this love of video games into a job,

00:01:50.453 --> 00:01:52.730
first working on the Game
Developers Conference,

00:01:52.754 --> 00:01:56.493
helping to start the first successful
digital distribution company in games,

00:01:56.517 --> 00:01:57.674
called Trymedia,

00:01:57.698 --> 00:01:59.757
and then now, writing
the Gamification blog.

00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:02.367
I'm author of two books
on the subject of gamification,
