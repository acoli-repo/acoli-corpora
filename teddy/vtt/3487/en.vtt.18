This is the key to making that experience
really successful for kids.

00:09:03.336 --> 00:09:05.928
It's also true, though,
that we need to talk about

00:09:05.952 --> 00:09:08.416
the relationship between kids
and violence in games.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.447
Study after study very clearly tells you

00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:13.056
that violent games
do not make children violent.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.828
We also must acknowledge, however,

00:09:14.852 --> 00:09:17.303
that if you have a child
predisposed to violence,

00:09:17.327 --> 00:09:20.549
violent games may help make them
a better violent child.

00:09:20.573 --> 00:09:23.920
If they train kids to do other things,
they also will train that,

00:09:23.944 --> 00:09:25.239
and we need to accept that,

00:09:25.263 --> 00:09:27.566
and we need to start
understanding the connection

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.349
between games as a form of training.

00:09:29.373 --> 00:09:31.707
We can't blanket-say
that they don't affect kids.
