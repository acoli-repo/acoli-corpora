and research and development,

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.209
in the form of a Tamagotchi-style game,

00:11:03.233 --> 00:11:07.381
in a dashboard designed to make you
a more ecological driver.

00:11:07.405 --> 00:11:10.426
Most of the game mechanics
are very simple:

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.186
a plant grows as you drive
more ecologically

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.652
and withers if you don't,

00:11:14.676 --> 00:11:16.694
like those virtual pets Tamagotchi.

This is an example
of gamification at work.

00:11:20.228 --> 00:11:24.015
Another really interesting example
is a thing called "speed camera lottery,"

00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:28.220
designed by Kevin Richardson,
based in San Francisco, works for MTV.

00:11:28.244 --> 00:11:29.395
Awesome guy.

00:11:29.419 --> 00:11:31.513
This is the concept
in speed camera lottery:
