I'm author of two books
on the subject of gamification,

00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:05.643
including the recent "Gamification
by Design," published by O'Reilly.

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.393
And I chair the Gamification Summit,

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:09.968
which is an event that brings
all this stuff together.

00:02:09.992 --> 00:02:12.400
So in many ways, I am parents' dream

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:17.357
of how somebody can turn a sedentary
lifestyle of playing video games

00:02:17.381 --> 00:02:19.911
into an actual career
that pays real money.

00:02:19.935 --> 00:02:22.312
So when I get invited
to an event like this,

00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:25.098
I'm sure that all of you
expect me to get up here and say,

00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:27.013
"Games are awesome for your children."

00:02:27.037 --> 00:02:30.128
Right? Because I'm a games guy
and this is how I make my living.
