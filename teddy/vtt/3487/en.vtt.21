A simple definition of gamification
is it's the process of using game thinking

00:10:31.357 --> 00:10:32.576
and game mechanics

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.200
to engage audiences and solve problems.

00:10:35.224 --> 00:10:39.104
Part of the reason gamification has become
such an emergent topic right now

00:10:39.128 --> 00:10:42.668
is because of Generation G's effect
on culture and society already.

00:10:42.692 --> 00:10:44.265
Their expectations are different.

00:10:44.289 --> 00:10:46.824
Some examples of gamification
that you may have seen

00:10:46.848 --> 00:10:48.456
that are really fascinating to me

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.990
are the emergence
of in-dash[board] games in cars.

00:10:51.014 --> 00:10:55.159
Today, if you buy a hybrid
or an electric vehicle,

00:10:55.183 --> 00:10:56.545
you'll almost certainly see

00:10:56.569 --> 00:10:59.373
the product of a hundred million
dollars' worth of tooling

00:10:59.397 --> 00:11:00.806
and research and development,
