00:05:58.955 --> 00:06:04.332
It also is connected to a constant
and exponential increase in learning.

00:06:04.356 --> 00:06:08.801
Video games fundamentally present
a continuous process of learning to users.

00:06:08.825 --> 00:06:11.603
They don't just learn
for a little while and then stop.

00:06:11.627 --> 00:06:14.070
They're constantly evolving
and moving forward.

00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:18.467
It may, in fact, help us to explain
the Flynn effect, finally.

00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:20.938
The "Flynn effect,"
for those of you who don't know,

00:06:20.962 --> 00:06:24.278
is the pattern that human intelligence
is actually rising over time.

00:06:24.302 --> 00:06:28.205
So if we look at the history of IQ,
people, in fact, are getting smarter.

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:29.504
In the US right now,

00:06:29.528 --> 00:06:34.213
average IQ is rising
at .36 points of IQ per year.
