00:07:27.552 --> 00:07:31.255
and keep seeking that activity
over and over again.

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:33.353
So this is really powerful stuff.

00:07:33.377 --> 00:07:38.273
I want to introduce you to an educator
who understands this in intricate detail,

00:07:38.297 --> 00:07:40.039
named Ananth Pai.

00:07:40.063 --> 00:07:42.939
Ananth was a very successful
businessperson

00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:45.159
who worked on process reengineering.

00:07:46.087 --> 00:07:49.797
When his kids went into school
in White Bear Lake, Minnesota,

00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:51.689
a suburb of Minneapolis-Saint Paul,

00:07:51.713 --> 00:07:53.070
he saw the education system

00:07:53.094 --> 00:07:55.341
and decided he wanted
to do something about it.

00:07:55.365 --> 00:07:58.337
So as an adult, he went back
and got a master's in [Education]

00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:01.162
and took over a class
at White Bear Lake Elementary School.
