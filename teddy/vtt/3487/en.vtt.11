00:05:27.248 --> 00:05:30.589
and to teach themselves
to increase their fluid intelligence.

00:05:30.613 --> 00:05:34.296
"Fluid intelligence" is the intelligence
we use to problem-solve.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.433
It's different from
crystalline intelligence,

00:05:36.457 --> 00:05:37.711
it helps us problem-solve.

00:05:37.735 --> 00:05:39.629
She identified, from the research,

00:05:39.653 --> 00:05:41.636
that there were five things you could do:

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.811
seek novelty,

00:05:42.835 --> 00:05:43.986
challenge yourself,

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.161
think creatively,

00:05:45.185 --> 00:05:46.336
do things the hard way

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.511
and network.

00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:49.166
Think about those five things.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.547
Any of you play video games?

00:05:50.571 --> 00:05:55.001
Does it resemble the basic pattern
of a video game to you in any way?

00:05:55.025 --> 00:05:58.931
These are five things that recur
in all very successful video games.

00:05:58.955 --> 00:06:04.332
It also is connected to a constant
and exponential increase in learning.
