00:00:59.274 --> 00:01:03.029
the last substantial giant hit
in the entertainment business,

00:01:03.053 --> 00:01:07.570
despite the fact that it was 1987,
which is such an incredibly long time ago,

00:01:07.594 --> 00:01:10.335
and I'm only 36, so you can do the math.

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:13.129
Things are completely different today
from what they were.

00:01:13.153 --> 00:01:14.421
Just as a simple example,

00:01:14.445 --> 00:01:16.848
in 1987, we thought
this guy was kind of crazy.

00:01:16.872 --> 00:01:18.797
Then we met this dude,

00:01:18.821 --> 00:01:21.839
who has really changed
our perspective on that subject.

00:01:21.863 --> 00:01:23.993
(Laughter)

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:25.358
Things have changed.

00:01:25.382 --> 00:01:28.679
(Laughter)

00:01:28.703 --> 00:01:31.551
Anti-Bush political humor
goes a long way in Western Europe.
