The neuroscientist was debunking
this idea in the article.

00:03:01.072 --> 00:03:04.551
She trotted out researchers
like Dr Christopher Lucas at NYU,

00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:08.142
who said games don't teach
the right kind of attention skills

00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:10.697
where kids have sustained attention,

00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:12.884
where they're not receiving
regular rewards.

00:03:12.908 --> 00:03:14.259
And she trotted out experts

00:03:14.283 --> 00:03:17.118
like Dr Dimitri Christakis
at the University of Washington,

00:03:17.142 --> 00:03:19.426
who said that kids
who play a lot of video games

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.197
may find the real world unpalatable
or uninteresting,

00:03:22.221 --> 00:03:24.812
as a result of their
sensitization to games.

00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:28.414
So I sat there and thought to myself,
I'm scratching my head,

00:03:28.438 --> 00:03:31.799
is it that our children have ADD,
