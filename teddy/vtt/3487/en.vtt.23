This is the concept
in speed camera lottery:

00:11:31.537 --> 00:11:34.037
you know those speeding cameras
that you pass by,

00:11:34.061 --> 00:11:36.370
and they take your picture
and send you a ticket?

00:11:36.394 --> 00:11:37.872
In many Scandinavian countries,

00:11:37.896 --> 00:11:41.413
the ticket you get is actually based
not only on how fast you were going,

00:11:41.437 --> 00:11:44.779
but how much money you make:
the more you make, the bigger the ticket.

00:11:44.803 --> 00:11:47.633
Kevin reengineered
a speeding camera in Sweden

00:11:47.657 --> 00:11:49.352
that instead of just giving tickets

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:52.405
to people who drive over the speed limit
that pass the camera,

00:11:52.429 --> 00:11:55.838
anybody who drives under the limit
is entered into a lottery

00:11:55.862 --> 00:11:58.212
to win the proceeds
of the people who speed.

00:11:58.236 --> 00:12:00.624
