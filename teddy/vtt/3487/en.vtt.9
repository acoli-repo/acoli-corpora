Research by Arne May et Al
at the University of Regensburg in Germany

00:04:32.692 --> 00:04:36.758
found that when they gave participants --
this was actually done on adults --

00:04:36.782 --> 00:04:39.274
a simple task to learn, like juggling,

00:04:39.298 --> 00:04:40.788
in 12 weeks,

00:04:40.812 --> 00:04:42.679
people who were asked to learn juggling

00:04:42.703 --> 00:04:46.506
displayed a marked increase
in gray matter in their brain.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.893
On an MRI, you can see
people get more gray matter

00:04:49.917 --> 00:04:51.799
after 12 weeks of learning juggling.

00:04:51.823 --> 00:04:54.502
In 2008, they went back
and redid the study

00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:56.581
to see why the gray matter increased.

00:04:56.605 --> 00:04:59.176
They discovered it was the act of learning

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.193
that produced the increased brain matter,
