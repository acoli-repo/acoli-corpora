00:03:59.427 --> 00:04:02.759
the maximum skill that I was expected
to display in a video game

00:04:02.783 --> 00:04:04.394
was simple hand-eye coordination,

00:04:04.418 --> 00:04:06.212
a joystick and a firing button.

00:04:06.236 --> 00:04:09.265
Today's kids play games
in which they're expected to chat

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:10.719
in text and voice,

00:04:10.743 --> 00:04:13.816
operate a character,
follow long- and short-term objectives,

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.428
and deal with their parents interrupting
them all the time to talk to them.

00:04:17.452 --> 00:04:18.545
(Laughter)

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:21.373
Kids have to have
an extraordinary multitasking skill

00:04:21.397 --> 00:04:23.104
to be able to achieve things today.

00:04:23.128 --> 00:04:24.592
We never had to have that.

00:04:24.616 --> 00:04:29.160
It turns out things like that
actually make you smarter.
