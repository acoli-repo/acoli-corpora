most people think that Atari 2600
is really the nexus,

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.380
the catalyst of the video game business.

00:00:34.404 --> 00:00:37.550
But I actually think that "Where
in the World is Carmen Sandiego?"

00:00:37.574 --> 00:00:40.148
is probably the most important
video game ever made,

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:43.787
principally because it was
the first and the last time

00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:48.065
that parents, teachers and kids all agreed
that a video game was awesome.

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:49.704

00:00:49.728 --> 00:00:52.525
Now, that was a long time ago.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:54.561
In fact, it was 1987.

00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:56.301
And it may surprise you to know

00:00:56.325 --> 00:00:59.250
that "Where in the World
is Carmen Sandiego?" continues to be

00:00:59.274 --> 00:01:03.029
the last substantial giant hit
in the entertainment business,
