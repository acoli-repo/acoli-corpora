00:03:28.438 --> 00:03:31.799
is it that our children have ADD,

00:03:31.823 --> 00:03:37.392
or is our world just too freaking slow
for our children to appreciate?

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:38.574
(Applause)

00:03:38.598 --> 00:03:42.037
Seriously, consider the picture
you're looking at right now,

00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:44.775
like in my era, even my grandfather's era,

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.398
sitting down on a Sunday afternoon
to read a good book with a cup of tea --

00:03:49.422 --> 00:03:50.623
I just have to say,

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:53.465
I don't think that today's kids
are ever going to do that.

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.982
The evidence is found
in the games they play.

00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:58.056
Consider the video game
"World of Warcraft."

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.403
When I was growing up,

00:03:59.427 --> 00:04:02.759
the maximum skill that I was expected
to display in a video game
