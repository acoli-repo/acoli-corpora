00:09:29.373 --> 00:09:31.707
We can't blanket-say
that they don't affect kids.

00:09:31.731 --> 00:09:32.893
It's not true.

00:09:32.917 --> 00:09:36.778
I'd like to call the group of people
who are driving this trend forward

00:09:36.802 --> 00:09:37.961
"Generation G."

00:09:37.985 --> 00:09:42.113
There are 126 million millennials
in the United States and the EU,

00:09:42.137 --> 00:09:44.291
plus younger kids we can't yet count,

00:09:44.315 --> 00:09:45.776
that form Generation G.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.250
And the way that Generation G
is different from X, Y,

00:09:50.274 --> 00:09:52.983
and all the different generations
that we may belong to,

00:09:53.007 --> 00:09:55.910
is that video games
are the primary form of entertainment

00:09:55.934 --> 00:09:57.634
that Generation G is consuming.

00:09:57.658 --> 00:09:59.672
It is their primary form of entertainment.

00:09:59.696 --> 00:10:02.788
This is already starting to have
a tremendous effect on society.
