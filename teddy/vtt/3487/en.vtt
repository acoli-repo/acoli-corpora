00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:01.666
I'm 36 years old.

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.120
My first experience
with the video game business

00:00:04.144 --> 00:00:06.429
was neighbors who were wealthier than us

00:00:06.453 --> 00:00:09.014
bringing home an Atari 2600
and playing it.

00:00:09.038 --> 00:00:10.994
It was a pretty definitive moment for me.

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:15.260
I also remember going to school,
and on an Apple II,

00:00:15.284 --> 00:00:18.328
playing a game called
"Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?"

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:20.412
an awesome game,

00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:24.710
which was the first time I played a game
in the school context.

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:28.673
When you ask people about the video game
business and what's significant,

00:00:28.697 --> 00:00:32.342
most people think that Atari 2600
is really the nexus,
