00:12:57.548 --> 00:13:00.096
It's a world in which
there are rewards everywhere

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.505
for actions that people take.

00:13:01.529 --> 00:13:03.865
The rewards don't always
have to be cash rewards.

00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:05.772
They can be meaningful status rewards,

00:13:05.796 --> 00:13:07.086
meaningful access rewards,

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.175
meaningful power rewards.

00:13:09.199 --> 00:13:12.306
A world in which there's extensive
collaborative play.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.534
This is one of the things
that Generation G does so much differently

00:13:15.558 --> 00:13:16.720
than even my generation.

00:13:16.744 --> 00:13:20.893
I remember going to school and teachers
struggling to come up with exercises

00:13:20.917 --> 00:13:22.291
that we could do as a team,

00:13:22.315 --> 00:13:24.662
that would be graded as a team.

00:13:24.686 --> 00:13:28.463
In the end, those group exercises
always boiled down to an individual score,

00:13:28.487 --> 00:13:30.653
which distorted the way
that people behaved.
