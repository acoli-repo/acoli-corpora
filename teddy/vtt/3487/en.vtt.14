(Laughter)

00:07:00.915 --> 00:07:06.135
In fact, games are wired to produce
a particular kind of reaction in people.

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:08.171
So we've got this learning brain increase,

00:07:08.195 --> 00:07:10.445
multitasking brain increase connection,

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:13.756
and we also have a strong
dopamine loop in the brain.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.362
As games present a challenge,

00:07:15.386 --> 00:07:18.385
and you struggle to achieve that challenge
and you overcome it,

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:20.099
dopamine is released in your brain.

00:07:20.123 --> 00:07:22.635
And that produces
an intrinsic reinforcement.

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:26.166
In the words of Judy,
that produces an intrinsic reinforcement

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.528
that causes you to go back

00:07:27.552 --> 00:07:31.255
and keep seeking that activity
over and over again.
