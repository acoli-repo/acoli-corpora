that produced the increased brain matter,

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:03.814
not performance at the activity itself,

00:05:03.838 --> 00:05:05.683
which is a very interesting finding.

00:05:05.707 --> 00:05:09.724
It also reinforced this idea,
which should go over well here as well,

00:05:09.748 --> 00:05:13.222
that multilingual people
outperform monolingual people

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:16.120
on most standardized tests by about 15%.

00:05:16.144 --> 00:05:19.654
There's something that happens

00:05:19.678 --> 00:05:23.543
Andrea Kuszewski,
speaking at Harvard, talked about

00:05:23.567 --> 00:05:27.224
these five things that people do
to increase their grey matter

00:05:27.248 --> 00:05:30.589
and to teach themselves
to increase their fluid intelligence.
