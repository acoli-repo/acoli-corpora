Right? Because I'm a games guy
and this is how I make my living.

00:02:30.152 --> 00:02:31.211
(Applause)

00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:32.459
Games will help children.

00:02:32.483 --> 00:02:34.959
But instead, I want to ask you
a different question,

00:02:34.983 --> 00:02:36.873
which is: Really, who needs games help?

00:02:36.897 --> 00:02:41.283
I started this process by thinking
about reading a particular article

00:02:41.307 --> 00:02:42.803
in the New York Times recently.

00:02:42.827 --> 00:02:45.221
In the article, a neuroscientist
was talking about

00:02:45.245 --> 00:02:48.662
how children were presenting themselves
with attention deficit disorder.

00:02:48.686 --> 00:02:50.402
Their parents would come in and say,

00:02:50.426 --> 00:02:52.780
"My kids can't possibly have ADD,

00:02:52.804 --> 00:02:55.958
because they're super good
at focusing on video games,

00:02:55.982 --> 00:02:58.229
But when they go to school,
they're really bad."

00:02:58.253 --> 00:03:01.048
The neuroscientist was debunking
this idea in the article.
