If you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and you say, "Well, what about thinking and emotions?"

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Most people will say, "Emotions are terribly hard.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
They're incredibly complex. They can't -- I have no idea of how they work.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But thinking is really very straightforward:

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
it's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning, or something.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But that's not the hard part."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So here's a list of problems that come up.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
One nice problem is, what do we do about health?
