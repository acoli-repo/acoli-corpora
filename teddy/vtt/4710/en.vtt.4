Today, one says,

00:02:00.293 --> 00:02:02.380
"Give us today our daily bread."

00:02:02.404 --> 00:02:04.130
In Old English, they said,

00:02:04.154 --> 00:02:07.415
"Urne gedaeghwamlican
hlaf syle us todaeg."

00:02:09.148 --> 00:02:11.121
Things change in conlangs, too.

00:02:11.438 --> 00:02:14.578
Tolkien charted out ancient
and newer versions of Elvish.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.453
When the first Elves awoke at Cuiviénen,

00:02:17.477 --> 00:02:18.525
in their new language,

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.767
the word for "people" was "kwendi,"

00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:24.289
but in the language of one of the groups
that moved away, Teleri,

00:02:24.313 --> 00:02:26.911
over time, "kwendi" became "pendi,"

00:02:26.935 --> 00:02:29.203
with the "k" turning into a "p."
