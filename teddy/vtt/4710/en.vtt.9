Here's a translation
of "Hamlet" into Klingon,

00:04:31.168 --> 00:04:33.359
although performing it
would mean getting used

00:04:33.383 --> 00:04:35.247
to pronouncing "k" with your uvula,

00:04:35.271 --> 00:04:38.201
that weird, cartoony thing hanging
in the back of your throat.

00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:42.586
Believe it or not, you actually do that
in plenty of languages around the world,

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.960
like Eskimo ones.

00:04:44.813 --> 00:04:46.819
Pronouncing Elvish is much easier, though.

00:04:47.336 --> 00:04:49.364
So, let's take our leave for now

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:51.629
from this introduction
to conlangs in Elvish

00:04:51.653 --> 00:04:53.734
and the other three conlangs discussed

00:04:53.758 --> 00:04:57.300
with a heartfelt
quad-conlangual valedictory:

00:04:58.004 --> 00:04:59.219
"A Na Marie!"

00:04:59.243 --> 00:05:00.281
"Hajas!"
