00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:00.790
among the Teleri,

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:03.678
among the Avari, who spread
throughout Middle Earth,

00:03:03.702 --> 00:03:06.579
it became "kindi"
when the "w" dropped out.

00:03:07.637 --> 00:03:10.051
The Elvish varieties Tolkien
fleshed out the most

00:03:10.075 --> 00:03:11.603
are Quenya and Sindarin,

00:03:11.627 --> 00:03:15.121
and their words are different
in the same way French and Spanish are.

00:03:15.145 --> 00:03:16.859
Quenya has "suc" for "drink,"

00:03:16.883 --> 00:03:18.490
Sindarin has "sog."

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.479
And as you know, real languages are messy.

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:23.789
That's because they change,

00:03:23.813 --> 00:03:26.577
and change has a way
of working against order,

00:03:26.601 --> 00:03:29.399
just like in a living room
or on a bookshelf.

00:03:29.423 --> 00:03:32.071
Real languages are never
perfectly logical.
