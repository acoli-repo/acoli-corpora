Dothraki has thousands of words.

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:04.321
Na'vi started with 1,500 words.

00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:07.093
Fans on websites
have steadily created more.

00:01:07.878 --> 00:01:10.778
But we can see the difference
between vocabulary alone

00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:12.538
and what makes a real language

00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:16.004
from a look at how Tolkien
put together grand old Elvish,

00:01:16.028 --> 00:01:18.309
a conlang with several thousands words.

00:01:19.068 --> 00:01:22.087
After all, you could memorize
5,000 words of Russian

00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:24.788
and still be barely able
to construct a sentence.

00:01:24.812 --> 00:01:27.367
A four-year-old would talk
rings around you.

00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:30.475
That's because you have to know
how to put the words together.
