00:00:28.858 --> 00:00:32.164
in J.R.R. Tolkien's
"Lord of the Rings" trilogy,

00:00:32.188 --> 00:00:34.780
especially since that was
the official grandfather

00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:37.148
of the fantasy conlangs.

00:00:37.997 --> 00:00:40.785
"Conlang" is short for
"constructed language."

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.452
They're more than codes like Pig Latin,

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:47.056
and they're not just collections
of fabricated slang like the Nadsat lingo

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.000
that the teen hoodlums
in "A Clockwork Orange" speak,

00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:52.948
where "droog" from Russian
happens to mean "friend."

00:00:52.972 --> 00:00:57.240
What makes conlangs real languages
isn't the number of words they have.

00:00:57.264 --> 00:00:59.608
It helps, of course,
to have a lot of words.

00:00:59.632 --> 00:01:02.004
Dothraki has thousands of words.
