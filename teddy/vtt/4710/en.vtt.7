Real languages are never
perfectly logical.

00:03:32.095 --> 00:03:36.062
That's why Tolkien made sure
that Elvish had plenty of exceptions.

00:03:36.086 --> 00:03:39.377
Lots of verbs are conjugated
in ways you just have to know.

00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:41.300
Take even the word "know."

00:03:41.324 --> 00:03:43.381
In the past, it's "knew,"

00:03:43.405 --> 00:03:47.090
which isn't explained
by any of the rules in English.

00:03:47.114 --> 00:03:48.132
Oh well.

00:03:48.156 --> 00:03:50.298
In Elvish, "know" is "ista,"

00:03:50.322 --> 00:03:52.671
but "knew" is "sinte."

00:03:52.695 --> 00:03:53.794
Oh well.

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:57.438
The truth is, though, that Elvish
is more a sketch for a real language

00:03:57.462 --> 00:03:58.589
than a whole one.

00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:01.233
For Tolkien, Elvish was a hobby
