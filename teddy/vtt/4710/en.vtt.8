For Tolkien, Elvish was a hobby

00:04:01.257 --> 00:04:04.953
rather than an attempt to create something
people could actually speak.

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:08.456
Much of the Elvish the characters
in the "Lord of the Rings" movies speak

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.703
has been made up since Tolkien
by dedicated fans of Elvish

00:04:11.727 --> 00:04:14.717
based on guesses as to what Tolkien
would have constructed.

00:04:15.931 --> 00:04:19.567
That's the best we can do for Elvish
because there are no actual Elves around

00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:21.094
to speak it for us.

00:04:21.118 --> 00:04:23.802
But the modern conlangs go further.

00:04:23.826 --> 00:04:26.888

are developed enough

00:04:26.912 --> 00:04:28.814
that you can actually speak them.

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:31.144
Here's a translation
of "Hamlet" into Klingon,
