00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:30.876
stories about triumph,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.907
stories about perseverance
all throughout the African diaspora.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.882
I tell these stories

00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:39.255
as a concerted effort
to correct the historical record,

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:42.228
because, no matter
where any of us is from,

00:01:42.252 --> 00:01:44.878
each of us has been touched
by the complicated histories

00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:47.140
that brought our families
to a foreign land.

00:01:47.728 --> 00:01:50.612
These histories shape
the way we view the world,

00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:53.251
and they mold the biases
we carry around with us.

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:55.791
To combat these biases,

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:58.538
my work draws aesthetics
from different parts of the globe

00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:00.563
and crafts a narrative
about the importance
