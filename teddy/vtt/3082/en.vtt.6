00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:01.145
and out into the real world.

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.956
Whether worn by refugees
or world-changing entrepreneurs,

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.647
when people are allowed
the freedom to present themselves

00:03:07.671 --> 00:03:10.488
in a manner that celebrates
their own unique identities,

00:03:10.512 --> 00:03:12.288
a magical thing happens.

00:03:12.312 --> 00:03:13.684
We stand taller.

00:03:13.708 --> 00:03:15.281
We're more proud and self-aware

00:03:15.305 --> 00:03:18.090
because we're presenting
our true, authentic selves.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.264
And those of us who are around them
in turn become more educated,

00:03:22.288 --> 00:03:25.747
more open and more tolerant
of their different points of view.

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:29.221
In this way, the clothes that we wear

00:03:29.245 --> 00:03:33.015
can be a great illustration
of diplomatic soft power.
