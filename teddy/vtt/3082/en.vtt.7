00:03:29.245 --> 00:03:33.015
can be a great illustration
of diplomatic soft power.

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.852
The clothes that we wear
can serve as bridges

00:03:35.876 --> 00:03:38.437
between our seemingly disparate cultures.

00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:43.707
And so, yeah, ostensibly I stand
before you as a mere maker of clothing.

00:03:44.786 --> 00:03:47.215
But my work has always
been about more than fashion.

00:03:48.024 --> 00:03:50.787
It has become my purpose
to rewrite the cultural narratives

00:03:50.811 --> 00:03:54.803
so that people of color can be seen
in a new and nuanced light,

00:03:54.827 --> 00:03:56.042
and so that we,

00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:58.098
the proud children of sub-Saharan Africa,

00:03:58.122 --> 00:03:59.820
can traverse the globe

00:03:59.844 --> 00:04:01.724
while carrying ourselves with pride.
