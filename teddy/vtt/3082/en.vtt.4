00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:00.563
and crafts a narrative
about the importance

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.076
of fighting for inclusivity.

00:02:03.217 --> 00:02:06.075
By refashioning images
from classic European art

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:08.235
and marrying them with African aesthetics,

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.798
I am able to recast people of color
in roles of prominence,

00:02:11.822 --> 00:02:13.736
providing them with a degree of dignity

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.679
they didn't have in earlier times.

00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:21.499
This approach subverts the historically
accepted narrative of African inferiority,

00:02:21.523 --> 00:02:24.032
and it serves as inspiration
for people of color

00:02:24.056 --> 00:02:27.477
who have grown wary of seeing
themselves depicted without sophistication

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:28.651
and without grace.
