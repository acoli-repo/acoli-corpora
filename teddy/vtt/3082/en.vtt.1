00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:30.047
I've discovered the importance
of providing representation

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:33.013
for the marginalized members
of our society,

00:00:33.037 --> 00:00:36.330
and the importance of telling
the most vulnerable among us

00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:38.763
that they no longer have
to compromise themselves

00:00:38.787 --> 00:00:41.427
just so they can fit in
with an uncompromising majority.

00:00:42.505 --> 00:00:44.099
It turns out that fashion,

00:00:44.123 --> 00:00:46.593
a discipline many of us
consider to be trivial,

00:00:46.617 --> 00:00:50.030
can actually be a powerful tool
for dismantling bias

00:00:50.054 --> 00:00:53.633
and bolstering the self-images
of underrepresented populations.

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:58.095
My interest in using design
as a vehicle for social change

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:59.595
happens to be a personal one.
