00:02:30.072 --> 00:02:32.231
Each of these culture-bending tapestries

00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:34.240
becomes a tailored garment

00:02:34.264 --> 00:02:38.201
or a silk scarf, like the one I am
very coincidentally wearing right now.

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:39.667
(Laughter)

00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:43.009
And even when surrounded
in a structure of European classicism,

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:46.897
these narratives boldly extoll
the merits of African empowerment.

00:02:47.798 --> 00:02:52.624
In this way, the tools of the masters
become masterworks

00:02:52.648 --> 00:02:55.004
to celebrate those
who were once subservient.

00:02:57.014 --> 00:02:59.241
This metaphor extends
beyond the realm of art

00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:01.145
and out into the real world.
