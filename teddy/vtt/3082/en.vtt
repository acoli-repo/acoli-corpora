It is often said that the stories
of history are written by its victors,

00:00:05.144 --> 00:00:06.456
but if this is true,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.528
what becomes of the downtrodden,

00:00:08.552 --> 00:00:11.330
and how can they ever hope
to aspire for something greater

00:00:11.354 --> 00:00:14.726

of their own glorious pasts?

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:22.792

I have found a higher calling.

00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:26.920

00:00:26.944 --> 00:00:30.047
I've discovered the importance
of providing representation
