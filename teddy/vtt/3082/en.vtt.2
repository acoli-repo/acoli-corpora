As a Nigerian American,
I know how easily the term "African"

00:01:03.358 --> 00:01:06.620
can slip from being
an ordinary geographic descriptor

00:01:06.644 --> 00:01:08.469
to becoming a pejorative.

00:01:09.686 --> 00:01:12.187
For those of us
from this beautiful continent,

00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:15.194
to be African is to be inspired by culture

00:01:15.218 --> 00:01:17.797
and to be filled with undying
hope for the future.

00:01:18.647 --> 00:01:23.228
So in an attempt to shift
the misguided perceptions that many have

00:01:23.252 --> 00:01:24.927
about the place of my birth,

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.847
I use design as a means to tell stories,

00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:29.409
stories about joy,

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:30.876
stories about triumph,
