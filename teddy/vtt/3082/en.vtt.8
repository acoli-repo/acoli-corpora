00:03:59.844 --> 00:04:01.724
while carrying ourselves with pride.

00:04:02.767 --> 00:04:05.158
It was indeed true
that the stories of history

00:04:05.182 --> 00:04:08.528
were told by its old victors,

00:04:08.552 --> 00:04:10.345
but I am of a new generation.

00:04:11.472 --> 00:04:12.912
My work speaks for those

00:04:12.936 --> 00:04:16.449
who will no longer let their futures
be dictated by a troubled past.

00:04:16.473 --> 00:04:20.028
Today, we stand ready
to tell our own stories

00:04:20.052 --> 00:04:22.845
without compromise, without apologies.

00:04:23.402 --> 00:04:25.052
But the question still remains:

00:04:25.957 --> 00:04:28.886
are you prepared
for what you are about to hear?
