00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.494
the fastest-growing job in the US
has been solar installer.

00:02:01.518 --> 00:02:05.527
The second-fastest has been
wind turbine technician.

00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:11.055
And the "Oxford Review of Economics,"
just a few weeks ago,

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:16.326
pointed the way to
a very jobs-rich recovery

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.463
if we emphasize renewable energy
and sustainability technology.

00:02:20.487 --> 00:02:23.986
So I think we are crossing
a tipping point,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.237
and you need only look
at the recovery plans

00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:30.178
that are being presented
in nations around the world
