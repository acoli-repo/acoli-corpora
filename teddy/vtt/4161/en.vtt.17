00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:30.237
and that even then, there's a chance
that we will end up with temperature rises

00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:34.678
more like two degrees Celsius
rather than 1.5?

00:08:34.702 --> 00:08:37.775
I mean, is that approximately
the big picture

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.077
of what the IPCC is recommending?

00:08:40.803 --> 00:08:42.083
AG: That's correct.

00:08:42.107 --> 00:08:46.872
The global goal established
in the Paris Conference

00:08:46.896 --> 00:08:49.821
is to get to net zero on a global basis

00:08:49.845 --> 00:08:51.359
by 2050,

00:08:51.383 --> 00:08:53.104
and many people quickly add

00:08:53.128 --> 00:08:58.456
that that really means a 45
to 50 percent reduction by 2030

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:03.101
to make that pathway
to net zero feasible.
