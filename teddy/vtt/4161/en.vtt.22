Angela Merkel, just 10 days ago,

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:04.288
with the leadership of
her minister Peter Altmaier,

00:11:04.312 --> 00:11:07.188
who is a good friend
and a great public servant,

00:11:07.212 --> 00:11:11.560
have just embarked on
a green hydrogen strategy

00:11:11.584 --> 00:11:14.180
to make hydrogen

00:11:14.204 --> 00:11:17.761
with zero marginal cost renewable energy.

00:11:17.785 --> 00:11:20.339
And just a word on that, Chris:

00:11:20.363 --> 00:11:25.045
you've heard about the intermittency
of wind and solar --

00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:28.223
solar doesn't produce electricity
when the sun's not shining,

00:11:28.247 --> 00:11:31.251
and wind doesn't
when the wind's not blowing --
