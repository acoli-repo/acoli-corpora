00:03:57.948 --> 00:04:01.068
and a range of other
sustainability approaches

00:04:01.092 --> 00:04:04.695
are continuing to fall in price,

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:08.167
and they're becoming
much more competitive.

00:04:08.191 --> 00:04:12.854
Just a quick reference
to how fast this is:

00:04:12.878 --> 00:04:15.903
five years ago, electricity
from solar and wind

00:04:15.927 --> 00:04:19.087
was cheaper than electricity
from fossil fuels

00:04:19.111 --> 00:04:20.891
in only one percent of the world.

00:04:20.915 --> 00:04:24.048
This year, it's cheaper
in two-thirds of the world,

00:04:24.072 --> 00:04:26.093
and five years from now,

00:04:26.117 --> 00:04:30.667
it will be cheaper in virtually
100 percent of the world.
