00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:38.292
and if these green recovery plans
are actually implemented,

00:03:38.316 --> 00:03:42.205
and I know many countries
are determined to implement them,

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.723
then we need not repeat that pattern.

00:03:45.747 --> 00:03:48.994
After all, this whole process is occurring

00:03:49.018 --> 00:03:55.938
during a period when
the cost of renewable energy

00:03:55.962 --> 00:03:57.924
and electric vehicles, batteries

00:03:57.948 --> 00:04:01.068
and a range of other
sustainability approaches
