00:11:28.247 --> 00:11:31.251
and wind doesn't
when the wind's not blowing --

00:11:31.275 --> 00:11:33.618
but batteries are getting better,

00:11:33.642 --> 00:11:37.711
and these technologies are becoming
much more efficient and powerful,

00:11:37.735 --> 00:11:41.598
so that for an increasing number
of hours of each day,

00:11:41.622 --> 00:11:46.825
they're producing often way more
electricity than can be used.

00:11:46.849 --> 00:11:48.298
So what to do with it?

00:11:48.322 --> 00:11:52.641
The marginal cost
for the next kilowatt-hour is zero.

00:11:52.665 --> 00:11:53.826
So all of a sudden,

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:59.007
the very energy-intensive process
of cracking hydrogen from water

00:11:59.031 --> 00:12:01.490
becomes economically feasible,
