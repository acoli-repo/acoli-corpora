00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:32.019
caused by the pandemic

00:05:32.043 --> 00:05:35.291
isn't that much more than, actually,
the fall that we will need

00:05:35.315 --> 00:05:37.132
every single year

00:05:37.156 --> 00:05:40.406
if we're to meet emissions targets.

00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:42.840
Is that true, and, if so,

00:05:42.864 --> 00:05:45.080
doesn't that seem impossibly daunting?

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.445
AG: It does seem daunting,
but first look at the number.

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.769
That number came from a study
a little over a year ago

00:05:51.793 --> 00:05:54.483
released by the IPCC

00:05:54.507 --> 00:05:59.755
as to what it would take to keep
the Earth's temperatures from increasing

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:02.941
more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.
