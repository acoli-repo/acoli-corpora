00:09:28.774 --> 00:09:30.768
but close, yes.

00:09:31.806 --> 00:09:36.926
CA: So it is something like the effect
that we've experienced this year

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.166
may be necessary.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.247
This year, we've done it
by basically shutting down the economy.

00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:45.321
You're talking about a way of doing it
over the coming years

00:09:45.345 --> 00:09:49.217
that actually gives some
economic growth and new jobs.

00:09:49.241 --> 00:09:50.948
So talk more about that.

00:09:50.972 --> 00:09:54.131
You've referred to
changing our energy sources,

00:09:54.155 --> 00:09:55.969
changing how we transport.

00:09:55.993 --> 00:09:57.680
If we did those things,

00:09:57.704 --> 00:10:00.467
how much of the problem does that solve?
