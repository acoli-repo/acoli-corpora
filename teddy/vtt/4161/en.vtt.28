but also hydrogen could be essential

00:14:00.801 --> 00:14:05.715
for some of the other processes
in the economy like making steel,

00:14:05.739 --> 00:14:06.912
making cement,

00:14:06.936 --> 00:14:11.458
that are fundamentally
carbon-intensive processes right now

00:14:11.482 --> 00:14:14.860
but could be transformed if we had
much cheaper sources of hydrogen.

00:14:14.884 --> 00:14:16.050
Is that right?

00:14:16.377 --> 00:14:20.652
AG: Yes, I was always skeptical
about hydrogen, Chris,

00:14:20.676 --> 00:14:25.099
principally because it's been
so expensive to make it,

00:14:25.123 --> 00:14:27.948
to "crack it out of water," as they say.

00:14:27.972 --> 00:14:30.455
But the game-changer has been
