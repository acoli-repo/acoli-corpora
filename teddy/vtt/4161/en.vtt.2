Another similarity, by the way,

00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:06.478
is that the climate crisis,
like the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:01:06.502 --> 00:01:09.341
has revealed in a new way

00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:14.221
the shocking injustices
and inequalities and disparities

00:01:14.245 --> 00:01:17.644
that affect communities of color

00:01:17.668 --> 00:01:20.277
and low-income communities.

00:01:20.874 --> 00:01:22.453
There are differences.

00:01:22.477 --> 00:01:27.464
The climate crisis has effects
that are not measured in years,

00:01:27.488 --> 00:01:29.572
as the pandemic is,

00:01:29.596 --> 00:01:33.942
but consequences that are measured
in centuries and even longer.
