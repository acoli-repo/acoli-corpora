00:07:58.951 --> 00:08:03.154
about 55 gigatons of what
they call "CO2 equivalent,"

00:08:03.178 --> 00:08:05.062
so that includes other greenhouse gases

00:08:05.086 --> 00:08:09.193
like methane dialed up
to be the equivalent of CO2.

00:08:09.217 --> 00:08:11.859
And am I right in saying that the IPCC,

00:08:11.883 --> 00:08:15.044
which is the global
organization of scientists,

00:08:15.068 --> 00:08:19.991
is recommending that
the only way to fix this crisis

00:08:20.015 --> 00:08:22.726
is to get that number from 55 to zero

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.845
by 2050 at the very latest,

00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:30.237
and that even then, there's a chance
that we will end up with temperature rises
