which was during the Balkan Wars.

00:02:00.844 --> 00:02:02.060
I was young then.

00:02:02.084 --> 00:02:04.623
It was about 25 years ago.

00:02:04.647 --> 00:02:10.428
And what we faced was the wholesale
violation, not just of human rights,

00:02:10.452 --> 00:02:13.431
but all the way to ethnic
cleansing and genocide,

00:02:13.455 --> 00:02:17.461
and that has been adjudicated
in the highest war crimes court

00:02:17.485 --> 00:02:18.649
in the world.

00:02:18.673 --> 00:02:20.326
So, we know what we were seeing.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.887
Trying to tell the world
what we were seeing

00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:25.686
brought us accusations of bias,

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.599
of siding with one side,

00:02:27.623 --> 00:02:29.485
of not seeing the whole side,

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:31.806
and just, you know,
trying to tell one story.
