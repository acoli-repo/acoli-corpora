00:04:57.456 --> 00:05:01.432
So we journalists,
who only seek the truth --

00:05:01.456 --> 00:05:02.977
I mean, that is our mission --

00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:05.118
we go around the world
looking for the truth

00:05:05.142 --> 00:05:07.115
in order to be everybody's eyes and ears,

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.658
people who can't go out
in various parts of the world

00:05:09.682 --> 00:05:13.051
to figure out what's going on
about things that are vitally important

00:05:13.075 --> 00:05:15.031
to everybody's health and security.

00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:21.741
So when you have a major world leader
accusing you of fake news,

00:05:21.765 --> 00:05:25.608
it has an exponential ripple effect.

00:05:25.632 --> 00:05:29.904
And what it does is,
it starts to chip away
