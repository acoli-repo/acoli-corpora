00:13:28.497 --> 00:13:30.675
who actually abides by the constitution

00:13:30.699 --> 00:13:34.311
and gives up power
after her prescribed term.

00:13:34.335 --> 00:13:38.192
She has said she wants
to do that as a lesson.

00:13:38.216 --> 00:13:40.248
But when I asked her about leadership,

00:13:40.272 --> 00:13:42.955
and I gave a quick-fire round
of certain names,

00:13:42.979 --> 00:13:45.956
I presented her with the name
of the new French president,

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.413
Emmanuel Macron.

00:13:47.437 --> 00:13:48.773
And she said --

00:13:48.797 --> 00:13:51.303
I said, "So what do you think
when I say his name?"

00:13:51.327 --> 00:13:52.600
And she said,

00:13:53.578 --> 00:13:55.903
"Shaping up potentially to be

00:13:55.927 --> 00:13:59.993
a leader to fill our current
leadership vacuum."
