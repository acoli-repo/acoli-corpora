00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.347
was actually not to do anything --

00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:01.788
not to step in,

00:03:01.812 --> 00:03:03.382
not to change the situation,

00:03:03.406 --> 00:03:04.855
not to find a solution.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.232
And so, their fake news at that time,

00:03:07.256 --> 00:03:08.638
their lie at that time --

00:03:08.662 --> 00:03:12.192
including our government's,
our democratically elected government's,

00:03:12.216 --> 00:03:14.488
with values and principles
of human rights --

00:03:14.512 --> 00:03:18.019
their lie was to say
that all sides are equally guilty,

00:03:18.043 --> 00:03:20.836
that this has been centuries
of ethnic hatred,

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.742
whereas we knew that wasn't true,

00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:26.413
that one side had decided to kill,
slaughter and ethnically cleanse

00:03:26.437 --> 00:03:27.594
another side.

00:03:27.618 --> 00:03:29.114
So that is where, for me,

00:03:29.138 --> 00:03:34.444
I understood that objectivity means
giving all sides an equal hearing
