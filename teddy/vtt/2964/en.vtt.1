00:00:28.358 --> 00:00:31.369
and to be able to get to the truth
of what we're talking about

00:00:31.393 --> 00:00:33.485
in order to really be able to solve it.

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:37.436
So if 99.9 percent
of the science on climate

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.517
is empirical, scientific evidence,

00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:45.436
but it's competing almost equally
with a handful of deniers,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.687
that is not the truth;

00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:49.209
that is the epitome of fake news.

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:54.335
And so for me, the last few years --
certainly this last year --

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.619
has crystallized the notion of fake news
in a way that's truly alarming

00:00:58.643 --> 00:01:01.302
and not just some slogan
to be thrown around.
