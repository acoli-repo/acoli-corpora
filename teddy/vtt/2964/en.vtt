Chris Anderson: Christiane,
great to have you here.

00:00:03.292 --> 00:00:05.135
So you've had this amazing viewpoint,

00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:08.219
and perhaps it's fair to say
that in the last few years,

00:00:08.243 --> 00:00:11.996
there have been some alarming
developments that you're seeing.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.584
What's alarmed you most?

00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:16.800
Christiane Amanpour: Well, just listening
to the earlier speakers,

00:00:16.824 --> 00:00:19.296
I can frame it
in what they've been saying:

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.742
climate change, for instance --
cities, the threat to our environment

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:24.026
and our lives.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.334
It basically also boils down to
understanding the truth

00:00:28.358 --> 00:00:31.369
and to be able to get to the truth
of what we're talking about
