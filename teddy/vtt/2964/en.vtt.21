00:10:29.215 --> 00:10:30.458
with this avenue.

00:10:30.482 --> 00:10:32.964
And what have we just learned
in the last few weeks?

00:10:32.988 --> 00:10:35.946
That, actually, there has been
a major problem in that regard,

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.088
and now they're having to investigate it
and figure it out.

00:10:39.112 --> 00:10:42.391
Yes, they're trying to do
what they can now

00:10:42.415 --> 00:10:44.573
to prevent the rise of fake news,

00:10:44.597 --> 00:10:45.980
but, you know,

00:10:46.004 --> 00:10:51.095
it went pretty unrestricted
for a long, long time.

00:10:51.119 --> 00:10:53.019
So I guess I would say, you know,

00:10:53.043 --> 00:10:55.142
you guys are brilliant at technology;

00:10:55.166 --> 00:10:57.057
let's figure out another algorithm.

00:10:57.081 --> 00:10:58.252
Can we not?

00:10:58.276 --> 00:11:01.163

journalistic investigation --
