00:12:28.449 --> 00:12:31.141
I speak for myself,
I don't know if others feel this --

00:12:31.165 --> 00:12:33.161
there's kind of been a disappointment of:

00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:35.044
Where are the leaders?

00:12:35.068 --> 00:12:37.382
So many of us have been disappointed --

00:12:37.406 --> 00:12:39.422
Aung San Suu Kyi,
what's happened recently,

00:12:39.446 --> 00:12:41.531
it's like, "No! Another one
bites the dust."

00:12:41.555 --> 00:12:43.154
You know, it's heartbreaking.

00:12:43.178 --> 00:12:44.413
(Laughter)

00:12:44.437 --> 00:12:46.458
Who have you met

00:12:46.482 --> 00:12:49.352
who you have been
impressed by, inspired by?

00:12:49.376 --> 00:12:51.880
CA: Well, you talk about
the world in crisis,

00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:53.258
which is absolutely true,

00:12:53.282 --> 00:12:57.769
and those of us who spend our whole lives
immersed in this crisis --

00:12:57.793 --> 00:13:00.786
I mean, we're all on the verge
of a nervous breakdown.
