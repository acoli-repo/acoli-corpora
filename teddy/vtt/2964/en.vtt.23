00:11:28.618 --> 00:11:30.062
And this is a --

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:33.673
this is what they've decided to do.

00:11:33.697 --> 00:11:35.302
It worked in the United States,

00:11:35.326 --> 00:11:36.647
it didn't work in France,

00:11:36.671 --> 00:11:38.344
it hasn't worked in Germany.

00:11:38.368 --> 00:11:41.309
During the elections there,
where they've tried to interfere,

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:43.935
the president of France
right now, Emmanuel Macron,

00:11:43.959 --> 00:11:46.482
took a very tough stand
and confronted it head on,

00:11:46.506 --> 00:11:47.664
as did Angela Merkel.

00:11:47.688 --> 00:11:50.673
CH: There's some hope to be had
from some of this, isn't there?

00:11:50.697 --> 00:11:51.848
That the world learns.

00:11:51.872 --> 00:11:53.190
We get fooled once,

00:11:53.214 --> 00:11:54.546
maybe we get fooled again,

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.025
but maybe not the third time.

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:57.217
Is that true?

00:11:57.241 --> 00:11:58.397
CA: I mean, let's hope.

00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:01.808
But I think in this regard that so much
of it is also about technology,
