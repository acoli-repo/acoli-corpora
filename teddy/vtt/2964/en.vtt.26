00:12:57.793 --> 00:13:00.786
I mean, we're all on the verge
of a nervous breakdown.

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:03.486
So it's pretty stressful right now.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.669
And you're right --

00:13:04.693 --> 00:13:07.803
there is this perceived and actual
vacuum of leadership,

00:13:07.827 --> 00:13:10.677
and it's not me saying it,
I ask all these --

00:13:10.701 --> 00:13:13.154
whoever I'm talking to,
I ask about leadership.

00:13:13.178 --> 00:13:17.688
I was speaking to the outgoing

00:13:17.712 --> 00:13:19.522
[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,]

00:13:19.546 --> 00:13:20.700
who --

00:13:20.724 --> 00:13:22.939
(Applause)

00:13:22.963 --> 00:13:24.505
in three weeks' time,

00:13:24.529 --> 00:13:28.473
will be one of the very rare
heads of an African country

00:13:28.497 --> 00:13:30.675
who actually abides by the constitution
