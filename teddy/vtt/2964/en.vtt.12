CH: I mean, someone a couple years ago
looking at the avalanche of information

00:06:02.662 --> 00:06:05.898
pouring through Twitter
and Facebook and so forth,

00:06:05.922 --> 00:06:07.080
might have said,

00:06:07.104 --> 00:06:09.945
"Look, our democracies are healthier
than they've ever been.

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:11.490
There's more news than ever.

00:06:11.514 --> 00:06:13.725
Of course presidents
will say what they'll say,

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:15.982
but everyone else can say
what they will say.

00:06:16.006 --> 00:06:20.161
What's not to like?
How is there an extra danger?"

00:06:20.185 --> 00:06:21.727
CA: So, I wish that was true.

00:06:22.992 --> 00:06:29.085
I wish that the proliferation of platforms
upon which we get our information

00:06:29.109 --> 00:06:32.987
meant that there was a proliferation
of truth and transparency
