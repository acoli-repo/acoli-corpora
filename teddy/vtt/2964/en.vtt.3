you said, "Look, there are some situations
one simply cannot be neutral about,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.880
because when you're neutral,

00:01:37.904 --> 00:01:39.791
you are an accomplice."

00:01:41.243 --> 00:01:46.140
So, do you feel that today's journalists
aren't heeding that advice

00:01:46.164 --> 00:01:47.636
about balance?

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.766
CA: Well, look, I think for journalists,
objectivity is the golden rule.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.206
But I think sometimes we don't understand
what objectivity means.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.224
And I actually learned this very,
very young in my career,

00:01:59.248 --> 00:02:00.820
which was during the Balkan Wars.
