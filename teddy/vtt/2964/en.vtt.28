00:14:00.017 --> 00:14:01.850
I thought that was really interesting.

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:04.330
Yesterday, I happened to have
an interview with him.

00:14:04.354 --> 00:14:05.512
I'm very proud to say,

00:14:05.536 --> 00:14:08.955
I got his first international interview.
It was great. It was yesterday.

00:14:08.979 --> 00:14:10.271
And I was really impressed.

00:14:10.295 --> 00:14:13.223
I don't know whether I should be
saying that in an open forum,

00:14:13.247 --> 00:14:14.702
but I was really impressed.

00:14:14.726 --> 00:14:15.944
(Laughter)

00:14:16.867 --> 00:14:19.542
And it could be just because
it was his first interview,

00:14:19.566 --> 00:14:21.661
but -- I asked questions,
and you know what?

00:14:21.685 --> 00:14:22.893
He answered them!

00:14:22.917 --> 00:14:24.850
(Laughter)

00:14:24.874 --> 00:14:28.143
(Applause)

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:29.760
There was no spin,

00:14:29.784 --> 00:14:32.175
there was no wiggle and waggle,
