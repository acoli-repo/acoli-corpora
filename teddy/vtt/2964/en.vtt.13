00:06:29.109 --> 00:06:32.987
meant that there was a proliferation
of truth and transparency

00:06:33.011 --> 00:06:34.879
and depth and accuracy.

00:06:34.903 --> 00:06:37.358
But I think the opposite has happened.

00:06:37.382 --> 00:06:39.472
You know, I'm a little bit of a Luddite,

00:06:39.496 --> 00:06:40.692
I will confess.

00:06:41.147 --> 00:06:44.531
Even when we started to talk about
the information superhighway,

00:06:44.555 --> 00:06:46.183
which was a long time ago,

00:06:46.207 --> 00:06:48.858
before social media, Twitter
and all the rest of it,

00:06:48.882 --> 00:06:50.706
I was actually really afraid

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.751
that that would put people
into certain lanes and tunnels

00:06:54.775 --> 00:06:59.117
and have them just focusing
on areas of their own interest

00:06:59.141 --> 00:07:01.474
instead of seeing the broad picture.
