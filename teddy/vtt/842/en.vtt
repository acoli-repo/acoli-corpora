00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.976
A few years ago,
I felt like I was stuck in a rut,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.976
so I decided to follow in the footsteps

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.536
of the great American
philosopher, Morgan Spurlock,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.976
and try something new for 30 days.

00:00:13.523 --> 00:00:15.276
The idea is actually pretty simple.

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:18.676
Think about something you've always
wanted to add to your life

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.976
and try it for the next 30 days.

00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:25.291
It turns out 30 days is just
about the right amount of time

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:28.007
to add a new habit or subtract a habit --

00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:29.276
like watching the news --

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.976
from your life.
