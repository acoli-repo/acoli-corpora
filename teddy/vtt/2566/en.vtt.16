00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:00.074
And you know, to a certain extent,

00:08:00.098 --> 00:08:03.736
there are other people out there
who are taking care of things for us.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.441
The government has all this regulation
and bureaucracy around things

00:08:07.465 --> 00:08:09.698
like burying a death, for example,

00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:11.691
and there's people like funeral directors

00:08:11.715 --> 00:08:14.311
who devote their entire
working lives to this issue.

00:08:14.335 --> 00:08:15.841
But when it comes to our cities

00:08:15.865 --> 00:08:18.907
and thinking about how
death fits in our cities,

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:22.980
there's much less regulation
and design and thought

00:08:23.004 --> 00:08:24.320
than we might imagine.

00:08:24.344 --> 00:08:26.558
So we're not thinking about this,

00:08:26.582 --> 00:08:29.482
but all of the people we imagine
are thinking about it --

00:08:29.506 --> 00:08:31.551
they're not taking care of it either.
