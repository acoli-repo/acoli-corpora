But what if I've got a piece of land

00:05:37.374 --> 00:05:40.692

00:05:41.533 --> 00:05:45.152
Well, then -- actually, I don't need
permission from anyone!

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.216
There's actually almost no regulation
in the UK around burial,

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.883
and the little bit that there is,
is about not polluting water courses,

00:05:53.907 --> 00:05:56.517
like not polluting rivers or groundwater.

00:05:56.962 --> 00:05:59.986
So actually, if you want to go
and make your own mini-cemetery,
