00:04:29.103 --> 00:04:31.754
But anyway, the council granted
these people permission,

00:04:31.778 --> 00:04:34.229
and they're now trying
to build their cemetery.

00:04:34.253 --> 00:04:37.573
So just to explain to you
kind of how this works:

00:04:37.597 --> 00:04:39.654
If I want to build something in the UK,

00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:41.870
like a cemetery for example,

00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:44.868
then I have to apply
for planning permission first.

00:04:44.892 --> 00:04:49.102
So if I want to build a new
office building for a client

00:04:49.126 --> 00:04:51.380
or if I want to extend my home

00:04:51.404 --> 00:04:55.173
or, you know, if I have a shop
and I want to convert it into an office,

00:04:55.197 --> 00:04:56.728
I have to do a load of drawings,

00:04:56.752 --> 00:04:59.188
and I submit them
to the council for permission.

00:04:59.212 --> 00:05:03.169
And they'll look at things like
how it fits in the surroundings.
