00:04:59.212 --> 00:05:03.169
And they'll look at things like
how it fits in the surroundings.

00:05:03.193 --> 00:05:05.225
So they'll look at what it looks like.

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:08.845
But they'll also think about things
like what impact is it going to have

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:10.344
on the local environment?

00:05:10.368 --> 00:05:12.408
And they'll be thinking about things like,

00:05:12.432 --> 00:05:14.273
is this thing going to cause pollution

00:05:14.297 --> 00:05:16.225
or is there going to be a lot of traffic

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:18.582
that wants to go to this thing
that I've built?

00:05:18.606 --> 00:05:19.986
But also good things.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.327
Is it going to add local services
like shops to the neighborhood

00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:25.413
that local people would like to use?

00:05:26.183 --> 00:05:28.877
And they'll weigh up the advantages
and the disadvantages

00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:30.337
and they'll make a decision.
