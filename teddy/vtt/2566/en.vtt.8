00:03:58.802 --> 00:04:03.561
But just to come back to this idea
of making profit from cemeteries,

00:04:03.585 --> 00:04:05.655
like, it's kind of ludicrous, right?

00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:09.780
The thing is that the high cost
of those burial plots

00:04:09.804 --> 00:04:11.920
is actually very misleading.

00:04:11.944 --> 00:04:13.731
They look like they're expensive,

00:04:13.755 --> 00:04:17.957
but that cost reflects the fact that
you need to maintain the burial plot --

00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:21.289
like, someone has to cut the grass
for the next 50 years.

00:04:21.313 --> 00:04:24.210
That means it's very difficult
to make money from cemeteries.

00:04:24.234 --> 00:04:27.059
And it's the reason that normally
they're run by the council

00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:29.079
or by a not-for-profit group.

00:04:29.103 --> 00:04:31.754
But anyway, the council granted
these people permission,
