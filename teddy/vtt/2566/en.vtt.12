00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.305
then you can.

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:04.757
But I mean, like -- really,
who does this? Right?

00:06:06.011 --> 00:06:09.629
Well, if you're an aristocratic family
and you have a large estate,

00:06:09.653 --> 00:06:12.336
then there's a chance that you'll
have a mausoleum on it,

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.169
and you'll bury your family there.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:16.867
But the really weird thing

00:06:16.891 --> 00:06:20.260
is that you don't need to have
a piece of land of a certain size

00:06:20.284 --> 00:06:22.886
before you're allowed
to start burying people on it.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.855
And so that means that, technically,

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:28.568
this applies to, like, the back garden
of your house in the suburbs.

00:06:28.592 --> 00:06:29.921
