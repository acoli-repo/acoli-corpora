00:02:29.896 --> 00:02:31.697
So they came up with a few solutions.

00:02:31.721 --> 00:02:35.764
They were like, well, maybe we can
reuse those graves after 50 years.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:38.101
Or maybe we can bury people,
like, four deep,

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:41.113
so that four people can be buried
in the same plot,

00:02:41.137 --> 00:02:43.780
and we can make more efficient use
of the land that way,

00:02:43.804 --> 00:02:47.144
and in that way, hopefully London
will still have space to bury people

00:02:47.168 --> 00:02:48.319
in the near future.

00:02:49.106 --> 00:02:51.768
But, traditionally, cemeteries
haven't been taken care of

00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:53.532
by the local authority.

00:02:53.556 --> 00:02:56.922
In fact, the surprising thing is that
there's no legal obligation

00:02:56.946 --> 00:02:59.975
on anyone in the UK
to provide burial space.
