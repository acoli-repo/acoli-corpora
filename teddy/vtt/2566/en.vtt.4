00:01:59.572 --> 00:02:03.512
But the UK, like many
Western European countries,

00:02:03.536 --> 00:02:05.211
is running out of burial space,

00:02:05.235 --> 00:02:07.115
especially in the major cities.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.186
And the Greater London Authority
has been aware of this for a while,

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.678
and the main causes are population growth,

00:02:14.702 --> 00:02:17.543
the fact that existing
cemeteries are almost full.

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:21.874
There's a custom in the UK that graves
are considered to be occupied forever,

00:02:21.898 --> 00:02:25.625
and there's also development pressure --
people want to use that same land

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:29.208
to build houses or offices or shops.

00:02:29.896 --> 00:02:31.697
So they came up with a few solutions.
