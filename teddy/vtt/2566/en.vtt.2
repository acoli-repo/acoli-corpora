00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.215
on death and architecture in Venice,

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.119
and it was called "Death in Venice."

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:06.564
And because death is a subject

00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:09.645
that many of us find quite
uncomfortable to talk about,

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:11.994
the exhibition was designed
to be quite playful,

00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:14.517
so that people would
literally engage with it.

00:01:14.882 --> 00:01:18.427
So one of our exhibits
was an interactive map of London

00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:21.469
which showed just how much
of the real estate in the city

00:01:21.493 --> 00:01:23.443
is given over to death.

00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:25.649
As you wave your hand across the map,

00:01:25.673 --> 00:01:29.178
the name of the piece of real estate --
the building or the cemetery --

00:01:29.202 --> 00:01:30.352
is revealed.
