What makes a great leader today?

00:00:05.231 --> 00:00:07.874
Many of us carry this image

00:00:07.874 --> 00:00:11.194
of this all-knowing superhero

00:00:11.194 --> 00:00:13.642
who stands and commands

00:00:13.642 --> 00:00:17.271
and protects his followers.

00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:21.567
But that's kind of an image from another time,

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:23.818
and what's also outdated

00:00:23.818 --> 00:00:26.220
are the leadership development programs

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.603
that are based on success models

00:00:28.603 --> 00:00:32.785
for a world that was, not a world that is
