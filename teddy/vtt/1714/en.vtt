Do you know these books, these such and such "For Dummies?"

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
My daughters pointed out that I'm very similar looking, so this is a bit of a problem.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But I was looking online at Amazon.com for other books like this.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You know, there's also something called the "Complete Idiot's Guide?"

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
There's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We like to have technology make us feel bad, for some strange reason.
