00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.430
there is no telling my mama to be "quiet,"

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.930
my mama don't know "quiet."

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.500
her voice is one size better fit all

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.570
and you best not tell her to hush,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.400
she waited too many years for her 
voice to arrive

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.090
to be told it needed house keeping.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.840
English sits in her mouth remixed

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.820
so "strawberry" becomes "eh-strawbeddy"

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.130
and "cookie" becomes "eh-cookie"

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.850
and kitchen, key chain, and chicken 
all sound the same.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.720
my mama doesn't say "yes"

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.678
she says, "ah ha"
