00:00:00.874 --> 00:00:02.184
I'm Denice Frohman,

00:00:02.184 --> 00:00:05.183
and this is "Accents."

00:00:07.443 --> 00:00:11.899
my mom holds her accent like a shotgun,

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:14.570
with two good hands.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.300
her tongue, all brass knuckle

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.880
slipping in between her lips

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.260
her hips, are all laughter and wind clap.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.850
she speaks a sanchocho 
of spanish and english,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.560
pushing up and against one another,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.550
in rapid fire

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.430
there is no telling my mama to be "quiet,"
