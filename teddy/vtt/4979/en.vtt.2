00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.678
she says, "ah ha"

00:01:00.678 --> 00:01:05.168
and suddenly the sky in her mouth 
becomes a Hector Lavoe song.

00:01:05.171 --> 00:01:08.051
her tongue can't lay itself 
down flat enough

00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:09.891
for the English language,

00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:11.441
it got too much hip

00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:12.641
too much bone

00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:13.901
too much conga

00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:14.731
too much cuatro

00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:15.701

00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:17.101
got too many piano keys

00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:18.511

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.081

00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:21.571
too much hand clap

00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:23.851
got too much salsa to sit still

00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:26.291
it be an anxious child wanting to

00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:29.291
make Play-Doh out of concrete

00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:30.981
English be too neat for
