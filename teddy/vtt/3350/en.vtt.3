However, he also estimated

00:01:35.103 --> 00:01:39.855
that these effects were so minute,

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:42.455
that it would never be possible
to measure them.

00:01:43.323 --> 00:01:45.629
I'm going to tell you the story of how,

00:01:45.653 --> 00:01:52.113
with the work of hundreds of scientists
working in many countries

00:01:52.137 --> 00:01:53.923
over the course of many decades,

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:57.556
