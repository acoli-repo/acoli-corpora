00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:32.643
wrinkles the flexible fabric
of space-time.

00:00:33.128 --> 00:00:37.462
Space-time is this thing in which we live
and that connects us all.

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:42.801
It's like when we lie down on a mattress
and distort its contour.

00:00:43.938 --> 00:00:48.870
The masses move -- again,
not according to Newton's laws,

00:00:48.894 --> 00:00:52.801
but because they see
this space-time curvature

00:00:52.825 --> 00:00:55.648
and follow the little curves,

00:00:55.672 --> 00:00:59.236
just like when our bedmate
nestles up to us

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.572
because of the mattress curvature.
