00:05:59.237 --> 00:06:02.078
we can distinguish them
from the local effects,

00:06:02.102 --> 00:06:05.182
which appear separately,
either on one or the other.

00:06:07.323 --> 00:06:10.075
In September of 2015,

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:15.068
we were finishing installing
the second-generation technology

00:06:15.092 --> 00:06:16.644
in the detectors,

00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:21.708
and we still weren't at the optimal
sensitivity that we wanted --

00:06:21.732 --> 00:06:25.104
we're still not, even now,
two years later --

00:06:25.128 --> 00:06:27.655
but we wanted to gather data.

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:29.695
We didn't think we'd see anything,

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:33.345
but we were getting ready to start
collecting a few months' worth of data.
