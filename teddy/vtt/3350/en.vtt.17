00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:30.592
I'd like you to listen
to the first two notes of that music.

00:08:31.102 --> 00:08:33.362
(Chirping sound)

00:08:34.448 --> 00:08:36.576
(Chirping sound)

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.466
The second, shorter sound
was the last fraction of a second

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.284
of the two black holes which,

00:08:43.308 --> 00:08:48.238
in that fraction of a second,
emitted vast amounts of energy --

00:08:48.262 --> 00:08:54.913
so much energy, it was like three Suns
converting into energy,

00:08:54.937 --> 00:08:56.513
following that famous formula,

00:08:56.537 --> 00:08:58.294
E = mc2.

00:08:58.318 --> 00:08:59.569
Remember that one?
