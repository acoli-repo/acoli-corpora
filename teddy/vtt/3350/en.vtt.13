00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:33.345
but we were getting ready to start
collecting a few months' worth of data.

00:06:33.924 --> 00:06:36.797
And then nature surprised us.

00:06:37.454 --> 00:06:41.737
On September 14, 2015,

00:06:41.761 --> 00:06:44.823
we saw, in both detectors,

00:06:44.847 --> 00:06:47.026
a gravitational wave.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.522
In both detectors, we saw a signal

00:06:49.546 --> 00:06:52.558
with cycles that increased
in amplitude and frequency

00:06:52.582 --> 00:06:53.835
and then go back down.

00:06:53.859 --> 00:06:57.291
And they were the same in both detectors.

00:06:57.315 --> 00:06:59.315
They were gravitational waves.
