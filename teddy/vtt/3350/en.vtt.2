because of the mattress curvature.

A year later, in 1916,

00:01:07.809 --> 00:01:12.200
Einstein derived from his theory

00:01:12.224 --> 00:01:16.037
that gravitational waves existed,

00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:19.196
and that these waves were produced
when masses move,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.025
like, for example, when two stars
revolve around one another

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.009
and create folds in space-time
which carry energy from the system,

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:31.500
and the stars move toward each other.
