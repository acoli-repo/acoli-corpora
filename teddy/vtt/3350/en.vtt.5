It started slowly,

00:02:30.736 --> 00:02:33.838
but as they emitted gravitational waves,

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:36.801
they grew closer together,
accelerating in speed,

00:02:36.825 --> 00:02:40.424
until, when they were revolving
at almost the speed of light,

00:02:40.448 --> 00:02:43.643
they fused into a single black hole

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:47.301
that had 60 times the mass of the Sun,

00:02:47.325 --> 00:02:51.827
but compressed
into the space of 360 kilometers.

00:02:51.851 --> 00:02:54.862
That's the size of the state of Louisiana,

00:02:54.886 --> 00:02:56.146
where I live.

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:02.265
This incredible effect
