that they came from black holes

fusing together to make one,

00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:14.312
more than a billion years ago.

00:07:15.613 --> 00:07:16.796
And that was --

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:23.379
(Applause)

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:26.339

00:07:26.994 --> 00:07:30.473
At first, we couldn't believe it.
