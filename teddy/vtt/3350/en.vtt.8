00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.935
the effect is infinitesimal.

00:04:01.443 --> 00:04:05.941
For example, the distance
between the Earth and the Sun

00:04:05.965 --> 00:04:10.413
changed by one atomic diameter.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.878
How can that be measured?

00:04:12.902 --> 00:04:14.953
How could we measure it?

00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:18.929
Fifty years ago,

00:04:18.953 --> 00:04:22.507
some visionary physicists
at Caltech and MIT --

00:04:23.181 --> 00:04:25.886
Kip Thorne, Ron Drever, Rai Weiss --

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.956
thought they could precisely
measure distances

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.163
using lasers that measured
distances between mirrors
