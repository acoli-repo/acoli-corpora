00:03:29.887 --> 00:03:31.887
which was in 2015,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.791
they produced changes in all distances --

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:40.431
the distances between all of you,
the distances between you and me,

00:03:40.455 --> 00:03:41.651
our heights --

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:45.325
every one of us
stretched and shrank a tiny bit.

00:03:46.303 --> 00:03:50.227
The prediction is that the effect
is proportional to the distance.

00:03:50.904 --> 00:03:52.694
But it's very small:

00:03:52.718 --> 00:03:57.576
even for distances much greater
than my slight height,

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.935
the effect is infinitesimal.
