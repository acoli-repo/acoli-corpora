A little over 100 years ago, in 1915,

00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:09.746
Einstein published
his theory of general relativity,

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.004
which is sort of a strange name,

00:00:12.028 --> 00:00:14.690
but it's a theory that explains gravity.

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:19.713
It states that mass -- all matter,
the planets -- attracts mass,

00:00:19.737 --> 00:00:24.351
not because of an instantaneous force,
as Newton claimed,

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:28.338
but because all matter --
all of us, all the planets --

00:00:28.362 --> 00:00:32.643
wrinkles the flexible fabric
of space-time.
