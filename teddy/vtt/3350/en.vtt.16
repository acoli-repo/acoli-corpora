over four kilometers.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.504
Yes, the second detection was smaller,

00:08:06.528 --> 00:08:10.797
but still very convincing
by our standards.

00:08:13.064 --> 00:08:17.588
Despite the fact that these are space-time
waves and not sound waves,

00:08:17.612 --> 00:08:21.697
we like to put them into loudspeakers
and listen to them.

00:08:22.315 --> 00:08:25.049
We call this "the music of the universe."

00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:30.592
I'd like you to listen
to the first two notes of that music.
