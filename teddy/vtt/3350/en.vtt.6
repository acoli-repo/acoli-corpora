00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:02.265
This incredible effect
produced gravitational waves

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:08.298
that carried the news of this cosmic hug
to the rest of the universe.

00:03:09.893 --> 00:03:16.803
It took us a long time to figure out
the effects of these gravitational waves,

00:03:16.827 --> 00:03:23.566
because the way we measure them
is by looking for effects in distances.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.706
We want to measure longitudes, distances.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.863
When these gravitational waves
passed by Earth,

00:03:29.887 --> 00:03:31.887
which was in 2015,
