00:04:59.307 --> 00:05:02.990
Each one is four kilometers long;

00:05:03.014 --> 00:05:07.612
one is in Livingston, Louisiana,

00:05:07.636 --> 00:05:09.886
in the middle of a beautiful forest,

00:05:10.592 --> 00:05:14.420
and the other is in Hanford, Washington,

00:05:14.444 --> 00:05:16.230
in the middle of the desert.

00:05:17.094 --> 00:05:20.179
The interferometers have lasers

00:05:20.203 --> 00:05:24.129
that travel from the center
through four kilometers in-vacuum,

00:05:24.153 --> 00:05:26.994
are reflected in mirrors
and then they return.

00:05:27.018 --> 00:05:29.662
We measure the difference in the distances

00:05:29.686 --> 00:05:31.514
between this arm and this arm.
