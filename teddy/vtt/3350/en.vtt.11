00:05:29.686 --> 00:05:31.514
between this arm and this arm.

00:05:32.546 --> 00:05:36.747
These detectors are very,
very, very sensitive;

00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:40.211
they're the most precise
instruments in the world.

00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:42.706
Why did we make two?

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:48.329
It's because the signals
that we want to measure come from space,

00:05:48.353 --> 00:05:50.818
but the mirrors are moving all the time,

00:05:50.842 --> 00:05:54.845
so in order to distinguish
the gravitational wave effects --

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:59.213
which are astrophysical effects
and should show up on the two detectors --

00:05:59.237 --> 00:06:02.078
we can distinguish them
from the local effects,
