00:10:58.131 --> 00:11:01.532
(Applause)

00:11:01.556 --> 00:11:03.556
But are they useful?

00:11:04.325 --> 00:11:08.848
Can't we derive any technology
from gravitational waves?

00:11:09.507 --> 00:11:11.016
Yes, probably.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.628
But it will probably take a lot of time.

00:11:13.652 --> 00:11:16.316
We've developed
the technology to detect them,

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.377
but in terms of the waves themselves,

00:11:18.401 --> 00:11:22.661
maybe we'll discover 100 years from now
that they are useful.

00:11:22.685 --> 00:11:26.739
But it takes a lot of time
to derive technology from science,

00:11:26.763 --> 00:11:28.349
and that's not why we do it.

00:11:28.373 --> 00:11:30.648
All technology is derived from science,
