00:11:28.373 --> 00:11:30.648
All technology is derived from science,

00:11:30.672 --> 00:11:33.775
but we practice science for the enjoyment.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.640
What's left to do?

00:11:37.386 --> 00:11:38.827
A lot.

00:11:38.851 --> 00:11:41.526
A lot; this is only the beginning.

00:11:42.613 --> 00:11:45.707
As we make the detectors
more and more sensitive --

00:11:45.731 --> 00:11:47.648
and we have lots of work to do there --

00:11:47.672 --> 00:11:49.917
not only are we going to see
more black holes

00:11:49.941 --> 00:11:54.245
and be able to catalog
how many there are, where they are

00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:55.841
and how big they are,

00:11:55.865 --> 00:11:59.272
we'll also be able to see other objects.

00:11:59.296 --> 00:12:04.889
We'll see neutron stars fuse
and turn into black holes.
