00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.163
using lasers that measured
distances between mirrors

00:04:35.187 --> 00:04:37.614
kilometers apart.

00:04:38.478 --> 00:04:42.498
It took many years, a lot of work
and many scientists

00:04:42.522 --> 00:04:45.757
to develop the technology
and develop the ideas.

00:04:45.781 --> 00:04:48.088
And 20 years later,

00:04:48.112 --> 00:04:51.140
almost 30 years ago,

00:04:51.164 --> 00:04:57.177
they started to build two gravitational
wave detectors, two interferometers,

00:04:57.201 --> 00:04:58.753
in the United States.

00:04:59.307 --> 00:05:02.990
Each one is four kilometers long;
