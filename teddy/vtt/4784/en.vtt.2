To accomplish this task,

00:01:00.808 --> 00:01:03.228
the Emperor enlisted soldiers
and commoners,

00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:05.087
not always voluntarily.

00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:09.976
Of the hundreds of thousands of builders
recorded during the Qin Dynasty,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.346
many were forcibly conscripted peasants

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.246
and others were criminals
serving out sentences.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.617
Under the Han Dynasty,
the wall grew longer still,

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:21.060
reaching 3700 miles,

00:01:21.084 --> 00:01:25.173
and spanning from Dunhuang
to the Bohai Sea.

00:01:25.197 --> 00:01:28.959
Forced labor continued
under the Han Emperor Han-Wudi ,

00:01:28.983 --> 00:01:33.302
and the walls reputation grew
into a notorious place of suffering.
