00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:33.481
the Great Wall now welcomes
millions of visitors each year.

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:37.657
In fact, the influx of tourists
has caused the wall to deteriorate,

00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:40.838
leading the Chinese government
to launch preservation initiatives.

00:03:40.862 --> 00:03:45.875
It's also often acclaimed as the only
man-made structure visible from space.

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:48.518
Unfortunately, that's not at all true.

00:03:48.542 --> 00:03:50.706
In low Earth orbit,
all sorts of structures,

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.684
like bridges, highways
and airports are visible,

00:03:54.708 --> 00:03:57.796
and the Great Wall
is only barely discernible.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.945
From the moon, it doesn't stand a chance.
