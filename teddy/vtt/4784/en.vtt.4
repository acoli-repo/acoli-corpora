00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:03.667
After the Ming dynasty
gained control in 1368,

00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:07.234
they began to refortify
and further consolidate the wall

00:02:07.258 --> 00:02:09.901
using bricks and stones from local kilns.

00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:13.698
Averaging 23 feet high and 21 feet wide,

00:02:13.722 --> 00:02:18.860
the walls 5500 miles
were punctuated by watchtowers.

00:02:18.884 --> 00:02:20.219
When raiders were sighted,

00:02:20.243 --> 00:02:22.886
fire and smoke signals traveled
between towers

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.554
until reinforcements arrived.

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:29.250
Small openings along the wall
let archers fire on invaders,

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:33.140
while larger ones were used
to drop stones and more.
