00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.961
And without regular reinforcement,
the wall fell into disrepair,

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:03.307
rammed earth eroded,

00:03:03.331 --> 00:03:06.593
while brick and stone were plundered
for building materials.

00:03:06.617 --> 00:03:08.197
But its job wasn't finished.

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:09.858
During World War II,

00:03:09.882 --> 00:03:12.729
China used sections for defense
against Japanese invasion,

00:03:12.753 --> 00:03:16.798
and some parts are still rumored
to be used for military training.

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:19.466
But the Wall's main purpose
today is cultural.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.030
As one of the largest man-made
structures on Earth,

00:03:23.054 --> 00:03:27.282
it was granted UNESCO
World Heritage Status in 1987.

00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:29.975
Originally built to keep
people out of China,

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:33.481
the Great Wall now welcomes
millions of visitors each year.
