Recently, the leadership team
of an American supermarket chain

00:00:04.361 --> 00:00:07.817
decided that their business
needed to get a lot more efficient.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:11.696
So they embraced their digital
transformation with zeal.

00:00:12.174 --> 00:00:16.122
Out went the teams
supervising meat, veg, bakery,

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:20.302
and in came an algorithmic task allocator.

00:00:20.914 --> 00:00:23.017
Now, instead of people working together,

00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:27.282
each employee went, clocked in,
got assigned a task, did it,

00:00:27.306 --> 00:00:28.884
came back for more.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.156
This was scientific
management on steroids,
