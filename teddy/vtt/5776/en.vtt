00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.597
John Doerr: Hello, Hal!

00:00:02.597 --> 00:00:04.240
Hal Harvey: John, nice to see you.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.777
JD: Nice to see you too.

00:00:05.947 --> 00:00:08.467
HH: So John, we've got a big challenge.

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:10.567
We need to get carbon
out of the atmosphere.

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:12.097
We need to stop emitting carbon,

00:00:12.097 --> 00:00:14.127
drive it to zero by 2050.

00:00:14.127 --> 00:00:16.927
And we need to be halfway there by 2030.

00:00:16.927 --> 00:00:18.400
Where are we now?

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.431
JD: As you know,
we're dumping 55 billion tons

00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:25.390
of carbon pollution in our precious
atmosphere every year,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.367
as if it's some kind
of free and open sewer.

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:31.333
To get halfway to zero by 2030,
