I just heard the best joke about Bond Emeruwa.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and a Nigerian journalist comes -- and this will only make sense

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
if you've ever watched a James Bond movie --

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and a Nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
"Aha, we meet again, Mr. Bond!"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
(Laughter)

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It was great.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So, I've got a little sheet of paper here,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
mostly because I'm Nigerian and if you leave me alone,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'll talk for like two hours.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I just want to say good afternoon, good evening.
