00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.016
The mathematics
of quantum mechanics tells us

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.336
this is how the world
works at tiny scales.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.320
It can be summed up in a single sentence:

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.336
Everything that can happen, does.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.816
That's quantum mechanics.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.576
But this does not mean everything happens.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.000
The rest of physics is about describing
what can happen and what can't.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.096
What physics tells us
is that everything comes down to geometry

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.240
and the interactions
of elementary particles.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.320
And things can happen only if
these interactions are perfectly balanced.
