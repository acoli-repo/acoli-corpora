00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.840
draws five times as much power
as the city of Monterey.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.696
We can't predict specifically

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.656
what particles will be produced
in any individual collision.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.400
Quantum mechanics tells us
all possibilities are realized.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.720
But physics does tell us
what particles can be produced.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.056
These particles must have
just as much mass and energy

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.440
as is carried in
by the proton and antiproton.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.816
Any particles more massive
than this energy limit aren't produced,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.240
and remain invisible to us.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.896
This is why this new
particle accelerator is so exciting.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.176
It's going to push
this energy limit seven times
