00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.896
Joined with quantum mechanics,

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.856
this mathematics describes our universe
as a growing E8 coral,

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.496
with particles interacting
at every location in all possible ways

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.120
according to a beautiful pattern.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.456
And as more of the pattern
comes into view using new machines

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.296
like the Large Hadron Collider,

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.160
we may be able to see whether nature
uses this E8 pattern or a different one.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.000
This process of discovery is
a wonderful adventure to be involved in.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.976
If the LHC finds particles
that fit this E8 pattern,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.600
that will be very, very cool.
