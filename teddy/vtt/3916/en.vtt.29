without which it is humanly impossible
to understand a single word of it;

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.400
without these, one is wandering around
in a dark labyrinth."

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.800
I believe this to be true,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.456
and I've tried
to follow Galileo's guidance

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.816
in describing the mathematics
of particle physics

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.216
using only triangles, circles
and other geometrical figures.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.976
Of course, when other physicists
and I actually work on this stuff,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.200
the mathematics
can resemble a dark labyrinth.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.776
But it's reassuring that at the heart
of this mathematics

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.720
is pure, beautiful geometry.
