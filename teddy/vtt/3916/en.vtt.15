WEBVTT

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.616
and interact with electric charge
along the vertical direction

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.880
in this charge space.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.816
So the electromagnetic and weak forces

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.176
are described by this pattern
of particle charges

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.576
in two-dimensional space.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.120
We can include the strong force
by spreading out its two charge directions

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.296
and plotting the charges
of the force particles in quarks

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.560
along these directions.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.896
The charges of all known particles

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.296
can be plotted in
a four-dimensional charge space,

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.496
and projected down to two dimensions
like this so we can see them.

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.296
Whenever particles interact,
nature keeps things in a perfect balance
