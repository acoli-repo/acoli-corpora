00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.416
could emerge from a more perfect pattern
that gets broken --

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.456
similar to how the Higgs particle
breaks the electroweak pattern

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.136
to give electromagnetism.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.216
In order to do this,
we need to introduce new forces

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.560
with new charge directions.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.176
When we introduce a new direction,

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.616
we get to guess what charges
the particles have along this direction,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.760
and then we can rotate it
in with the others.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.216
If we guess wisely,
we can construct the standard charges

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.936
in six charge dimensions
as a broken symmetry

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.360
of this more perfect pattern
in seven charge dimensions.
