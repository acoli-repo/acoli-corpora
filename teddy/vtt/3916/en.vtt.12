00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.536
Now, if we count up
all these different particles

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.416
using their various spins and charges,

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.760
there are 226.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.440
That's a lot of particles
to keep track of.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.096
And it seems strange

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.680
that nature would have
so many elementary particles.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.336
But if we plot them out
according to their charges,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.000
some beautiful patterns emerge.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.400
The most familiar charge
is electric charge.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.496
Electrons have an electric charge,

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.736
a negative one,

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.776
and quarks have
electric charges in thirds.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.056
So when two up quarks and a down quark
are combined to make a proton,
