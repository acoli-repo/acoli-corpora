00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.856
In contrast, the up and down quarks
have very large masses,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.080
and combine in threes to make
the protons and neutrons inside atoms.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.096
All of these matter particles
come in left- and right-handed varieties,

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.882
and have antiparticle partners
that carry opposite charges.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.616
These familiar particles

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.656
also have less familiar
second and third generations,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.200
which have the same charges as the first
but have much higher masses.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.216
These matter particles all interact
with the various force particles.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.456
The electromagnetic force
interacts with electrically charged matter

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.296
via particles called photons.
