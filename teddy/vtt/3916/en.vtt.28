It's a fantastic prospect that this object
of great mathematical beauty

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.776
could describe the truth
of particle interactions

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.440
at the smallest scales imaginable.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.656
And this idea that nature is described
by mathematics is not at all new.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.400
In 1623, Galileo wrote this:

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.056
"Nature's grand book,
which stands continually open to our gaze,

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.576
is written in the language of mathematics.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.216
Its characters are triangles,
circles and other geometrical figures,

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.096
without which it is humanly impossible
to understand a single word of it;
