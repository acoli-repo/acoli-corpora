00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.296
Whenever particles interact,
nature keeps things in a perfect balance

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.480
along all four of these charge directions.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.176
If a particle and an antiparticle collide,

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.856
it creates a burst of energy
and a total charge of zero

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.320
in all four charge directions.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.936
At this point, anything can be created

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.320
as long as it has the same energy
and maintains a total charge of zero.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.376
For example, this weak force particle
and its antiparticle

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.176
can be created in a collision.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.096
In further interactions,
the charges must always balance.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.440
One of the weak particles could decay
into an electron and an antineutrino,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.816
and these three
still add to zero total charge.
