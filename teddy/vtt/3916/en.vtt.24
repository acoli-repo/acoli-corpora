However, if we work
in eight-dimensional charge space,

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.640
then we can assign
unique new charges to each particle.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.760
Then we can spin these in eight dimensions

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.440
and see what the whole pattern looks like.

00:12:11.983 --> 00:12:14.936
Here we can see the second
and third generations of matter now,

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.080
related to the first generation
by a symmetry called "triality."

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.016
This particular pattern
of charges in eight dimensions

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.560
is actually part of the most beautiful
geometric structure in mathematics.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.840
It's a pattern of the largest
exceptional Lie group, E8.
