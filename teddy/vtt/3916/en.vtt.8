00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.176
It's going to push
this energy limit seven times

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.936
beyond what's ever been done before,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.680
so we're going to get to see
some new particles very soon.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.496
But before talking
about what we might see,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.840
let me describe the particles
we already know of.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.560
There's a whole zoo
of subatomic particles.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.096
Most of us are familiar with electrons.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.336
A lot of people in this room
make a good living pushing them around.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.536
(Laughter)

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.576
But the electron also has
a neutral partner called the neutrino,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.720
with no electric charge
and a very tiny mass.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.856
In contrast, the up and down quarks
have very large masses,
