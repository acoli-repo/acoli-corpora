00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:00.722
and I have surfing scars to prove that.

00:01:01.503 --> 00:01:03.456
But this polyp would continue and tell us

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.536
that his neighbors were
quite clearly identical copies of him.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.896
That he was in all
these other locations as well,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.080
but experiencing them
as separate individuals.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.616
For a coral, branching
into different copies

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.498
is the most natural thing in the world.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.696
Unlike us, a hyperintelligent coral

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.520
would be uniquely prepared
to understand quantum mechanics.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.576
The mathematics of quantum mechanics

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.136
very accurately describes
how our universe works.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.018
And it tells us our reality is continually
branching into different possibilities,
