00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.840
It's a pattern of the largest
exceptional Lie group, E8.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.736
This Lie group is a smooth,
curved shape with 248 dimensions.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.736
Each point in this pattern
corresponds to a symmetry

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.800
of this very complex and beautiful shape.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.536
One small part of this E8 shape
can be used to describe

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.176
the curved space-time
of Einstein's general relativity,

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.440
explaining gravity.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.896
Together with quantum mechanics,

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.376
the geometry of this shape
could describe everything

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.016
about how the universe works
at the tiniest scales.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.336
The pattern of this shape living
in eight-dimensional charge space
