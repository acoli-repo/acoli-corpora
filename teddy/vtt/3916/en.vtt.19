00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.936
We can rotate this pattern
in six dimensions

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.480
and see that it's quite pretty.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.736
Right now, this pattern
matches our best current knowledge

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.160
of how nature is built at the tiny scales
of these elementary particles.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.656
This is what we know for certain.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.816
Some of these particles
are at the very limit

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.216
of what we've been able to reach
with experiments.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.456
From this pattern

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.816
we already know the particle physics
of these tiny scales --

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.720
the way the universe works
at these tiny scales is very beautiful.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.536
But now I'm going to discuss
some new and old ideas
