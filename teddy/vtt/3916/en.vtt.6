00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.656
Now I'll go ahead and describe
how we know about these particles,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.720
what they are and how this balance works.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.056
In this machine,
a beam of protons and antiprotons

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.096
are accelerated to near the speed of light

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.776
and brought together in a collision,
producing a burst of pure energy.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.696
This energy is immediately converted
into a spray of subatomic particles,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.016
with detectors and computers
used to figure out their properties.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.296
This enormous machine --

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.496
the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN in Geneva --

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.216
has a circumference of 17 miles
and, when it's operating,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.840
draws five times as much power
as the city of Monterey.
