(Laughter)

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.656
In the branch in which
the sample radiates,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.056
it sets off a trigger that releases poison
and Schrödinger is dead.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.976
But in the other branch of reality,
he remains alive.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.905
These realities are experienced
separately by each individual.

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:17.856
As far as either can tell,
the other one doesn't exist.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.096
This seems weird to us,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.976
because each of us
only experiences an individual existence,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.096
and we don't get to see other branches.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.416
It's as if each of us,
like Schrödinger here,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.600
are a kind of coral
branching into different possibilities.
