00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.016
of these two new force particles,

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.680
which should act a lot
like the weak force, only weaker.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.896
Now, we can rotate this set
of charges in seven dimensions

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.480
and consider an odd fact
about the matter particles:

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.656
the second and third generations of matter

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.576
have exactly the same charges
in six-dimensional charge space

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.840
as the first generation.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.560
These particles are not
uniquely identified by their six charges.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.160
They sit on top of one another
in the standard charge space.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.016
However, if we work
in eight-dimensional charge space,
