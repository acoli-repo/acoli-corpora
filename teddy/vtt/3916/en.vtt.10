00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.296
via particles called photons.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.856
There is also a very weak force

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.613
called, rather unimaginatively,
the weak force ...

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:05.776
(Laughter)

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.208
that interacts
only with left-handed matter.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.456
The strong force acts between quarks

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.616
which carry a different kind of charge,
called color charge,

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.416
and come in three different varieties:
red, green and blue.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.640
You can blame Murray Gell-Mann
for these names -- they're his fault.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.256
Finally, there's the force of gravity,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.376
which interacts with matter
via its mass and spin.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.616
The most important thing
to understand here

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.440
is that there's a different kind of charge
associated with each of these forces.
