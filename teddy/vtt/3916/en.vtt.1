00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.936
These polyps are continually
budding and branching

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.840
into genetically identical neighbors.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.856
If we imagine this
to be a hyperintelligent coral,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.056
we can single out an individual
and ask him a reasonable question.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.456
We can ask how exactly
he got to be in this particular location

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.176
compared to his neighbors --

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.760
if it was just chance,
or destiny, or what?

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.160
Now, after admonishing us
for turning the temperature up too high,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.816
he would tell us that our question
was completely stupid.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.840
These corals can be kind of mean, you see,

00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:00.722
and I have surfing scars to prove that.
