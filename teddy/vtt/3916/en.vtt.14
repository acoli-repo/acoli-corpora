00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.616
which make this pattern.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.776
This is called
the unified electroweak model,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.000
and it was put together back in 1967.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.576
The reason most of us
are only familiar with electric charge

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.200
and not both of these
is because of the Higgs particle.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.136
The Higgs, over here on the left,
has a large mass

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.616
and breaks the symmetry
of this electroweak pattern.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.216
It makes the weak force very weak
by giving the weak particles a large mass.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.336
Since this massive Higgs sits along
the horizontal direction in this diagram,

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.656
the photons of electromagnetism
remain massless

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.616
and interact with electric charge
along the vertical direction
