00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.776
And strong interactions
are happening millions of times

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.936
each second in every atom of our bodies,

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.640
holding the atomic nuclei together.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.856
But these four charges
corresponding to three forces

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.280
are not the end of the story.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.856
We can also include two more charges
corresponding to the gravitational force.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.176
When we include these,

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.856
each matter particle
has two different spin charges,

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.856
spin-up and spin-down.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.936
So they all split and give a nice pattern
in six-dimensional charge space.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.936
We can rotate this pattern
in six dimensions
