00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.056
So when two up quarks and a down quark
are combined to make a proton,

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.096
it has a total
electric charge of plus one.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.376
These particles also have antiparticles,
which have opposite charges.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.216
Now, it turns out the electric charge

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.736
is actually a combination
of two other charges:

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.360
hypercharge and weak charge.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.760
If we spread out
the hypercharge and weak charge

00:06:46.762 --> 00:06:50.096
and plot the charges of particles
in this two-dimensional charge space,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.376
the electric charge
is where these particles sit

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.800
along the vertical direction.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.096
The electromagnetic
and weak forces interact with matter

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.336
according to their hypercharge
and weak charge,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.616
which make this pattern.
