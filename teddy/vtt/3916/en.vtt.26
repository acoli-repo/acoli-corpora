00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.336
The pattern of this shape living
in eight-dimensional charge space

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.640
is exquisitely beautiful,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.496
and it summarizes thousands
of possible interactions

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.216
between these elementary particles,

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.880
each of which is just a facet
of this complicated shape.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.416
As we spin it, we can see
many of the other intricate patterns

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.680
contained in this one.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.256
And with a particular rotation,

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.456
we can look down through this pattern
in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.296
and see all the particles at once.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.896
It's a very beautiful object,

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.296
and as with any unification,

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.680
we can see some holes where new particles
are required by this pattern.
