00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.016
This particular choice
corresponds to a grand unified theory

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.720
introduced by Pati and Salam in 1973.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.176
When we look at this new unified pattern,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.160
we can see a couple of gaps
where particles seem to be missing.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.200
This is the way
theories of unification work.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.496
A physicist looks for larger,
more symmetric patterns

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.840
that include the established
pattern as a subset.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.816
The larger pattern allows us
to predict the existence of particles

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.080
that have never been seen.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.496
This unification model
predicts the existence

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.016
of these two new force particles,
