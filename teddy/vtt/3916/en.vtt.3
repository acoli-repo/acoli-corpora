00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.018
And it tells us our reality is continually
branching into different possibilities,

00:01:32.042 --> 00:01:33.242
just like a coral.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.216
It's a weird thing for us humans
to wrap our minds around,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.096
since we only ever get
to experience one possibility.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.120
This quantum weirdness was first described

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:43.896
by Erwin Schrödinger and his cat.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.616
The cat likes this version better.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.000
(Laughter)

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.096
In this setup, Schrödinger is in a box
with a radioactive sample

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.016
that, by the laws of quantum mechanics,
branches into a state

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.880
in which it is radiated
and a state in which it is not.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.616
(Laughter)
