00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.816
and these three
still add to zero total charge.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.919
Nature always keeps a perfect balance.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:37.736
So these patterns of charges
are not just pretty.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.256
They tell us what interactions
are allowed to happen.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.895
And we can rotate this charge space
in four dimensions

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.696
to get a better look
at the strong interaction,

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.976
which has this nice hexagonal symmetry.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.336
In a strong interaction,
a strong force particle,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.576
such as this one,

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.360
interacts with a colored quark,
such as this green one,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.065
to give a quark with a different
color charge -- this red one.
