but you do have to respect
the entrepreneurial nature

00:08:30.545 --> 00:08:31.752
of their endeavors.

00:08:31.776 --> 00:08:32.926
(Laughter)

00:08:34.476 --> 00:08:38.331
So how are we going to stop this?

00:08:39.714 --> 00:08:45.278
It's not like we're going to be able
to identify who's responsible --

00:08:45.302 --> 00:08:48.264
remember, they operate with anonymity

00:08:48.288 --> 00:08:50.273
and outside the reach of the law.

00:08:51.217 --> 00:08:54.501
We're certainly not going to be able
to prosecute the offenders.

00:08:55.156 --> 00:09:00.701
I would propose that we need
a completely new approach.
