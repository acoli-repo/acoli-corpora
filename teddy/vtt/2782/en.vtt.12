00:05:59.977 --> 00:06:02.537
You can even buy attacks

00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:05.889
that come with a money-back guarantee --

00:06:05.913 --> 00:06:06.958
(Laughter)

00:06:06.982 --> 00:06:08.637
if you're not successful.

00:06:09.931 --> 00:06:13.022
Now, these environments,
these marketplaces --

00:06:13.046 --> 00:06:16.393
they look like an Amazon or an eBay.

00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:20.373
You see products, prices,
ratings and reviews.

00:06:20.397 --> 00:06:22.651
Of course, if you're going
to buy an attack,

00:06:22.675 --> 00:06:26.124
you're going to buy from a reputable
criminal with good ratings, right?

00:06:26.148 --> 00:06:27.152
(Laughter)

00:06:27.176 --> 00:06:28.377
This isn't any different

00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:33.591
than checking on Yelp or TripAdvisor
before going to a new restaurant.
