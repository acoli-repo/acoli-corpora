00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:02.040
And after going through
the normal voice prompts,

00:04:02.064 --> 00:04:04.181
you're met with
an English-speaking operator.

00:04:04.205 --> 00:04:07.073
"Hello, Altoro Mutual Bank.
How can I help you?"

00:04:08.033 --> 00:04:11.686
And you go through the process
like you do every time you call your bank,

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.501
of giving them your name
and your account number,

00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:18.448
going through the security checks
to verify you are who you said you are.

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:21.297
Most of us may not know this,

00:04:21.321 --> 00:04:23.550
but in many large-scale wire transfers,

00:04:23.574 --> 00:04:26.685
it requires two people to sign off
on the wire transfer,

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:29.908
so the operator then asks you
to get the second person on the line,

00:04:29.932 --> 00:04:32.733
and goes through the same set
of verifications and checks.
