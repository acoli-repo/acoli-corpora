and goes through the same set
of verifications and checks.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.306
Sounds normal, right?

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.351
Only one problem:

00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:39.200

00:04:39.224 --> 00:04:40.810
You're talking to the criminals.

an English-speaking help desk,

00:04:43.056 --> 00:04:45.121

and a million and a half
dollars per attempt

00:04:53.547 --> 00:04:55.105
into their criminal coffers.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.755
These criminal organizations operate

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:01.804
like highly regimented,
legitimate businesses.
