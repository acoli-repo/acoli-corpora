00:02:29.862 --> 00:02:31.092
to name a few.

00:02:32.293 --> 00:02:34.297
So how does this work?

00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:36.227
How do these criminals operate?

00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:39.557
Well, let me tell you a little story.

00:02:40.531 --> 00:02:41.725
About a year ago,

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:45.059
our security researchers were tracking

00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:51.129
a somewhat ordinary but sophisticated
banking Trojan called the Dyre Wolf.

00:02:51.925 --> 00:02:54.146
The Dyre Wolf would get on your computer

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.170
via you clicking on a link
in a phishing email

00:02:57.194 --> 00:02:59.146
that you probably shouldn't have.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.167
It would then sit and wait.
