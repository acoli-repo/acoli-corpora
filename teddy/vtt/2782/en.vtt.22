Remember, they're programmed right
into their DNA to keep secrets.

00:11:01.164 --> 00:11:04.188
We've got to turn
that thinking on its head.

00:11:04.212 --> 00:11:07.493
We've got to get governments,
private institutions

00:11:07.517 --> 00:11:08.960
and security companies

00:11:08.984 --> 00:11:11.715
willing to share information at speed.

00:11:11.739 --> 00:11:13.415
And here's why:

00:11:13.439 --> 00:11:15.316
because if you share the information,

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.357
it's equivalent to inoculation.

00:11:18.663 --> 00:11:20.210
And if you're not sharing,

00:11:20.234 --> 00:11:22.335
you're actually part of the problem,

00:11:22.359 --> 00:11:28.127
because you're increasing the odds
that other people could be impacted

00:11:28.151 --> 00:11:30.781
by the same attack techniques.
