00:12:31.757 --> 00:12:35.218
It had information not just
on what had happened in the past,

00:12:35.242 --> 00:12:37.717
but what was happening in near-real time.

00:12:37.741 --> 00:12:41.638
What if we were to publish it all
openly on the internet?

00:12:42.463 --> 00:12:44.957
As you can imagine,
this got quite a reaction.

00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:46.345
First came the lawyers:

Then came the business:

00:12:50.744 --> 00:12:53.144
What are the business
implications of doing that?

00:12:53.622 --> 00:12:55.795
And this was also met with a good dose

00:12:55.819 --> 00:12:58.927
of a lot of people just asking
if we were completely crazy.

00:12:59.928 --> 00:13:03.714
But there was one conversation
that kept floating to the surface
