In a blog post,

00:07:31.464 --> 00:07:38.269
she positioned Bilal Bot
as a new, inexpensive and beta alternative

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.208
to the much more advanced GM Bot

00:07:42.232 --> 00:07:45.047
that was commonplace
in the criminal underground.

00:07:46.658 --> 00:07:50.668
This review did not sit well
with the authors of Bilal Bot.

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:53.817
So they wrote her this very email,

00:07:55.028 --> 00:07:57.785
pleading their case
and making the argument

00:07:57.809 --> 00:08:03.238
that they felt she had evaluated
an older version.
