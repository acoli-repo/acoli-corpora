I would propose that we need
a completely new approach.

00:09:01.763 --> 00:09:05.669
And that approach needs
to be centered on the idea

00:09:05.693 --> 00:09:09.588
that we need to change
the economics for the bad guys.

00:09:10.245 --> 00:09:13.346
And to give you a perspective
on how this can work,

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:18.358
let's think of the response we see
to a healthcare pandemic:

00:09:18.382 --> 00:09:21.385
SARS, Ebola, bird flu, Zika.

00:09:22.036 --> 00:09:23.957
What is the top priority?

00:09:23.981 --> 00:09:29.274
It's knowing who is infected
and how the disease is spreading.
