00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
have led to the Charter for Compassion.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Compassion can't be reduced to sainthood

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
any more than it can be reduced to pity.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
So I want to propose

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
a final definition of compassion --

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
this is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way --

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and that would be for us

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
to call compassion a spiritual technology.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Now our traditions contain

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
vast wisdom about this,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and we need them to mine it for us now.
