00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Our cultural imagination about compassion

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
has been deadened by idealistic images.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And so what I'd like to do this morning

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
for the next few minutes

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
is perform a linguistic resurrection.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that words matter,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that they shape the way we understand ourselves,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
the way we interpret the world

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and the way we treat others.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
When this country

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
first encountered genuine diversity

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in the 1960s,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
we adopted tolerance

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
as the core civic virtue

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
with which we would approach that.
