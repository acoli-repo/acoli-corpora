00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of giving a speech in Holland

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and, after the fact, the word "compassion"

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
was translated as "pity."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now compassion, when it enters the news,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
too often comes in the form

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
of feel-good feature pieces

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
or sidebars about heroic people

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
you could never be like

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
or happy endings

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
or examples of self-sacrifice

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that would seem to be too good to be true

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
most of the time.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Our cultural imagination about compassion

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
has been deadened by idealistic images.
