00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the standards to which we hold ourselves and others,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
both in our private and in our civic spaces.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So what is it, three-dimensionally?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
What are its kindred and component parts?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
What's in its universe of attendant virtues?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
To start simply,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I want to say that compassion is kind.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Now "kindness" might sound like a very mild word,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and it's prone to its own abundant cliche.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
But kindness is an everyday byproduct

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
of all the great virtues.
