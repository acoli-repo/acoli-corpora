00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I think that compassion

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
also is often linked to beauty --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and by that I mean a willingness

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
to see beauty in the other,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
not just what it is about them

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
that might need helping.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I love it that my Muslim conversation partners

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
often speak of beauty as a core moral value.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And in that light, for the religious,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
compassion also brings us

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
into the territory of mystery --

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
encouraging us not just

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
to see beauty,
