00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I think this is one of the most fascinating developments

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
of the 21st century --

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that science, in fact,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
is taking a virtue like compassion

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
definitively out of the realm of idealism.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
This is going to change science, I believe,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and it will change religion.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
But here's a face

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
from 20th century science

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
that might surprise you

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
in a discussion about compassion.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
We all know about the Albert Einstein

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
who came up with E = mc2.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
We don't hear so much about the Einstein
