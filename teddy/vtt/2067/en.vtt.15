00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Compassion is rarely a solution,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
but it is always a sign of a deeper reality,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
of deeper human possibilities.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And compassion is unleashed

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
in wider and wider circles

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
by signs and stories,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
never by statistics and strategies.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
We need those things too,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
but we're also bumping up against their limits.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And at the same time that we are doing that,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I think we are rediscovering the power of story --

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that as human beings, we need stories
