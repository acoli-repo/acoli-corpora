Now invoking Einstein

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
but actually it is.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
I want to show you

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
the rest of this photograph,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
because this photograph

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
is analogous to what we do to the word "compassion" in our culture --

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
we clean it up

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and we diminish its depths and its grounding

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
in life, which is messy.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
So in this photograph

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
you see a mind looking out a window
