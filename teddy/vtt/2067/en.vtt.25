00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
you see a mind looking out a window

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
at what might be a cathedral -- it's not.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
This is the full photograph,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
and you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
smoking a cigar.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And by the look of that paunch,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
he hasn't been doing enough yoga.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
We put these two photographs side-by-side on our website,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
and someone said, "When I look at the first photo,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
I ask myself, what was he thinking?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And when I look at the second, I ask,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
what kind of person was he? What kind of man is this?"

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Well, he was complicated.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
He was incredibly compassionate

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
in some of his relationships
