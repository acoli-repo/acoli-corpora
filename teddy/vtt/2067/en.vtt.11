00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
in a car crash that killed his father and his sister.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Matthew's legs don't work, and he'll never walk again,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and -- and he does experience this as an "and"

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
rather than a "but" --

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and he experiences himself

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
to be healed and whole.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And as a teacher of yoga,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
he brings that experience to others

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
across the spectrum of ability and disability,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
health, illness and aging.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
He says that he's just at an extreme end

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
of the spectrum we're all on.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
He's doing some amazing work now

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan.
