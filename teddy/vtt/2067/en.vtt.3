00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
with which we would approach that.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now the word "tolerance," if you look at it in the dictionary,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
connotes "allowing," "indulging"

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and "enduring."

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
In the medical context that it comes from,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
it is about testing the limits of thriving

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
in an unfavorable environment.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Tolerance is not really a lived virtue;

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
it's more of a cerebral ascent.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And it's too cerebral

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to animate guts and hearts

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and behavior

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
when the going gets rough.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And the going is pretty rough right now.
