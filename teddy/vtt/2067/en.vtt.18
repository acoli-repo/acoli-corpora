00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Rachel Naomi Remen says

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
this is an important and empowering story

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
for our time,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
because this story insists

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
that each and every one of us,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
frail and flawed as we may be,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
inadequate as we may feel,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
has exactly what's needed

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
to help repair the part of the world

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
that we can see and touch.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Stories like this,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
signs like this,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
are practical tools

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
in a world longing to bring compassion
