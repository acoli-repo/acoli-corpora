00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
of all the great virtues.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And it is a most edifying form

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
of instant gratification.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Compassion is also curious.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I love a phrase that was offered me

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
by two young women

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
who are interfaith innovators in Los Angeles,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Aziza Hasan and Malka Fenyvesi.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
They are working to create a new imagination

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
about shared life among young Jews and Muslims,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and as they do that, they cultivate what they call

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
"curiosity without assumptions."
