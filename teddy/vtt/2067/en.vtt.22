00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
national and ethnic divisions.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
But he watched physicists and chemists

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
in the early 20th century.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
He once said that science in his generation

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
had become like a razor blade

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
in the hands of a three-year-old.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And Einstein foresaw

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that as we grow more modern

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and technologically advanced,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
we need the virtues

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
our traditions carry forward in time

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
more, not less.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages.
