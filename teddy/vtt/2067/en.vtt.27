00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
So are we all.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And I want to say

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
that it is a liberating thing

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion --

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
following on what Fred Luskin says --

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
that these flaws just make us human.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Our culture is obsessed with perfection

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and with hiding problems.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
But what a liberating thing to realize

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
that our problems, in fact,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
are probably our richest sources

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
towards bringing compassion
