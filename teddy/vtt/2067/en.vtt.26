and terribly inadequate in others.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
to be compassionate towards those closest to us,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
which is another quality in the universe of compassion,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
on its dark side,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So was Mother Teresa.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
So are we all.
