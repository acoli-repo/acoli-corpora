00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
He's doing some amazing work now

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And Matthew has made this remarkable observation

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I can't quite explain it, and he can't either.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
But he says that he has yet to experience someone

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
who became more aware of their body,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
in all its frailty and its grace,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
without, at the same time,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
becoming more compassionate towards all of life.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Compassion also looks like this.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
This is Jean Vanier.
