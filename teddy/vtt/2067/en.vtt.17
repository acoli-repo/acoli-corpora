00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
that in the beginning of the Creation

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
something happened

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and the original light of the universe

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
was shattered into countless pieces.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
inside every aspect of the Creation.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
to gather it up,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and in so doing, to repair the world.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Now this might sound like a fanciful tale.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
