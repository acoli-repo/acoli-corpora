00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
to see beauty,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
but perhaps also to look for the face of God

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
in the moment of suffering,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
in the face of a stranger,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
in the face of the vibrant religious other.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I'm not sure if I can show you

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
what tolerance looks like,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
but I can show you what compassion looks like --

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
because it is visible.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
When we see it, we recognize it

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and it changes the way we think about what is doable,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
what is possible.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
It is so important

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
when we're communicating big ideas --

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion --
