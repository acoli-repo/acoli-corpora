00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
towards bringing compassion

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
towards the suffering and joys of others.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Rachel Naomi Remen is a better doctor

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
because of her life-long struggle with Crohn's disease.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Einstein became a humanitarian,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
not because of his exquisite knowledge

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
of space and time and matter,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And Karen Armstrong, I think you would also say

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
that it was some of your very wounding experiences

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
in a religious life that,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
with a zigzag,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
have led to the Charter for Compassion.
