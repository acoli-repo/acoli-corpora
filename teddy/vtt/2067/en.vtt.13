This is Jean Vanier.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Jean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
which you can now find all over the world,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
communities centered around life

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
with people with mental disabilities --

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
mostly Down syndrome.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
The communities that Jean Vanier founded,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
like Jean Vanier himself,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
exude tenderness.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
"Tender" is another word

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
I would love to spend some time resurrecting.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
We spend so much time in this culture

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
being driven and aggressive,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and I spend a lot of time being those things too.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And compassion can also have those qualities.
