00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:32.030
And at 19, we got married,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.885
and we had our first son.

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:40.073
And when I held my son in my arms
in the delivery room that day,

00:06:40.784 --> 00:06:45.280
not only did I reconnect
with some of the innocence that I had lost

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:46.730
at 14 years old,

00:06:47.716 --> 00:06:49.649
but it also began to challenge

00:06:49.673 --> 00:06:53.882
the very important things that drew
me to the movement to begin with:

00:06:53.906 --> 00:06:56.376
identity, community and purpose --

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.914
things that I had been
struggling with as a young boy.

00:06:59.938 --> 00:07:05.106
And now, I struggled with the concept
of who I was again.
