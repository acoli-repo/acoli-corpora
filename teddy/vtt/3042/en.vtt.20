00:09:59.101 --> 00:10:00.535
that I had in my head.

00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:04.681
I decided to pull the white-power
music from the inventory

00:10:04.705 --> 00:10:08.064
when I became too embarrassed
to sell it in front of my new friends.

00:10:08.929 --> 00:10:11.284
And of course, the store
couldn't sustain itself,

00:10:11.308 --> 00:10:12.619
so I had to close it.

00:10:13.343 --> 00:10:17.974
At that same time, I lost
nearly everything in my life.

00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:20.988
I used it as an opportunity to walk away

00:10:21.012 --> 00:10:23.870
from the movement that
I'd been a part of for eight years,

00:10:23.894 --> 00:10:28.296
the only identity, community and purpose
that I'd really known for most of my life.

00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:30.535
So I had nobody.
