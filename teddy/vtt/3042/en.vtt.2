00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:04.350
They struggled to survive with raising
a young family and a new business,

00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:06.768
often working seven days a week,

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.057
14 hours a day,

00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:12.556
taking on second and third jobs
just to earn a meager living.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.612
And quality time with my parents
was pretty nonexistent.

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:19.557
Even though I knew
they loved me very much,

00:01:20.216 --> 00:01:22.395
growing up, I felt abandoned.

00:01:23.297 --> 00:01:26.256
I was lonely, and I started to withdraw,

00:01:27.196 --> 00:01:31.379
and then I started to resent my parents
and become very angry.
