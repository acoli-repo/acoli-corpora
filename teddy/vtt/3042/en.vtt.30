00:14:58.045 --> 00:15:00.971
that invariably just kind of
nudge us off our path,

00:15:00.995 --> 00:15:02.677
and if they remain unresolved

00:15:03.442 --> 00:15:04.681
or untreated

00:15:05.697 --> 00:15:07.118
or not dealt with,

00:15:07.792 --> 00:15:11.555
sometimes we can get dangerously lost
down pretty dark corridors.

00:15:12.228 --> 00:15:14.411
Potholes can be things like trauma,

00:15:14.435 --> 00:15:16.852
abuse, unemployment,

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:18.826
neglect,

00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:21.844
untreated mental health conditions,

00:15:21.868 --> 00:15:23.059
even privilege.

00:15:23.942 --> 00:15:27.090
And if we hit enough potholes
on our journey in life,

00:15:27.696 --> 00:15:31.436
and we don't have the resources
or the help to navigate around them
