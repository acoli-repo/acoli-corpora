00:00:01.223 --> 00:00:06.188
My journey away from violent extremism
began 22 years ago,

00:00:06.212 --> 00:00:08.159
when I denounced racism

00:00:08.183 --> 00:00:10.967
and left the American white
supremacist skinhead movement

00:00:10.991 --> 00:00:12.351
that I had helped build.

00:00:12.707 --> 00:00:17.769
(Cheers and applause)

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.365
I was just 22 years old at the time,

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:25.442
but I had already spent eight years,
from the time I was 14 years old,

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:27.680
as one of the earliest
and youngest members

00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:32.233
and an eventual leader within
America's most violent hate movement.
