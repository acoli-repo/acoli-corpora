00:07:55.374 --> 00:08:00.942
to understand what the struggle was
that was happening inside of me,

00:08:01.715 --> 00:08:04.956
then maybe tragedy
could have been averted.

00:08:05.916 --> 00:08:07.835
Instead, I did compromise.

00:08:07.859 --> 00:08:11.204
I took myself off the streets
for the benefit of my family,

00:08:11.228 --> 00:08:15.204
because I was nervous that maybe
I could go to jail or end up dead,

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:17.321
and they would have to fend
for themselves.

00:08:18.086 --> 00:08:19.668
So I stepped back as a leader,

00:08:19.692 --> 00:08:22.331
and instead I opened a record store

00:08:23.092 --> 00:08:27.243
that I was going to sell
white-power music in, of course,

00:08:27.267 --> 00:08:29.388
because I was importing it in from Europe.
