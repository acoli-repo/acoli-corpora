00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:02.457
So if you've been following the news,

00:00:02.457 --> 00:00:04.946
you've heard that there's a pack of giant asteroids

00:00:04.946 --> 00:00:06.019
headed for the United States,

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.486
all scheduled to strike within the next 50 years.

00:00:09.486 --> 00:00:12.539
Now I don't mean actual asteroids made of rock and metal.

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.046
That actually wouldn't be such a problem,

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:16.150
because if we were really all going to die,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.188
we would put aside our differences, we'd spend whatever it took,

00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:21.318
and we'd find a way to deflect them.

00:00:21.318 --> 00:00:24.020
I'm talking instead about threats that are headed our way,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.156
but they're wrapped in a special energy field

00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:30.506
that polarizes us, and therefore paralyzes us.
