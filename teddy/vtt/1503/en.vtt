Walk around for four months with three wishes,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and all the ideas will start to percolate up.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I think everybody should do it -- think that you've got three wishes.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And what would you do? It's actually a great exercise

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to really drill down to the things that you feel are important,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and really reflect on the world around us.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And thinking that, can an individual actually do something,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
or come up with something,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Inspired by nature -- that's the theme here.
