00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
He doesn't need Adam.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
He can make his own spears and axes.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Well no, because if you think about it,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and then they trade,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
then they will each have saved an hour of work.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And the more they do this, the more true it's going to be,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
because the more they do this, the better Adam is going to get at making axes

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and the better Oz is going to get at making spears.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So the gains from trade are only going to grow.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And this is one of the beauties of exchange,
