00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the future of the world was bleak.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The population explosion was unstoppable.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Global famine was inevitable.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
was going to shorten our lives.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The acid rain was falling on the forests.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The oil was running out,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and a nuclear winter would finish us off.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
None of those things happened,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
(Laughter)
