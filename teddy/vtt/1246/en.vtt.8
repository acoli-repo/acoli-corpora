00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
No other animal does it.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange --

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and indeed there's reciprocity in other animals --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
But the exchange of one object for another never happens.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
As Adam Smith said, "No man ever saw a dog

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog."

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
(Laughter)

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
You can have culture without exchange.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
You can have, as it were, asexual culture.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Chimpanzees, killer whales, these kinds of creatures, they have culture.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
They teach each other traditions

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
which are handed down from parent to offspring.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
In this case, chimpanzees teaching each other

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
how to crack nuts with rocks.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But the difference is
