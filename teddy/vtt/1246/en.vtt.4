00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And that's because they're both designed to fit the human hand.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
They're both technologies. In the end, their similarity is not that interesting.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The differences are what interest me,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
for about a million years --

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Homo erectus made the same tool

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
for 30,000 generations.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Of course there were a few changes,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
There was no progress, no innovation.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It's an extraordinary phenomenon, but it's true.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years.
