00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
because I think it's the secret to understanding

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
what's happening in the world.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
My body's an accumulation of ideas too:

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
the idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of liver cells.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
They've come together.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
How does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Well, it uses sexual reproduction.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
In an asexual species, if you get two different mutations in different creatures,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
a green one and a red one,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
then one has to be better than the other.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
One goes extinct for the other to survive.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
But if you have a sexual species,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
then it's possible for an individual

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
to inherit both mutations
