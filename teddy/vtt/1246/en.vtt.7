00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
then it's possible for an individual

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
to inherit both mutations

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
from different lineages.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So what sex does is it enables the individual

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
to draw upon

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
the genetic innovations of the whole species.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
It's not confined to its own lineage.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
What's the process that's having the same effect

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
in cultural evolution

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
as sex is having in biological evolution?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And I think the answer is exchange,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
the habit of exchanging one thing for another.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
It's a unique human feature.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
No other animal does it.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange --
