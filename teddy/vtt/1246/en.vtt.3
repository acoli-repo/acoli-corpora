00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
In other words, you need to understand

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
how ideas have sex.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I want you to imagine

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
how we got from making objects like this

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
to making objects like this.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
These are both real objects.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
of the kind made by Homo erectus.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The other is obviously a computer mouse.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
They're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I've tried to work out which is bigger,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and it's almost impossible.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And that's because they're both designed to fit the human hand.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
They're both technologies. In the end, their similarity is not that interesting.
