00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And there's another difference too,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
which is the object on the left is made from one substance.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The object on the right is made from

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
a confection of different substances,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
from silicon and metal and plastic and so on.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And more than that, it's a confection of different ideas,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the idea of plastic, the idea of a laser,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
the idea of transistors.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
They've all been combined together in this technology.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And it's this combination,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
this cumulative technology, that intrigues me,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
because I think it's the secret to understanding
