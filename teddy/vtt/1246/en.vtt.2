00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
How did we achieve that?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
How did we become

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the only species

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that becomes more prosperous

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
as it becomes more populous?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and the level of the graph

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
represents GDP per capita.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I think to answer that question

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
you need to understand

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
how human beings bring together their brains

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and enable their ideas to combine and recombine,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
to meet and, indeed, to mate.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
In other words, you need to understand

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
how ideas have sex.
