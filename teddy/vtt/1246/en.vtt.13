00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And back in 1880,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
it would have been 15 minutes

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
to earn that amount of light on the average wage.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Back in 1800,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
you'd have had to work six hours

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
to earn a candle that could burn for an hour.

and ask yourself: "Who made them and for who?"

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
The stone axe was made by someone for himself.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
It was self-sufficiency.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
We call that poverty these days.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
But the object on the right
