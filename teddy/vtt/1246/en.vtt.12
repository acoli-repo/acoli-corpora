00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
You render it down. You make a candle, etc. etc.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
How long is it going to take you? Quite a long time.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
How long do you actually have to work

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
to earn an hour of reading light

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
if you're on the average wage in Britain today?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And the answer is about half a second.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
to acquire that much light.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
or you can acquire another good or service.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And back in 1880,
