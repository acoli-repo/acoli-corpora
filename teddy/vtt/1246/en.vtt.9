how to crack nuts with rocks.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But the difference is

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000

Well, the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And here is a Stone Age version of his story,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
although he told it in terms of trade between countries.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
