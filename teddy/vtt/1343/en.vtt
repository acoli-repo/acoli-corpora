00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This was in an area called Wellawatta, a prime residential area in Colombo.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We stood on the railroad tracks

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that ran between my friend's house and the beach.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but at that point the water had receded

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to a level three or four feet below normal.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'd never seen the reef here before.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There were fish caught in rock pools left behind by the receding water.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Some children jumped down and ran to the rock pools with bags.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
They were trying to catch fish.
