00:00:00.603 --> 00:00:03.669
So, this book that I have in my hand

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:07.603
is a directory of everybody who had an email address

00:00:07.603 --> 00:00:11.122
in 1982. (Laughter)

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:14.807
Actually, it's deceptively large.

00:00:14.807 --> 00:00:18.244
There's actually only about 20 people on each page,

00:00:18.244 --> 00:00:20.134
because we have the name, address

00:00:20.134 --> 00:00:23.227
and telephone number of every single person.

00:00:23.227 --> 00:00:25.410
And, in fact, everybody's listed twice,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.968
because it's sorted once by name and once by email address.

00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:32.869
Obviously a very small community.
