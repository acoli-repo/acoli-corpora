00:00:01.122 --> 00:00:03.332
I had a chance to teach a summer program

00:00:03.374 --> 00:00:05.710
a few years back in my hometown
of New Orleans.

00:00:06.878 --> 00:00:08.421
I had a group of 32 young men,

00:00:08.463 --> 00:00:12.592
age ranging from nine to 14,
all Black boys.

00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:16.304
I wanted to set a tone
the first day of class.

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:18.598
I want to compare
and contrast the mindsets

00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:20.975
of the contemporary young folk

00:00:22.143 --> 00:00:26.773
in contrast to my constituents
and how we grew up and how we aspired.

00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:31.611
So I asked them the old clich√© question:
What do you want to be when you grow up?
