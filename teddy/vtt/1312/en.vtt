If you are a blind child in India,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
you will very likely have to contend with

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
at least two big pieces of bad news.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The first bad news

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is that the chances of getting treatment

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
are extremely slim to none,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and that's because most of the blindness

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
alleviation programs in the country

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
are focused on adults,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and there are very, very few hospitals

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that are actually equipped to treat children.
