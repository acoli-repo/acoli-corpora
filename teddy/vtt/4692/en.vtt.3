00:01:29.644 --> 00:01:31.644
because our brains have a limited capacity

00:01:31.668 --> 00:01:33.209
and we replace useless memories,

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:35.091
like middle school locker combinations,

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:37.184
with relevant information.

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:39.344
If this immortal boy finds a companion

00:01:39.368 --> 00:01:41.599
to fall in love with
once every hundred years,

00:01:41.623 --> 00:01:45.344
he would have ten thousand girlfriends
in a million years.

00:01:45.368 --> 00:01:48.214
And how many of those

00:01:48.238 --> 00:01:49.893
will he be able to remember?

00:01:49.917 --> 00:01:53.270
This changes what a meaningful
relationship means, doesn't it?

00:01:53.294 --> 00:01:55.152
Another tricky thing about immortality:

00:01:55.176 --> 00:01:57.276
Human beings have not
always looked the same.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.872
This can be explained
by Darwin's theory of evolution.

00:01:59.896 --> 00:02:02.613
For instance, if women find
taller men more attractive,
