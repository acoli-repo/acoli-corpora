00:00:28.483 --> 00:00:32.692
To his forty-year-old mother,
one year is merely 2.5% of her life.

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:34.655
The same year, 365 days,

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:38.005
can feel differently to different people.

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:39.864
If we live until we're 82,

00:00:39.888 --> 00:00:42.377
that's about 30,000 days.

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:47.158
If this boy lives for 30,000 years,
a year to him could feel like a day.

00:00:47.182 --> 00:00:48.833
And if this boy's emotions sustain

00:00:48.857 --> 00:00:51.931
through the potential boredom
of living for millions of years,

00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:55.000
he might become extremely lonely and sad,

00:00:55.024 --> 00:01:00.302
knowing he has and always will
outlive everyone he has ever loved.
