00:01:59.896 --> 00:02:02.613
For instance, if women find
taller men more attractive,

00:02:02.637 --> 00:02:05.409
then more tall men would mate
and have children,

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:07.481
putting more tall genes in the gene pool.

00:02:07.505 --> 00:02:09.186
That means, in the next generation,

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.428
more children will have
the genes to be taller.

00:02:11.452 --> 00:02:13.333
Repeat that process for a million years

00:02:13.357 --> 00:02:15.363
and the average height
will be a lot taller

00:02:15.387 --> 00:02:16.888
than the average height today,

00:02:16.912 --> 00:02:20.293
assuming there's no natural disaster
that wipes out all the tall people.

00:02:20.317 --> 00:02:22.433
Our ancestors were short, hairy apes.

00:02:22.457 --> 00:02:25.598
We still have body hair,
but we don't look like apes any more.

00:02:25.622 --> 00:02:27.622
If you're the only person who is immortal,

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:29.446
while everyone else keeps evolving,

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.063
generation after generation,
