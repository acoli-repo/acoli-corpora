00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.063
generation after generation,

00:02:31.087 --> 00:02:34.686
you will eventually look quite different
than the people who surround you.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.797
"Hi, how you doing?"

00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:38.503
If one of our ancestors, apes,
is still alive today,

00:02:38.527 --> 00:02:40.480
how many people will make friends with it

00:02:40.504 --> 00:02:43.099
instead of calling
the Museum of Natural History?

00:02:43.123 --> 00:02:46.373
And one more physical consideration
for immortality:

00:02:46.397 --> 00:02:47.712
Scars.

00:02:47.736 --> 00:02:51.589
After all, immortality doesn't
automatically translate to invincibility,

00:02:51.613 --> 00:02:53.788
it just means you cannot die.

00:02:53.812 --> 00:02:56.593
But it doesn't guarantee
what condition you'll be alive in.

00:02:56.617 --> 00:02:59.098
Look at your body
and count how many scars you have.

00:02:59.122 --> 00:03:01.159
If you have made this many permanent scars
