When I was a little little kid,

00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:04.329
I was a four years old on
my first airplane ride

00:00:04.746 --> 00:00:06.538
and we got to go up front in the cockpit

00:00:06.788 --> 00:00:09.954
because you could kind of do
that back then. And it was.

00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:13.829
Totally dark, no moon over
the Atlantic Ocean,

00:00:14.204 --> 00:00:19.079
there is like a billion stars in the
sky and I went back and told my mom

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.621
I wanted to be a stewardess and my mom,
to her credit, she wasn't.

00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:26.579
Honey, you might want to think about
being a pilot. And there you go.

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:27.746
That's what I wanted
to do from then on.

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:31.788
Sharon Pressler has flown lots of
different kinds of airplanes since then,
