00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:06.227
I thought if I skipped it might help my nerves,

00:00:06.227 --> 00:00:09.413
but I'm actually having a paradoxical reaction to that,

00:00:09.413 --> 00:00:11.235
so that was a bad idea. (Laughter)

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:14.656
Anyway, I was really delighted to receive the invitation

00:00:14.656 --> 00:00:18.593
to present to you some of my music and some of my work

00:00:18.593 --> 00:00:21.687
as a composer, presumably because it appeals

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:25.670
to my well-known and abundant narcissism. (Laughter)

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.278
And I'm not kidding, I just think we should just

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:31.734
say that and move forward. (Laughter)
