Hey, we're Leifer's, it's Adam,

00:00:02.537 --> 00:00:04.871
we're getting close to the premiere
of Season four of our show,

00:00:05.246 --> 00:00:07.996
but today I've got another conversation
for you from our taken

00:00:07.996 --> 00:00:12.079
for granted series of unscripted
interviews about rethinking assumptions

00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:16.288
this year and last. Many of us have been
forced to communicate with our closest

00:00:16.288 --> 00:00:20.829
colleagues and friends from a distance,
and that skill is not uniquely human.

00:00:21.538 --> 00:00:22.704
Whoa, whoa,

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:28.913
whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, this
is the distance greeting.

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.788
And that simply means this is me going.
