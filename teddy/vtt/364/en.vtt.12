Venture capitalists
and philanthropies don't have it.

00:06:02.264 --> 00:06:05.471
But we have to figure out
how to get people in the capital markets,

00:06:05.495 --> 00:06:08.987
who traditionally don't invest in this,
to want to invest in this stuff.

00:06:09.011 --> 00:06:11.329
So again, financial engineering
was helpful here.

00:06:11.353 --> 00:06:13.153
Imagine the megafund starts empty,

00:06:13.177 --> 00:06:17.186
and what it does is it issues
some debt and some equity,

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.606
and that generates cash flow.

00:06:18.964 --> 00:06:22.709
That cash flow is used, then, to buy
that big portfolio of drugs that you need,

00:06:22.733 --> 00:06:26.046
and those drugs start working their way
through that approval process,

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.461
and each time they go through
a phase of approval,

00:06:28.485 --> 00:06:29.680
they gain value.

00:06:29.704 --> 00:06:32.062
Most of them don't make it,
but a few of them do,
