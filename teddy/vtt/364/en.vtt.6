00:02:58.434 --> 00:03:00.789
that they do to determine
whether the drug is safe

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:02.826
and whether it works and all these things.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.930
So the FDA has a very specific protocol.

00:03:04.954 --> 00:03:06.645
In the first phase of this testing,

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.278
which is called testing for toxicity,
it's called Phase I.

00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:13.369
In the first phase,
you give the drug to healthy people

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.730
and you see if it actually
makes them sick.

00:03:16.578 --> 00:03:18.972
In other words, are the side
effects just so severe

00:03:18.996 --> 00:03:20.784
that no matter how much good it does,

00:03:20.808 --> 00:03:22.266
it's not going to be worth it?

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.981
Does it cause heart attacks,
kill people, liver failure?

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:27.158
And it turns out,
that's a pretty high hurdle.

00:03:27.182 --> 00:03:29.544
About a third of all drugs
drop out at that point.

00:03:29.663 --> 00:03:32.522
In the next phase, you test
to see if the drug's effective,
