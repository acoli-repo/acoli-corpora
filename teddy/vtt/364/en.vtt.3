00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:30.266
and that he'd learned
from studying the literature

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.371
was that there's actually
a big bottleneck.

00:01:32.395 --> 00:01:34.535
It's very difficult to develop new drugs,

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:36.919
and the reason it's difficult
to develop new drugs

00:01:36.943 --> 00:01:39.364
is because in the early stages
of drug development,

00:01:39.388 --> 00:01:41.893
the drugs are very risky,
and they're very expensive.

00:01:41.917 --> 00:01:44.790
So Andrew asked me
if I'd want to maybe work with him a bit,

00:01:44.814 --> 00:01:46.924
work on some of the math and the analytics

00:01:46.948 --> 00:01:49.485
and see if we could figure out
something we could do.

00:01:50.116 --> 00:01:51.585
Now I'm not a scientist.

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.657
You know, I don't know
how to build a drug.

00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:58.576
And none of my coauthors, Andrew Lo
or Jose-Maria Fernandez or David Fagnan --

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.315
none of those guys are scientists either.
