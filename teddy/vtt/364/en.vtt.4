00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.315
none of those guys are scientists either.

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:04.368
We don't know the first thing
about how to make a cancer drug.

00:02:04.828 --> 00:02:07.027
But we know a little bit
about risk mitigation

00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:09.167
and a little bit
about financial engineering,

00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:11.299
and so we started thinking,
what could we do?

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.889
I'm going to tell you about some work

00:02:13.913 --> 00:02:15.998
we've been doing
over the last couple years

00:02:16.022 --> 00:02:18.293
that we think could
fundamentally change the way

00:02:18.317 --> 00:02:21.190
research for cancer
and lots of other things gets done.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.139
We want to let the research
drive the funding,

00:02:24.163 --> 00:02:25.715
not the other way around.

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:27.740
So in order to get started,

00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:29.887
let me tell you
how you get a drug financed.

00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:34.312
Imagine that you're in your lab --
you're a scientist, you're not like me --
