In finance, we know what to do
with assets that are risky.

00:05:03.057 --> 00:05:06.169
You put them in a portfolio
and you try to smooth out the returns.

00:05:06.193 --> 00:05:09.236
So we did some math, and it turned out
you could make this work,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.692
but in order to make it work,
you need about 80 to 150 drugs.

00:05:12.716 --> 00:05:14.881
Now the good news is,
there's plenty of drugs

00:05:14.905 --> 00:05:16.365
that are waiting to be tested.

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.322
We've been told that there's a backlog
of about 20 years of drugs

00:05:20.346 --> 00:05:22.799
that are waiting to be tested
but can't be funded.

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:25.220
In fact, that early stage
of the funding process,

00:05:25.244 --> 00:05:27.216
that Phase I and preclinical stuff,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.109
that's actually, in the industry,
called the Valley of Death
