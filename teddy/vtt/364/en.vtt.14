00:06:58.915 --> 00:07:03.283
We talked to hundreds of experts
in drug financing and venture capital.

00:07:03.721 --> 00:07:05.973
We talked to people
who have developed drugs.

00:07:05.997 --> 00:07:07.832
We talked to pharmaceutical companies.

00:07:07.856 --> 00:07:10.686
We actually looked at the data for drugs,

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.882
over 2,000 drugs that had been approved
or denied or withdrawn,

00:07:14.906 --> 00:07:17.257
and we also ran millions of simulations.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.760
And all that actually took a lot of time.

00:07:20.784 --> 00:07:24.077
But when we were done, we found something
that was sort of surprising.

00:07:24.101 --> 00:07:25.927
It was feasible to structure that fund

00:07:25.951 --> 00:07:28.043
such that when you were done
structuring it,

00:07:28.067 --> 00:07:32.006
you could actually produce low-risk bonds
that would be attractive to bond holders,
