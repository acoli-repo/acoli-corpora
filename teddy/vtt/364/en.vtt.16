00:07:57.183 --> 00:08:01.998
in medical journals, in finance journals.

00:08:02.022 --> 00:08:05.467
But it wasn't until we actually
got the popular press interested in this

00:08:05.491 --> 00:08:07.696
that we began to get some traction.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.956
We wanted to do more
than just make people aware of it.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.560
We wanted people to get involved.

00:08:12.584 --> 00:08:15.697
So we took all of our computer code
and made that available online

00:08:15.721 --> 00:08:18.409
under an open-source license
to anybody that wanted it.

00:08:18.433 --> 00:08:20.128
And you guys can download it today

00:08:20.152 --> 00:08:23.279
if you want to run your own experiments
to see if this would work.

00:08:23.303 --> 00:08:24.788
And that was really effective,

00:08:24.812 --> 00:08:27.176
because people that didn't
believe our assumptions

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.351
could try their own
and see how it would work.

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:31.361
Now there's an obvious problem, which is,
