00:03:29.663 --> 00:03:32.522
In the next phase, you test
to see if the drug's effective,

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:34.336
and you give it to people with cancer

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.091
and you see if it makes them better.

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:38.433
And that's also a higher hurdle.
People drop out.

00:03:38.457 --> 00:03:41.263
And in the third phase,
you test it on a very large sample,

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:44.395
and you're trying to determine
what the right dose is,

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.621
is it better than what's available today?
If not, then why build it?

00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:49.835
When you're done with all that,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.445
what you have is a very small
percentage of drugs

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:55.295
that start the process
actually come out the other side.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.033
So those blue bottles --
those blue bottles save lives,

00:03:59.057 --> 00:04:02.117
and they're also worth billions,
sometimes billions a year.
