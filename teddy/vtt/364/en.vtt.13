00:06:29.704 --> 00:06:32.062
Most of them don't make it,
but a few of them do,

00:06:32.086 --> 00:06:34.592
and with the ones that gain
value, you can sell some,

00:06:34.616 --> 00:06:35.854
and when you sell them,

00:06:35.878 --> 00:06:38.216
you have money to pay
the interest on those bonds,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.291
but also to fund the next round of trials.

00:06:40.315 --> 00:06:41.540
It's almost self-funding.

00:06:41.564 --> 00:06:43.844
You do that for the course
of the transaction,

00:06:43.868 --> 00:06:46.297
and when you're done,
you liquidate the portfolio,

00:06:46.321 --> 00:06:49.643
pay back the bonds, and you can give
the equity holders a nice return.

00:06:49.667 --> 00:06:51.842
That was the theory,
and we talked about it,

00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:53.336
we did a bunch of experiments,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.528
and then we said,
let's really try to test it.

00:06:55.552 --> 00:06:58.436
We spent the next two years
doing research.

00:06:58.915 --> 00:07:03.283
We talked to hundreds of experts
in drug financing and venture capital.
