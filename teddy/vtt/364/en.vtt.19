00:09:29.293 --> 00:09:31.073
It was an invitation-only conference.

00:09:31.097 --> 00:09:33.347
It was sponsored
by the American Cancer Society

00:09:33.371 --> 00:09:36.780
and done in collaboration
with the National Cancer Institute.

00:09:36.804 --> 00:09:39.762
We had experts from every field
we thought would be important,

00:09:39.786 --> 00:09:42.783
including the government, and people
that run research centers,

00:09:42.807 --> 00:09:45.244
and for two days they heard the reports

00:09:45.268 --> 00:09:47.860
from those five work streams,
and talked about it.

00:09:47.884 --> 00:09:50.722
It was the first time the people
who could make this happen

00:09:50.746 --> 00:09:53.813
sat across the table from each other
and had these conversations.

00:09:53.837 --> 00:09:57.334
Now these conferences,
it's typical to have a dinner,

00:09:57.358 --> 00:10:00.130
and at that dinner,
you get to know each other,
