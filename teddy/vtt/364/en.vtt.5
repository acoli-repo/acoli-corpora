Imagine that you're in your lab --
you're a scientist, you're not like me --

00:02:34.336 --> 00:02:36.308
and you've developed a new compound

00:02:36.332 --> 00:02:40.188
that you think might be therapeutic
for somebody with cancer.

00:02:40.212 --> 00:02:43.868
Well, what you do is, you test in animals,
you test in test tubes,

00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:46.952
but there's this notion
of going from the bench to the bedside,

00:02:46.976 --> 00:02:50.628
and in order to get from the bench,
the lab, to the bedside, to the patients,

00:02:50.652 --> 00:02:52.482
you've got to get the drug tested.

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:54.110
And the way the drug gets tested

00:02:54.134 --> 00:02:56.355
is through a series of,
basically, experiments,

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.410
through these large,
they're called trials,

00:02:58.434 --> 00:03:00.789
that they do to determine
whether the drug is safe
