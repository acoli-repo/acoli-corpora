00:09:57.358 --> 00:10:00.130
and at that dinner,
you get to know each other,

00:10:00.154 --> 00:10:01.895
sort of like what we're doing here.

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:03.565
I happened to look out the window,

00:10:03.589 --> 00:10:04.885
and hand on my heart,

00:10:04.909 --> 00:10:07.721
on the night of this conference --
it was the summertime --

00:10:07.745 --> 00:10:09.989
and that's what I saw, a double rainbow.

00:10:10.013 --> 00:10:11.956
So I'd like to think it was a good sign.

00:10:12.082 --> 00:10:16.283
Since the conference, we've got people
working between Paris and San Francisco,

00:10:16.307 --> 00:10:18.176
lots of different folks working on this

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.651
to try to see if we can
really make it happen.

00:10:20.932 --> 00:10:24.335
We're not looking to start a fund,
but we want somebody else to do this.

00:10:24.359 --> 00:10:26.529
Because, again, I'm not a scientist.

00:10:26.553 --> 00:10:28.432
I can't build a drug.

00:10:28.456 --> 00:10:32.082
I'm never going to have enough money
to fund even one of those trials.
