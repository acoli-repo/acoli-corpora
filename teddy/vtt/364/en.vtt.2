00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.920
And what I want to talk about today

00:01:00.944 --> 00:01:03.816
is how we can help
more people like my dad,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.794
because we have to change the way
we think about raising money

00:01:06.818 --> 00:01:08.212
to fund cancer research.

00:01:09.273 --> 00:01:11.207
So a while after my dad was diagnosed,

00:01:11.231 --> 00:01:14.006
I was having coffee
with my friend Andrew Lo.

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:17.673
He's the head of the Laboratory
for Financial Engineering at MIT,

00:01:17.697 --> 00:01:19.635
where I also have a position,

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.261
and we were talking about cancer.

00:01:21.285 --> 00:01:23.679
And Andrew had been doing
his own bits of research,

00:01:23.703 --> 00:01:25.797
and one of the things
that he had been told

00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:30.266
and that he'd learned
from studying the literature
