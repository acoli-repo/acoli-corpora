00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:31.361
Now there's an obvious problem, which is,

00:08:31.385 --> 00:08:33.660
is there enough money
in the world to fund this?

00:08:33.684 --> 00:08:36.601
I've told you there's enough drugs,
but is there enough money?

00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:38.531
There's 100 trillion dollars of capital

00:08:38.555 --> 00:08:41.549
currently invested
in fixed-income securities.

00:08:42.632 --> 00:08:44.465
That's a hundred thousand billion.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.927
There's plenty of money.

00:08:47.951 --> 00:08:50.957
(Laughter)

00:08:52.088 --> 00:08:54.831
But we realized it's more than
just money that's required.

00:08:54.855 --> 00:08:56.855
We had to get people motivated, involved,

00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:58.529
and get them to understand this.

00:08:58.775 --> 00:09:02.310
And we started thinking about all
the different things that could go wrong.
