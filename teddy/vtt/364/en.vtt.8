00:03:59.057 --> 00:04:02.117
and they're also worth billions,
sometimes billions a year.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.375
So now here's a question:

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:07.641
if I were to ask you, for example,

00:04:07.665 --> 00:04:11.630
to make a one-time investment of, say,
200 million dollars

00:04:11.654 --> 00:04:13.298
to buy one of those bottles,

00:04:13.322 --> 00:04:16.674
so 200 million dollars up front, one time,
to buy one of those bottles,

00:04:16.698 --> 00:04:18.314
I won't tell you which one it is,

00:04:18.338 --> 00:04:22.239
and in 10 years, I'll tell you whether
you have one of the blue ones.

00:04:22.263 --> 00:04:24.394
Does that sound like a good
deal for anybody?

00:04:24.418 --> 00:04:25.656
No. No, right?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.214
And of course, it's a very,
very risky trial position,

00:04:28.238 --> 00:04:30.380
and that's why it's very hard
to get funding,
