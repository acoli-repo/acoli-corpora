00:07:28.067 --> 00:07:32.006
you could actually produce low-risk bonds
that would be attractive to bond holders,

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.770
that would give you yields
of about five to eight percent,

00:07:34.794 --> 00:07:36.259
and you could produce equity

00:07:36.283 --> 00:07:38.978
that would give equity holders
about a 12 percent return.

00:07:39.002 --> 00:07:42.384
Now those returns aren't going
to be attractive to a venture capitalist.

00:07:42.408 --> 00:07:43.941
They want to make those big bets

00:07:43.965 --> 00:07:45.758
and get those billion dollar payoffs.

00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:49.433
But it turns out there are lots of other
folks that would be interested.

00:07:49.457 --> 00:07:53.036
That's right in the investment sweet spot
of pension funds and 401(k) plans

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.358
and all this other stuff.

00:07:54.687 --> 00:07:57.159
So we published some articles
in the academic press,

00:07:57.183 --> 00:08:01.998
in medical journals, in finance journals.
