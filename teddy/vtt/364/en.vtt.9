00:04:28.238 --> 00:04:30.380
and that's why it's very hard
to get funding,

00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:33.200
but to a first approximation,
that's actually the proposal.

00:04:33.224 --> 00:04:35.834
You have to fund these things
from the early stages on.

00:04:35.858 --> 00:04:37.125
It takes a long time.

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:40.566
So Andrew said to me, he said,

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.036
"What if we stop thinking
about these as drugs?

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.846
What if we start thinking
about them as financial assets?"

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.514
They've got really weird payoff
structures and all that,

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.878
but let's throw everything we know
about financial engineering at them.

00:04:51.902 --> 00:04:54.362
Let's see if we can use
all the tricks of the trade

00:04:54.386 --> 00:04:57.733
to figure out how to make these drugs
work as financial assets.

00:04:58.344 --> 00:04:59.790
Let's create a giant fund.
