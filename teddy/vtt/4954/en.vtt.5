00:02:29.337 --> 00:02:33.167
you’ll be left with 30 seconds 
on the second fuse.

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:35.197
Just when you’ve got this all figured out,

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:37.037
you see the signal from your partner,

00:02:37.037 --> 00:02:38.767
and spring into action.

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:43.037
You gather the four ends of the two 
fuses and light three of them.

00:02:43.037 --> 00:02:44.843
The moment the first burns out,

00:02:44.843 --> 00:02:47.883
you light the other end 
of the second fuse.

00:02:47.883 --> 00:02:49.403
When it flickers and dies,

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:52.613
you know that exactly 45 
seconds have passed,

00:02:52.613 --> 00:02:55.503
and the electric fence is dead.

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:57.688
By the time it hiccups back to life,

00:02:57.688 --> 00:03:00.518
you’re over the fence and home free.
