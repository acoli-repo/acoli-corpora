00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.769
It’ll automatically restart 
after a second or two,

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.649
but as long as you move fast,

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:34.349
you’ll be home free.

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:35.739
And then you notice,

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:36.899
to your horror,

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.489
that your watch is broken,

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.159
and there’s no time to fix it.

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:41.329
The signal is coming,

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.769
and if you make even a small mistake 
in counting off 45 seconds,

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.760
you’ll get fried.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.990
Searching your pockets,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.290
you find something that might help:

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.320
a lighter and two fuses you made earlier 
in the prison work program.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.430
Each fuse is a length of flammable twine,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.250
built to be lit on either end 
and burn for precisely one minute.
