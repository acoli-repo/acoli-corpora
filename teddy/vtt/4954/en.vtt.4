00:01:58.092 --> 00:02:01.712
That means that if you lit it 
from both ends simultaneously,

00:02:01.712 --> 00:02:05.162
it would burn out in precisely 30 seconds.


00:02:05.162 --> 00:02:08.022
But how will you time the last fifteen?

00:02:08.022 --> 00:02:10.662
That’ll have to come from the second fuse.

00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:12.542
If it were a 30 second fuse,

00:02:12.542 --> 00:02:14.832
you’d be able to use that same trick again

00:02:14.832 --> 00:02:19.772
to double the burning speed and 
make it last exactly 15 seconds.

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:22.937
And, you realize, you can 
shorten the second fuse

00:02:22.937 --> 00:02:27.197
by lighting one end of it at the same time
as you light the first.

00:02:27.197 --> 00:02:29.337
At the moment the first burns out,

00:02:29.337 --> 00:02:33.167
you’ll be left with 30 seconds 
on the second fuse.
