built to be lit on either end 
and burn for precisely one minute.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.650
The problem is that even though 
the fuses look uniform,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.470
they don’t burn evenly,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.870
so if you cut one in half, for example,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.200
one side might burn longer than the other.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.710
Your partner is going to give 
the signal any minute,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.430
and you’ll have to make your move.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.610
How can you use the fuses and lighter 
to time exactly 45 seconds?

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.500
