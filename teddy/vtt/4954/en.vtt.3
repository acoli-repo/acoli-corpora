Answer in 1

00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:37.702
The length of the fuse may 
not tell you anything,

00:01:37.702 --> 00:01:43.052
but you do know the fuses take exactly
60 seconds to burn from end to end.

00:01:43.052 --> 00:01:44.412
Here’s the key insight:

00:01:44.412 --> 00:01:48.682
If you start a fuse on one side 
and it burns for 30 seconds,

00:01:48.682 --> 00:01:52.192
there’ll still be 30 seconds of fuse left.

00:01:52.192 --> 00:01:54.142
If you had started it from the other end,

00:01:54.142 --> 00:01:58.092
it would’ve reached the exact 
same spot in thirty seconds.

00:01:58.092 --> 00:02:01.712
That means that if you lit it 
from both ends simultaneously,
