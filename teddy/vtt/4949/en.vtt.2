00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:04.236
he began writing novels and essays
while taking a series of odd jobs.

00:01:04.236 --> 00:01:06.605
But the issues that had driven him 
away from the Church

00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:09.860
were still inescapable in his daily life.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.674
Constantly confronted with racism 
and homophobia,

00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:16.730
he was angry and disillusioned, 
and yearned for a less restricted life.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.085
So in 1948, 
at the age of 24,

00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:23.035
he moved to Paris on a writing fellowship.

00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:25.571
From France, he published his first novel,

00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:28.814
"Go Tell it on the Mountain," in 1953.

00:01:28.814 --> 00:01:29.794
Set in Harlem,

00:01:29.794 --> 00:01:34.467
the book explores the Church 
as a source of both repression and hope.
