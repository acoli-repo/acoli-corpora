00:03:29.978 --> 00:03:33.044
for his choice to live abroad,
as well as his sexuality,

00:03:33.044 --> 00:03:35.126
which he explored openly 
in his writing

00:03:35.126 --> 00:03:37.897
at a time when homophobia ran rampant.

00:03:37.897 --> 00:03:39.113
Throughout his life,

00:03:39.113 --> 00:03:42.012
Baldwin considered it his role
to bear witness.

00:03:42.012 --> 00:03:43.562
Unlike many of his peers,

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.853
he lived to see some of the
victories of the Civil Rights movement,

00:03:46.853 --> 00:03:51.333
but the continuing racial inequalities in 
the United States weighed heavily on him.

00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:53.981
Though he may have felt trapped 
in his moment in history,

00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:56.775
his words have made generations 
of people feel known,

00:03:56.775 --> 00:03:59.475
while guiding them toward a more 
nuanced understanding

00:03:59.475 --> 00:04:02.524
of society’s most complex issues.
