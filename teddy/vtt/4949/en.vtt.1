00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:31.536
During the years when the FBI hounded him,

00:00:31.536 --> 00:00:35.350
he became one of the best-selling
black authors in the world.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.913
So what made James Baldwin loom 
so large in the imaginations

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:42.105
of both the public and the authorities?

00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:44.022
Born in Harlem in 1924,

00:00:44.022 --> 00:00:46.344
he was the oldest of nine children.

00:00:46.344 --> 00:00:49.609
At age fourteen,
he began to work as a preacher.

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.093
By delivering sermons,
he developed his voice as a writer,

00:00:53.093 --> 00:00:55.462
but also grew conflicted about the Church’s stance

00:00:55.462 --> 00:00:59.010
on racial inequality and homosexuality.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.971
After high school,

00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:04.236
he began writing novels and essays
while taking a series of odd jobs.
