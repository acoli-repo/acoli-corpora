00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.456
And so, out of the blue,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.536
I decided to write
to the lead imaging scientist

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.776
on the Archimedes palimpsest project,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.296
Professor Roger Easton,

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.136
with a plan and a plea.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.200
And to my surprise,
he actually wrote back.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.656
With his help, I was able
to win a grant from the US government

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.696
to build a transportable,
multispectral imaging lab,

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.536
And with this lab, I transformed
what was a charred and faded mess

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.560
into a new medieval classic.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.136
So how does multispectral
imaging actually work?
