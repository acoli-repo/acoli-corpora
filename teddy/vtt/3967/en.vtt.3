Several years ago, I conducted
a survey of European research libraries

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.936
and discovered that,
at the barest minimum,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.176
there are 60,000 manuscripts

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.816
pre-1500

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.776
that are illegible
because of water damage,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.776
fading, mold and chemical reagents.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.776
The real number is likely double that,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.976
and that doesn't even count

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.616
Renaissance manuscripts
and modern manuscripts

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.760
and cultural heritage
objects such as maps.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.416
What if there were a technology
