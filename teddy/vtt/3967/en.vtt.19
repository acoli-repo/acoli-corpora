00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.656
The problem with this map
is that its inks and pigments

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.776
had so degraded over time

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.936
that this large, nearly seven-foot map,

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.040
made the world look like a giant desert.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.136
Until now, we had very little idea,
detailed idea, that is,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.816
of what Columbus knew of the world

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.760
and how world cultures were represented.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.376
The main legend of the map
was entirely illegible under normal light.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.656
Ultraviolet did very little for it.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.680
Multispectral gave us everything.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.216
In Asia, we learned of monsters
with ears so long

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.560
that they could cover
the creature's entire body.
