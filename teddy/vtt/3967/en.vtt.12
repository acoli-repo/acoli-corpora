00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.096
and used by people
like geospatial scientists

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.320
and the CIA.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.336
The results can be spectacular.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.536
You may already have heard
of what's been done

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.936
for the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.520
which are slowly gelatinizing.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.136
Using infrared, we've been able
to read even the darkest corners

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.880
of the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.336
You may not be aware, however,

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.096
of other Biblical texts
that are in jeopardy.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.536
Here, for example,
is a leaf from a manuscript

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.336
that we imaged,

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.240
which is perhaps the most valuable
Christian Bible in the world.
