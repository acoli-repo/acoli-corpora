00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.056
a discoverer of literature,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.976
an Indiana Jones without the whip --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.496
or, actually, with the whip.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.736
(Laughter)

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.456
And I wanted it not just for myself
but I wanted it for my students as well.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.376
And so six years ago,
I changed the direction of my career.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.416
At the time, I was working
on "The Chess of Love,"

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.296
the last important long poem
of the European Middle Ages

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.936
never to have been edited.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.976
And it wasn't edited because
it existed in only one manuscript

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.256
which was so badly damaged
during the firebombing of Dresden

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.496
in World War II

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.400
that generations of scholars
had pronounced it lost.
