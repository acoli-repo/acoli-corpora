Having a lab that can travel
to collections where it's needed, however,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.760
is only part of the solution.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.336
The technology is expensive and very rare,

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.576
and the imaging and image
processing skills are esoteric.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.296
That means that mounting recoveries

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:46.216
is beyond the reach of most researchers
and all but the wealthiest institutions.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.016
That's why I founded the Lazarus Project,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.696
a not-for-profit initiative

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.696
to bring multispectral imaging
to individual researchers

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.560
and smaller institutions
at little or no cost whatsoever.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.176
Over the past five years,
