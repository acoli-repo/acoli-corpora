00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.016
the knowledge of how texts are made

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.176
in order to be able
to place and date them --

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.936
with new techniques like imaging science,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.536
the chemistry of inks and pigments,

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.960
computer-aided optical
character recognition.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.576

As he worked, tiny Greek writing
began to appear from behind the text.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.696
Everyone gathered around,

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.376
and he read a line from a lost work
