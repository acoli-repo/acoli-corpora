00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.696
from banks of LEDs,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.576
and another multispectral light source

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.553
which comes up through
the individual leaves of the manuscript.

00:05:35.577 --> 00:05:40.096
Up to 35 images per sequence
per leaf are imaged this way

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.740
using a high-powered digital camera
equipped with a lens

00:05:42.764 --> 00:05:44.736
which is made out of quartz.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.856
There are about five
of these in the world.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.696
And once we capture these images,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.776
we feed them through
statistical algorithms

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.296
to further enhance and clarify them,

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.696
using software which was originally
designed for satellite images

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.096
and used by people
like geospatial scientists
