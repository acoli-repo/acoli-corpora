More subtly, though, it can recover
a second story behind every object,

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:38.176
the story of how, when
and by whom a text was created,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.600
and, sometimes, what the author
was thinking at the time he wrote.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.696
Take, for example, a draft
of the Declaration of Independence

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.136
written in Thomas Jefferson's own hand,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.589
which some colleagues of mine
imaged a few years ago

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:51.933
at the Library of Congress.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.056
Curators had noticed
that one word throughout

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.456
had been scratched out and overwritten.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.560
The word overwritten was "citizens."
