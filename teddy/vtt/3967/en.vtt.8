that generations of scholars
had pronounced it lost.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.856
For five years, I had been working
with an ultraviolet lamp

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.776
trying to recover traces of the writing

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.216
and I'd gone about as far
as technology at the time

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.616
could actually take me.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.736
And so I did what many people do.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.776
I went online,

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.536
and there I learned about

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.136
how multispectral imaging had been used
to recover two lost treatises

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.056
of the famed Greek
mathematician Archimedes

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.616
from a 13th-century palimpsest.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.920
A palimpsest is a manuscript
which has been erased and overwritten.
