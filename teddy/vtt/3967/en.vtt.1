00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.056
Unknown in the West,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.496
this was the collected wisdom
of an entire continent,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.600
the voice of Africa at a time when Africa
was thought not to have a voice at all.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.976
The mayor of Bamako,
who witnessed the event,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.936
called the burning of the manuscripts

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.200
"a crime against world cultural heritage."

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.416
And he was right --

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.880
or he would have been, if it weren't
for the fact that he was also lying.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.296
In fact, just before,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.456
African scholars had collected
a random assortment of old books

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.976
and left them out
for the terrorists to burn.
