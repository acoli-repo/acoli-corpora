Over the past five years,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.056
our team of imaging scientists,
scholars and students

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.256
has travelled to seven different countries

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.136
and have recovered some of the world's
most valuable damaged manuscripts,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160
included the Vercelli Book,
which is the oldest book of English,

00:08:14.184 --> 00:08:16.800
the Black Book of Carmarthen,
the oldest book of Welsh,

00:08:16.824 --> 00:08:20.296
and some of the most valuable
earliest Gospels

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.200
located in what is now
the former Soviet Georgia.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.560
So, spectral imaging
can recover lost texts.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.456
More subtly, though, it can recover
a second story behind every object,
