00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm speaking to you about what I call the "mesh."

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's essentially a fundamental shift

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in our relationship with stuff, with the things in our lives.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And it's starting to look at --

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
not always and not for everything --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but in certain moments of time,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
access to certain kinds of goods and service

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
will trump ownership of them.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And so it's the pursuit of better things,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
easily shared.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And we come from a long tradition of sharing.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We've shared transportation.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We've shared wine and food
