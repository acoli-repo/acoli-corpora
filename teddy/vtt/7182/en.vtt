Meg Jay: We need to talk
about the empathy gap.

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:06.156
So the empathy gap is
why we sometimes hate on people

00:00:06.156 --> 00:00:08.796
on the other end
of the political spectrum.

00:00:08.836 --> 00:00:10.876
Or it's why maybe we shrug their shoulders

00:00:10.916 --> 00:00:13.516
at the problems of those
who look different

00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:16.596
or live different
or love different than we do.

00:00:16.636 --> 00:00:19.676
It's why we almost certainly
aren't doing enough

00:00:19.716 --> 00:00:23.716
to protect our kids and grandkids
from climate change.

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:29.236
It can just be difficult sometimes
to care about people that we don't know

00:00:29.236 --> 00:00:32.836
or to do right by people
who don't even exist yet.
