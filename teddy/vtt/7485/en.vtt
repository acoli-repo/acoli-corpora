It may sound strange to bring up work,

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.872
but when we fall in love,

00:00:03.896 --> 00:00:07.346
we often consider
what that love will do to our life,

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.607
and our work and careers
are a big part of that.

00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:17.676
All working couples face hard choices,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.016
and these can feel like a zero-sum game.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.656
One partner gets offered
a job in another city,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.586
so the other needs to leave
their job and start over.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.046
One partner takes on more childcare
and puts their career on hold

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.066
so the other can pursue
an exciting promotion.
