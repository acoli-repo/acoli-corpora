When I got my current job, I was given a good piece of advice,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which was to interview three politicians every day.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And from that much contact with politicians,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I can tell you they're all emotional freaks of one sort or another.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
They have what I called "logorrhea dementia,"

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
(Laughter)

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But what they do have is incredible social skills.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
When you meet them, they lock into you,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
they look you in the eye,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
they invade your personal space,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
they massage the back of your head.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I had dinner with a Republican senator several months ago
