Good afternoon.

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:06.976
There's a medical revolution
happening all around us,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.096
and it's one that's going
to help us conquer

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.120
some of society's most dreaded conditions,

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:12.350
including cancer.

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:16.635
The revolution is called angiogenesis,

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:20.620
and it's based on the process
that our bodies use to grow blood vessels.

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.326
So why should we care about blood vessels?

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.158
Well, the human body
is literally packed with them --

00:00:26.182 --> 00:00:29.166
60,000 miles worth in a typical adult.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.174
End to end, that would form a line
that would circle the earth twice.
