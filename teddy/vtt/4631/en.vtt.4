00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:03.139
also consists of a long, tube-like 
structure called a proboscis

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:06.355
that works like a straw 
to suck up nectar from flowers.

00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:08.534
Insects of the Lepidoptera order—

00:02:08.534 --> 00:02:10.204
butterflies and moths—

00:02:10.204 --> 00:02:13.681
keep their proboscises rolled
up tightly beneath their heads

00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:14.682
when they’re not feeding

00:02:14.682 --> 00:02:18.674
and unfurl them when 
they come across some sweet nectar.

00:02:18.674 --> 00:02:21.258
With the sponging mouthpart,
there’s yet another tube,

00:02:21.258 --> 00:02:23.935
this time ending in two spongy lobes

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:27.564
that contain many finer 
tubes called pseudotracheae.

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:30.683
The pseudotracheae secrete 
enzyme-filled saliva
