00:02:58.564 --> 00:03:01.789
and a proboscis with a tongue-like 
structure at its tip

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:03.365
for lapping up nectar.

00:03:03.365 --> 00:03:05.115
On this type of mouthpart,

00:03:05.115 --> 00:03:08.626
the mandibles themselves 
are not actually used for eating.

00:03:08.626 --> 00:03:12.374
For bees and wasps,
members of the Hymenoptera order,

00:03:12.374 --> 00:03:17.162
they serve instead as tools 
for pollen-collecting and wax-molding.

00:03:17.162 --> 00:03:20.574
Of course, in nature, there are always 
exceptions to the rules.

00:03:20.574 --> 00:03:23.508
The juvenile stages of some insects, 
for example,

00:03:23.508 --> 00:03:27.107
have completely different kinds 
of mouths than their adult versions,

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:30.510
like caterpillars, which use chewing 
mouthparts to devour leaves
