like caterpillars, which use chewing 
mouthparts to devour leaves

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.460
before metamorphosing into
butterflies and moths

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.274
with siphoning mouthparts.

00:03:35.274 --> 00:03:38.449
Still, mouthpart identification can, 
for the most part,

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.930
help scientists—and you
—categorize insects.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.852
So why not break out a magnifying lens

00:03:43.852 --> 00:03:47.051
and learn a little more about
who’s nibbling your vegetable garden,

00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:48.255
biting your arm,

00:03:48.255 --> 00:03:50.051
or just flying by your ear.
