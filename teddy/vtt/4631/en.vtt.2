It’s also the most primitive—

00:01:00.503 --> 00:01:04.225
all other mouthparts are thought to have 
started out looking like this one

00:01:04.225 --> 00:01:06.565
before evolving into something different.

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:09.647
It features a pair 
of jaws called mandibles

00:01:09.647 --> 00:01:13.832
with toothed inner edges that cut up 
and crush solid foods,

00:01:13.832 --> 00:01:16.215
like leaves or other insects.

00:01:16.215 --> 00:01:19.894
You can find this mouthpart 
on ants from the Hymenoptera order,

00:01:19.894 --> 00:01:22.909
grasshoppers and crickets 
of the Orthoptera order,

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.589
dragonflies of the Odonata order,

00:01:25.589 --> 00:01:28.657
and beetles of the Coleoptera order.

00:01:28.657 --> 00:01:34.321
The piercing-sucking mouthpart consists of
a long, tube-like structure called a beak.
