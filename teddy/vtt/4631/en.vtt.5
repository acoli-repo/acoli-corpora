00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:30.683
The pseudotracheae secrete 
enzyme-filled saliva

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:35.084
and soak up fluids 
and dissolved foods by capillary action.

00:02:35.084 --> 00:02:36.469
House flies,

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:37.570
fruit flies,

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.573
and the other non-biting 
members of the Diptera order

00:02:40.573 --> 00:02:43.373
are the only insects 
that use this technique.

00:02:43.373 --> 00:02:44.736
But, there’s a catch.

00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:46.763
Biting flies within Diptera,

00:02:46.763 --> 00:02:47.834
like mosquitoes,

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:48.676
horse flies,

00:02:48.676 --> 00:02:49.750
and deer flies,

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.251
have a piercing-sucking mouthpart 
instead of the sponging mouthpart.

00:02:54.251 --> 00:02:58.564
And finally, the chewing-lapping mouthpart
is a combination of mandibles

00:02:58.564 --> 00:03:01.789
and a proboscis with a tongue-like 
structure at its tip
