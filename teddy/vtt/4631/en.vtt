00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:08.708
A whip-like straw.

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:11.045
Powerful, crushing blades.

00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:13.605
A pointed, piercing tube.

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:17.079
There are nearly a million 
known insect species in the world,

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:20.821
but most have one of just 
five common types of mouthparts.

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:23.058
And thatâ€™s extremely useful to scientists

00:00:23.058 --> 00:00:26.003
because when they encounter 
an unfamiliar insect in the wild,

00:00:26.003 --> 00:00:30.434
they can learn a lot about it 
just by examining how it eats.
