Scientific classification, or taxonomy,

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:37.345
is used to organize all 
living things into seven levels:

00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:38.513
kingdom,

00:00:38.513 --> 00:00:39.414
phylum,

00:00:39.414 --> 00:00:40.558
class,

00:00:40.558 --> 00:00:41.563
order,

00:00:41.563 --> 00:00:42.595
family,

00:00:42.595 --> 00:00:43.696
genus,

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:45.485
and species.

00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:50.941
The features of an insect’s mouthparts can
help identify which order it belongs to,

00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:56.431
while also providing clues about how 
it evolved and what it feeds on.

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.973
The chewing mouthpart is the most common.

00:00:58.973 --> 00:01:00.503
It’s also the most primitive—
