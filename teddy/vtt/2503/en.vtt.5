Well, I had a lot of time to think
during those eight hours and no sleep.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.496
(Laughter)

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.176
And I started wondering,
are there things that I can do,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.136

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.616
that will prevent bad things
from happening?

I was having dinner with my colleague,
Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner,

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.936
and I somewhat embarrassedly told him
about having broken my window,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.376
and, you know, forgotten my passport,
