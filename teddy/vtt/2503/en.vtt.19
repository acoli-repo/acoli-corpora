00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.336
For the most widely performed surgery
on men over the age of 50,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.576
removal of the prostate for cancer,

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.176
the number needed to treat is 49.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.376
That's right, 49 surgeries are done
for every one person who's helped.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.056
And the side effects in that case
occur in 50 percent of the patients.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.936
They include impotence,
erectile dysfunction,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.736
urinary incontinence, rectal tearing,

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.216
fecal incontinence.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.736
And if you're lucky, and you're one
of the 50 percent who has these,

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.800
they'll only last for a year or two.
