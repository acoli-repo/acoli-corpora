a hook by the door,
maybe a decorative bowl.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.296
For your passport, a particular drawer.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.096
For your reading glasses,
a particular table.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.576
If you designate a spot
and you're scrupulous about it,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.416
your things will always be there
when you look for them.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.656
What about travel?

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.056
Take a cell phone picture
of your credit cards,

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.376
your driver's license, your passport,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.656
mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.056
If these things are lost or stolen,
you can facilitate replacement.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.696
Now these are some rather obvious things.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.256
Remember, when you're under stress,
the brain releases cortisol.
