00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.216
and I know a little bit
about how the brain performs under stress.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.776
It releases cortisol
that raises your heart rate,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.056
it modulates adrenaline levels

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.560
and it clouds your thinking.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.056
So the next morning,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.536
when I woke up on too little sleep,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.296
worrying about the hole in the window,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.096
and a mental note
that I had to call my contractor,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.816
and the freezing temperatures,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.296
and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.856
and, you know, with all
the cortisol in my brain,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.256
my thinking was cloudy,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.696
but I didn't know it was cloudy
because my thinking was cloudy.
