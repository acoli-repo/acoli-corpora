00:07:29.578 --> 00:07:31.109
And it's not the doctor's fault,

00:07:31.134 --> 00:07:34.053
if it's anybody's fault,
it's the fault of scientists like me.

00:07:34.077 --> 00:07:36.942
We haven't figured out
the underlying mechanisms well enough.

00:07:36.966 --> 00:07:39.376
But GlaxoSmithKline estimates

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.376
that 90 percent of the drugs work
in only 30 to 50 percent of the people.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.216
So the number needed to treat
for the most widely prescribed statin,

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.376
what do you suppose it is?

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.216
How many people have to take it
before one person is helped?

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.440
300.

00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:56.456
This is according to research

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.976
by research practitioners
Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband,
