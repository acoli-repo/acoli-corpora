00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.096
to put systems in place
that will help minimize the damage,

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.640
or to prevent the bad things
from happening in the first place.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.936
Getting back to that
snowy night in Montreal,

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.696
when I got back from my trip,

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.576
I had my contractor install
a combination lock next to the door,

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.136
with a key to the front door in it,
an easy to remember combination.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.376
And I have to admit,

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.816
I still have piles of mail
that haven't been sorted,

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.416
and piles of emails
that I haven't gone through.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.216
So I'm not completely organized,

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.376
but I see organization
as a gradual process,
