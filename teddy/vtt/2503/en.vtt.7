00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.416
you look ahead and you try to figure out
all the things that could go wrong,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.016
and then you try to figure out
what you can do

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.536
to prevent those things from happening,
or to minimize the damage.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.496
So what I want to talk to you about today

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.056
are some of the things we can do
in the form of a pre-mortem.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.976
Some of them are obvious,
some of them are not so obvious.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.936
I'll start with the obvious ones.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.040
Around the home, designate a place
for things that are easily lost.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.536
Now, this sounds
like common sense, and it is,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.096
but there's a lot of science
to back this up,
