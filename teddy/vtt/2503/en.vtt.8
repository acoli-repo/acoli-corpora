00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.096
but there's a lot of science
to back this up,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.416
based on the way our spatial memory works.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.296
There's a structure in the brain
called the hippocampus,

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.256
that evolved over tens
of thousands of years,

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.056
to keep track of the locations
of important things --

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.496
where the well is,
where fish can be found,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.016
that stand of fruit trees,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.656
where the friendly and enemy tribes live.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.585
The hippocampus is the part of the brain

00:04:22.609 --> 00:04:26.096
that in London taxicab drivers
becomes enlarged.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.816
It's the part of the brain
that allows squirrels to find their nuts.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.698
And if you're wondering,
somebody actually did the experiment
