00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.536
I found a large rock and I broke
through the basement window,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.536
cleared out the shards of glass,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.896
I crawled through,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.336
I found a piece of cardboard
and taped it up over the opening,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.980
figuring that in the morning,
on the way to the airport,

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:14.776
I could call my contractor
and ask him to fix it.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.277
This was going to be expensive,

00:01:16.301 --> 00:01:19.856
but probably no more expensive
than a middle-of-the-night locksmith,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.040
so I figured, under the circumstances,
I was coming out even.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.096
Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.216
and I know a little bit
about how the brain performs under stress.
