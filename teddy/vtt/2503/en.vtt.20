00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.496
So the idea of the pre-mortem
is to think ahead of time

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.056
to the questions
that you might be able to ask

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.456
that will push the conversation forward.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.576
You don't want to have to manufacture
all of this on the spot.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.496
And you also want to think
about things like quality of life.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.296
Because you have a choice oftentimes,

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.616
do you I want a shorter life
that's pain-free,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.416
or a longer life that might have
a great deal of pain towards the end?

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.856
These are things to talk about
and think about now,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.696
with your family and your loved ones.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.216
You might change your mind
in the heat of the moment,
