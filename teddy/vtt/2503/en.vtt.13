00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.256
Now, you all know that high cholesterol

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.416
is associated with an increased risk
of cardiovascular disease,

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.856
heart attack, stroke.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.096
And so you're thinking

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.216
having high cholesterol
isn't the best thing,

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.256
and so the doctor says,
"You know, I'd like to give you a drug

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.056
that will help you
lower your cholesterol, a statin."

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.976
And you've probably heard of statins,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.810
you know that they're among
the most widely prescribed drugs

00:06:49.834 --> 00:06:51.008
in the world today,

00:06:51.032 --> 00:06:53.111
you probably even know
people who take them.

00:06:53.135 --> 00:06:55.516
And so you're thinking,
"Yeah! Give me the statin."

00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:57.976
But there's a question
you should ask at this point,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.856
a statistic you should ask for

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.336
that most doctors
don't like talking about,
