00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.696
but I didn't know it was cloudy
because my thinking was cloudy.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.216
(Laughter)

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.496
And it wasn't until I got
to the airport check-in counter,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.776
that I realized I didn't have my passport.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.816
(Laughter)

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.296
So I raced home in the snow
and ice, 40 minutes,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.776
got my passport,
raced back to the airport,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.616
I made it just in time,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.879
but they had given away
my seat to someone else,

00:02:20.903 --> 00:02:23.879
so I got stuck in the back of the plane,
next to the bathrooms,

00:02:23.903 --> 00:02:27.120
in a seat that wouldn't recline,
on an eight-hour flight.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.336
Well, I had a lot of time to think
during those eight hours and no sleep.
