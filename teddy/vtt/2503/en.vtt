00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.800
A few years ago,
I broke into my own house.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.096
I had just driven home,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.656
it was around midnight
in the dead of Montreal winter,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.976
I had been visiting my friend,
Jeff, across town,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.776
and the thermometer on the front porch
read minus 40 degrees --

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.896
and don't bother asking
if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.376
minus 40 is where the two scales meet --

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.656
it was very cold.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.896
And as I stood on the front porch
fumbling in my pockets,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.176
I found I didn't have my keys.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.296
In fact, I could see them
through the window,
