00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.256
Remember, when you're under stress,
the brain releases cortisol.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.496
Cortisol is toxic,
and it causes cloudy thinking.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.056
So part of the practice of the pre-mortem

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.336
is to recognize that under stress
you're not going to be at your best,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.656
and you should put systems in place.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.616
And there's perhaps
no more stressful a situation

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.056
than when you're confronted
with a medical decision to make.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.376
And at some point, all of us
are going to be in that position,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.776
where we have to make
a very important decision

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.096
about the future of our medical care
or that of a loved one,

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.776
to help them with a decision.
