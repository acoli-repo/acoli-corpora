00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.896
Unfortunately,

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.536
one of the things that goes out the window
during those times of stress

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.536
is rational, logical thinking,

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.976
as Danny Kahneman
and his colleagues have shown.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.176
So we need to train ourselves
to think ahead

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.456
to these kinds of situations.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:21.656
I think the important point here
is recognizing that all of us are flawed.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.536
We all are going to fail now and then.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.176
The idea is to think ahead
to what those failures might be,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.096
to put systems in place
that will help minimize the damage,
