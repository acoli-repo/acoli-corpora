And if you're wondering,
somebody actually did the experiment

00:04:32.722 --> 00:04:35.496
where they cut off
the olfactory sense of the squirrels,

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.336
and they could still find their nuts.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.176
They weren't using smell,
they were using the hippocampus,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.216
this exquisitely evolved mechanism
in the brain for finding things.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.976
But it's really good for things
that don't move around much,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.456
not so good for things that move around.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.776
So this is why we lose car keys
and reading glasses and passports.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.296
So in the home,
designate a spot for your keys --

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.176
a hook by the door,
maybe a decorative bowl.
