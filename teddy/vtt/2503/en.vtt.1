In fact, I could see them
through the window,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.416
lying on the dining room table
where I had left them.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.576
So I quickly ran around
and tried all the other doors and windows,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.176
and they were locked tight.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.343
I thought about calling a locksmith --
at least I had my cellphone,

00:00:41.367 --> 00:00:44.696
but at midnight, it could take a while

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.880

Jeff's house for the night

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.827
because I had an early flight
to Europe the next morning,

00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:56.090
and I needed to get
my passport and my suitcase.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.896
So, desperate and freezing cold,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.536
I found a large rock and I broke
through the basement window,
