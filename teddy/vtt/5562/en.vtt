00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:08.905
Ah, romantic love -

00:00:08.905 --> 00:00:10.839
beautiful and intoxicating,

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.259
heartbreaking and soul-crushing,

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.357
often all at the same time.

00:00:15.357 --> 00:00:18.919
Why do we choose to put ourselves
through its emotional wringer?

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.201
Does love make our lives meaningful,

00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:24.444
or is it an escape from our loneliness
and suffering?

00:00:24.444 --> 00:00:26.705
Is love a disguise for our sexual desire,

00:00:26.705 --> 00:00:30.409
or a trick of biology
to make us procreate?
