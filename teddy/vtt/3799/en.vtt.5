00:02:28.867 --> 00:02:32.536
to set up an agro-processing
factory called Stawi

00:02:32.536 --> 00:02:37.420
to produce gluten-free
banana-based flour and baby food.

00:02:38.242 --> 00:02:41.283
Stawi is leveraging economies of scale

00:02:41.283 --> 00:02:46.164
and using modern manufacturing processes
to create value for not only its owners

00:02:46.164 --> 00:02:49.499
but its workers, who have
an ownership in the business.

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:56.708
Our dream is to take an Eric Muthomi
and try to help him become a Mo Ibrahim,

00:02:56.708 --> 00:03:01.855
which requires skill, financing,
local and global partnerships,
