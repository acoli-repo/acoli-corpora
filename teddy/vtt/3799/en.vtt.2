00:00:58.698 --> 00:01:03.615
have taught me that most people
want jobs instead.

00:01:03.615 --> 00:01:06.750
My solution: Forget micro-entrepreneurs.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.836
Let's invest in building
pan-African titans

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:15.061
like Sudanese businessman Mo Ibrahim.

00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:20.959
Mo took a contrarian bet on Africa when
he founded Celtel International in '98

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:24.494
and built it into a mobile 
cellular provider

00:01:24.494 --> 00:01:30.901
with 24 million subscribers
across 14 African countries by 2004.
