The Mo model might be better
than the everyman entrepreneur model,

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:39.741
which prevents an effective means
of diffusion and knowledge-sharing.

00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:42.357
Perhaps we are not at a stage in Africa

00:01:42.357 --> 00:01:47.624
where many actors and small enterprises
leads to growth through competition.

00:01:47.624 --> 00:01:51.034
Consider these two alternative scenarios.

00:01:51.034 --> 00:01:57.070
One: You loan 200 dollars 
to each of 500 banana farmers

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.967
allowing them to dry 
their surplus bananas

00:01:59.967 --> 00:02:04.295
and fetch 15 percent more revenue
at the local market.
