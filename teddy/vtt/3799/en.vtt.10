00:04:57.471 --> 00:05:01.465
Tom Rielly: So Sangu, of course,
this is strong rhetoric.

00:05:01.465 --> 00:05:04.460
You're making 100 percent contrast
between microcredit

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.825
and regular investment
and growing regular investment.

00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:11.277
Do you think there is
a role for microcredit at all?

00:05:11.277 --> 00:05:13.539
Sangu Delle: I think there is a role.

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.093
Microcredit has been a great,
innovative way

00:05:16.093 --> 00:05:20.063
to expand financial access
to the bottom of the pyramid.

00:05:20.063 --> 00:05:22.315
But for the problems we face in Africa,

00:05:22.315 --> 00:05:24.204
when we are looking
at the Marshall Plan

00:05:24.204 --> 00:05:25.821
to revitalize war-torn Europe,

00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:27.904
it was not full of donations of sheep.

00:05:27.904 --> 00:05:29.626
We need more than just microcredit.

00:05:29.626 --> 00:05:31.757
We need more than just give 200 dollars.
