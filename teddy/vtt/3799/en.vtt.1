pushed for free trade not aid,

00:00:30.226 --> 00:00:34.451
yet the historical record
shows little empirical evidence

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:38.561
that free trade leads to economic growth.

00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:42.460
The newly prescribed 
silver bullet is microcredit.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.177
We seem to be fixated
on this romanticized idea

00:00:46.177 --> 00:00:50.031
that every poor peasant in Africa
is an entrepreneur.

00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:52.098
(Laughter)

00:00:53.328 --> 00:00:58.698
Yet my work and travel
in 40-plus countries across Africa

00:00:58.698 --> 00:01:03.615
have taught me that most people
want jobs instead.
