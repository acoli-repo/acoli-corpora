00:03:59.514 --> 00:04:03.948
develop the local economy,
and we hope to become rich in the process.

00:04:03.948 --> 00:04:06.167
While it's not the sexiest approach,

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:08.415
and maybe it doesn't
achieve the same feel-good

00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:12.306
as giving a woman 100 dollars 
to buy a goat on kiva.org,

00:04:12.306 --> 00:04:16.231
perhaps supporting fewer,
higher-impact entrepreneurs

00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:19.204
to build massive businesses
that scale pan-Africa

00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:22.364
can help change this.

00:04:22.364 --> 00:04:26.918
The political freedom
for which our forebearers fought

00:04:26.918 --> 00:04:30.636
is meaningless without economic freedom.
