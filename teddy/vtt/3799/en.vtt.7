Liberia, four million;
Cape Verde, 500,000.

00:03:31.576 --> 00:03:34.315
Pan-Africa gives you one billion people,

00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:38.472
granted across 55 countries
with trade barriers and other impediments,

00:03:38.472 --> 00:03:41.705
but our ancestors traded
across the continent

00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:44.282
before Europeans drew lines around us.

00:03:44.282 --> 00:03:47.719
The pan-African opportunities
outweigh the challenges,

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:51.155
and that's why we're expanding
Stawi's markets from just Kenya

00:03:51.155 --> 00:03:55.520
to Algeria, Nigeria, Ghana,
and anywhere else that will buy our food.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.514
We hope to help solve food security,
empower farmers, create jobs,

00:03:59.514 --> 00:04:03.948
develop the local economy,
and we hope to become rich in the process.
