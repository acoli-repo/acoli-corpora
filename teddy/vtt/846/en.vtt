00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
You know, culture was born of the imagination,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and the imagination -- the imagination as we know it --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
came into being when our species descended

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
from our progenitor, Homo erectus,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and, infused with consciousness, began a journey that would carry it

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to every corner of the habitable world.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
For a time, we shared the stage with our distant cousins, Neanderthal,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
who clearly had some spark of awareness,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but -- whether it was the increase in the size of the brain,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
or the development of language,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
or some other evolutionary catalyst --
