a collaborative team of scientists
led by Luke Koblan and Jon Levy,

00:12:30.807 --> 00:12:33.220
two additional students in my lab,

00:12:33.244 --> 00:12:37.363
recently used a virus to deliver
that second base editor

00:12:37.387 --> 00:12:39.577
into a mouse with progeria,

00:12:39.601 --> 00:12:43.458
changing that disease-causing
T back into a C

00:12:43.482 --> 00:12:47.588
and reversing its consequences
at the DNA, RNA and protein levels.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.626
Base editors have also
been used in animals

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:54.574
to reverse the consequence of tyrosinemia,

00:12:55.642 --> 00:12:59.260
beta thalassemia, muscular dystrophy,

00:12:59.284 --> 00:13:02.974
phenylketonuria, a congenital deafness
