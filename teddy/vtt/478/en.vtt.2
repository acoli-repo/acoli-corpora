00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:01.098
If that mutation were inherited
from your parents

00:01:01.122 --> 00:01:03.782
or occurred early enough
in your development,

00:01:03.806 --> 00:01:06.772
then the result would be
that many or all of your cells

00:01:06.796 --> 00:01:08.708
contain this harmful mutation.

00:01:09.153 --> 00:01:12.423
And then you would be one
of hundreds of millions of people

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:14.058
with a genetic disease,

00:01:14.082 --> 00:01:17.085
such as sickle cell anemia or progeria

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:20.230
or muscular dystrophy
or Tay-Sachs disease.

00:01:22.225 --> 00:01:25.407
Grievous genetic diseases
caused by point mutations

00:01:25.431 --> 00:01:27.424
are especially frustrating,

00:01:27.448 --> 00:01:30.352
because we often know
the exact single-letter change
