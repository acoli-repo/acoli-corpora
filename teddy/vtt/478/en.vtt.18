But correcting the largest fraction
of disease-causing point mutations

00:09:01.387 --> 00:09:05.022
would require developing
a second class of base editor,

00:09:05.046 --> 00:09:09.132
one that could convert
As into Gs or Ts into Cs.

Led by Nicole Gaudelli,
a former post doc in the lab,

00:09:14.597 --> 00:09:17.719
we set out to develop
this second class of base editor,

00:09:17.743 --> 00:09:23.870
which, in theory, could correct up to
almost half of pathogenic point mutations,

00:09:23.894 --> 00:09:27.805
including that mutation that causes
the rapid-aging disease progeria.
