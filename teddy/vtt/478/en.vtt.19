00:09:30.107 --> 00:09:33.274
We realized that we could
borrow, once again,

00:09:33.298 --> 00:09:37.366
the targeting mechanism of CRISPR scissors

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:42.551
to bring the new base editor
to the right site in a genome.

00:09:43.543 --> 00:09:46.635
But we quickly encountered
an incredible problem;

00:09:47.896 --> 00:09:50.324
namely, there is no protein

00:09:50.348 --> 00:09:54.400
that's known to convert
A into G or T into C

00:09:54.424 --> 00:09:55.585
in DNA.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.926
Faced with such a serious stumbling block,

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.482
most students would probably
look for another project,
