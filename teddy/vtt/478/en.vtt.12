00:05:58.077 --> 00:06:01.018
they directly convert
one base to another base

00:06:01.042 --> 00:06:03.295
without disrupting the rest of the gene.

00:06:04.674 --> 00:06:08.832
So if you think of naturally occurring
CRISPR proteins as molecular scissors,

00:06:08.856 --> 00:06:11.642
you can think of base editors as pencils,

00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:15.162
capable of directly rewriting
one DNA letter into another

00:06:16.098 --> 00:06:19.901
by actually rearranging
the atoms of one DNA base

00:06:19.925 --> 00:06:22.259
to instead become a different base.

00:06:23.513 --> 00:06:25.689
Now, base editors don't exist in nature.

00:06:26.683 --> 00:06:29.913
In fact, we engineered
the first base editor, shown here,

00:06:29.937 --> 00:06:31.294
from three separate proteins
