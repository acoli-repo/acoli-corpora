00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.141
led by a former post doc
in the lab, Alexis Komor,

00:08:30.165 --> 00:08:33.347
we succeeded in developing
this first class of base editor,

00:08:33.371 --> 00:08:37.037
which converts Cs into Ts and Gs into As

00:08:37.061 --> 00:08:39.220
at targeted positions of our choosing.

00:08:40.633 --> 00:08:45.863
Among the more than 35,000 known
disease-associated point mutations,

00:08:45.887 --> 00:08:49.672
the two kinds of mutations
that this first base editor can reverse

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:55.839
collectively account for about 14 percent
or 5,000 or so pathogenic point mutations.

00:08:56.593 --> 00:09:01.363
But correcting the largest fraction
of disease-causing point mutations
