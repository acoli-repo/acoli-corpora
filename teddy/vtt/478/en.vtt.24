00:11:59.015 --> 00:12:02.743
using base editors in organisms
ranging from bacteria

00:12:02.767 --> 00:12:04.901
to plants to mice to primates.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.557
While base editors are too new

00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:12.466
to have already entered
human clinical trials,

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:17.612
scientists have succeeded in achieving
a critical milestone towards that goal

00:12:17.636 --> 00:12:20.485
by using base editors in animals

00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:24.418
to correct point mutations
that cause human genetic diseases.

00:12:25.815 --> 00:12:26.966
For example,

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:30.783
a collaborative team of scientists
led by Luke Koblan and Jon Levy,
