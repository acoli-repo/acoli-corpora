00:01:27.448 --> 00:01:30.352
because we often know
the exact single-letter change

00:01:30.376 --> 00:01:34.576
that causes the disease
and, in theory, could cure the disease.

00:01:35.268 --> 00:01:38.117
Millions suffer from sickle cell anemia

00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:41.212
because they have
a single A to T point mutations

00:01:41.236 --> 00:01:43.597
in both copies of their hemoglobin gene.

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:48.661
And children with progeria
are born with a T

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:50.853
at a single position in their genome

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:52.276
where you have a C,

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:56.564
with the devastating consequence
that these wonderful, bright kids

00:01:56.588 --> 00:02:00.564
age very rapidly and pass away
by about age 14.
