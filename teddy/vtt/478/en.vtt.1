00:00:28.244 --> 00:00:32.473
is the simple swap of one letter,
or base, such as C,

00:00:32.497 --> 00:00:35.738
with a different letter,
such as T, G or A.

00:00:36.744 --> 00:00:40.117
In any day, the cells in your body
will collectively accumulate

00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:44.977
billions of these single-letter swaps,
which are also called "point mutations."

00:00:46.147 --> 00:00:48.678
Now, most of these
point mutations are harmless.

00:00:48.702 --> 00:00:49.860
But every now and then,

00:00:49.884 --> 00:00:53.877
a point mutation disrupts
an important capability in a cell

00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:57.256
or causes a cell to misbehave
in harmful ways.

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:01.098
If that mutation were inherited
from your parents
