who were creative enough to engineer
what we could design ourselves

00:15:31.674 --> 00:15:34.599
and brave enough
to evolve what we couldn't,

00:15:34.623 --> 00:15:39.663
base editing has begun to transform
that science-fiction-like aspiration

00:15:39.687 --> 00:15:41.544
into an exciting new reality,

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.481
one in which the most important gift
we give our children

00:15:45.505 --> 00:15:48.530
may not only be
three billion letters of DNA,

00:15:48.554 --> 00:15:51.664
but also the means to protect
and repair them.

00:15:52.339 --> 00:15:53.490
Thank you.

00:15:53.514 --> 00:15:58.016
(Applause)

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.190
Thank you.
