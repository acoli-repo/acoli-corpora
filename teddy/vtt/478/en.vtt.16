00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:02.515
to flag the nonedited strand
as the one to be replaced

00:08:02.539 --> 00:08:04.450
by nicking that strand.

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:07.805
This little nick tricks the cell

00:08:07.829 --> 00:08:12.776
into replacing the nonedited G with an A

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.125
as it remakes the nicked strand,

00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:19.180
thereby completing the conversion
of what used to be a C-G base pair

00:08:19.204 --> 00:08:21.500
into a stable T-A base pair.

00:08:24.585 --> 00:08:26.136
After several years of hard work

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.141
led by a former post doc
in the lab, Alexis Komor,
