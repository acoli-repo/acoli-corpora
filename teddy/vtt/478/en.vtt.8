00:03:57.554 --> 00:04:00.141
to cut DNA sequences of our choosing,

00:04:00.165 --> 00:04:02.534
including sequences in your genome,

00:04:02.558 --> 00:04:05.901
instead of the viral DNA sequences
chosen by bacteria.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.084
But the outcomes are actually similar.

00:04:09.606 --> 00:04:12.074
Cutting a DNA sequence in your genome

00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:16.225
also disrupts the function
of the cut gene, typically,

00:04:16.997 --> 00:04:21.464
by causing the insertion and deletion
of random mixtures of DNA letters

00:04:21.488 --> 00:04:22.641
at the cut site.

00:04:24.625 --> 00:04:28.506
Now, disrupting genes can be very
useful for some applications.
