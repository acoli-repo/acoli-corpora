00:06:29.937 --> 00:06:31.294
from three separate proteins

00:06:31.318 --> 00:06:33.548
that don't even come
from the same organism.

00:06:34.151 --> 00:06:39.248
We started by taking CRISPR scissors
and disabling the ability to cut DNA

00:06:39.272 --> 00:06:43.811
while retaining its ability to search for
and bind a target DNA sequence

00:06:43.835 --> 00:06:45.369
in a programmed manner.

00:06:46.351 --> 00:06:49.188
To those disabled CRISPR
scissors, shown in blue,

00:06:49.212 --> 00:06:51.720
we attached a second protein in red,

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:56.045
which performs a chemical reaction
on the DNA base C,

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:59.402
converting it into a base
that behaves like T.
