00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:34.306
But for most point mutations
that cause genetic diseases,

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.687
simply cutting the already-mutated gene
won't benefit patients,

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:42.679
because the function of the mutated gene
needs to be restored,

00:04:42.703 --> 00:04:44.318
not further disrupted.

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.141
So cutting this
already-mutated hemoglobin gene

00:04:48.165 --> 00:04:50.688
that causes sickle cell anemia

00:04:50.712 --> 00:04:54.228
won't restore the ability of patients
to make healthy red blood cells.

00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:59.972
And while we can sometimes introduce
new DNA sequences into cells

00:04:59.996 --> 00:05:03.417
to replace the DNA sequences
surrounding a cut site,
