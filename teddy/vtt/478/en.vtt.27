Two companies I cofounded,
Beam Therapeutics and Pairwise Plants,

00:13:35.637 --> 00:13:39.462
are using base editing
to treat human genetic diseases

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:41.092
and to improve agriculture.

00:13:41.953 --> 00:13:43.919
All of these applications of base editing

00:13:43.943 --> 00:13:47.037
have taken place in less
than the past three years:

00:13:47.061 --> 00:13:49.425
on the historical timescale of science,

00:13:49.449 --> 00:13:50.731
the blink of an eye.

00:13:52.657 --> 00:13:53.910
Additional work lies ahead

00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:56.966
before base editing can realize
its full potential

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:00.604
to improve the lives of patients
with genetic diseases.
