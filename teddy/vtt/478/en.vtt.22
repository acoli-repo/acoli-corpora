and then uses the same
strand-nicking strategy

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.450
that we used in the first base editor

00:11:04.474 --> 00:11:09.939
to trick the cell into replacing
the nonedited T with a C

00:11:09.963 --> 00:11:11.638
as it remakes that nicked strand,

00:11:11.662 --> 00:11:15.833
thereby completing the conversion
of an A-T base pair to a G-C base pair.

00:11:16.845 --> 00:11:18.892
(Applause)

00:11:18.916 --> 00:11:20.086
Thank you.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:23.467
(Applause)

00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:25.826
As an academic scientist in the US,

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.997
I'm not used to being
interrupted by applause.

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:31.172
