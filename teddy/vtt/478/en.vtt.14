00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.100
Third, we had to attach
to the first two proteins

00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:05.474
the protein shown in purple,

00:07:05.498 --> 00:07:09.098
which protects the edited base
from being removed by the cell.

00:07:10.466 --> 00:07:13.308
The net result is an engineered
three-part protein

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:17.450
that for the first time
allows us to convert Cs into Ts

00:07:17.474 --> 00:07:19.637
at specified locations in the genome.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.522
But even at this point,
our work was only half done.

00:07:24.546 --> 00:07:27.172
Because in order to be stable in cells,

00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:30.855
the two strands of a DNA double helix
have to form base pairs.
