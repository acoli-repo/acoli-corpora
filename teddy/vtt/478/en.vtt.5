00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:31.715
We think of bacteria
as sources of infection,

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.053
but bacteria themselves are also
prone to being infected,

00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:36.984
in particular, by viruses.

00:02:37.871 --> 00:02:40.022
So about three billion years ago,

00:02:40.046 --> 00:02:43.926
bacteria evolved a defense mechanism
to fight viral infection.

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:48.434
That defense mechanism
is now better known as CRISPR.

00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:51.833
And the warhead in CRISPR
is this purple protein

00:02:51.857 --> 00:02:55.635
that acts like molecular
scissors to cut DNA,

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.087
breaking the double helix into two pieces.

00:02:59.323 --> 00:03:03.299
If CRISPR couldn't distinguish
between bacterial and viral DNA,
