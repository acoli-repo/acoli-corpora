If CRISPR couldn't distinguish
between bacterial and viral DNA,

00:03:03.323 --> 00:03:05.562
it wouldn't be a very useful
defense system.

00:03:06.315 --> 00:03:09.100
But the most amazing feature of CRISPR

00:03:09.124 --> 00:03:14.161
is that the scissors can be
programmed to search for,

00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:16.608
bind to and cut

00:03:16.632 --> 00:03:19.370
only a specific DNA sequence.

00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:24.308
So when a bacterium encounters
a virus for the first time,

00:03:24.332 --> 00:03:27.705
it can store a small snippet
of that virus's DNA

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.373
for use as a program
to direct the CRISPR scissors
