00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.373
for use as a program
to direct the CRISPR scissors

00:03:31.397 --> 00:03:34.933
to cut that viral DNA sequence
during a future infection.

00:03:35.778 --> 00:03:40.691
Cutting a virus's DNA messes up
the function of the cut viral gene,

00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:43.417
and therefore disrupts
the virus's life cycle.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:50.860
Remarkable researchers including
Emmanuelle Charpentier, George Church,

00:03:50.884 --> 00:03:53.537
Jennifer Doudna and Feng Zhang

00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:57.530
showed six years ago how CRISPR scissors
could be programmed

00:03:57.554 --> 00:04:00.141
to cut DNA sequences of our choosing,
