00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.815
if you had told me
even just five years ago

00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:04.490
that researchers around the globe

00:15:04.514 --> 00:15:08.053
would be using laboratory-evolved
molecular machines

00:15:08.077 --> 00:15:11.074
to directly convert
an individual base pair

00:15:11.098 --> 00:15:12.280
to another base pair

00:15:12.304 --> 00:15:14.923
at a specified location
in the human genome

00:15:14.947 --> 00:15:18.772
efficiently and with a minimum
of other outcomes,

00:15:18.796 --> 00:15:19.964
I would have asked you,

00:15:19.988 --> 00:15:22.462
"What science-fiction novel
are you reading?"

00:15:23.706 --> 00:15:27.166
Thanks to a relentlessly dedicated
group of students

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:31.650
who were creative enough to engineer
what we could design ourselves
