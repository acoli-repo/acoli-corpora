to replace the DNA sequences
surrounding a cut site,

00:05:03.441 --> 00:05:07.765
that process, unfortunately, doesn't work
in most types of cells,

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.230
and the disrupted gene outcomes
still predominate.

00:05:12.297 --> 00:05:14.479
Like many scientists,
I've dreamed of a future

00:05:14.503 --> 00:05:17.277
in which we might be able to treat
or maybe even cure

00:05:17.301 --> 00:05:18.672
human genetic diseases.

00:05:19.135 --> 00:05:22.936
But I saw the lack of a way
to fix point mutations,

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.984
which cause most human genetic diseases,

00:05:26.008 --> 00:05:28.396
as a major problem standing in the way.

00:05:29.434 --> 00:05:32.102
Being a chemist, I began
working with my students
