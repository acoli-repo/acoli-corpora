00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:30.855
the two strands of a DNA double helix
have to form base pairs.

00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:35.783
And because C only pairs with G,

00:07:35.807 --> 00:07:38.809
and T only pairs with A,

00:07:39.752 --> 00:07:44.598
simply changing a C to a T
on one DNA strand creates a mismatch,

00:07:44.622 --> 00:07:47.471
a disagreement between the two DNA strands

00:07:47.495 --> 00:07:51.763
that the cell has to resolve
by deciding which strand to replace.

00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:57.490
We realized that we could further engineer
this three-part protein

00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:02.515
to flag the nonedited strand
as the one to be replaced
