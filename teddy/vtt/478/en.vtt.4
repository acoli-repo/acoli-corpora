age very rapidly and pass away
by about age 14.

00:02:02.358 --> 00:02:04.041
Throughout the history of medicine,

00:02:04.065 --> 00:02:07.125
we have not had a way
to efficiently correct point mutations

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.918
in living systems,

00:02:08.942 --> 00:02:12.142
to change that disease-causing
T back into a C.

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:15.450
Perhaps until now.

00:02:15.474 --> 00:02:19.664
Because my laboratory recently succeeded
in developing such a capability,

00:02:19.688 --> 00:02:21.488
which we call "base editing."

00:02:23.277 --> 00:02:25.301
The story of how we developed base editing

00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:27.999
actually begins three billion years ago.

00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:31.715
We think of bacteria
as sources of infection,
