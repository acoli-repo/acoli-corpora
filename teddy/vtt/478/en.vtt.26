00:12:59.284 --> 00:13:02.974
phenylketonuria, a congenital deafness

00:13:02.998 --> 00:13:04.937
and a type of cardiovascular disease --

00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:09.823
in each case, by directly
correcting a point mutation

00:13:09.847 --> 00:13:12.400
that causes or contributes to the disease.

00:13:13.688 --> 00:13:15.744
In plants, base editors have been used

00:13:15.768 --> 00:13:19.840
to introduce individual
single DNA letter changes

00:13:19.864 --> 00:13:21.832
that could lead to better crops.

00:13:22.253 --> 00:13:26.842
And biologists have used base editors
to probe the role of individual letters

00:13:26.866 --> 00:13:29.683
in genes associated
with diseases such as cancer.
