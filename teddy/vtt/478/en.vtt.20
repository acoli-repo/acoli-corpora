most students would probably
look for another project,

00:10:01.506 --> 00:10:03.246
if not another research advisor.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.434
(Laughter)

00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:06.400
But Nicole agreed to proceed with a plan

00:10:06.424 --> 00:10:09.091
that seemed wildly ambitious at the time.

00:10:09.966 --> 00:10:12.305
Given the absence
of a naturally occurring protein

00:10:12.329 --> 00:10:14.490
that performs the necessary chemistry,

00:10:14.514 --> 00:10:17.950
we decided we would evolve
our own protein in the laboratory

00:10:17.974 --> 00:10:21.809
to convert A into a base
that behaves like G,

00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:26.660
starting from a protein
that performs related chemistry on RNA.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:31.164
We set up a Darwinian
survival-of-the-fittest selection system
