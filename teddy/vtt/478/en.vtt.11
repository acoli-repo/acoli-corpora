00:05:29.434 --> 00:05:32.102
Being a chemist, I began
working with my students

00:05:32.126 --> 00:05:37.061
to develop ways on performing chemistry
directly on an individual DNA base,

00:05:37.085 --> 00:05:42.704
to truly fix, rather than disrupt,
the mutations that cause genetic diseases.

00:05:44.522 --> 00:05:47.070
The results of our efforts
are molecular machines

00:05:47.094 --> 00:05:48.482
called "base editors."

00:05:49.618 --> 00:05:55.093
Base editors use the programmable
searching mechanism of CRISPR scissors,

00:05:55.117 --> 00:05:58.053
but instead of cutting the DNA,

00:05:58.077 --> 00:06:01.018
they directly convert
one base to another base
