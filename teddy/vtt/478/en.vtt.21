00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:31.164
We set up a Darwinian
survival-of-the-fittest selection system

00:10:31.188 --> 00:10:35.180
that explored tens of millions
of protein variants

00:10:35.204 --> 00:10:37.222
and only allowed those rare variants

00:10:37.246 --> 00:10:40.467
that could perform the necessary
chemistry to survive.

00:10:41.883 --> 00:10:44.271
We ended up with a protein shown here,

00:10:44.295 --> 00:10:47.152
the first that can convert A in DNA

00:10:47.176 --> 00:10:49.268
into a base that resembles G.

00:10:49.292 --> 00:10:50.895
And when we attached that protein

00:10:50.919 --> 00:10:53.490
to the disabled CRISPR
scissors, shown in blue,

00:10:53.514 --> 00:10:55.522
we produced the second base editor,

00:10:55.546 --> 00:10:58.641
which converts As into Gs,

00:10:58.665 --> 00:11:02.506
and then uses the same
strand-nicking strategy
