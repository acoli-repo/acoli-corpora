00:14:28.268 --> 00:14:30.633
Continuing to develop
new molecular machines

00:14:30.657 --> 00:14:32.525
that can make all of the remaining ways

00:14:32.549 --> 00:14:35.441
to convert one base pair
to another base pair

00:14:35.465 --> 00:14:39.845
and that minimize unwanted editing
at off-target locations in cells

00:14:39.869 --> 00:14:41.069
is very important.

00:14:41.782 --> 00:14:46.488
And engaging with other scientists,
doctors, ethicists and governments

00:14:46.512 --> 00:14:51.303
to maximize the likelihood
that base editing is applied thoughtfully,

00:14:51.327 --> 00:14:53.708
safely and ethically,

00:14:53.732 --> 00:14:55.732
remains a critical obligation.

00:14:57.525 --> 00:14:59.136
These challenges notwithstanding,

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.815
if you had told me
even just five years ago
