00:00:00.515 --> 00:00:03.695
David Fano: Well I would say
there was kind of like three phases.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.627
There was the time
when you would tell people,

00:00:06.651 --> 00:00:09.676
"Hey, I work at WeWork"
and nobody would know what that was.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.506
And then very quickly
it became pretty commonplace.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.502
People knew what WeWork was,

00:00:14.526 --> 00:00:17.006
and it was on the cover of magazines,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.472
it had a great mission,

00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:19.827
it had this rebranding,

00:00:19.851 --> 00:00:22.685
it had these, like,
very grandiose ambitions.

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:28.399
And then from one day to the next,

00:00:28.423 --> 00:00:29.961
it flipped completely.
