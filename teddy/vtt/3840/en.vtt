00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.555
When I turned 19, I started my career

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:05.985
as the first female photojournalist

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:09.180
in the Gaza Strip, Palestine.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.294
My work as a woman photographer

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:13.398
was considered a serious insult

00:00:13.398 --> 00:00:15.153
to local traditions,

00:00:15.153 --> 00:00:17.201
and created a lasting stigma

00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:20.010
for me and my family.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.022
The male-dominated field made my presence

00:00:23.022 --> 00:00:26.092
unwelcome by all possible means.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:27.810
They made clear that a woman

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.407
must not do a man's job.
