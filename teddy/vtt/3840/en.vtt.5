00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:30.848
like these lights.

00:02:30.848 --> 00:02:34.211
I thought to myself I either got blind

00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:37.100
or I was in heaven.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.320
By the time I managed to open my eyes,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.531
I had documented this moment.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:46.874
Mohammed Khader, a Palestinian worker

00:02:46.874 --> 00:02:50.043
who spent two decades in Israel,

00:02:50.043 --> 00:02:51.936
as his retirement plan,

00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:55.266
he decided to build a four-floor house,

00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:59.563
only by the first field operation at his neighborhood,

00:02:59.563 --> 00:03:02.995
the house was flattened to the ground.
