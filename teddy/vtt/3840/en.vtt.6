the house was flattened to the ground.

00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:06.544
Nothing was left but the pigeons he raised

00:03:06.544 --> 00:03:09.709
and a jacuzzi, a bathtub

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.953
that he got from Tel Aviv.

00:03:11.953 --> 00:03:13.750
Mohammed got the bathtub

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.516
on the top of the rubble

00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:18.140
and started giving his kids

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.198
an every morning bubble bath.

00:03:22.198 --> 00:03:25.460
My work is not meant to hide the scars of war,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.541
but to show the full frame

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:30.748
of unseen stories of Gazans.
