00:01:57.366 --> 00:02:00.065
Because of my gender, I had access

00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:04.643
to worlds where my colleagues were forbidden.

00:02:04.643 --> 00:02:07.077
Beyond the obvious pain and struggle,

00:02:07.077 --> 00:02:08.862
there was a healthy dose

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:11.682
of laughter and accomplishments.

00:02:11.682 --> 00:02:15.201
In front of a police compound in Gaza City

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:18.240
during the first war in Gaza,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.593
an Israeli air raid managed to destroy the compound

00:02:21.593 --> 00:02:23.740
and break my nose.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.351
For a moment, all I saw was white, bright white,

00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:30.848
like these lights.
