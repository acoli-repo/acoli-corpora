00:01:56.931 --> 00:02:00.421
Once the organism is rehydrated,
the matrix dissolves,

00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:03.887
leaving behind undamaged, 
functional cells.

00:02:03.887 --> 00:02:08.151
Beyond dryness, tardigrades can also
tolerate other extreme stresses:

00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:09.416
being frozen,

00:02:09.416 --> 00:02:11.830
heated up past the boiling point
of water,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.507
high levels of radiation,

00:02:13.507 --> 00:02:17.092
and even the vacuum of outer space.

00:02:17.092 --> 00:02:19.221
This has led to some erroneous speculation

00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:22.562
that tardigrades 
are extraterrestrial beings.

00:02:22.562 --> 00:02:24.150
While that's fun to think about,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.751
scientific evidence places their
origin firmly on Earth

00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:29.772
where they've evolved over time.

00:02:29.772 --> 00:02:32.503
In fact, this earthly evolution 
has given rise
