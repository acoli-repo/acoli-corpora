00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:01.100
from the Greek meaning
life without water.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.728
And however extraordinary,
tardigrades aren't alone.

00:01:04.728 --> 00:01:05.780
Bacteria,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.309
single-celled organisms called archaea,

00:01:08.309 --> 00:01:09.090
plants,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.269
and even other animals 
can all survive drying up.

00:01:13.269 --> 00:01:14.671
For many tardigrades,

00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:18.571
this requires that they go through 
something called a tun state.

00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:20.030
They curl up into a ball,

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.620
pulling their head and eight legs
inside their body

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.000
and wait until water returns.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.141
It's thought that as water
becomes scarce

00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:31.501
and tardigrades enter their tun state,
