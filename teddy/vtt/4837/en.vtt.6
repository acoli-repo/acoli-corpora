00:02:57.242 --> 00:03:00.913
But you can find tardigrades
in the most ordinary places, too,

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:02.904
like moss or lichen found in yards,

00:03:02.904 --> 00:03:03.693
parks,

00:03:03.693 --> 00:03:04.963
and forests.

00:03:04.963 --> 00:03:08.403
All you need to find them is a little
patience and a microscope.

00:03:08.403 --> 00:03:12.323
Scientists are now to trying to find out
whether tardigrades use the tun state,

00:03:12.323 --> 00:03:14.364
their anti-drying technique,

00:03:14.364 --> 00:03:16.293
to survive other stresses.

00:03:16.293 --> 00:03:18.683
If we can understand how they,
and other creatures,

00:03:18.683 --> 00:03:21.852
stabilize their sensitive 
biological molecules,

00:03:21.852 --> 00:03:26.043
perhaps we could apply this knowledge
to help us stabilize vaccines,

00:03:26.043 --> 00:03:31.793
or to develop stress-tolerant crops that 
can cope with Earth's changing climate.
