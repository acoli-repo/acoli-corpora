00:03:26.043 --> 00:03:31.793
or to develop stress-tolerant crops that 
can cope with Earth's changing climate.

00:03:31.793 --> 00:03:34.214
And by studying how tardigrades survive

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.373
prolonged exposure 
to the vacuum of outer space,

00:03:37.373 --> 00:03:42.195
scientists can generate clues about
the environmental limits of life

00:03:42.195 --> 00:03:44.205
and how to safeguard astronauts.

00:03:44.205 --> 00:03:49.164
In the process, tardigrades could even
help us answer a critical question:

00:03:49.164 --> 00:03:53.923
could life survive on planets much
less hospitable than our own?
