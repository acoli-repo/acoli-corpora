00:02:29.772 --> 00:02:32.503
In fact, this earthly evolution 
has given rise

00:02:32.503 --> 00:02:36.322
to over 1100 known species of tardigrades

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.653
and there are probably many others
yet to be discovered.

00:02:39.653 --> 00:02:44.783
And because tardigrades are so hardy,
they exist just about everywhere.

00:02:44.783 --> 00:02:48.463
They live on every continent,
including Antarctica.

00:02:48.463 --> 00:02:51.152
And they're in diverse biomes
including deserts,

00:02:51.152 --> 00:02:52.283
ice sheets,

00:02:52.283 --> 00:02:53.182
the sea,

00:02:53.182 --> 00:02:54.143
fresh water,

00:02:54.143 --> 00:02:55.233
rainforests,

00:02:55.233 --> 00:02:57.242
and the highest mountain peaks.

00:02:57.242 --> 00:03:00.913
But you can find tardigrades
in the most ordinary places, too,
