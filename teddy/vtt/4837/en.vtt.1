00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.420
This is the tardigrade,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.289
and it's one of the toughest creatures
on Earth,

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:38.049
even if it does look more like
a chubby, eight-legged gummy bear.

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:40.749
Most organisms need water to survive.

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.059
Water allows metabolism to occur,

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.080
which is the process that drives
all the biochemical reactions

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.249
that take place in cells.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:53.409
But creatures like the tardigrade,
also known as the water bear,

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:58.069
get around this restriction
with a process called anhydrobiosis,

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:01.100
from the Greek meaning
life without water.
