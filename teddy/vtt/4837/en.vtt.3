00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:31.501
and tardigrades enter their tun state,

00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:34.351
they start synthesize special molecules,

00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:38.041
which fill the tardigrade's cells
to replace lost water

00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:40.430
by forming a matrix.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.080
Components of the cells that are
sensitive to dryness,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.111
like DNA,

00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:45.101
proteins,

00:01:45.101 --> 00:01:46.191
and membranes,

00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:48.580
get trapped in this matrix.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.973
It's thought that this keeps these
molecules locked in position

00:01:51.973 --> 00:01:53.631
to stop them from unfolding,

00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:54.868
breaking apart,

00:01:54.868 --> 00:01:56.931
or fusing together.

00:01:56.931 --> 00:02:00.421
Once the organism is rehydrated,
the matrix dissolves,
