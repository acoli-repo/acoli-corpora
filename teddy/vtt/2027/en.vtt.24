00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Now if we look at nuclear -- (Laughter)

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
With nuclear, what do we have?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
We have facilities around there. You also have a buffer zone

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
that's 17 square kilometers.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And you have the uranium mining

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
that you have to deal with.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Now if we go to the area,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
lots is worse than nuclear or wind.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
For example, cellulosic ethanol, to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
this is how much land you would need.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
That's cellulosic, second generation

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
biofuels from prairie grass.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Here's corn ethanol. It's smaller.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
This is based on ranges from data,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
but if you look at nuclear,
