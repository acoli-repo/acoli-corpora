00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
While you're waiting around for your nuclear,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
you have to run the regular electric power grid,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
which is mostly coal in the United States and around the world.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And the chart here shows the difference between

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
the emissions from the regular grid,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
resulting if you use nuclear, or anything else,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
versus wind, CSP or photovoltaics.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Wind takes about two to five years on average,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
same as concentrated solar and photovoltaics.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
So the difference is the opportunity cost

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
of using nuclear versus wind, or something else.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So if you add these two together, alone,
