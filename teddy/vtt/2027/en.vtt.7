00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
because most places don't have underground storage yet.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It's just as well, because it can stay where it is.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
While the carbon dioxide,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
vast quantities of it, gigatons,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
goes into the atmosphere

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
where we can't get it back -- yet --

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So when you add up the greenhouse gases

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
in the lifetime of these various energy sources,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
nuclear is down there with wind and hydro,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
below solar and way below, obviously, all the fossil fuels.
