His first time at TED, possibly a disadvantage -- we shall see --

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
from Stanford,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Professor Mark Jacobson. Good luck.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Mark Jacobson: Thank you.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
(Applause)

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So my premise here is that nuclear energy

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
puts out more carbon dioxide,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
puts out more air pollutants,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
enhances mortality more and takes longer to put up

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
than real renewable energy systems,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
namely wind, solar,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
geothermal power, hydro-tidal wave power.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So let's start just by looking at the

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
CO2 emissions from the life cycle.
