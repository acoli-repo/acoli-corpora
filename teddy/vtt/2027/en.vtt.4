00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But we move to cities, toward the bright lights,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and one of the things that is there that we want, besides jobs,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
is electricity.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And if it isn't easily gotten, we'll go ahead and steal it.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This is one of the most desired things

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
by poor people all over the world,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
in the cities and in the countryside.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Electricity for cities, at its best,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
is what's called baseload electricity.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
That's where it is on

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
all the time.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And so far there are only three major sources of that --

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
coal and gas, hydro-electric,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
which in most places is maxed-out --

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and nuclear.
