00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
If all of your electricity in your lifetime came from nuclear,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
the waste from that lifetime of electricity

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
would go in a Coke can --

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
a pretty heavy Coke can, about two pounds.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
But one day of coal

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
adds up to one hell of a lot

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
of carbon dioxide

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
in a normal one-gigawatt coal-fired plant.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Then what happens to the waste?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The nuclear waste typically goes into

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
a dry cask storage

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
out back of the parking lot at the reactor site

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
because most places don't have underground storage yet.
