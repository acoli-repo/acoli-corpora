00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
nuclear bomb created

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
that was used to destroy a city

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
such as Mumbai or some other big city, megacity,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
the additional death rates due to this

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
averaged over 30 years and then scaled to the population of the U.S.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
would be this.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
So, do we need this?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
The next thing is: What about the footprint? Stewart mentioned the footprint.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Actually, the footprint on the ground for wind

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
is by far the smallest of any energy source in the world.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
That, because the footprint, as you can see,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
is just the pole touching the ground.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And you can power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
with 73,000 to 145,000
