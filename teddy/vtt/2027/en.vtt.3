And Hansen is hard over for nuclear power,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
as are most climatologists

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
who are engaging this issue seriously.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This is the design situation:

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
a planet that is facing climate change

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and is now half urban.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Look at the client base for this.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Five out of six of us

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000

We are moving to cities. We are moving up in the world.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And we are educating our kids,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
having fewer kids,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
basically good news all around.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But we move to cities, toward the bright lights,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and one of the things that is there that we want, besides jobs,
