00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
a long-standing TEDster, the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
someone we all know and love, Stewart Brand.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Stewart Brand: Whoa.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
(Applause)

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The saying is that with climate, those who know the most

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
are the most worried.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
With nuclear, those who know the most

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
are the least worried.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
A classic example is James Hansen,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
a NASA climatologist

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
pushing for 350 parts per million

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
He came out with a wonderful book recently

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
called "Storms of My Grandchildren."

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And Hansen is hard over for nuclear power,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
as are most climatologists
