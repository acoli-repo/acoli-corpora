00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
CO2 emissions from the life cycle.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
CO2e emissions are equivalent emissions

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
of all the greenhouse gases and particles

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
that cause warming

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and converted to CO2.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And if you look, wind and concentrated solar

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
have the lowest CO2 emissions, if you look at the graph.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Nuclear -- there are two bars here.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
One is a low estimate, and one is a high estimate.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
The low estimate is the nuclear energy industry

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
estimate of nuclear.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
The high is the average of 103

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
scientific, peer-reviewed studies.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And this is just the

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
CO2 from the life cycle.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
If we look at the delays,
