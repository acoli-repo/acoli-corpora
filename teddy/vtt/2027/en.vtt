00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Chris Anderson: We're having a debate.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The debate is over the proposition:

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
"What the world needs now

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is nuclear energy." True or false?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And before we have the debate,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'd like to actually take a show of hands --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
on balance, right now, are you for or against this?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So those who are "yes," raise your hand. "For."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Okay, hands down.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Those who are against, raise your hands.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Okay, I'm reading that at about

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
75 to 25 in favor at the start.
