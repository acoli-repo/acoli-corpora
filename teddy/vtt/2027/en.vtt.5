00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
which in most places is maxed-out --

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and nuclear.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I would love to have something in the fourth place here,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
but in terms of constant, clean,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
scalable energy,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
[solar] and wind and the other renewables

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
aren't there yet because they're inconstant.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Nuclear is and has been for 40 years.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Now, from an environmental standpoint,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the main thing you want to look at

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
is what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
the two major sources of electricity.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
If all of your electricity in your lifetime came from nuclear,
