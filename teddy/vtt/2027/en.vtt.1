00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
75 to 25 in favor at the start.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Which means we're going to take a vote at the end

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and see how that shifts, if at all.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So here's the format: They're going to have six minutes each,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and then after one little, quick exchange between them,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I want two people on each side of this debate in the audience

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
to have 30 seconds

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
to make one short, crisp, pungent, powerful point.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So, in favor of the proposition, possibly shockingly,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
is one of, truly, the founders of the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
environmental movement,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
a long-standing TEDster, the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
someone we all know and love, Stewart Brand.
