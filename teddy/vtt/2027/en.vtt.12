Ten percent of American electricity

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
comes from decommissioned warheads.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
We haven't even started the American stockpile.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I think of most interest to a TED audience

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
would be the new generation of reactors

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
that are very small,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
down around 10

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
to 125 megawatts.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
This is one from Toshiba.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Here's one the Russians are already building that floats on a barge.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And that would be very interesting in the developing world.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Typically, these things are put in the ground.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
They're referred to as nuclear batteries.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
They're incredibly safe,
