00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
of wind farm.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
In places like Denmark and Germany,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
they've maxed out on wind already.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
They've run out of good sites.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
The power lines are getting overloaded.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And you peak out.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Likewise, with solar,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
especially here in California,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
we're discovering that the 80 solar farm

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
schemes that are going forward

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
want to basically bulldoze

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
1,000 square miles of southern California desert.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Well, as an environmentalist, we would rather that didn't happen.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
It's okay on frapped-out agricultural land.
