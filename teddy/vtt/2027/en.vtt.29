00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and energy.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
These diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
putting out a lot of greenhouse gases --

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
a lot of those studies include, "Well of course war will be inevitable

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and therefore we'll have cities burning and stuff like that,"

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
which is kind of finessing it

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
a little bit, I think.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
The reality is that there's, what,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
21 nations that have nuclear power?

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Of those, seven have nuclear weapons.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
In every case, they got the weapons

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
before they got the nuclear power.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
There are two nations, North Korea and Israel,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
that have nuclear weapons

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and don't have nuclear power at all.
