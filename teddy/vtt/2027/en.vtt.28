00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
and yours is slightly short because you slightly overran --

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I need two people from either side.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So if you're for this,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
if you're for nuclear power, put up two hands.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000

Now then, you guys have --

you have a minute comeback on him

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
to pick up a point he said, challenge it,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
SB: I think a point of difference we're having, Mark,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
has to do with weapons

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and energy.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
These diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow
