00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And you can power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
with 73,000 to 145,000

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
five-megawatt wind turbines.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
That would take between one and three square kilometers

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
of footprint on the ground, entirely.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
The spacing is something else.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
That's the footprint that is always being confused.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
People confuse footprint with spacing.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
As you can see from these pictures,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
the spacing between can be used for multiple purposes

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
including agricultural land,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
range land or open space.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Over the ocean, it's not even land.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Now if we look at nuclear -- (Laughter)

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
With nuclear, what do we have?
