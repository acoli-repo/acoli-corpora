00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Well, right now in the United States,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
50 to 100,000 people die per year from air pollution,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and vehicles are about 25,000 of those.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
In 2020, the number will go down to 15,000

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
due to improvements.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And so, on the right, you see gasoline emissions,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
the death rates of 2020.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
If you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
you'd actually increase the death rate slightly.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
If you go to nuclear,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
you do get a big reduction,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
but it's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Now if you consider the fact

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
that nuclear weapons proliferation

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
is associated with nuclear energy proliferation,
