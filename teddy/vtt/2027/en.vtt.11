00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
an area he refers to as "Renewistan."

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
A guy who's added it up all this very well is David Mackay,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
a physicist in England,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and in his wonderful book, "Sustainable Energy," among other things,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
he says, "I'm not trying to be pro-nuclear. I'm just pro-arithmetic."

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
In terms of weapons,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
We have been taking down

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
the Russian warheads,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
turning it into electricity.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Ten percent of American electricity

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
comes from decommissioned warheads.
