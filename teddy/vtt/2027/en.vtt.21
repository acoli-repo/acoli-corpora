00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
that nuclear weapons proliferation

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
is associated with nuclear energy proliferation,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
because we know for example,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
India and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
by enriching uranium

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
in nuclear energy facilities.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
North Korea did that to some extent.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Iran is doing that right now.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And Venezuela would be doing it

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
if they started with their nuclear energy facilities.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
If you do a large scale expansion

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
of nuclear energy across the world,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and as a result there was just one

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
nuclear bomb created
