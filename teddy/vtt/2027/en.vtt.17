00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
If we look at the delays,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
it takes between 10 and 19 years

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
to put up a nuclear power plant

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
from planning to operation.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
This includes about three and a half to six years

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
for a site permit.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and another two and a half to four years

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
for a construction permit and issue,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and then four to nine years for actual construction.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And in China, right now,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
they're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And the average, just for the construction time of these,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
is 7.1 years

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
on top of any planning times.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
While you're waiting around for your nuclear,
