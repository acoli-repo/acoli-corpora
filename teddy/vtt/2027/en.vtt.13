00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
They're incredibly safe,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
weapons proliferation-proof and all the rest of it.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Here is a commercial version from New Mexico

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
called the Hyperion,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and another one from Oregon called NuScale.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Babcock &amp; Wilcox that make nuclear reactors,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
here's an integral fast reactor.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Thorium reactor that Nathan Myhrvold's involved in.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
The governments of the world are going to have to decide

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that coals need to be made expensive, and these will go ahead.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And here's the future.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
