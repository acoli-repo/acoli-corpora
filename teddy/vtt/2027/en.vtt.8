00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Wind is wonderful; I love wind.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I love being around these

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
big wind generators.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
But one of the things we're discovering is that

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
wind, like solar, is an actually relatively

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
dilute source of energy.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And so it takes a very large footprint on the land,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
a very large footprint in terms of materials,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
five to 10 times what you'd use for nuclear,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and typically to get one gigawatt of electricity

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
is on the order of 250 square miles

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
of wind farm.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
In places like Denmark and Germany,
