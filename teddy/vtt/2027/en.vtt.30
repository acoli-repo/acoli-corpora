00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
that have nuclear weapons

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and don't have nuclear power at all.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
The places that we would most like to have

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
really clean energy occur

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
are China, India, Europe, North America,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
all of which have sorted out their situation

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
in relation to nuclear weapons.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
So that leaves a couple of places like Iran,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
maybe Venezuela,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
that you would like to have very close

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
surveillance of anything

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
that goes on with fissile stuff.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
really know where all of the fissile material is,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and we can move toward
