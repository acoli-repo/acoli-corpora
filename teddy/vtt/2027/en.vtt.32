Solving the world's problems can be done,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
if you really put your mind to it and use clean, renewable energy.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
There's absolutely no need for nuclear power.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
(Applause)

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
CA: We need someone for.

Rod Beckstrom: Thank you Chris. I'm Rod Beckstrom, CEO of ICANN.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
I've been involved in global warming policy

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
since 1994,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
when I joined the board of Environmental Defense Fund

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
that was one of the crafters of the Kyoto Protocol.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And I want to support Stewart Brand's position.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
I've come around in the last 10 years.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
I used to be against nuclear power.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I'm now supporting Stewart's position,
