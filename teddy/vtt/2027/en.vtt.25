00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
but if you look at nuclear,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
it would be the size of Rhode Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
For wind, there's a larger area,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
but much smaller footprint.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And of course, with wind,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
you could put it all over the East Coast,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
offshore theoretically, or you can split it up.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And now, if you go back to

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
looking at geothermal, it's even smaller than both,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and solar is slightly larger than the nuclear spacing,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
but it's still pretty small.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And this is to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
To power the entire world with 50 percent wind,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
you would need about one percent of world land.
