00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
really know where all of the fissile material is,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and we can move toward

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
zero weapons left, once we know all that.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
CA: Mark,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
30 seconds, either on that or on anything Stewart said.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
MJ: Well we know India and Pakistan had nuclear energy first,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
and then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
So the other thing is, we don't need nuclear energy.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
There's plenty of solar and wind.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
You can make it reliable, as I showed with that diagram.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
That's from real data.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
And this is an ongoing research. This is not rocket science.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Solving the world's problems can be done,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
if you really put your mind to it and use clean, renewable energy.
