00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.333
So, asking for help
is basically the worst, right?

00:00:06.357 --> 00:00:10.309
I've actually never seen it
on one of those top ten lists

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.008
of things people fear,

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:14.135
like public speaking

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:15.831
and death,

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:18.456
but I'm pretty sure
it actually belongs there.

00:00:19.146 --> 00:00:24.022
Even though in many ways it's foolish
for us to be afraid to admit we need help,

00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:28.780
whether it's from a loved one
or a friend or from a coworker

00:00:28.804 --> 00:00:30.787
or even from a stranger,
