00:07:59.284 --> 00:08:02.156
and maybe even hold a basic conversation,

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.180
but it hasn't learned to walk yet.

00:08:04.934 --> 00:08:07.498
Now, we are teaching technology

00:08:07.522 --> 00:08:09.806
how to navigate
the three-dimensional world

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.292
without our help.

00:08:12.585 --> 00:08:14.664
We are entering this new era

00:08:14.688 --> 00:08:19.315
where insentient objects
are going to get up and move freely.

00:08:20.305 --> 00:08:21.791
And when they do,

00:08:21.815 --> 00:08:24.473
we've got to make sure
they don't look like aliens.

00:08:24.497 --> 00:08:29.236
My vision for the future
is that when things come to life,

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.720
they do so with joy.
