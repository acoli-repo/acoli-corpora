the food will make its way to you.

00:01:32.295 --> 00:01:35.959
Let's go back to those 20 million a day
restaurant deliveries.

00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:39.150
If we could get
these deliveries off the road,

00:01:39.174 --> 00:01:40.609
we could reduce the need

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:45.363
for as many as one and a half
million cars just in the US.

00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:47.833
That's twice the size of San Francisco.

00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:52.091
Now, think of the impact this could have
on cities like Delhi,

00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:54.545
or my birth city of Tehran,

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.053
where car pollution is killing
thousands of people every year.

00:01:58.546 --> 00:02:03.455
So how do we get some
of these deliveries off the road?
