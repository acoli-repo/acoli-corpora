00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.800
because people feel bad
when they think they broke it.

00:06:02.474 --> 00:06:04.490
But delivery robots aren't toys,

00:06:04.514 --> 00:06:07.069
they're not small,
they are out there in public.

00:06:07.394 --> 00:06:10.371
We found that with delivery robots,

00:06:10.395 --> 00:06:12.331
to get people to stop tampering,

00:06:12.355 --> 00:06:14.355
robots need to show awareness.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.410
It's kind of the opposite of playing dead.

00:06:17.792 --> 00:06:18.991
In this case,

00:06:19.015 --> 00:06:21.656
robots need to acknowledge the situation

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.680
to get people to step away.

00:06:24.546 --> 00:06:25.991
Also, a word of advice.

00:06:26.015 --> 00:06:28.910
If you are a robot and you see small kids,

00:06:28.934 --> 00:06:30.934
run towards the closest adult.
