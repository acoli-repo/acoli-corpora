Now, before I tell you
more about the robots,

00:02:31.328 --> 00:02:33.328
let's do a quick thought experiment.

00:02:33.947 --> 00:02:38.372
In your mind, picture a city
with thousands of robots.

00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:40.341
Is it this one?

00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:44.601
This Hollywood dystopia
is what a lot of people expect.

00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:50.307
But our job is to create a friendly future
that's designed for people.

00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:53.298
So instead of making aliens,

00:02:53.322 --> 00:02:57.004
we set out to create robots
that are familiar.

00:02:57.361 --> 00:03:00.100
Robots that would belong
in our communities.
