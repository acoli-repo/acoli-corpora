It's familiar, but it's also surprising.

00:03:32.555 --> 00:03:34.483
It's just a shopping cart,

00:03:34.507 --> 00:03:38.267
but it also looks like
we crossbred WALL-E with Minions.

00:03:39.004 --> 00:03:41.853
If you live in San Francisco
or Los Angeles,

00:03:41.877 --> 00:03:44.933
chances are one of these
has already delivered your food.

00:03:45.482 --> 00:03:48.244
As soon as we put robots
out on the street,

00:03:48.268 --> 00:03:50.415
we learned some
really interesting problems.

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:53.400
Like, how should robots cross the road?

00:03:53.704 --> 00:03:59.330
Or how should robots interact with people
with visual or mobility impairments?
