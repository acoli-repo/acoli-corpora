00:00:57.885 --> 00:01:00.290
Solo, or with our whole family.

00:01:00.688 --> 00:01:05.600
We get into the same SUV
to go buy coffee or a coffee table.

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:08.796
If we could free up
some of these streets and parking lots,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.201
we could build more housing,

00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:12.328
more social spaces, more parks.

00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:14.014
But to do that,

00:01:14.038 --> 00:01:17.942
first, we need to rethink
how we are using cars today.

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.395
In the city of the future,

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:23.065
if you want to go five blocks,
you summon a bike or a scooter.

00:01:23.089 --> 00:01:26.376
If you're in a rush,
a passenger drone would pick you up.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.661
And if you need food,
no need to have someone drive over --

00:01:29.685 --> 00:01:32.271
the food will make its way to you.
