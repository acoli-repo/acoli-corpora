00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:03.805
We quickly realized
that we need to teach our robots

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.099
how to communicate with people.

00:04:06.877 --> 00:04:09.718
People on the sidewalk
come from every walk of life,

00:04:09.742 --> 00:04:12.960
so we needed to create a new language,

00:04:12.984 --> 00:04:14.729
kind of a universal language

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:17.864
so people and robots
can understand each other

00:04:17.888 --> 00:04:19.253
right off the bat.

00:04:19.277 --> 00:04:22.345
Because no one is going
to be reading user manuals.

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:27.441
We started with eyes,
because eyes are universal.

00:04:27.465 --> 00:04:29.403
They can show where the robot is going

00:04:29.427 --> 00:04:31.513
or if it's confused.
