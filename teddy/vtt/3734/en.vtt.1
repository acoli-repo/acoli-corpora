00:00:29.938 --> 00:00:32.072
The energy to bring you that burrito

00:00:32.096 --> 00:00:34.850
is actually bringing you
a two-ton metal cage

00:00:34.874 --> 00:00:36.263
with heated seats.

00:00:36.287 --> 00:00:37.609
Let's be honest.

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:39.633
We are addicted to our cars.

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:41.935
Did you know that in America,

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:45.434
for every car,
there are four parking spots?

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:46.831
In some downtowns,

00:00:46.855 --> 00:00:49.942
over half of the real estate is for cars.

00:00:50.427 --> 00:00:53.401
We have designed our cities
around our cars,

00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:56.290
because we drive
whether we're going two miles

00:00:56.314 --> 00:00:57.861
or 200 miles.

00:00:57.885 --> 00:01:00.290
Solo, or with our whole family.
