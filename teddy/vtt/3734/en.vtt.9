00:04:29.427 --> 00:04:31.513
or if it's confused.

00:04:31.537 --> 00:04:34.378
Plus, eyes make robots more human.

00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:37.045
We also used sounds.

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:39.534
For example, we created this running sound

00:04:39.558 --> 00:04:41.379
with frequent gaps

00:04:41.403 --> 00:04:45.268
so that people with visual impairments
could locate their robots

00:04:45.292 --> 00:04:47.244
using the Doppler effect.

00:04:47.268 --> 00:04:50.061
But it turned out these were not enough.

00:04:50.085 --> 00:04:51.299
At intersections,

00:04:51.323 --> 00:04:53.323
cars would cut in front of our robots.

00:04:53.347 --> 00:04:55.863
Drivers were getting confused sometimes,

00:04:55.887 --> 00:04:59.931
because robots would take too long
before they started crossing.
