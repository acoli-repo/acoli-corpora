00:06:28.934 --> 00:06:30.934
run towards the closest adult.

00:06:31.315 --> 00:06:35.066
It turns out that some kids
just love harassing robots.

00:06:35.455 --> 00:06:38.010
So besides dystopia,

00:06:38.034 --> 00:06:41.098
Hollywood also promised us
some really cool robots

00:06:41.122 --> 00:06:43.983
that would run our errands
or keep us company.

00:06:44.007 --> 00:06:46.880
So far, we've really focused
on food delivery,

00:06:46.904 --> 00:06:48.555
but in the future,

00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:50.537
these robots can do more.

00:06:50.561 --> 00:06:55.252
Like, they could gather excess food
and bring it to shelters every night.

00:06:55.593 --> 00:06:59.593
Because in America,
we waste 30 percent of our food,

00:06:59.617 --> 00:07:03.145
while 10 percent of our people
experience food insecurity.
