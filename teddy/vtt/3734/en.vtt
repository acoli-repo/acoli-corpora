Food delivery.

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:05.809
It's the thing that saves
millennials from starvation.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.188
By my calculations,

00:00:08.212 --> 00:00:11.950
Americans order over 20 million
restaurant deliveries

00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:13.640
every single day.

00:00:14.022 --> 00:00:17.458
Over half of these deliveries
are actually within walking distance.

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:21.233
But nine out of 10 are delivered in cars.

00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:23.933
So basically,

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:25.861
we are moving a two-pound burrito

00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:27.655
in a two-ton car

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.914
20 million times a day.

00:00:29.938 --> 00:00:32.072
The energy to bring you that burrito
