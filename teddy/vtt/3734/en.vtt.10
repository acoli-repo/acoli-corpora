Even ordinary pedestrians
were getting confused.

00:05:03.796 --> 00:05:07.188
Sometimes, they couldn't figure out
on which side to pass the robots,

00:05:07.212 --> 00:05:10.640
because robots make a lot
of small adjustments to their direction

00:05:10.664 --> 00:05:11.836
as they move.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.312
This actually sparked a new idea.

00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:18.669
What if we used movement
to create a universal language?

00:05:19.106 --> 00:05:20.772
Like, at intersections,

00:05:20.796 --> 00:05:24.201
robots would gently move forward
before they start crossing,

00:05:24.225 --> 00:05:26.820
to signal to drivers that it's their turn.

00:05:27.928 --> 00:05:29.864
If they see someone in a wheelchair,

00:05:29.888 --> 00:05:33.982
they yield by pointing themselves
away from the sidewalk,
