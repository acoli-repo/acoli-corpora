00:02:57.361 --> 00:03:00.100
Robots that would belong
in our communities.

00:03:00.665 --> 00:03:02.720
But we also wanted a little surprise.

00:03:02.744 --> 00:03:05.505
Something unexpectedly delightful.

00:03:05.815 --> 00:03:06.974
Think about it.

00:03:06.998 --> 00:03:08.481
You're walking down the street,

00:03:08.505 --> 00:03:10.710
and you see your very first robot.

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:13.052
That's the moment
when you're going to decide

00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:15.861
if this is a future you love or fear.

00:03:16.861 --> 00:03:20.137
And with a lot of people
having these dystopian ideas,

00:03:20.161 --> 00:03:22.383
we need to open their minds.

00:03:22.407 --> 00:03:24.772
We want to surprise and delight them,

00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:27.952
so that we can win them over
on first impression.

00:03:27.976 --> 00:03:29.380
This is what we came up with.

00:03:29.404 --> 00:03:32.174
It's familiar, but it's also surprising.
