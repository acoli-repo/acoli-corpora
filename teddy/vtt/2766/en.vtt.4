00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.536
So let me first let you know
that there's nothing at all distinct

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.336
about this audience

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.176

I've done this exercise
dozens of times around the country.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.296
I've done it to women's

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.456
I've done it with civil rights groups.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.456
I've done it with professors.
I've done it with students.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.736
I've done it with psychologists.
I've done it with sociologists.
