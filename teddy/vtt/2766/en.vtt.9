many will fall through the cracks
of our movements,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.240
left to suffer in virtual isolation.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.280
But it doesn't have to be this way.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.216
Many years ago, I began to use
the term "intersectionality"

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.336
to deal with the fact
that many of our social justice problems

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.256
like racism and sexism

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.480
are often overlapping,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.040
creating multiple levels
of social injustice.
