an issue that affects black people
and an issue that affects women,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.256
wouldn't that necessarily include
black people who are women

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.560
and women who are black people?

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.776
Well, the simple answer is that this is
a trickle-down approach to social justice,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.800
and many times it just doesn't work.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.776

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.536

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.776
many will fall through the cracks
of our movements,
