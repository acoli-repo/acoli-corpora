00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.776
For me, the challenge that I faced was

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.616
trying to figure out whether
there was an alternative narrative,

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.336
a prism that would allow us
to see Emma's dilemma,

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:16.296
a prism that would allow us
to rescue her from the cracks in the law,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.600
that would allow judges to see her story.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.896
So it occurred to me,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.936
maybe a simple analogy to an intersection

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:32.240
might allow judges
to better see Emma's dilemma.
