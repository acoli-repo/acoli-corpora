I've done it with psychologists.
I've done it with sociologists.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.256
I've done it even with
progressive members of Congress.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.576
And everywhere, the awareness
of the level of police violence

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.496
that black women experience

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.520
is exceedingly low.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.176
Now, it is surprising, isn't it,
that this would be the case.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.216
I mean, there are two issues
involved here.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.336
There's police violence
against African-Americans,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.416
and there's violence against women,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.400
two issues that have been
talked about a lot lately.
