00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.456
Only if the court was able to see
how these policies came together

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.136
would he be able to see
the double discrimination

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.280
that Emma DeGraffenreid was facing.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.456
But the court refused to allow Emma
to put two causes of action together

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.856
to tell her story

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.816
because he believed that,
by allowing her to do that,

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.776
she would be able
to have preferential treatment.
