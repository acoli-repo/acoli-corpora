Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
introduced a design challenge

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
called the marshmallow challenge.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And the idea's pretty simple:

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
out of 20 sticks of spaghetti,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
one yard of tape, one yard of string

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and a marshmallow.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The marshmallow has to be on top.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because it forces people

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to collaborate very quickly.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And so, I thought this was an interesting idea,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and I incorporated it into a design workshop.
