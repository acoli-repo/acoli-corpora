00:06:28.417 --> 00:06:32.226
We dance, we make the club our own

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.143
We chant at night to free our souls

00:06:36.167 --> 00:06:39.434
We dance, we make the club our home --

00:06:39.458 --> 00:06:40.934
TM: Can you guys clap with us?

00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:43.268
(Singing) We chant
at night to free our souls

00:06:43.292 --> 00:06:44.875
TM: Alright, New York.

00:06:45.583 --> 00:06:47.184
It's that time.

00:06:47.208 --> 00:06:49.226
It's that TED Talks time.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.059
We're sitting down

00:06:51.083 --> 00:06:52.559
but we're grooving out, right?

00:06:52.583 --> 00:06:54.809
(Singing) We dance

00:06:54.833 --> 00:06:56.393
TM: You know we dance

00:06:56.417 --> 00:06:59.309
After this, we're going to go dance,
all of us, altogether

00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:00.601
at Chever's house.
