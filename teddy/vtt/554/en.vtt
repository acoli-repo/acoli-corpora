00:00:00.655 --> 00:00:02.278
A few years ago,

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:06.025
I was taking care of a woman
who was a victim of violence.

00:00:06.654 --> 00:00:11.826
I wanted her to be seen in a clinic
that specialized in trauma survivors.

00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:17.271
I made the appointment myself because,
being the director of the department,

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:18.757
I knew if I did it,

00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:21.197
she would get an appointment right away.

00:00:21.886 --> 00:00:25.799
The clinic was about an hour and a half
away from where she lived.

00:00:25.823 --> 00:00:29.254
But she took down the address
and agreed to go.
