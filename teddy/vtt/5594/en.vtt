00:00:07.786 --> 00:00:12.536
As the sun rises on a 
fall morning in 55 BCE,

00:00:12.536 --> 00:00:17.086
Camma lays two pigeons on the altar 
at the center of her village.

00:00:17.086 --> 00:00:20.966
She offers a prayer to Matrona 
mother goddess of the Earth,

00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:23.856
and Lugus chief of the gods.

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:25.796
Then, she wrings the birdsâ€™ necks

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:30.746
and cuts them open to examine their 
entrails for divine messages.
