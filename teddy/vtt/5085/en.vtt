Which is correct: "A dozen eggs is?"

I remember being in elementary school,

00:00:19.908 --> 00:00:22.289
and my teachers making
a big deal about the unit.

00:00:22.313 --> 00:00:23.674
And I never really got that,

00:00:23.698 --> 00:00:25.993
until one day, I was in the grocery store,

00:00:26.017 --> 00:00:28.835
and I wanted to buy an apple,
but I couldn't buy one apple.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.812
I had to buy a whole bag of apples.
