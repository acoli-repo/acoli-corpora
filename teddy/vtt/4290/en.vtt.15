"If you are a little bit skinnier
and you have shinier hair,

00:07:31.878 --> 00:07:34.651
you will be so happy and fabulous."

00:07:34.675 --> 00:07:36.210
And when we're backstage,

00:07:36.234 --> 00:07:38.757
we give an answer
that maybe makes it seem like that.

00:07:38.781 --> 00:07:42.261
We say, "It's really amazing to travel,
and it's amazing to get to work

00:07:42.285 --> 00:07:44.885
with creative, inspired,
passionate people."

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:48.052
And those things are true,
but they're only one half of the story,

00:07:48.076 --> 00:07:50.654
because the thing
that we never say on camera,

00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:52.750
that I have never said on camera, is,

00:07:52.774 --> 00:07:54.146
"I am insecure."

00:07:55.158 --> 00:07:59.306
And I'm insecure because I have to think
about what I look like every day.
