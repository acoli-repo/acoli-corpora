and they gave me the dress for free.

00:06:30.822 --> 00:06:33.318
When I was a teenager,
I was driving with my friend

00:06:33.342 --> 00:06:36.009
who was an awful driver
and she ran a red and of course,

00:06:36.033 --> 00:06:37.222
we got pulled over,

00:06:37.246 --> 00:06:41.053
and all it took was a "Sorry, officer,"
and we were on our way.

00:06:42.363 --> 00:06:45.545
And I got these free things
because of how I look,

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:48.364
not who I am, and there are
people paying a cost

00:06:48.388 --> 00:06:50.606
for how they look and not who they are.

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.250
I live in New York, and last year,

00:06:52.274 --> 00:06:56.053
of the 140,000 teenagers
that were stopped and frisked,

00:06:56.077 --> 00:07:00.092
86% of them were black and Latino,
and most of them were young men.
