Hopefully less awkward
than that one in the middle.

00:05:00.393 --> 00:05:02.944
That was -- I don't know
what happened there.

00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:05.075
Unfortunately,
after you've gone to school,

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.429
and you have a résumé
and you've done a few jobs,

00:05:07.453 --> 00:05:08.945
you can't say anything anymore,

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:12.016
so if you say you want to be
the President of the United States,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.446
but your résumé reads,
"Underwear Model: 10 years,"

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.876
people give you a funny look.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.488
The next question is,
"Do they retouch all the photos?"

00:05:18.512 --> 00:05:20.893
And yeah, they pretty much
retouch all the photos,

00:05:20.917 --> 00:05:23.526
but that is only a small component
of what's happening.

00:05:24.006 --> 00:05:26.724
This picture is the very first
picture that I ever took,

00:05:26.748 --> 00:05:29.557
and it's also the very first time
that I had worn a bikini,

00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:31.361
and I didn't even have my period yet.
