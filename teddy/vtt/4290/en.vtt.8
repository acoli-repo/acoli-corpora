(Laughter)

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.374
If, after this amazing list,
they still are like,

00:04:02.398 --> 00:04:04.303
"No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model,"

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:05.941

00:04:24.316 --> 00:04:28.283
I will demonstrate for you now
10 years of accumulated model knowledge,

00:04:28.307 --> 00:04:30.212
because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons,
