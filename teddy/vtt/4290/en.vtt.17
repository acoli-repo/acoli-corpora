00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:31.999
and it also felt really uncomfortable
to follow that up with,

00:08:32.023 --> 00:08:34.387
"and it doesn't always make me happy."

00:08:34.411 --> 00:08:40.286
But mostly it was difficult to unpack
a legacy of gender and racial oppression

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.418
when I am one
of the biggest beneficiaries.

00:08:43.822 --> 00:08:46.279
But I'm also happy
and honored to be up here

00:08:46.303 --> 00:08:49.515
and I think that it's great
that I got to come

00:08:49.539 --> 00:08:53.212
before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed
and I'd had more agency in my career,

00:08:53.236 --> 00:08:56.710
because maybe then I wouldn't tell
the story of how I got my first job,

00:08:56.734 --> 00:08:59.607
or maybe I wouldn't tell the story
of how I paid for college,

00:08:59.631 --> 00:09:01.304
which seems so important right now.
