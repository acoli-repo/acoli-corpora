I always just say, "Oh, I was scouted,"

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:32.325
but that means nothing.

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.430
The real way that I became a model

00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:38.917
is I won a genetic lottery,
and I am the recipient of a legacy,

00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:41.037
and maybe you're wondering
what is a legacy.

00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:43.783
Well, for the past few centuries

00:02:43.807 --> 00:02:49.301
we have defined beauty
not just as health and youth

00:02:49.325 --> 00:02:53.087
and symmetry that we're biologically
programmed to admire,

00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:56.623
but also as tall, slender figures,

00:02:56.647 --> 00:02:59.870
and femininity and white skin.

00:02:59.894 --> 00:03:01.942
And this is a legacy
that was built for me,
