00:04:28.307 --> 00:04:30.212
because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons,

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:32.938
it can just be distilled right now.

00:04:32.962 --> 00:04:36.022
So, if the photographer is right there,

00:04:36.046 --> 00:04:38.103
the light is right there, like a nice HMI,

00:04:38.127 --> 00:04:40.274
and the client says,
"We want a walking shot,"

00:04:40.298 --> 00:04:43.982
this leg goes first, nice and long,
this arm goes back, this arm goes forward,

00:04:44.006 --> 00:04:46.924
the head is at three quarters,
and you just go back and forth,

00:04:46.948 --> 00:04:49.948
just do that, and then you look back
at your imaginary friends,

00:04:49.972 --> 00:04:51.691
300, 400, 500 times.

00:04:51.715 --> 00:04:53.395
(Laughter)

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.206
It will look something like this.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.417
(Laughter)

00:04:57.441 --> 00:05:00.369
Hopefully less awkward
than that one in the middle.
