00:03:27.766 --> 00:03:30.870
and of the 677 models that were hired,

00:03:30.894 --> 00:03:34.387
only 27, or less than four percent,
were non-white.

00:03:35.637 --> 00:03:37.570
The next question people always ask is,

00:03:37.594 --> 00:03:39.219
"Can I be a model when I grow up?"

00:03:39.243 --> 00:03:42.877
And the first answer is, "I don't know,
they don't put me in charge of that."

00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:44.294
But the second answer,

00:03:44.318 --> 00:03:47.072
and what I really want to say
to these little girls is,

00:03:47.096 --> 00:03:49.086
"Why? You know? You can be anything.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.356
You could be the President
of the United States,

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.157
or the inventor of the next Internet,

00:03:53.181 --> 00:03:55.139
or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet,

00:03:55.163 --> 00:03:57.830
which would be awesome,
because you'd be the first one."

00:03:57.854 --> 00:04:00.016
