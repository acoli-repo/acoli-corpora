00:06:56.077 --> 00:07:00.092
86% of them were black and Latino,
and most of them were young men.

00:07:00.116 --> 00:07:04.578
And there are only 177,000
young black and Latino men in New York,

00:07:04.602 --> 00:07:07.317
so for them, it's not a question
of, "Will I get stopped?"

00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:10.399
but "How many times will I get stopped?
When will I get stopped?"

00:07:10.423 --> 00:07:11.995
When I was researching this talk,

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:15.174
I found out that of the 13-year-old girls
in the United States,

00:07:15.198 --> 00:07:17.861
53% don't like their bodies,

00:07:17.885 --> 00:07:20.854
and that number goes to 78%
by the time that they're 17.

00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:24.879
So, the last question people ask me is,

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:26.503
"What is it like to be a model?"

00:07:26.527 --> 00:07:28.910
And I think the answer
that they're looking for is,

00:07:28.934 --> 00:07:31.854
"If you are a little bit skinnier
and you have shinier hair,
