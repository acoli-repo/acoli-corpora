00:08:59.631 --> 00:09:01.304
which seems so important right now.

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:03.972
If there's a takeaway to this talk,

00:09:03.996 --> 00:09:07.599
I hope it's that we all feel
more comfortable acknowledging

00:09:07.623 --> 00:09:11.566
the power of image
in our perceived successes

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.466
and our perceived failures.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.842
Thank you.

00:09:14.866 --> 00:09:16.970
