00:10:28.987 --> 00:10:32.087
Well, what we tend to do about it

00:10:32.111 --> 00:10:34.681
is we think about Orwell-space.

00:10:34.705 --> 00:10:38.545
And we try to make electronic versions
of the identity card

00:10:38.569 --> 00:10:40.141
that we got rid of in 1953.

00:10:40.165 --> 00:10:42.696
So we think if we had a card --

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.134
call it a Facebook login --

00:10:44.158 --> 00:10:45.354
which proves who you are,

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:47.159
and I make you carry it all the time,

00:10:47.183 --> 00:10:48.339
that solves the problem.

00:10:48.363 --> 00:10:51.593
And of course, for all those
reasons I've just outlined, it doesn't,

00:10:51.617 --> 00:10:53.443
and it might make some problems worse.

00:10:53.467 --> 00:10:56.069
The more times you're forced
to use your real identity,

00:10:56.093 --> 00:10:57.672
certainly in transactional terms,

00:10:57.696 --> 00:11:00.593
the more likely that identity
is to get stolen and subverted.
