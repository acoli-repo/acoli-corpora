00:14:28.807 --> 00:14:32.539
Anyone should be able
to write some code to do this.

00:14:33.427 --> 00:14:36.656
Well, you know what symmetry is,
so you don't need a picture of it.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.262
This is how we're going to do it.

00:14:38.286 --> 00:14:40.872
We're going to do it using phones
and mobile proximity.

00:14:40.896 --> 00:14:42.361
I'm going to suggest to you

00:14:42.385 --> 00:14:45.857

psychic paper is already here,

00:14:45.881 --> 00:14:48.846
and if any of you have got
one of the new Barclay's debit cards

Does that ring a bell?

00:14:57.027 --> 00:14:58.465
The technology already exists.

00:14:58.489 --> 00:15:00.973
The first phones that have
the technology built in --
