00:10:57.696 --> 00:11:00.593
the more likely that identity
is to get stolen and subverted.

00:11:00.617 --> 00:11:02.770
The goal is to stop people
from using identity

00:11:02.794 --> 00:11:04.815
in transactions which don't need identity,

00:11:04.839 --> 00:11:07.097
which is actually almost all transactions.

00:11:07.121 --> 00:11:11.175
Almost all of the transactions you do
are not "Who are you?"

00:11:11.199 --> 00:11:13.269
They're "Are you allowed
to drive the car?"

00:11:13.293 --> 00:11:15.807
"Are you allowed in the building?"
"Are you over 18?"

00:11:15.831 --> 00:11:17.784
etcetera, etcetera.

00:11:17.808 --> 00:11:19.495
So my suggestion -- I, like James,

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:22.540
think that there should be
a resurgence of interest in R and D.

00:11:22.564 --> 00:11:24.238
I think this is a solvable problem.

00:11:24.262 --> 00:11:25.746
It's something we can do about.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.799
Naturally, in these circumstances,
I turn to Doctor Who.

00:11:28.823 --> 00:11:29.976
Because in this --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.001
(Laughter)
