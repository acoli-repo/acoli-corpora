00:09:30.472 --> 00:09:35.353
But suppose I worked
next to somebody in a bank

00:09:35.377 --> 00:09:36.764
who was doing something --

00:09:36.788 --> 00:09:41.487
you know, they were like people who take

That's the word I was thinking of.

00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:47.633

"This guy's a rogue trader."

00:09:54.152 --> 00:09:55.484
That message is meaningless

00:09:55.508 --> 00:09:58.076
if you don't know
that I'm a trader at the bank.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:00.037
If that message just comes from anybody,
