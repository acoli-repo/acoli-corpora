(Laughter)

00:05:31.471 --> 00:05:34.742
I mean, they generally are,
when you look in the paper, right?

00:05:34.766 --> 00:05:37.747
"So I want to know who all the people
in the chat room are.

00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:39.534
So, OK, you can go in the chat room,

00:05:39.558 --> 00:05:42.658
but only if everybody in the chat room
is using their real names,

00:05:42.682 --> 00:05:45.646
and they submit full copies
of their police report."

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.824
(Laughter)

00:05:46.848 --> 00:05:50.043
But of course, if anybody
in the chat room asked for his real name,

00:05:50.067 --> 00:05:52.587
I'd say, "No. You can't
give them your real name,

00:05:52.611 --> 00:05:55.109
because what happens
if they turn out to be perverts

00:05:55.133 --> 00:05:57.317
and teachers and whatever?"

00:05:57.341 --> 00:05:59.152
So you have this odd sort of paradox

00:05:59.176 --> 00:06:01.327
where I'm happy for him
to go into this space
