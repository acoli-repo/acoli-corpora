the phone says, "Yes, that's whoever,"

00:13:30.686 --> 00:13:32.508
and the ATM then gives you some money.

00:13:32.532 --> 00:13:35.543

00:13:50.363 --> 00:13:52.377

It doesn't disclose any other information.

00:13:56.025 --> 00:13:57.648
It has to have no special gadgets.

00:13:57.672 --> 00:14:00.727
That can only mean one thing,
