00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:30.196
And so what I thought I'd do is,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.177
I'll explain four sort of
problems about it,

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:35.999
and then I'll suggest a solution,

00:00:36.023 --> 00:00:38.140
which, hopefully,
you might find interesting.

00:00:38.164 --> 00:00:39.920
So just to frame the problem:

00:00:39.944 --> 00:00:41.709
What does "authenticity" mean?

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.274
That's me,

00:00:43.298 --> 00:00:47.918
that's a camera phone picture
of me looking at a painting.

00:00:47.942 --> 00:00:49.004
[What's the Problem?]

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:51.810
That's a painting that was painted
by a very famous forger,

00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:54.040
and because I'm not very good
at presentations,

00:00:54.064 --> 00:00:56.804
I already can't remember the name
that I wrote on my card.

00:00:56.828 --> 00:01:00.435
And he was incarcerated in,
I think, Wakefield Prison,
