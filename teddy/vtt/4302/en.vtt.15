00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.675
So the girls all logged into Facebook
and deleted their profiles.

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:35.289
So when the teacher logged in,
there was nothing there.

00:07:35.313 --> 00:07:39.295
My point is: those identities,
they don't think about them the same way.

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:43.169
Identity is -- especially when
you're a teenager -- a fluid thing.

00:07:43.193 --> 00:07:45.729
You have lots of identities,
you experiment with them.

00:07:45.753 --> 00:07:49.433
And if you have an identity you don't
like because it's subverted in some way

00:07:49.457 --> 00:07:51.315
or it's insecure or it's inappropriate,

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:53.207
you just delete it and get another one.

00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:56.458
The idea that you have an identity
that's given to you by someone,

00:07:56.482 --> 00:07:57.781
the government or whatever,

00:07:57.805 --> 00:08:00.869
and you have to stick with that identity
and use it in all places
