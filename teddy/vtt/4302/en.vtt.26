00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:01.575
So, in order to build that
and make it work,

00:13:01.599 --> 00:13:04.362
I'm only going to name these things,
I'll not go into them:

00:13:04.386 --> 00:13:05.825
we need a plan,

00:13:05.849 --> 00:13:08.484
which is, we're going to build
this as an infrastructure

00:13:08.508 --> 00:13:10.959
for everybody to use
to solve all of these problems.

00:13:10.983 --> 00:13:12.611
We're going to make a utility.

00:13:12.635 --> 00:13:15.412
The utility has to be universal,
you can use it everywhere.

00:13:15.436 --> 00:13:18.647
I'm just giving you little flashes
of the technology as we go along.

00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:19.831
That's a Japanese ATM,

00:13:19.855 --> 00:13:22.633
the fingerprint template
is stored inside the mobile phone.

00:13:22.657 --> 00:13:24.363
So when you want to draw money out,

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:26.793
you put the phone on the ATM
and touch your finger,

00:13:26.817 --> 00:13:28.828
your fingerprint
goes through to the phone,

00:13:28.852 --> 00:13:30.662
the phone says, "Yes, that's whoever,"
