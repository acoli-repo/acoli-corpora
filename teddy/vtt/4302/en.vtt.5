00:02:27.498 --> 00:02:30.332
And even more amusingly,
and on my debit card, too,

00:02:30.356 --> 00:02:33.634
we print the name and the sort code
and everything else on the front.

00:02:33.658 --> 00:02:35.208
Why?

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:39.867
There is no earthly reason why your name
is printed on a chip-and-PIN card.

00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:41.788
And if you think about it,

00:02:41.812 --> 00:02:44.812
it's even more insidious and perverse
than it seems at first.

00:02:44.836 --> 00:02:48.349
Because the only people that benefit
from having the name on the card

00:02:48.373 --> 00:02:49.528
are criminals.

00:02:49.552 --> 00:02:51.173
You know what your name is, right?

00:02:51.197 --> 00:02:52.204
(Laughter)

00:02:52.228 --> 00:02:54.553
And when you go into a shop
and buy something,

00:02:54.577 --> 00:02:56.972
it's a PIN -- he doesn't care
what the name is.

00:02:56.996 --> 00:02:59.774
The only place you ever have to write
your name on the back

00:02:59.798 --> 00:03:00.953
is in America.
