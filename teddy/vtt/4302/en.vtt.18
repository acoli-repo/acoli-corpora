00:08:59.892 --> 00:09:00.894
(Laughter)

00:09:00.918 --> 00:09:04.766
So this nonsense about "you've got to have
real names on Facebook" and whatever,

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.566
that gets you that kind of security.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.691
That gets you "security theater,"

00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:10.662
where there's no actual security,

00:09:10.686 --> 00:09:13.988
but people are sort of playing parts
in a play about security,

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:16.111
and as long as everybody
learns their lines,

00:09:16.135 --> 00:09:17.288
everyone's happy.

00:09:17.312 --> 00:09:19.284
But it's not real security, right?

00:09:20.036 --> 00:09:23.073
Especially because I hate banks
more than the G20 protesters do,

00:09:23.097 --> 00:09:24.258
because I work for them.

00:09:24.282 --> 00:09:27.465
I know that things are actually worse
than these guys think.

00:09:27.489 --> 00:09:29.532
