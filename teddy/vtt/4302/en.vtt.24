00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.429
Oh right, you were in the library
the whole time studying, I guess.

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:02.234
Is that what you're going to tell us?

00:12:02.258 --> 00:12:03.702
Doctor Who's psychic paper is:

00:12:03.726 --> 00:12:05.393
when you hold up the psychic paper,

00:12:05.417 --> 00:12:06.764
the person, in their brain,

00:12:06.788 --> 00:12:08.915
sees the thing that they need to see.

00:12:08.939 --> 00:12:11.341
So I want to show you a British passport,

00:12:11.365 --> 00:12:12.717
I hold up the psychic paper,

00:12:12.741 --> 00:12:14.056
you see a British passport.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.707
I want to get into a party,

00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:17.115
I hold up the psychic paper,

00:12:17.139 --> 00:12:18.569
I show you a party invitation.

00:12:18.593 --> 00:12:20.526
You see what you want to see.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.840
So what I'm saying is, we need
to make an electronic version of that,

00:12:23.864 --> 00:12:26.070
but with one tiny, tiny change,

00:12:26.094 --> 00:12:28.667
which is that it'll only show you
the British passport

00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:29.884
if I've actually got one.

00:12:29.908 --> 00:12:32.911
It'll only show you the party invitation
if I actually have one.
