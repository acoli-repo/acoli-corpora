WEBVTT

00:01:59.836 --> 00:02:01.261
is extremely secure,

00:02:01.285 --> 00:02:03.653
you can put scanning
electron microscopes on it,

00:02:03.677 --> 00:02:05.847
you can try and grind it down,
blah blah blah.

00:02:05.871 --> 00:02:09.258
Those chips have never been broken,
whatever you read in the paper.

00:02:09.282 --> 00:02:12.541
And for a joke,

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:16.216
and we bond it to a trivially
counterfeitable magnetic stripe.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.431
And for very lazy criminals,
we still emboss the card.

00:02:19.455 --> 00:02:23.106
So if you're a criminal in a hurry
and you need to copy someone's card,

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.271
you can just stick a piece of paper on it
and rub a pencil over it

00:02:26.295 --> 00:02:27.474
just to speed things up.

00:02:27.498 --> 00:02:30.332
And even more amusingly,
and on my debit card, too,
