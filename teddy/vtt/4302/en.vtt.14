00:06:58.824 --> 00:07:01.363
kids are forced to hand over
their Facebook passwords.

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:03.637
So you have to give them
your Facebook password.

00:07:03.661 --> 00:07:06.533
So the kid -- she was a kid! --
what she should have said is,

00:07:06.557 --> 00:07:09.294
"My lawyer will be calling
you first thing in the morning.

00:07:09.318 --> 00:07:12.628
It's an outrageous imposition
on my Fourth Amendment right to privacy.

00:07:12.652 --> 00:07:14.794
You'll be sued
for all the money you've got!"

00:07:14.818 --> 00:07:16.398
That's what she should have said.

00:07:16.422 --> 00:07:18.681
But she's a kid,
so she hands over the password.

00:07:18.705 --> 00:07:20.112
The teacher can't log in,

00:07:20.136 --> 00:07:22.533
because the school
has blocked access to Facebook.

00:07:22.557 --> 00:07:25.340
So the teacher can't log into Facebook
till she gets home.

00:07:25.364 --> 00:07:26.801
So the girl tells her friends,

00:07:26.825 --> 00:07:29.516
"Guess what happened?
The teacher logged in. She knows."

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.675
So the girls all logged into Facebook
and deleted their profiles.
