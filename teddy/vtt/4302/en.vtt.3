00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:32.105
and that's a good example to show it.

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:37.432
I tried to pick four problems
that will frame the issue properly.

00:01:37.456 --> 00:01:39.946
So the first problem, I thought,
chip and PIN, right?

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.667
[Banks and legacies
bringing down the system from within]

00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:44.512
[Offline solutions do not work online]

00:01:44.536 --> 00:01:46.536
Everyone's got a chip and PIN card, right?

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.003
So why is that a good example?

00:01:48.027 --> 00:01:50.804
That's the example
of how legacy thinking about identity

00:01:50.828 --> 00:01:53.679
subverts the security
of a well-constructed system.

00:01:53.703 --> 00:01:56.767
That chip-and-PIN card
that's in your pocket

00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:59.812
has a little chip on it
that cost millions of pounds to develop,

00:01:59.836 --> 00:02:01.261
is extremely secure,
