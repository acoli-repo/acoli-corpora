00:04:29.016 --> 00:04:32.604
and then they sell tickets,
and the first band on the --

00:04:32.628 --> 00:04:36.229
I was going to say "menu," that's
probably the wrong word for it, isn't it?

00:04:36.253 --> 00:04:38.159
The first band on the list of bands

00:04:38.183 --> 00:04:42.000
that appears at some
public music performance of some kind

00:04:42.024 --> 00:04:44.603
gets the sales from the first 20 tickets,

00:04:44.627 --> 00:04:46.348
then the next band gets the next 20,

00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:47.541
and so on.

00:04:47.565 --> 00:04:49.851
They were at the bottom
of the menu, like, fifth,

00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:51.259
I thought they had no chance.

00:04:51.283 --> 00:04:53.341
He actually got 20 quid. Fantastic, right?

00:04:53.365 --> 00:04:55.399
But my point is,
that all worked perfectly,

00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:57.727
except on the web.

00:04:57.751 --> 00:05:00.343
So they're sitting on Facebook,
