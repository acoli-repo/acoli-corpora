00:14:58.489 --> 00:15:00.973
The first phones that have
the technology built in --

00:15:00.997 --> 00:15:03.550
the Google Nexus, the S II,
the Samsung Wave 578 --

00:15:03.574 --> 00:15:07.503
the first phones that have the technology
built into them are already in the shops.

00:15:07.527 --> 00:15:10.421
So the idea that the gasman
can turn up at my mum's door,

00:15:10.445 --> 00:15:12.376
and he can show my mum his phone,

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.110
and she can tap it with her phone,

00:15:14.134 --> 00:15:17.003
and it'll come up with green
if he really is from British Gas

00:15:17.027 --> 00:15:18.183
and allowed in,

00:15:18.207 --> 00:15:20.644
and will come up with red
if he isn't, end of story.

00:15:20.668 --> 00:15:22.294
We have the technology to do that.

00:15:22.318 --> 00:15:23.471
And what's more,

00:15:23.495 --> 00:15:26.262
although some of those things
sound a bit counterintuitive,

00:15:26.286 --> 00:15:28.631
like proving I'm over 18
without proving who I am,

00:15:28.655 --> 00:15:30.711
the cryptography to do that
not only exists,
