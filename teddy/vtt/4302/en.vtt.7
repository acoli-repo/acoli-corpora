Because we think identity
is something to do with names,

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.552
and because we're rooted
in the idea of the identity card,

00:03:36.576 --> 00:03:37.754
which obsesses us.

00:03:37.778 --> 00:03:40.370
And I know it crashed and burned
a couple of years ago,

00:03:40.394 --> 00:03:44.304
but if you're someone in politics
or the Home Office or whatever,

00:03:44.328 --> 00:03:45.752
and you think about identity,

00:03:45.776 --> 00:03:48.992
you can only think of identity
in terms of cards with names on.

00:03:49.016 --> 00:03:51.831
And that's very subversive
in a modern world.

00:03:52.427 --> 00:03:54.680
So the second example I thought I'd use

00:03:54.704 --> 00:03:56.499
is chat rooms.

00:03:56.523 --> 00:03:57.679
[Chatrooms and Children]

00:03:57.703 --> 00:03:59.191
I'm very proud of that picture.

00:03:59.215 --> 00:04:01.709
That's my son playing
in his band with his friends
