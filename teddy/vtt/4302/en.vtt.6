00:02:59.798 --> 00:03:00.953
is in America.

00:03:00.977 --> 00:03:02.178
Whenever I go to America,

00:03:02.202 --> 00:03:05.035
and I have to pay with a magstripe
on the back of the card,

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:08.414
I always sign it "Carlos Tethers" anyway,
just as a security mechanism,

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.498
because if a transaction
ever gets disputed,

00:03:10.522 --> 00:03:12.528
and it comes back
and it says "Dave Birch,"

00:03:12.552 --> 00:03:14.279
I know it must have been a criminal,

00:03:14.303 --> 00:03:16.527
because I would never
sign it "Dave Birch."

00:03:16.551 --> 00:03:17.805
(Laughter)

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.872
So if you drop your card in the street,

00:03:19.896 --> 00:03:22.101
it means a criminal
can pick it up and read it.

00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:24.983
They know the name,
from the name, they can find the address,

00:03:25.007 --> 00:03:27.178
and then they can go off
and buy stuff online.

00:03:27.202 --> 00:03:28.881
Why do we put the name on the card?

00:03:28.905 --> 00:03:32.486
Because we think identity
is something to do with names,
