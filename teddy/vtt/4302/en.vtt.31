00:15:28.655 --> 00:15:30.711
the cryptography to do that
not only exists,

00:15:30.735 --> 00:15:32.889
it's extremely well-known
and well-understood.

00:15:32.913 --> 00:15:35.840
Digital signatures, the blinding
of public key certificates --

00:15:35.864 --> 00:15:38.118
these technologies
have been around for a while,

00:15:38.142 --> 00:15:40.152
we've just had no way
of packaging them up.

00:15:40.176 --> 00:15:41.760
So the technology already exists.

00:15:41.784 --> 00:15:45.084
We know it works.

00:15:45.108 --> 00:15:47.591
There are a few examples
of the technology being used

00:15:47.615 --> 00:15:48.850
in experimental places.

00:15:48.874 --> 00:15:50.179
That's London Fashion Week,

00:15:50.203 --> 00:15:52.054
where we built a system with O2.

00:15:52.078 --> 00:15:54.694
That's for the Wireless
Festival in Hyde Park.

00:15:54.718 --> 00:15:57.382
You can see the person's
walking in with their VIP band,

00:15:57.406 --> 00:16:00.321
it's being checked by the Nokia phone
that's reading the band.
