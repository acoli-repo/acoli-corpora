If that message just comes from anybody,

00:10:00.061 --> 00:10:02.695
it has zero information value.

00:10:02.719 --> 00:10:04.750
There's no point in sending that message.

00:10:04.774 --> 00:10:06.841
You have to know that I'm ...

00:10:06.865 --> 00:10:09.283
But if I have to prove who I am,

00:10:09.307 --> 00:10:11.052
I'll never send that message.

00:10:11.076 --> 00:10:14.665
It's just like the nurse in the hospital
reporting the drunk surgeon.

00:10:14.689 --> 00:10:17.770
That message will only happen
if I'm anonymous.

00:10:17.794 --> 00:10:22.218
So the system has to have ways
of providing anonymity in it,

00:10:22.242 --> 00:10:24.520
otherwise, we don't get
where we want to get to.

00:10:24.544 --> 00:10:26.628
So, four issues.

00:10:26.652 --> 00:10:28.963
So what are we going to do about it?

00:10:28.987 --> 00:10:32.087
Well, what we tend to do about it
