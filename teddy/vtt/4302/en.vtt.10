00:04:57.751 --> 00:05:00.343
So they're sitting on Facebook,

00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:03.007
and they're sending these messages
and arranging things,

00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:05.616
and they don't know who anybody is, right?

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.606
That's the problem we're trying to solve.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.301
If only they were using real names,

00:05:09.325 --> 00:05:11.952
then you wouldn't be worried
about them on the internet.

00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:13.136
So when he says to me,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.205
"Oh, I want to go to a chat room
to talk about guitars" or something,

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.354
I'm like, "Oh, well,
I don't want you to go into a chat room

00:05:20.378 --> 00:05:22.062
to talk about guitars,

00:05:22.086 --> 00:05:24.111
because they might
not all be your friends,

00:05:24.135 --> 00:05:26.408
and some of the people
that are in the chat room

00:05:26.432 --> 00:05:29.653
might be, you know, perverts
and teachers and vicars --"

00:05:29.677 --> 00:05:31.447
(Laughter)
