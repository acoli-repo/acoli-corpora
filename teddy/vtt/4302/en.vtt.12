00:05:59.176 --> 00:06:01.327
where I'm happy for him
to go into this space

00:06:01.351 --> 00:06:03.193
if I know who everybody else is,

00:06:03.217 --> 00:06:05.820
but I don't want anybody else
to know who he is.

00:06:05.844 --> 00:06:08.257
And so you get this sort of
logjam around identity,

00:06:08.281 --> 00:06:10.683
where you want full disclosure
from everybody else,

00:06:10.707 --> 00:06:11.863
but not from yourself.

00:06:11.887 --> 00:06:13.735
And there's no progress, we get stuck.

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:15.876
So the chat room thing
doesn't work properly,

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.506
and it's a very bad way
of thinking about identity.

00:06:18.937 --> 00:06:22.762
Cheerleading ... so, on my RSS feed,
I saw this thing about --

00:06:22.786 --> 00:06:25.358
I just said something bad
about my RSS feed, didn't I?

00:06:25.382 --> 00:06:27.008
I should stop saying it like that.

00:06:27.032 --> 00:06:28.892
For some random reason I can't imagine,

00:06:28.916 --> 00:06:31.357
something about cheerleaders
turned up in my in-box.
