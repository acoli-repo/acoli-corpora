00:00:56.828 --> 00:01:00.435
And he was incarcerated in,
I think, Wakefield Prison,

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:04.231
for forging masterpieces by,
I think, French Impressionists.

00:01:04.255 --> 00:01:07.144
And he's so good at it
that when he was in prison,

00:01:07.168 --> 00:01:09.364
everybody in prison,
the governor and whatever,

00:01:09.388 --> 00:01:11.827
wanted him to paint masterpieces
to put on the walls

00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:13.096
because they were so good.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.297
And so that's a masterpiece,
which is a fake of a masterpiece,

00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:23.007
and bonded into the canvas is a chip
which identifies that as a real fake,

00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:24.191
if you see what I mean.

00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:25.268
(Laughter)

00:01:25.292 --> 00:01:27.575
So when we're talking about authenticity,

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:29.897
it's a little more fractal
than it appears,

00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:32.105
and that's a good example to show it.
