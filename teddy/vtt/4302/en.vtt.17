00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:31.579
I look pretty good in a suit, frankly,

00:08:31.603 --> 00:08:34.897
so you can see why it would drive them
into an anticapitalist frenzy.

00:08:34.921 --> 00:08:35.929
(Laughter)

00:08:35.953 --> 00:08:39.196
So I thought, "Well, if I don't
want to inflame the protesters,

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.825
the obvious thing to do
is go dressed as a protester."

00:08:41.849 --> 00:08:45.230
So I went dressed completely in black,
you know, black balaclava ...

00:08:45.254 --> 00:08:48.416
I had black gloves on but took them off
to sign the visitors' book.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.442
(Laughter)

00:08:49.466 --> 00:08:52.764
I'm wearing black trousers and boots,
I'm dressed completely in black.

00:08:52.788 --> 00:08:55.378
I go into the bank at 10am
and go, "Hi, I'm Dave Birch,

00:08:55.402 --> 00:08:57.172
I've got a 3 o'clock with so-and-so."

00:08:57.196 --> 00:08:59.868
"Sure!" And they sign me in.
There's my visitor's badge.

00:08:59.892 --> 00:09:00.894
(Laughter)
