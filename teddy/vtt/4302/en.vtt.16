00:07:57.805 --> 00:08:00.869
and you have to stick with that identity
and use it in all places

00:08:00.893 --> 00:08:02.046
is absolutely wrong.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.997
Why would you want to really know
who someone was on Facebook,

00:08:05.021 --> 00:08:07.846
unless you wanted to abuse them
and harass them in some way?

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.766
It just doesn't work properly.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.240
And my fourth example is,

00:08:11.264 --> 00:08:14.470
there are some cases
where you really want to be --

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:18.041
in case you're wondering,
that's me at the G20 protest.

00:08:18.065 --> 00:08:19.827
I wasn't actually at the G20 protest,

00:08:19.851 --> 00:08:23.907
but I had a meeting at a bank
on the day of the G20 protest.

00:08:23.931 --> 00:08:25.913
And I got an email from the bank, saying,

00:08:25.937 --> 00:08:29.215
"Please don't wear a suit,
because it'll inflame the protesters."

00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:31.579
I look pretty good in a suit, frankly,
