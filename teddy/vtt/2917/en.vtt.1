00:00:29.307 --> 00:00:31.507
when I'm bored, when I'm stressed,

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.101
I listen to and I create music.

00:00:35.716 --> 00:00:37.987
When I was younger, I played piano;

00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:39.408
later, I took up guitar.

00:00:39.432 --> 00:00:41.265
And as I started high school,

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.203
music became a part of my identity.

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:44.926
I was in every band,

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.576
I was involved with every
musical fine arts event.

00:00:48.158 --> 00:00:49.565
Music surrounded me.

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:50.944
It made me who I was,

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:53.078
and it gave me a place to belong.

00:00:54.656 --> 00:00:56.753
Now, I've always had
this thing with rhythms.

00:00:56.777 --> 00:00:57.946
I remember being young,

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.034
I would walk down
the hallways of my school
