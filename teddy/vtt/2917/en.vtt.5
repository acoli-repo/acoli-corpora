00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.200
Now, music has these parts --

00:02:31.224 --> 00:02:33.359
rhythm, melody and harmony --

00:02:33.383 --> 00:02:34.864
just like our lives.

00:02:35.552 --> 00:02:37.588
Where music has rhythm,

00:02:37.612 --> 00:02:39.866
we have routines and habits --

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.155
things that help us to remember
what to do and to stay on track,

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:45.058
and to just keep going.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.055
And you may not notice it,

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.402
but it's always there.

00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:53.035
(Guitar)

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:54.876
And it may seem simple,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.597
it may seem dull by itself,

00:02:58.587 --> 00:03:01.901
but it gives tempo and heartbeat.
