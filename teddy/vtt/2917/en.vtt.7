00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:31.351
You play on top of everything else,

00:03:33.321 --> 00:03:36.335
on top of the rhythms and the beat

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.488
because you're the melody.

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:44.335
And things may change and develop,

00:03:45.226 --> 00:03:46.786
but no matter what we do,

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.428
we're still the same people.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.291
Throughout a song melodies develop,

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.015
but it's still the same song.

00:03:55.253 --> 00:03:57.037
No matter what you do,

00:03:57.061 --> 00:03:58.987
the rhythms are still there:

00:03:59.011 --> 00:04:02.137
the tempo and the heartbeat ...
