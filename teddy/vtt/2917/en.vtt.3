00:01:28.912 --> 00:01:30.098
and analyzed it,

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:32.588
and figured out what made it tick.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.770
Every Wednesday, we did something
called "rhythmic dictation,"

00:01:36.794 --> 00:01:38.196
and I was pretty good at it.

00:01:38.772 --> 00:01:41.027
Our teacher would give us
an amount of measures

00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:42.544
and a time signature,

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:44.432
and then he would speak a rhythm to us

00:01:44.456 --> 00:01:47.872
and we would have to write it down
with the proper rests and notes.

00:01:48.412 --> 00:01:49.683
Like this:

00:01:50.622 --> 00:01:53.099
ta ta tuck-a tuck-a ta,

00:01:53.123 --> 00:01:55.676
ta tuck-a-tuck-a-tuck-a, tuck-a.

00:01:56.832 --> 00:01:58.137
And I loved it.

00:01:58.161 --> 00:01:59.639
The simplicity of the rhythm --

00:01:59.663 --> 00:02:01.821
a basic two- to four- measure line --
