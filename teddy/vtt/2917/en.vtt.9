00:04:28.603 --> 00:04:31.417
It's like I had been taken out
of my natural environment,

00:04:31.441 --> 00:04:32.786
and put somewhere new,

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.642
where the rhythms and the harmonies

00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:38.323
and the form had gone away,

00:04:39.638 --> 00:04:41.007
and it was just me --

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:42.356
(Guitar)

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.653
silence and my melody.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.425
And even that began to waver,

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.401
because I didn't know what I was doing.

00:04:53.074 --> 00:04:55.470
I didn't have any chords
to structure myself,

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:57.547
or a rhythm

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.967
or a beat to know the tempo.

00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:03.461
(Guitar)
