00:06:27.255 --> 00:06:30.845
music is a fundamental part of what we are

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:32.342
and of everything around us.

00:06:33.276 --> 00:06:34.696
Now, music is my passion,

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.147
but physics also used to be
an interest of mine.

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:38.806
And the more I learned,

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.059
the more I saw connections
between the two --

00:06:41.678 --> 00:06:43.549
especially regarding string theory.

00:06:45.275 --> 00:06:48.013
I know this is only one of many theories,

00:06:48.037 --> 00:06:49.543
but it spoke to me.

00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:55.287
So, one aspect of string theory,
at its simplest form, is this:

00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:57.337
matter is made up of atoms,

00:06:57.361 --> 00:07:00.579
which are made up of protons
and neutrons and electrons,
