00:06:57.361 --> 00:07:00.579
which are made up of protons
and neutrons and electrons,

00:07:00.603 --> 00:07:02.329
which are made up of quark.

00:07:02.353 --> 00:07:04.386
And here's where the string part comes in.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.941
This quark is supposedly made up
of little coiled strings,

00:07:08.696 --> 00:07:12.884
and it's the vibrations of these strings
that make everything what it is.

00:07:13.751 --> 00:07:15.302
Michio Kaku once explained this

00:07:15.326 --> 00:07:18.258
in a lecture called,
"The Universe in a Nutshell,"

00:07:18.282 --> 00:07:19.657
where he says,

00:07:20.504 --> 00:07:22.744
"String theory is the simple idea

00:07:22.768 --> 00:07:24.796
that the four forces of the universe --

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:29.006
gravity, the electromagnetic force,
and the two strong forces --

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.005
can be viewed as music.
