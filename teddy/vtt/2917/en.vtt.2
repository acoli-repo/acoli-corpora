00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.034
I would walk down
the hallways of my school

00:01:00.058 --> 00:01:03.048
and I would tap rhythms to myself
on my leg with my hands,

00:01:03.072 --> 00:01:04.792
or tapping my teeth.

00:01:05.684 --> 00:01:07.163
It was a nervous habit,

00:01:07.187 --> 00:01:08.470
and I was always nervous.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.126
I think I liked the repetition
of the rhythm --

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.510
it was calming.

00:01:13.957 --> 00:01:15.107
Then in high school,

00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:16.644
I started music theory,

00:01:16.668 --> 00:01:18.898
and it was the best class I've ever taken.

00:01:18.922 --> 00:01:20.456
We were learning about music --

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.169
things I didn't know,
like theory and history.

00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:27.236
It was a class where we basically
just listened to a song,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.888
talked about what it meant to us

00:01:28.912 --> 00:01:30.098
and analyzed it,
