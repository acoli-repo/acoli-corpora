00:01:58.746 --> 00:02:01.544
for me is like making a portrait
of someone that I love.

00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:03.574
And when I make a photograph,

00:02:03.598 --> 00:02:06.321
I have to think about
what I want it to say.

00:02:06.888 --> 00:02:09.903
I have to ask myself
what I want it to feel like.

00:02:09.927 --> 00:02:12.033
When you're communicating
through an image,

00:02:12.057 --> 00:02:13.872
every creative choice matters.

00:02:13.896 --> 00:02:15.893
Sometimes, I plan to share my images,

00:02:15.917 --> 00:02:18.022
and other times, I take them
just for myself.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.421
I currently host a video series
on the future of the outdoors,

00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:24.287
and for one of the episodes
we wanted to explore

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:27.864
the relationship between
photography and outdoor spaces.

00:02:27.888 --> 00:02:30.019
I learned about the research
of Kristin Diehl
