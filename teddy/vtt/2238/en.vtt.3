or to see it with our own eyes.

00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:34.361
When I'm behind the camera,

00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:36.987
I notice the smallest details:

00:01:37.011 --> 00:01:39.719
the layers of light in the mountains

00:01:39.743 --> 00:01:42.193
as the light fades at the end of the day;

00:01:42.217 --> 00:01:45.471
the shapes that nature so expertly makes,

00:01:45.495 --> 00:01:48.141
abstract and yet completely perfect.

00:01:48.978 --> 00:01:52.588
I could go on and on here musing
about the intricacies of this planet

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:54.462
and the way that it makes me feel.

00:01:55.544 --> 00:01:58.722
Photographing the beauty
and complexity of this world

00:01:58.746 --> 00:02:01.544
for me is like making a portrait
of someone that I love.
