00:02:27.888 --> 00:02:30.019
I learned about the research
of Kristin Diehl

00:02:30.043 --> 00:02:31.529
and her colleagues at USC,

00:02:31.553 --> 00:02:34.701
who studied photo-taking's
effect on enjoyment levels.

00:02:34.725 --> 00:02:37.135
They found that when we're
behind the camera,

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.055
when we're the ones taking the picture,

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:41.656
we enjoy our experiences more, not less.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.224
But it wasn't true all the time.

00:02:43.248 --> 00:02:47.059
If the person took the photo
solely with the intention of sharing it,

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.784
there was no increase in enjoyment,

00:02:48.808 --> 00:02:51.038
because they didn't do it for themselves.

00:02:51.062 --> 00:02:53.480
So this points to
an important distinction:

00:02:53.504 --> 00:02:55.913
photography can enhance your experience

00:02:55.937 --> 00:02:57.745
if it's done intentionally.

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.242
The intention piece is what matters.
