Well, the next time you feel the impulse
to take out your camera or phone,

00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:33.342
or, in my case, once you realize
you have already pulled it out --

00:07:33.366 --> 00:07:34.446
(Laughter)

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:35.875
First: stop.

00:07:36.567 --> 00:07:37.879
Pause.

00:07:37.903 --> 00:07:39.236
Take a deep breath.

00:07:40.148 --> 00:07:42.187
Look around. What do you notice?

00:07:44.045 --> 00:07:46.716
Are you experiencing
this moment with someone else?

00:07:47.191 --> 00:07:49.867
Remember that this moment only comes once.

00:07:50.267 --> 00:07:53.280
Photography can be part
of a beautiful experience.

00:07:53.304 --> 00:07:56.503
Just don't let it be a block
between you and reality.

00:07:56.527 --> 00:07:57.940
Be intentional,

00:07:57.964 --> 00:08:01.594
and don't lose a beautiful,
irreplaceable memory,
