00:03:58.518 --> 00:04:00.935
Other times, I choose
to leave the camera behind,

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.797
and I think that choice ultimately
improves both my experience

00:04:04.821 --> 00:04:06.097
and my work.

00:04:06.672 --> 00:04:09.752
I recently flew to
the South Pacific island of Tonga

00:04:09.776 --> 00:04:11.413
to swim with humpback whales.

00:04:11.887 --> 00:04:14.264
I noticed myself feeling pressure

00:04:14.288 --> 00:04:17.146
and a certain obligation
to take the camera with me,

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.346
when sometimes I just wanted
the pure experience itself.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.796
And the experience is seriously amazing.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.705
You're talking about being in the water

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.493
with a curious baby animal
the size of a station wagon

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:31.272
while you are surrounded by particles
that float around you like glitter,
