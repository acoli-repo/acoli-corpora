00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:01.101
I started to see online.

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:02.872
And I was participating in it.

00:01:03.784 --> 00:01:05.090
So this made me wonder:

00:01:05.114 --> 00:01:08.215
Why are we taking photos
in the first place?

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:11.021
Sometimes, I visit a popular landmark --

00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:14.088
this one is Horseshoe Bend in Arizona --

00:01:14.112 --> 00:01:16.862
and I see all the people
with their phones and cameras out

00:01:16.886 --> 00:01:18.054
who snap a photo,

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:21.335
just to turn and get back in the car
or walk back to the trailhead.

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:25.187
And sometimes it seems like
we are missing the point

00:01:25.211 --> 00:01:29.582
of going to this place
to experience it for ourselves

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:32.194
or to see it with our own eyes.
