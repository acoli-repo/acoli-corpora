are located in these sensitive areas,

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.511
but the request not to photograph them
is an explicit and direct invitation

00:05:37.535 --> 00:05:41.624
to learn more about the land,
its importance and its people.

00:05:41.648 --> 00:05:43.913
Isn't that what we should be doing anyway?

00:05:43.937 --> 00:05:46.963
So my visit to Uluru
quickly became not about me

00:05:46.987 --> 00:05:50.171
but about connecting with the place.

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:52.465
Ironically and unsurprisingly,

00:05:52.489 --> 00:05:54.622
I have found that presence and connection

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:57.849
also happens to make
for more compelling images.

00:05:58.413 --> 00:06:00.775
We can probably all point to social media
