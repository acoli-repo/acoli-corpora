00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:33.288
and having my camera with me
in this case enhanced that.

00:03:33.698 --> 00:03:37.338
We were all creating independently
but also all completely in the moment,

00:03:37.362 --> 00:03:39.350
both with nature and with each other.

00:03:39.374 --> 00:03:40.840
I so clearly remember

00:03:40.864 --> 00:03:44.431
capturing the water droplets
and the motion as the bears swam

00:03:44.455 --> 00:03:47.048
and the cute cubs following their mothers.

00:03:47.793 --> 00:03:50.482
That group and I will have
that experience together

00:03:50.506 --> 00:03:52.393
and these images to look back on

00:03:52.417 --> 00:03:53.589
time and time again,

00:03:53.613 --> 00:03:57.414
and photography is what enabled us
to share this in the first place.

00:03:58.518 --> 00:04:00.935
Other times, I choose
to leave the camera behind,
