while you are surrounded by particles
that float around you like glitter,

00:04:31.296 --> 00:04:34.044
and the mom swims gracefully below you.

00:04:34.068 --> 00:04:37.093
There were times, obviously,
when I did take my camera with me,

00:04:37.117 --> 00:04:40.080
and those were really amazing
to capture as well.

00:04:40.104 --> 00:04:41.976
But the setup is pretty big.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.503
It's like this big box.
This is what it looks like.

00:04:44.527 --> 00:04:46.583
And so this is between me and the whales,

00:04:46.607 --> 00:04:50.270
and at times that feels like a block
between you and reality.

00:04:50.294 --> 00:04:52.605
Is there a difference
when it's just your phone?

00:04:53.135 --> 00:04:55.658
Last year, I went to Uluru
in Central Australia,

00:04:55.682 --> 00:04:59.087
which is this massive rock
that towers over the desert.

00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:02.521
This is sacred land to Anangu,
