and then behind it you see the buttes
and clouds and cliffs.

00:00:31.822 --> 00:00:34.009
But what you might not see
from my photo here

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:37.587
is the 30 people behind me
who were also taking photos.

00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:40.842
And these are just the committed people,
the sunrise people, right?

00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.477
So when you think about that,

00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:47.852
there must be hundreds if not thousands
of photos of Mesa Arch taken every week.

00:00:47.876 --> 00:00:51.138
I've been sharing my photography
on Instagram for years,

00:00:51.162 --> 00:00:55.745
and it started to become
really interesting and funny, even,

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.347
just how many similar photos
of the same places

00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:01.101
I started to see online.
