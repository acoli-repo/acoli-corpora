00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.242
The intention piece is what matters.

00:03:00.691 --> 00:03:03.806
As a photographer, I've really
had to check myself on this.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.371
When does it help me
to have my camera out,

00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:08.639
and when do I just need to put it away?

00:03:08.663 --> 00:03:13.298
On a trip to Alaska, I had the opportunity
to photograph Alaskan brown bears.

00:03:13.322 --> 00:03:15.632
I was on a boat with
four other photographers,

00:03:15.656 --> 00:03:18.129
and we were all having our minds blown

00:03:18.153 --> 00:03:19.396
at the same time

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.980
in such close proximity to these animals.

00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:24.184
It's an emotional experience.

00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:27.545
Being eye to eye with these bears
gave me a feeling of connection

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.109
that transcends words,

00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:33.288
and having my camera with me
in this case enhanced that.
