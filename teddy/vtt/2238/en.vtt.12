We can probably all point to social media

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:04.728
as being a good place to share the images
from our travels and from our lives.

00:06:05.255 --> 00:06:08.144
We not only share pieces
of the world that we have seen

00:06:08.168 --> 00:06:10.640
but also parts of our
day-to-day experiences.

00:06:10.664 --> 00:06:14.507
And if we're applying intentionality
to the photos we take,

00:06:14.531 --> 00:06:17.631
then hopefully we're sharing
intentionally too.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.466
For me, allowing people to see pieces
of my story and my perspective online

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.228
has reminded me that I'm not alone.

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:28.475
It's helped me build support and community

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:30.252
to do the same for others.
