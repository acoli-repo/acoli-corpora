00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:30.252
to do the same for others.

00:06:31.212 --> 00:06:32.382
Let me be clear:

00:06:32.406 --> 00:06:36.017
I am not trying to discourage you
from taking photos.

00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:40.431
Even if thousands of people
have been to whatever exact location

00:06:40.455 --> 00:06:42.583
and taken whatever exact photo,

00:06:42.607 --> 00:06:44.936
I encourage you to get out and create too.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.286
The world needs every
voice and perspective,

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.862
and yours is included.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.858
But what I'm trying to show you
is that the phone or camera

00:06:52.882 --> 00:06:54.799
doesn't have to stay out all the time.

00:06:55.376 --> 00:06:57.221
What I'm trying to encourage you to do

00:06:57.245 --> 00:06:59.782
is to put it away, just for a moment --

00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:01.238
a moment for you.
