What is the most beautiful place
you have ever been?

00:00:05.778 --> 00:00:08.624
And when you were there,
did you take a picture of it?

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.761
Here's a place that tops that list for me.

00:00:11.785 --> 00:00:15.252
This is Mesa Arch
in Canyonlands National Park in Utah

00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:16.431
at sunrise.

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:19.090
It's the traditional homeland
of the Pueblo, Ute,

00:00:19.114 --> 00:00:21.005
Paiute and Navajo people,

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.643
and when you are there,

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:24.452
it is absolutely stunning.

00:00:24.476 --> 00:00:27.573
The sunrise illuminates
the bottom of the arch orange,

00:00:27.597 --> 00:00:31.798
and then behind it you see the buttes
and clouds and cliffs.
