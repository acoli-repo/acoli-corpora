This is sacred land to Anangu,

00:05:02.545 --> 00:05:04.633
who are the Aboriginal
people from this area

00:05:04.657 --> 00:05:06.933
and the traditional owners of the land.

00:05:07.455 --> 00:05:11.903
There are particular spots in Uluru
that you cannot photograph professionally,

00:05:11.927 --> 00:05:14.484
because they are culturally sensitive,

00:05:14.508 --> 00:05:17.470
equivalent to sacred scripture to Anangu.

00:05:17.494 --> 00:05:22.032
So because of this, most of my photographs
are from either far away, like this one,

00:05:22.056 --> 00:05:24.961
or from specific angles in the park.

00:05:24.985 --> 00:05:29.490
You could say that some of the most
interesting and beautiful visuals in Uluru

00:05:29.514 --> 00:05:31.926
are located in these sensitive areas,
