00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:12.467
On a daily basis, you spend
between a third and half

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:14.260
your waking hours daydreaming.

00:00:14.427 --> 00:00:16.429
That may sound like a huge waste of time,

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.140
but scientists think it must have 
some purpose,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.601
or humans wouldn’t have evolved
to do so much of it.

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:23.436
So to figure out what's going on here,

00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:26.355
let’s take a closer look 
at the mind-wanderer in chief:

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.357
the bored teenager.

00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:32.153
Wouldn’t it be cool to discover something,
anything.
