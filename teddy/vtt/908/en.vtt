00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I've been fascinated with crop diversity for about 35 years from now,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
ever since I stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
by a guy named Jack Harlan.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And he described the diversity within crops --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
as a genetic resource.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And he said, "This genetic resource," --

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and I'll never forget the words --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
"stands between us and catastrophic starvation

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
on a scale we cannot imagine."
