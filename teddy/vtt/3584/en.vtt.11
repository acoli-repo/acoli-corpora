00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
This is -- we have a fairly complex process

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
that, you know, software and musicians and so on,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
but when we're all done, we know that the ear is the final arbiter.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
We can play the original in one ear, and a new recording in the other.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
So I'm going to do this for you right now, what you just heard.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and the left speaker is going to be the new recording,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
actually of an instrument just like that one,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and I'm going to play them together at the same time.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
