00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And we look at every single note,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and all the attributes of those notes:

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
how hard they were struck, and how they were held down,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and how you move the fingers.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And, you know, it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
but we never had a science behind these kinds of things.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm going to start with Glenn Gould.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
He died 25 years ago this year, and was born 75 years ago this year.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Was a beloved pianist, maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
He just got tired of being in front of an audience,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and felt like -- a performing monkey was, in fact, his term.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So he stepped back, and did nothing but the crafting of his work.
