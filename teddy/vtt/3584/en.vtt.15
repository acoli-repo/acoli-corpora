00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
with this thing called binaural recording.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and it's got microphones where the ears are.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And when you put on headphones, and you listen to this,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
you're inside of Glenn Gould's body.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
who are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
"I can't believe it! It's just what it's like to play the piano."

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Except now you're inside Glenn Gould's body playing the piano,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and moving through the whole process.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
It's a game changer.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Here's now something we know in spectacular quality.
