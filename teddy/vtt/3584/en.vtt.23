00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
I didn't feel real comfortable about where we were.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
That's a real uncomfortable feeling,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
when all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and people are going to be sitting there in the audience.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
which has not changed since 1949, still seats 6,000 people.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And on the sweet spot on the stage, Tatum starts playing ...

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and every note, every beat, every slur, every accent, every pedal

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
was perfect, because he played it for that room on that day.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And we captured all that data all over again.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And I want you to hear that right now.
