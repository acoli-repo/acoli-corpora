00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that looks like a nice grand piano there.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things --

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but full of solenoids, and fiber optics, and computers

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and all this kind of stuff. The highest resolution out of Japan.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high-definition.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And we were able to cross this line, called the uncanny valley,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in terms of -- artificial intelligence terms.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We have a process where we, you know,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
kind of put it into the computer and digitize it, and then a whole lot of analysis.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And we look at every single note,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and all the attributes of those notes:
