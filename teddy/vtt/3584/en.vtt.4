So he stepped back, and did nothing but the crafting of his work.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And Gould's specialty was playing Bach.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
His maybe most famous recording

In fact, the theme isn't even the melody, it's the bass line.

one in mono, and one in stereo.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And the one in mono, by the way, he used the pedal,
