00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
every time you listen to it, it's the same thing -- it's frozen.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Wouldn't it be cool if every time you listened, it could be different?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
This morning, you're sadder, you want to hear your song,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
the same song, played sadder than you did yesterday.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
You want to hear it played by different musicians.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
We've seen all these "Star Treks," and they're all holodeck episodes as well.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Every time I listen to that, I get goose bumps.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
It's so amazing, it's so exciting.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Every time I listen to that recording it's like, "Oh my God,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening."

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
It's a way better experience

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
than whatever you're used to listening to, in whatever form.
