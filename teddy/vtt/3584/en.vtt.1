00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And so we said, there's a solution to this.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's separate the performance, as a thing,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
out from the recording, which was how it was made.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You know, the thing with microphones in the room and all that day.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and what instruments they were using.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And it's the data hidden inside the recording.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
In order to do this, it's a lot of hardware and software

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that runs in a very high resolution.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro
