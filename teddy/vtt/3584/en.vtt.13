(Music)

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Before "Jurassic Park,"

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.000
there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle, right?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So, in the video world,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
we've been able to invent, in our lifetimes, natural behavior.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And this is kind of another example

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
of putting a science behind natural behavior.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And then you heard the original.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Ultimately, I started with the experience.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians.
