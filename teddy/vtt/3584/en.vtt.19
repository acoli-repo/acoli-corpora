00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
That's where I'm at.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
But I believe we're on a path now, when we get to data,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
that we can distill styles, and templates, and formulas, and all these kinds of things,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
again, that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
It's now coming in this world.
