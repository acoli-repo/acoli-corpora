00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Ultimately, I started with the experience.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Lots of you can afford to buy one of these.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
But, if not, there is now high-definition surround sound.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And I got to tell you, if you haven't heard high-definition surround,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
go down to your audio dealer, your audiophile dealer.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
It's so involving compared to regular stereo.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
But if you don't have that, maybe you can listen on your headphones.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And so on the same disk we have five recordings --

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Sony has five recordings.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And you could listen in headphones

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
with this thing called binaural recording.
