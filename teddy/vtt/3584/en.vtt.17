00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Without putting dates next to these things,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
step-by-step music will be turned into data,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
like every field that's occurred in the past 35 or 40 years.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Audio has come very late to this game --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I'm not talking about digitizing, and bits, and re-mastering.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
which is how it was performed.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool --

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
they're high-resolution, and they're wired straight to our emotions,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and you can't trick them very easily.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement, you know.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
All right, there's this episode of "Star Trek."
