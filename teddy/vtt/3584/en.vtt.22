00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So I've really overshot my budget here.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
We made a new recording of him

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And I've got to tell you, we have this lab

where we build and measure everything, back in Raleigh, North Carolina,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and we flew out to Los Angeles.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And as the president of the company,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
I didn't feel real comfortable about where we were.
