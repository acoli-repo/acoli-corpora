00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Ninety-nine percent of us have the dream of listeners.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Not being the musicians -- the listeners, right?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And we crave one thing,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
even though we kind of don't know it all the time.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We crave to be in the room with the musician

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the day it was recorded, the day it was played.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And we go to live concerts, and we get that as much as we can.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And it turns out the further back you go in history,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the little rougher it sounds.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And so we said, there's a solution to this.
