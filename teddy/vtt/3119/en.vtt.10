00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.267
1,900 churches have been
shut down since 1969,

00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:07.918
due to shrinking congregations,

00:05:07.942 --> 00:05:10.188
while in Africa, every single day,

00:05:10.212 --> 00:05:11.890
a church or mosque is being built.

00:05:12.728 --> 00:05:15.808
In some communities,
you might not find a public health center,

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:18.257
a post office or even a school,

00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:19.972
but you'll find a church or mosque.

00:05:20.842 --> 00:05:24.635
Some of these churches
and mosques are world-class,

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.645
with excellent audio-visual systems,

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.499
wonderful meeting spaces,

00:05:28.523 --> 00:05:31.797
and they organize events
that rival international concerts.
