Imagine if every single church
in Lekki opened its doors

00:06:04.235 --> 00:06:05.989
to the homeless at night,

00:06:06.013 --> 00:06:10.504
gave them a sleeping bag, a warm meal
and a voucher in the morning

00:06:10.528 --> 00:06:12.368
to learn a vocational course,

00:06:12.392 --> 00:06:15.456
offered by the unemployed youth
who attend that church.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.448
That would demonstrate what we preach

00:06:18.472 --> 00:06:21.807
and what we speak about
as people of faith,

00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:25.003
and what led me to Christianity
in the first place.

00:06:26.675 --> 00:06:32.314
Similarly, we have to utilize
our resources for social change.
