00:00:57.172 --> 00:01:00.886
my faith was challenged
by a young nine-year-old

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.771
who asked a series of questions.

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:05.423
He asked,

00:01:05.447 --> 00:01:08.876
"Ms. Ndidi, does God hate Africans?"

00:01:10.345 --> 00:01:12.568
To which I quickly retorted,
"Of course not.

00:01:12.592 --> 00:01:14.774
God loves all his children equally."

00:01:15.634 --> 00:01:19.284
Then he asked, "So why do so many
young African children die?"

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:23.074
I stumbled and mumbled as I responded.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.803
"There are many reasons
why young African children die.

00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:30.504
Most of them are man-made,
and we cannot blame God."
