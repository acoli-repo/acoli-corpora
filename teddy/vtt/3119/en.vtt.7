00:03:27.983 --> 00:03:31.515
Both as people of faith
and of those who are not religious,

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.265
their perceptions of those of us
who are people of faith.

00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:39.657
Now, for people of faith
and those of us who are religious,

00:03:39.681 --> 00:03:42.488
we often say, "If God wills, I'll do this;

00:03:42.512 --> 00:03:44.798
inshallah, I'll do that --

00:03:44.822 --> 00:03:46.980
by God's grace, I'll do this."

00:03:47.988 --> 00:03:52.084
Now there are many things,
I believe, that we can control --

00:03:52.108 --> 00:03:53.360
some we cannot.

00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:56.435
I believe that God is all-powerful,

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.023
but he's not a micromanager.

00:03:59.066 --> 00:04:01.058
