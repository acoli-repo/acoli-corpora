00:12:26.889 --> 00:12:30.985
I hope that we, as people of faith,

00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:34.715
can truly live up to
the promise of social impact

00:12:34.739 --> 00:12:38.298
that we have been called to do
as change agents in society.

00:12:39.232 --> 00:12:41.326
And I believe that working with you,

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:42.601
all stakeholders,

00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:45.677
we can truly solve
Africa's most pressing challenges.

00:12:46.483 --> 00:12:47.689
I have that hope ...

00:12:48.986 --> 00:12:50.931
and I have the faith,

00:12:50.955 --> 00:12:52.601
and I've started to dance.

00:12:52.625 --> 00:12:53.866
Won't you join me?

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.041
Thank you.

00:12:55.065 --> 00:12:59.023
