00:08:29.434 --> 00:08:32.038
are actually owned
by faith-based organizations,

00:08:32.062 --> 00:08:36.182
but that there's very little collaboration
between the faith community

00:08:36.206 --> 00:08:38.007
and public health-care systems.

00:08:38.835 --> 00:08:41.879
One positive example is from Ghana,

00:08:41.903 --> 00:08:46.352
where the Ghana Catholic Health Service
partnered with a range of stakeholders

00:08:46.376 --> 00:08:52.259
and was able to realize
a 31 percent reduction in mortality.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.653
I believe there's so much potential
that can be realized

00:08:56.677 --> 00:08:59.605
when we walk across the divide of faith

00:08:59.629 --> 00:09:02.436
and, hand in hand, try to solve
many of our problems.
