00:11:30.083 --> 00:11:31.707
Not hope in the afterlife,

00:11:31.731 --> 00:11:34.795
but hope in Africa today,

00:11:34.819 --> 00:11:36.800
because the faithful are powerful.

00:11:37.636 --> 00:11:40.978
Not just because of their beliefs
but because of their assets,

00:11:41.002 --> 00:11:44.803
their resources, their army of volunteers,

00:11:44.827 --> 00:11:49.070
and because working together,
across the divide,

00:11:49.094 --> 00:11:54.142
we can live as positive examples
for what our children --

00:11:54.166 --> 00:11:55.732
my children, your children --

00:11:55.756 --> 00:11:57.448
deserve to see.

00:11:57.472 --> 00:12:01.065
An Africa that demonstrates
that God loves Africans
