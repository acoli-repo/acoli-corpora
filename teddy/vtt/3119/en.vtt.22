I would suggest that partnerships
with faith-based organizations are a risk,

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:06.984
but one that all stakeholders that are
committed to social impact in Africa

00:11:07.008 --> 00:11:08.683
cannot afford not to take.

00:11:09.942 --> 00:11:13.094
I often reflect on my conversation
with that young boy,

00:11:13.118 --> 00:11:16.348
and I believe I should have ended it
a little differently.

00:11:16.372 --> 00:11:19.983
First, I should have commended him
for asking tough questions.

00:11:20.537 --> 00:11:23.960
Africa needs more young people
who challenge the status quo,

00:11:23.984 --> 00:11:25.645
even in the faith communities.

00:11:26.698 --> 00:11:29.607
Secondly, I should have given him
a little more hope.
