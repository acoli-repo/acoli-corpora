Shortly after I published my book,

00:00:02.498 --> 00:00:03.750
I got an email.

00:00:03.791 --> 00:00:05.001
It said,

00:00:05.043 --> 00:00:07.962
"Your book was the only thing
that saved me from suicide.

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:10.339
You saved my life."

00:00:10.715 --> 00:00:13.718
Now, for a book about how to clean,
that's sort of odd, yeah?

00:00:13.718 --> 00:00:15.386
(Laughter)

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:17.346
But what if a new approach to cleaning

00:00:17.388 --> 00:00:21.225
could teach us a better approach
to treating mental health?

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:25.438
I'm not an interior designer
or a lifestyle influencer.

00:00:25.438 --> 00:00:27.732
I'm just a therapist with ADHD.

00:00:27.774 --> 00:00:30.610
And in February of 2020,
I had my second baby.
