00:00:00.788 --> 00:00:04.208
I join you from Lagos, Nigeria,

00:00:05.293 --> 00:00:07.628
one of the largest cities in Africa.

00:00:08.463 --> 00:00:12.258
By 2050, Lagos will outgrow
many of the largest cities of the world,

00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:14.218
including New York and Mexico City,

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.055
and will be home
to over 32 million people.

00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:19.140
By that same date,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.560
Nigeria will be home to more people
than the United States.

00:00:23.686 --> 00:00:25.104
But there is a problem.

00:00:25.146 --> 00:00:29.942
Lagos and other African megacities
suffer, or are plagued by,

00:00:29.942 --> 00:00:33.446
limited road infrastructure, pollution,
