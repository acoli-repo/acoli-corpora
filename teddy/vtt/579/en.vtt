On the 17th of October, 2009,

00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:10.690
President Mohamed Nasheed of the Maldives
did something unusual.

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:15.374
He held his cabinet meeting underwater.

00:00:19.614 --> 00:00:24.130
He literally took his ministers
scuba diving, as it were,

00:00:24.154 --> 00:00:28.633
to warn the world
that his country could drown

00:00:28.657 --> 00:00:30.979
unless we control global warming.
