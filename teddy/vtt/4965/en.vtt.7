Many of these aesthetic characteristics 
come with congenital health problems,

00:03:31.884 --> 00:03:36.920
such as difficulty breathing 
or being prone to spinal injuries.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.271
Humanity’s longest experiment 
in controlled evolution

00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:42.241
has had other side effects as well.

00:03:42.241 --> 00:03:44.711
Generations of selection for tameness

00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:47.591
have favored more juvenile 
and submissive traits

00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:49.631
that were pleasing to humans.

00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:54.611
This phenomenon of selecting traits 
associated with youth is known as neoteny,

00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:57.441
and can be seen in many domestic animals.

00:03:57.441 --> 00:04:01.911
Thousands of years of co-evolution 
may even have bonded us chemically.
