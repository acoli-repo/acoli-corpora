00:01:29.712 --> 00:01:33.922
But when pitted against the similar
strengths of their invasive new neighbors,

00:01:33.922 --> 00:01:36.731
wolves found themselves at a crossroads.

00:01:36.731 --> 00:01:37.941
For most packs,

00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:42.881
these bourgeoning bipeds represented 
a serious threat to their territory.

00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:44.121
But for some wolves,

00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:46.181
especially those without a pack,

00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:49.111

Wolves that showed less aggression
towards humans

00:01:51.941 --> 00:01:53.951
could come closer to their encampments,

00:01:53.951 --> 00:01:55.531
feeding on leftovers.

00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:59.911
And as these more docile scavengers 
outlasted their aggressive brethren,

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:02.161
their genetic traits were passed on,
