00:00:56.554 --> 00:01:01.564
Able to exert over 300 lbs. of pressure 
in one bone-crushing bite

00:01:01.564 --> 00:01:04.500
and sniff out prey more than a mile away,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.100
these formidable predators didn’t have 
much competition.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.940
Much like human hunter-gatherers,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.550
they lived and hunted 
in complex social groups

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.880
consisting of a few nuclear families,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.620
and used their social skills to 
cooperatively take down larger creatures.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.292
Using these group tactics,

00:01:21.292 --> 00:01:24.462
they operated as effective 
persistence hunters,

00:01:24.462 --> 00:01:26.802
relying not on outrunning their prey,

00:01:26.802 --> 00:01:29.712
but pursuing it to the point 
of exhaustion.

00:01:29.712 --> 00:01:33.922
But when pitted against the similar
strengths of their invasive new neighbors,
