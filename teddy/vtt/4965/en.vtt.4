00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:02.161
their genetic traits were passed on,

00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:06.991
gradually breeding tamer wolves
in areas near human populations.

00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:11.283
Over time humans found a multitude of uses
for these docile wolves.

00:02:11.283 --> 00:02:13.433
They helped to track and hunt prey,

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:16.173
and might have served as sentinels
to guard camps

00:02:16.173 --> 00:02:18.163
and warn of approaching enemies.

00:02:18.163 --> 00:02:22.173
Their similar social structure made
it easy to integrate with human families

00:02:22.173 --> 00:02:24.721
and learn to understand their commands.

00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:28.721
Eventually they moved from the fringes 
of our communities into our homes,

00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:32.769
becoming humanity’s 
first domesticated animal.
