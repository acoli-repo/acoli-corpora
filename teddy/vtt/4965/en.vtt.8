Thousands of years of co-evolution 
may even have bonded us chemically.

00:04:01.911 --> 00:04:05.801
Not only can canines understand 
our emotions and body language,

00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:08.181
but when dogs and humans interact,

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:10.711
both our bodies release oxytocin;

00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:15.861
a hormone commonly associated with 
feelings of love and protectiveness.

00:04:15.861 --> 00:04:20.795
It might be difficult to fathom how every
Pomeranian, Chihuahua, and Poodle

00:04:20.795 --> 00:04:22.945
are descended from fierce wolves.

00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:26.575
But the diversity of breeds today 
is the result of a relationship

00:04:26.575 --> 00:04:29.005
that precedes cities, agriculture,

00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:32.465
and even the disappearance 
of our Neanderthal cousins.
