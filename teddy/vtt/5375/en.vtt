00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.737
Why act now?

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.941
The best time to act was yesterday.

00:00:05.965 --> 00:00:08.253
The second best time is today.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.531
Every year that we don't reduce emissions

00:00:11.555 --> 00:00:15.176
represents another 55 gigatons
of greenhouse gases

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.369
that future generations
will have to scrub out of the air.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.256
That would cost 8 trillion dollars a year,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.356
almost half the entire US economy today.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.096
And that price doesn't include
the cost of people forced to move,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.489
the natural world transformed
and lives lost.
