00:00:00.538 --> 00:00:04.413
I cried in a group meeting with four
of my colleagues a few months ago,

00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:09.413
most of them I've known worked with and
taught with for the past seven years.

00:00:09.788 --> 00:00:12.496
I know these people really, really well,

00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:16.288
but it was the first time I actually
cried in a meeting with them.

00:00:16.913 --> 00:00:19.663
And I'm not saying crying is the gold
standard something we should

00:00:19.663 --> 00:00:21.246
or shouldn't do in organizations,

00:00:21.496 --> 00:00:24.829
but it was really interesting to me that
I'd finally let my guard down.

00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:26.829
So let me tell you the situation.

00:00:27.413 --> 00:00:31.496
I was sharing some feedback on things
we could do better in the classroom.
