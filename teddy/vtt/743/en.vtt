00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.722
So a few weeks ago, a friend

00:00:02.722 --> 00:00:04.976
of mine gave this toy car to his

00:00:04.976 --> 00:00:06.587
8-year-old son.

00:00:06.587 --> 00:00:09.408
But instead of going into a store and buying one,

00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:12.203
like we do normally, he went to this

00:00:12.203 --> 00:00:14.118
website and he downloaded

00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:16.287
a file, and then he printed it

00:00:16.287 --> 00:00:18.142
on this printer.

00:00:18.142 --> 00:00:20.121
So this idea that you can

00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:22.068
manufacture objects

00:00:22.068 --> 00:00:23.631
digitally using these machines

00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:25.309
is something that The Economist magazine

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:27.939
defined as the Third Industrial Revolution.

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.782
Actually, I argue that there is another revolution
