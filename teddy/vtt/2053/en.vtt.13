00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
in the global fishery story in National Geographic.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And I hope that it helped readers to take notice

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
of this problem of 100 million sharks.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And because I love sharks -- I'm somewhat obsessed with sharks --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I wanted to do another, more celebratory, story about sharks,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So I went to the Bahamas

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
because there're very few places in the world

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
where sharks are doing well these days,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
largely due to the fact that the government there

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
had outlawed longlining several years ago.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And I wanted to show several species

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
that we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations.
