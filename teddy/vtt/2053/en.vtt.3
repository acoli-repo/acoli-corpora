00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
making its very first swim in the icy 29-degree water.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But as I got more involved in the story,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn't ignore.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The first was that these animals continue to be hunted,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
killed with hakapiks at about eight, 15 days old.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It actually is the largest marine mammal

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
slaughter on the planet,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
But as disturbing as that is,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I think the bigger problem for harp seals

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
is the loss of sea ice due to global warming.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This is an aerial picture that I made that shows

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the Gulf of St. Lawrence during harp seal season.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And even though we see a lot of ice in this picture,
