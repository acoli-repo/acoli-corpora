00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
because, currently on planet Earth,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
we're killing over 100 million sharks

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
every single year.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
But before I went out to photograph this component,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
that will resonate with readers

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
You know, I think there's still a lot of people out there who think

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
the only good shark is a dead shark.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
But this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
that had just recently died in the gill net.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
it struck me as sort of a crucifixion, if you will.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
This ended up being the lead picture

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
in the global fishery story in National Geographic.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And I hope that it helped readers to take notice
