00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
very fat and healthy, robust, no entanglement scars,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
the way they're supposed to look.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
You know, I read that the pilgrims, when they landed at Plymouth Rock

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
in Massachusetts in 1620,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
wrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
on the backs of right whales.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And we can't go back and see that today,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
but maybe we can preserve what we have left.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And I wanted to close this program with a story of hope,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
a story I did on marine reserves

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
as sort of a solution

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
to the problem of overfishing, the global fish crisis story.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I settled on working in the country of New Zealand

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
because New Zealand was rather progressive,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean.
