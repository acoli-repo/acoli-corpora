00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
they're now considered critically endangered.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
In the Pacific, where I made this photograph,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
their stocks have declined about 90 percent

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
in the last 15 years.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
This is a photograph that shows a hatchling

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
about to taste saltwater for the very first time

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
beginning this long and perilous journey.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Only one in a thousand

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
But that's due to natural predators

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
like vultures that pick them off on a beach

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
or predatory fish that are waiting offshore.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Nature has learned to compensate with that,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and females have multiple clutches of eggs

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
to overcome those odds.
