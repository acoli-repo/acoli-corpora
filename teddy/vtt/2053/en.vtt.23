00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
the most endangered species on the planet today

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
because they are urban whales; they live along the east coast

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
of North America, United States and Canada,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and they have to deal with all these urban ills.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
This photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of Florida.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
You can see the coal burning plant in the background.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
They have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
that are flushed out into the ocean,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
and maybe even affecting their reproduction.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
They also get entangled in fishing gear.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
This is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And those white markings are not natural markings.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
These are entanglement scars.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
72 percent of the population has such scars,
