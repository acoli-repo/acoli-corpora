00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
You know, we know almost nothing about them.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
We don't know where they migrate to or from,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
where they mate, where they have their pups,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and yet, hammerhead populations in the Atlantic

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
have declined about 80 percent in the last 20 to 30 years.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
You know, we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
This is the oceanic whitetip shark,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
if you pay attention to such lists.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
But it's an animal that's about 98 percent in decline

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
throughout most of its range.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and because we weren't working on the bottom,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I brought along a shark cage here,
