00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
that about a million years ago, there was

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
one species of right whale on the planet,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
the species sort of separated,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and today we have essentially two distinct stocks.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
We have the Southern right whale that we see here

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and the North Atlantic right whale that we see here

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
with a mom and calf off the coast of Florida.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Now, both species were hunted to the brink of extinction

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
by the early whalers,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
but the Southern right whales have rebounded a lot better

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
because they're located in places

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
farther away from human activity.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
The North Atlantic right whale is listed as

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
the most endangered species on the planet today
