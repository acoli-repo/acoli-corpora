00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
than it was in the 1960s.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And that's because it's been protected,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
that it has come back.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So I think the message is clear.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
The ocean is, indeed, resilient and tolerant to a point,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
but we must be good custodians.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
I became an underwater photographer

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
because I fell in love with the sea,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
and I make pictures of it today because I want to protect it,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and I don't think it's too late.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Thank you very much.
