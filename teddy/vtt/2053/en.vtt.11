00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
but have no commercial value.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
maybe seven or eight shrimp

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And to make that point even more visual, I swam under the shrimp boat

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and made this picture of the guy shoveling

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
this bycatch into the sea as trash

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and photographed this cascade of death,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
you know, animals like guitarfish, bat rays,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
flounder, pufferfish, that only an hour before,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
were on the bottom of the ocean, alive,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
but now being thrown back as trash.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
because, currently on planet Earth,
