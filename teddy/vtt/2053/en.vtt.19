00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
as a way of talking about other threats.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
One such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
This is the largest, widest-ranging,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
deepest-diving and oldest of all turtle species.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Here we see a female crawling

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
out of the ocean under moonlight

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
on the island of Trinidad.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
These are animals whose lineage dates back about 100 million years.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And there was a time in their lifespan

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
where they were coming out of the water to nest

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and saw Tyrannosaurus rex running by.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And today, they crawl out and see condominiums.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
But despite this amazing longevity,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
they're now considered critically endangered.
