00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
that we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
One of the locations was this place called Tiger Beach,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
in the northern Bahamas where tiger sharks

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
aggregate in shallow water.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
This is a low-altitude photograph that I made

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
sort of just swimming around behind.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
But the one thing I definitely didn't want to do with this coverage

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And with this photograph of a beautiful

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
15-feet, probably 14-feet, I guess,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
female tiger shark,
