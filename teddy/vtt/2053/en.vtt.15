00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
female tiger shark,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I sort of think I got to that goal,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and my strobe created a shadow on her face.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And I think it's a gentler picture, a little less threatening,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
a little more respectful of the species.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I also searched on this story

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
for the elusive great hammerhead,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
an animal that really hadn't been photographed much

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
until maybe about seven or 10 years ago.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
It's a very solitary creature.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
But this is an animal that's considered data deficient by science

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
in both Florida and in the Bahamas.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
You know, we know almost nothing about them.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
We don't know where they migrate to or from,
