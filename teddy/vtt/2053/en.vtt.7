00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The first component of the story that I thought was essential, however,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
was to give readers a sense of appreciation

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
for the ocean animals that they were eating.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
You know, I think people go into a restaurant,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and somebody orders a steak, and we all know where steak comes from,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and somebody orders a chicken, and we know what a chicken is,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
but when they're eating bluefin sushi,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they're consuming?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
These are the lions and tigers of the sea.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
In reality, these animals have no terrestrial counterpart;

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
they're unique in the world.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
These are animals that can practically swim

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
from the equator to the poles
