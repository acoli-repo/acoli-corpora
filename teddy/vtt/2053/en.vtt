00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I would like to share with you this morning

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
some stories about the ocean

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
through my work as a still photographer

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
for National Geographic magazine.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I guess I became an underwater photographer

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and a photojournalist

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
because I fell in love with the sea as a child.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And I wanted to tell stories

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
about all the amazing things I was seeing underwater,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And after even 30 years of doing this,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
after 30 years of exploring the ocean,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I never cease to be amazed
