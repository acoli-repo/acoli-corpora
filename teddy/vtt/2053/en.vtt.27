00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
because New Zealand was rather progressive,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And I really wanted this story to be about three things:

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I wanted it to be about abundance,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
about diversity and about resilience.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And one of the first places I worked

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
was a reserve called Goat Island

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
in Leigh of New Zealand.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
What the scientists there told me was that

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
when protected this first marine reserve in 1975,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
they hoped and expected that certain things might happen.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
For example, they hoped that certain species of fish

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
like the New Zealand snapper would return

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And they did come back. What they couldn't predict was that other things would happen.
