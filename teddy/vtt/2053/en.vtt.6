00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last 30 years,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
but also because I read a scientific paper

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
that stated that 90 percent of the big fish in the ocean

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
have disappeared in the last 50 or 60 years.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
These are the tuna, the billfish and the sharks.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
When I read that, I was blown away by those numbers.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
but it really wasn't, so I wanted to do a story

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
that was a very different kind of underwater story.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I wanted it to be more like war photography,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
where I was making harder-hitting pictures

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
that showed readers what was happening

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
to marine wildlife around the planet.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The first component of the story that I thought was essential, however,
