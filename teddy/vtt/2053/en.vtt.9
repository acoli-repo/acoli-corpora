00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
it sort of occurred to me that the ocean's not a grocery store, you know.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
We can't keep taking without expecting

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
serious consequences as a result.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I also, with the story, wanted to show readers

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
how fish are caught, some of the methods that are used to catch fish,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
like a bottom trawler, which is one of the most common methods in the world.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
This was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
You have a large net in the middle

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
with two steel doors on either end.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And as this assembly is towed through the water,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
the doors meet resistance with the ocean,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and it opens the mouth of the net,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom.
