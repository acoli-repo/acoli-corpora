00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I brought along a shark cage here,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and my friend, shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
You'll see that the photographer, of course, was not inside the cage here,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And lastly with this story,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I also wanted to focus on baby sharks, shark nurseries.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And I went to the island of Bimini, in the Bahamas,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
to work with lemon shark pups.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
This is a photo of a lemon shark pup,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
in these protective mangroves.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
This is a very sort of un-shark-like photograph.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
It's not what you typically might think of as a shark picture.
