00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
to overcome those odds.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
But what they can't deal with is anthropogenic stresses,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
human things, like this picture that shows

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
a leatherback caught at night in a gill net.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I actually jumped in and photographed this,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and with the fisherman's permission,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
I cut the turtle out, and it was able to swim free.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
But, you know, thousands of other leatherbacks each year

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
are not so fortunate,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and the species' future is in great danger.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Another charismatic megafauna species that I worked with

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
is the story I did on the right whale.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And essentially, the story is this with right whales,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
that about a million years ago, there was
