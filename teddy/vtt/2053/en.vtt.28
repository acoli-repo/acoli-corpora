00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And they did come back. What they couldn't predict was that other things would happen.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
For example, these fish

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
predate on sea urchins,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and when the fish were all gone,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
all anyone ever saw underwater

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
was just acres and acres of sea urchins.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
But when the fish came back

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and began predating and controlling the urchin population,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
low and behold, kelp forests emerged in shallow water.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And that's because the urchins eat kelp.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
So when the fish control the urchin population,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
You know, this is probably how the ocean looked here
