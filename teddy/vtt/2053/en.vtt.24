00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
These are entanglement scars.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
72 percent of the population has such scars,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
but most don't shed the gear, things like lobster traps and crab pots.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
They hold on to them, and it eventually kills them.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And the other problem is they get hit by ships.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And this was an animal that was struck by a ship

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
in Nova Scotia, Canada

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
being towed in, where they did a necropsy

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
to confirm the cause of death,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
which was indeed a ship strike.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
So all of these ills are stacking up against these animals

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and keeping their numbers very low.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
And to draw a contrast with that beleaguered North Atlantic population,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales
