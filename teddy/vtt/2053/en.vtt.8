from the equator to the poles

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
If we weren't so efficient at catching them, because they grow their entire life,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
would have 30-year-old bluefin out there that weigh a ton.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
But the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and their stocks have collapsed worldwide.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
This is the daily auction at the Tsukiji Fish Market

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that I photographed a couple years ago.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And every single day these tuna, bluefin like this,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
are stacked up like cordwood,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
just warehouse after warehouse.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
As I wandered around and made these pictures,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
it sort of occurred to me that the ocean's not a grocery store, you know.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
We can't keep taking without expecting
