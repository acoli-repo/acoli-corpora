00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And this just drags over the bottom, in this case to catch shrimp.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
But as you can imagine, it's catching everything else in its path as well.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
things like sponges and corals,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that critical habitat for other animals.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
This photograph I made of the fisherman

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So he had a handful of shrimp, maybe seven or eight shrimp,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
These are animals that died in the process,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
but have no commercial value.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner,
