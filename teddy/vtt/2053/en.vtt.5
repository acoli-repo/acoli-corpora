00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and to get it back to stable purchase.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
This problem has continued to grow each year since I was there.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I read that last year the pup mortality rate

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
was 100 percent in parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So, clearly, this species has a lot of problems going forward.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
This ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And it received quite a bit of attention.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And with that, I saw the potential to begin

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
doing other stories about ocean problems.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So I proposed a story on the global fish crisis,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
in part because I had personally witnessed

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last 30 years,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
but also because I read a scientific paper
