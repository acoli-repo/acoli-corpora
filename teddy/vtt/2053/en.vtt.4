00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And even though we see a lot of ice in this picture,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
there's a lot of water as well, which wasn't there historically.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And the ice that is there is quite thin.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
in order to nurse from their moms.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
They only need 12 days from the moment they're born until they're on their own.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
But if they don't get 12 days,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
they can fall into the ocean and die.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
This is a photo that I made showing

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
one of these pups that's only about five or seven days old --

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly --

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
that has fallen in because of the thin ice,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and to get it back to stable purchase.
