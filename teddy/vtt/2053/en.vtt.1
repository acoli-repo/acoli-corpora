00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I never cease to be amazed

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
at the extraordinary encounters that I have while I'm at sea.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But more and more frequently these days

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm seeing terrible things underwater as well,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
things that I don't think most people realize.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And I've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
to tell a more complete story.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I want people to see what's happening underwater,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
both the horror and the magic.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The first story that I did for National Geographic,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
where I recognized the ability to include

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
environmental issues within a natural history coverage,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
was a story I proposed on harp seals.
