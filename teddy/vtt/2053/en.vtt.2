00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
was a story I proposed on harp seals.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The story I wanted to do initially

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
where these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
to engage in courtship, mating and to have their pups.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And all of this is played out against

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the backdrop of transient pack ice

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that moves with wind and tide.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And because I'm an underwater photographer,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I wanted to do this story from both above and below,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
making its very first swim in the icy 29-degree water.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But as I got more involved in the story,
