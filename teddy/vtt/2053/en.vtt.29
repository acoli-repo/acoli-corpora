You know, this is probably how the ocean looked here

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
one or 200 years ago, but nobody was around to tell us.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
I worked in other parts of New Zealand as well,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
in beautiful, fragile, protected areas

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
like in Fiordland, where this sea pen colony was found.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
In the northern part of New Zealand,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
I dove in the blue water, where the water's a little warmer,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and photographed animals like this giant sting ray

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
swimming through an underwater canyon.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Every part of the ecosystem in this place

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
seems very healthy,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
from tiny, little animals like a nudibrank

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
crawling over encrusting sponge
