Moreover, the Schedule I label
led to the mass, biased arrest

for the use of cannabis,

00:06:42.042 --> 00:06:45.059
particularly among
young Black and brown men.

00:06:45.083 --> 00:06:46.934
However, things are changing.

00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.726
The pendulum is shifting

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:55.684
Today, cannabis is legal for medical
or recreational use in most states.

00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:58.893
And a bill is even being considered
in Congress to remove cannabis

00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:00.792
from the list of schedule drugs.
