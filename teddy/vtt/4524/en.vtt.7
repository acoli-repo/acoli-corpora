These few medications have been used
during the past 50 years.

00:03:38.292 --> 00:03:40.893
They're considered substitution therapy --

00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:43.500
basically fighting fire with fire.

00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:47.601
They have saved numerous lives,

00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:51.250
yet they're not used
by many who still need them.

00:03:52.208 --> 00:03:53.893
Why?

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:56.434
These medications
are themselves addictive,

00:03:56.458 --> 00:04:00.143
and therefore come
with many governmental regulations.
