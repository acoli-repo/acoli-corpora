But the politics
is a lot more complicated.

00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:05.893
Attitudes towards cannabis

00:06:05.917 --> 00:06:08.893
and the amount of THC
that's considered safe to consume

00:06:08.917 --> 00:06:11.726
have dramatically changed over the years.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.643
In fact, this country's had
a roller-coaster relationship

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:16.976
with the drug.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.476
Cannabis is either
highly demonized or glorified.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.101
On the demonized side,

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:25.184
cannabis was deemed
a Schedule I drug by the DEA --

00:06:25.208 --> 00:06:27.143
the Drug Enforcement Agency --

00:06:27.167 --> 00:06:29.601
meaning that cannabis is considered

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:32.893
to be a drug of the highest
abuse potential
