00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:30.934
Such disinformation,

00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.184
compounded with clinicians'
limited education

00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:35.351
and public ignorance about addiction,

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:37.208
is what created the epidemic.

00:02:38.042 --> 00:02:39.833
So that's how we got here.

00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:42.184
Now the question is:

00:02:42.208 --> 00:02:45.333
how do you treat
a national opioid epidemic?

00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:48.226
During an epidemic,

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.476
normally governments, clinicians
and scientists are brought together

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.184
to help the afflicted.

00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:56.768
They develop new and even
unconventional treatment strategies

00:02:56.792 --> 00:02:59.458
to rapidly address the condition.
