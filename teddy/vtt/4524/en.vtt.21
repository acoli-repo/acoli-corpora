00:10:29.375 --> 00:10:30.684
Another intriguing finding

00:10:30.708 --> 00:10:34.893
was the CBD continued to decrease
craving and anxiety

00:10:34.917 --> 00:10:37.500
even a week following its final use.

00:10:38.167 --> 00:10:42.268
This aspect of prolonged efficacy
is very beneficial

00:10:42.292 --> 00:10:45.476
for people taking any medication.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.851
So the evidence is mounting.

00:10:48.875 --> 00:10:53.018
CBD does show potential to reduce
critical features for opioid addiction

00:10:53.042 --> 00:10:54.792
such as craving and anxiety.

00:10:56.708 --> 00:11:00.309
But we're still not at the end of the road
for medication development.
