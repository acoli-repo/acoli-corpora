00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:03.351
That has not been the case
for the opioid epidemic.

00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:05.601
However, the picture is changing.

00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:08.976
We're beginning to see
more aggressive government actions.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.143
For example, the NIH recently started
a new initiative called HEAL.

00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:17.059
HEAL stands for Helping
End Addiction Long-term,

00:03:17.083 --> 00:03:21.476
and it's designed to accelerate research
for pain management and addiction

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.059
through funding new treatment strategies.

00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:28.643
The current treatment strategy
for opioid addiction

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:32.167
is the use of other opioids
such as methadone.
