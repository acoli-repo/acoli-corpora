Over the past 20 years

00:00:03.542 --> 00:00:07.375
more than 800,000 people
have died in the United States

00:00:07.417 --> 00:00:09.768
due do drug overdose.

00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:12.934
Yes, more than all the lives lost

00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.750
in all the wars
this country has fought in.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:20.417
The majority of these cases
are due to opioid drugs.

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:24.976
Sadly, while we're having
this very conversation,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.476
at least one person will die
from a drug overdose,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.393
and a child will be born
experiencing severe withdrawals
