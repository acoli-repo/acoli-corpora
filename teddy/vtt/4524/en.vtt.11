00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:30.351
how cannabis may connect
to combating the opioid epidemic,

00:05:30.375 --> 00:05:35.059
first it helps to understand a little bit
about the science behind the drug

00:05:35.083 --> 00:05:36.667
and the politics.

00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:40.309
Cannabis is a complex plant.

00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:43.768
It's actually made up
of over 140 cannabinoids.

00:05:43.792 --> 00:05:46.101
Cannabinoids are
active chemicals from the plant

00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:49.268
that binds to cannabinoid
receptors in our bodies.

00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:53.143
The potent psychoactive cannabinoid
that leads to the reward -- the high --

00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:54.809
is THC,

00:05:54.833 --> 00:05:57.809
which we scientists call
tetrahydrocannabinol.

00:05:57.833 --> 00:05:59.125
Pretty simple, right?
