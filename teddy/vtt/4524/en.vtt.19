00:09:28.542 --> 00:09:32.500
even though individuals taking it
had also consumed a potent opioid.

00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:36.726
Next, to determine efficacy,

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.226
we conducted clinical trials

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.018
and made sure that both
the study investigators

00:09:41.042 --> 00:09:42.684
and the study participants

00:09:42.708 --> 00:09:46.708
were blind to the CBD
or the placebo substances.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:51.559
The results from those studies
replicated the findings that we had

00:09:51.583 --> 00:09:53.518
in the animal experiments.

00:09:53.542 --> 00:09:59.434
So now we know that CBD can reduce
craving triggered by environmental cues

00:09:59.458 --> 00:10:01.917
in human heroin users.
