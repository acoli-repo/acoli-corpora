00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.393
and a child will be born
experiencing severe withdrawals

00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:36.684
due to in utero opioid exposure.

00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:39.268
Only recently have some
pharmaceutical companies

00:00:39.292 --> 00:00:42.601
been held legally responsible
for the opioid crisis.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:46.184
And compared to their
multibillion-dollar revenues,

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:49.542
the economic penalties
they're paying seem minuscule.

00:00:51.292 --> 00:00:53.083
So let me as a question:

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:57.476
why does addiction
and the stigma of addiction

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.042
make it OK to undervalue human lives?
