and therefore come
with many governmental regulations.

00:04:00.167 --> 00:04:04.208
Hundreds of thousands of people
must be strictly monitored each day.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.851
They must find an opioid clinic --

00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:08.518
often far from home --

00:04:08.542 --> 00:04:10.917
take their meds and then
try to make it into work.

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:16.750
Obviously, that is not the most effective
treatment strategy for an epidemic.

00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:20.542
And it raises obvious questions as well.

00:04:21.708 --> 00:04:24.934
For example: why is the treatment
of addiction disorders different

00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.101
from other medical disorders?

00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:28.893
With most other medical disorders,

00:04:28.917 --> 00:04:32.500
a nonaddictive, prescribed medication
is picked up at the pharmacy.
