00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.042
make it OK to undervalue human lives?

00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:04.726
Ironically, I'm often asked
the opposite question.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.684
Why should we care about "addicts?"

00:01:07.708 --> 00:01:09.684
Sometimes I'm even shouted at

00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:13.559
by people who think that anyone
who suffers from a substance use disorder

00:01:13.583 --> 00:01:15.101
brought it on themselves.

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:16.434
They must be weak,

00:01:16.458 --> 00:01:17.851
they lack any moral compass

00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:19.833
and therefore don't deserve any help.

00:01:20.708 --> 00:01:24.726
But if you know anything
about opioid addiction,

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.351
you know that this population
does not fit that stereotype --

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:30.875
not that any addiction every really does.
