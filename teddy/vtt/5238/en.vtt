Imagine, for a second,
a duck teaching a French class,

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:13.038
a ping-pong match in orbit
around a black hole,

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.163
a dolphin balancing a pineapple.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.496
You probably havenâ€™t seen
any of these things;

00:00:18.538 --> 00:00:21.288
yet, you could imagine them instantly.

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:26.413
How does your brain produce an image
of something you've never seen?

00:00:26.663 --> 00:00:27.871
That may not seem hard,

00:00:27.913 --> 00:00:30.746
but that's only because
we're so used to doing it.
