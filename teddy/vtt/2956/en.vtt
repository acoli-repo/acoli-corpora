00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.450
I'm going to begin today with a story

00:00:03.474 --> 00:00:05.475
and end with a revolution.

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:06.834
(Laughter)

00:00:06.858 --> 00:00:08.025
Are you ready?

00:00:08.048 --> 00:00:09.209
Audience: Yes!

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:11.138
Naomi McDougall-Jones: Here's the story.

00:00:11.162 --> 00:00:13.144
All my life I wanted to be an actress.

00:00:13.168 --> 00:00:16.620
From the time I was very small,
I could feel the magic of storytelling

00:00:16.644 --> 00:00:18.644
and I wanted to be a part of it.

00:00:18.668 --> 00:00:20.400
So, at the ripe age of 21,

00:00:20.424 --> 00:00:23.026
I graduated from the American
Academy of Dramatic Arts

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.212
in New York City,

00:00:24.236 --> 00:00:27.404
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,
and ready to take my rightful place

00:00:27.428 --> 00:00:28.719
as the next Meryl Streep.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.611
That's my grandmother, not Meryl Streep.
