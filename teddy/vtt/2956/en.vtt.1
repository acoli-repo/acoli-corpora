That's my grandmother, not Meryl Streep.

00:00:31.635 --> 00:00:32.643
(Laughter)

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:35.324
Now, it's important for this story
that you understand

00:00:35.348 --> 00:00:37.349
that I was raised by a raging feminist.

00:00:37.373 --> 00:00:39.279
I mean, just to give you some idea:

00:00:39.303 --> 00:00:42.860
when I was five or six years old
and obsessed with "The Sound of Music,"

00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:45.312
and running around, singing,
"I am 16 going on 17,"

00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:46.908
all day every day,

00:00:46.932 --> 00:00:49.641
my mother sat me down
for a very serious conversation

00:00:49.665 --> 00:00:51.436
and she said, "OK, look.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.496
I'm not going to say
that you can't sing that song,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.075
but if you are going to sing that song,
I do need you to understand

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:01.118
the extremely problematic
gender construct that it reinforces."
