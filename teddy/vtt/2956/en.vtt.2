00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:01.118
the extremely problematic
gender construct that it reinforces."

00:01:01.142 --> 00:01:03.220
(Laughter)

00:01:03.244 --> 00:01:04.893
So that's where I come from.

00:01:04.917 --> 00:01:07.284
So it just honestly never
even occurred to me

00:01:07.308 --> 00:01:09.970
that I would be prevented
from doing anything in my life

00:01:09.994 --> 00:01:11.354
because I'm a woman.

00:01:11.378 --> 00:01:12.529
OK. So I graduate.

00:01:12.553 --> 00:01:15.327
And I start auditioning
and I get work, slowly.

00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:18.595
But I just start noticing
that the parts available for women

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.329
are terrible.

00:01:20.353 --> 00:01:22.169
But, remember -- I came here

00:01:22.193 --> 00:01:25.579
to play smart, willful,
complicated, interesting

00:01:25.603 --> 00:01:28.644
complex, confident
female characters, right?

00:01:28.668 --> 00:01:30.148
Like Meryl.
