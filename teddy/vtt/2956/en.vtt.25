That's it, just start there. Great!

00:12:31.133 --> 00:12:32.699
If you need help finding them,

00:12:32.723 --> 00:12:35.660
you can go to the website, moviesbyher.com

00:12:36.009 --> 00:12:39.895
It's an easily searchable database
of films by women.

00:12:40.783 --> 00:12:43.115
And as you start watching all movies,

00:12:43.139 --> 00:12:45.987
I just want you to pay attention
to the female characters.

00:12:46.011 --> 00:12:47.308
How many of them are there?

00:12:47.332 --> 00:12:48.521
What are they wearing?

00:12:48.545 --> 00:12:50.000
Or not?

00:12:50.024 --> 00:12:51.476
Do they get to do cool things,

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.159
or are they just there
to emotionally support the men?

00:12:55.213 --> 00:12:58.904
I'm telling you, once you see this,
you're not going to be able to unsee it.

00:12:58.928 --> 00:13:02.510
And as you start noticing this,
it's going to shift your viewing habits.
