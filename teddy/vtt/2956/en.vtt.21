00:10:25.888 --> 00:10:30.696
showing that films that feature women
make 23 cents more on every dollar

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.166
than films that don't.

00:10:32.506 --> 00:10:35.070
Furthermore, my colleagues and I
commissioned a study

00:10:35.094 --> 00:10:38.230
comparing 1,700 films
made over the last five years

00:10:38.254 --> 00:10:40.803
and, looking at the average
returns on investment --

00:10:40.827 --> 00:10:42.850
so, how much money does that movie make --

00:10:42.874 --> 00:10:46.224
comparing if a man or a woman
filled each of the following roles:

00:10:46.248 --> 00:10:49.313
director, producer,
screenwriter and lead actor.

00:10:49.884 --> 00:10:52.561
And in every single category,

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:55.537
the return on investment is higher
if it's a woman.

00:10:56.797 --> 00:11:00.052
Fact: women buy 51 percent
of all movie tickets.
