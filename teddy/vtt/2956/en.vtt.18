00:08:59.093 --> 00:09:00.250
(Applause)

00:09:00.274 --> 00:09:01.487
We exist!

00:09:02.455 --> 00:09:04.558
We actually graduate from film schools

00:09:04.582 --> 00:09:06.905
at the same rate that men
do -- 50 percent.

00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:09.227
So here we have our 50 women.

00:09:09.251 --> 00:09:12.438
The problem is that as soon as you get
to the micro-budget film,

00:09:12.462 --> 00:09:14.023
so even the very smallest films,

00:09:14.047 --> 00:09:16.767
we're already only directing 18 percent.

00:09:17.331 --> 00:09:19.331
Then you get to slightly bigger films,

00:09:19.355 --> 00:09:22.486
indies in the $1-5 million budget range,

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.117
and we go down to 12 percent.

00:09:24.141 --> 00:09:26.644
So by the time you get
to the studio system,

00:09:26.668 --> 00:09:28.779
we're only directing
five percent of movies.

00:09:29.755 --> 00:09:33.051
Now, I know some of you out there
will look at this
