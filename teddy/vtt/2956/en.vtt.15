00:07:29.851 --> 00:07:31.628
So what do we do about this?

00:07:31.652 --> 00:07:34.771
This may be the first time
a lot of you are hearing about this,

00:07:34.795 --> 00:07:38.299
but a lot of us within the film industry
have spent years --

00:07:38.323 --> 00:07:40.972
a lot of people,
a lot longer than I have --

00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:43.632
giving speeches and doing panels
and writing articles

00:07:43.656 --> 00:07:44.810
and doing studies,

00:07:44.834 --> 00:07:48.903
and really just yelling at Hollywood
to do a better job about this.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:52.658
I mean, we have really yelled at them.

00:07:52.682 --> 00:07:56.681
And yet, Paramount and Fox
recently released their slates,

00:07:56.705 --> 00:08:01.337
and of the 47 films that they will release
between now and 2018,
