00:09:29.755 --> 00:09:33.051
Now, I know some of you out there
will look at this

00:09:33.075 --> 00:09:34.958
and secretly think to yourselves,

00:09:34.982 --> 00:09:37.941
"Well, maybe women
just aren't as good at directing movies."

00:09:38.567 --> 00:09:40.742
And that's not a totally insane question.

00:09:40.766 --> 00:09:44.123
I mean, we like to believe
the film industry is a meritocracy, right?

00:09:44.147 --> 00:09:45.432
(Laughs)

00:09:45.456 --> 00:09:47.503
(Laughter)

00:09:47.527 --> 00:09:49.275
But look at this trajectory.

00:09:49.299 --> 00:09:50.662
Either you have to accept

00:09:50.686 --> 00:09:54.937
that women are actually
five percent as talented as men,

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:56.119
which I don't,

00:09:56.143 --> 00:09:59.163
or you have to accept
that there are serious systemic issues

00:09:59.187 --> 00:10:02.000
preventing us from getting
from here to there.
