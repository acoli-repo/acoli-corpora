00:01:28.668 --> 00:01:30.148
Like Meryl.

00:01:30.172 --> 00:01:31.580
And all of the sudden,

00:01:31.604 --> 00:01:35.096
I am wrestling with 300 other
gorgeous, talented women

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.684
to play ...

00:01:36.708 --> 00:01:38.708
"[Female] No dialogue.

00:01:38.732 --> 00:01:41.159
The character only needs
to stand on a balcony,

00:01:41.183 --> 00:01:43.821
look forlorn, and walk back
inside the house.

00:01:43.845 --> 00:01:45.154
Only partial nudity."

00:01:45.178 --> 00:01:46.910
(Laughter)

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:48.934
"[Sarah] Brian's love interest.

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.968
Attractive, cute, and flirty,
she is the ideal girl and Brian's prize

00:01:52.992 --> 00:01:54.545
throughout the entire film."

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:59.060
"[Mom] A proper Southern belle
who is making peace with the fact

00:01:59.084 --> 00:02:02.059
that her only purpose in life
is to tend to her husband."
