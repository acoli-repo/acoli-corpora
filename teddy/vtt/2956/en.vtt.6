00:02:57.704 --> 00:03:00.209
And we decide, you know what? No problem.

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:01.794
We'll just make our own movie.

00:03:01.818 --> 00:03:05.692
And I'll write and then I'll write it
about two complex female characters.

00:03:05.716 --> 00:03:06.866
So we do.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.369
We set out to make this movie,

00:03:08.393 --> 00:03:11.879
and sort of accidentally, we end up hiring
an all-female production team:

00:03:11.903 --> 00:03:13.503
the writer, directors, producers,

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:15.087
and it's a film about two women.

00:03:15.111 --> 00:03:17.355
And so pretty soon,
we're sitting in the office

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:18.956
of a successful male producer,

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.443
and he goes, "OK, girls.

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:24.778
So, you do understand that at some point
you are going to have to hire

00:03:24.802 --> 00:03:26.697
a male producer onboard, right?

00:03:26.721 --> 00:03:29.322
Just so that people
will trust you with their money."
