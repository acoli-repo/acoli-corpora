00:13:26.724 --> 00:13:30.708
That 18 percent in the micro-budget
range -- that is on us to fix.

00:13:31.134 --> 00:13:33.134
Don't wait for permission.

00:13:33.158 --> 00:13:35.158
Don't wait for somebody to pick you,

00:13:35.182 --> 00:13:37.619
because 95 percent says
they are not going to.

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:39.424
Crowd fund.

00:13:39.448 --> 00:13:41.326
Write letters to eccentric relatives.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:42.716
I know how hard it is,

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:47.428
but you have to make your movies --
now, today, features, not shorts.

00:13:47.452 --> 00:13:51.195
There is an audience for them,
and they want and need to see them.

00:13:52.321 --> 00:13:54.867
Three: invest in each other.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.858
Fellow female filmmakers, I feel like
we need to stop wasting so much energy

00:13:59.882 --> 00:14:01.945
on a system that does not want us.
