00:07:00.571 --> 00:07:03.324
They're actually the mechanism
through which we process

00:07:03.348 --> 00:07:05.482
our experience of being alive.

00:07:06.045 --> 00:07:08.175
They're the way
that we understand the world

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.631
and our place in it.

00:07:09.655 --> 00:07:11.427
They're the way we develop empathy

00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:14.418
for people who have experiences
different than our own.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.279
And right now, all of that
is being funneled at us

00:07:18.303 --> 00:07:21.006
through the prism of this one perspective.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.926
It's not that it's a bad perspective,

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.000
but don't we deserve to hear them all?

00:07:25.786 --> 00:07:29.217
How would the world be different
if all of the stories were told?

00:07:29.851 --> 00:07:31.628
So what do we do about this?
