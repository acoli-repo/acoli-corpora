00:10:56.797 --> 00:11:00.052
Fact: women buy 51 percent
of all movie tickets.

00:11:01.361 --> 00:11:03.475
Films by and about women make more money.

00:11:03.927 --> 00:11:06.869
And of course, at least
some portion of the male population

00:11:06.893 --> 00:11:08.108
does also like women --

00:11:08.132 --> 00:11:11.257
(Laughter)

00:11:11.281 --> 00:11:14.243
so "women films" are not just for women.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:18.868
And yet, Hollywood only targets
18 percent of all of their films

00:11:18.892 --> 00:11:20.574
as "women films."

00:11:20.598 --> 00:11:24.668
So what you're left with
is a giant underserved audience

00:11:24.692 --> 00:11:27.057
and untapped profit potential.

00:11:28.937 --> 00:11:31.897
So we exist, and we have stories to tell.
