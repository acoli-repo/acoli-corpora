00:02:29.224 --> 00:02:31.839
and you're not quite pretty enough
to be the hot one,

00:02:31.863 --> 00:02:33.863
so I think you'll work when you're 35."

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:35.318
(Laughter)

00:02:35.342 --> 00:02:36.773
And I said, "Oh. That's funny.

00:02:36.797 --> 00:02:39.810
I always thought that when you were 35,
you were kind of, like,

00:02:39.834 --> 00:02:41.201
over the hill as an actress,

00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:44.001
that you were relegated to playing
20-year-olds' mothers."

00:02:44.025 --> 00:02:45.395
And he said, "Yeah --

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.419
(Laughter)

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:49.548
It's just the way it is."

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:53.345
So, maybe a year or so after this,

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:55.639
I'm having lunch
with an actress friend of mine,

00:02:55.663 --> 00:02:57.680
and we're talking about
how insane this is.

00:02:57.704 --> 00:03:00.209
And we decide, you know what? No problem.
