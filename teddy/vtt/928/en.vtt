00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Early visions of wireless power

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
actually were thought of by Nikola Tesla

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
basically about 100 years ago.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The thought that

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
you wouldn't want to transfer electric power wirelessly,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
no one ever thought of that.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
They thought, "Who would use it if you didn't?"

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And so, in fact, he actually set about

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
doing a variety of things.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Built the Tesla coil. This tower was built

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
on Long Island back at the beginning of the 1900s.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And the idea was, it was supposed to be able to transfer power
