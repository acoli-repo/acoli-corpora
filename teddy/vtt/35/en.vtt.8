Now, I think we are now entering a stage

00:04:03.178 --> 00:04:08.489
where companies are starting to realize
this is no longer sustainable,

00:04:08.513 --> 00:04:10.679
and they're starting to see the pushback

00:04:10.703 --> 00:04:13.838
that's coming
from people, users, citizens,

00:04:13.862 --> 00:04:16.476
but also governments
that are starting to say,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.063
"This cannot be."

00:04:18.087 --> 00:04:23.516
So I think there is a maturity
that is starting to set,

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.014
especially in that Silicon Valley area,

00:04:26.038 --> 00:04:30.561
where people are beginning to say,
"We have a role."
