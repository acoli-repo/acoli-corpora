00:02:27.812 --> 00:02:33.172
FC: The rules that govern
the technology layers of the internet

00:02:33.196 --> 00:02:35.879
are now well put in place,

00:02:35.903 --> 00:02:39.355
and I was very busy for a few years
setting those rules

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.496
around the part of the internet
that makes the internet one network.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.005
The domain-name system, the IP numbers,

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:47.745
all of that is in place.

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.103
However, as we get now
into the upper layers of the internet,

00:02:52.127 --> 00:02:54.953
the issues that affect
me and you every day --

00:02:54.977 --> 00:02:57.779
privacy, security, etc. --

00:02:57.803 --> 00:03:04.803
the system to create norms for those
unfortunately is not in place.
