WEBVTT

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.627
to actually have in them
a sense of responsibility and stewardship

00:06:34.651 --> 00:06:36.160
towards what they're building.

00:06:36.184 --> 00:06:38.580
So I suggested we create a new oath,

00:06:38.604 --> 00:06:40.263
like the Hippocratic Oath,

00:06:40.287 --> 00:06:43.215
so that every student
entering an engineering program

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:46.840
takes a technocratic oath or a wisdom oath

00:06:46.864 --> 00:06:49.777
or some oath of commitment
to the rest of us.

00:06:49.801 --> 00:06:52.477
That's my best hope, that we all rise.

00:06:52.501 --> 00:06:57.414
Because governments and businesses
will fight over this power game,

00:06:57.438 --> 00:06:58.972
but where are we?

00:06:58.996 --> 00:07:03.448
And unless we play into that power table,
