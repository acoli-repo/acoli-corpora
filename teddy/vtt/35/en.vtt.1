00:00:27.992 --> 00:00:30.025
and we as the citizenry

00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:34.540
need to start understanding
that we have a big role

00:00:34.564 --> 00:00:37.600
in shaping how the world
will be governed, moving forward.

00:00:37.624 --> 00:00:41.891
Yes, indeed, the tug of war right now
is between governments,

00:00:41.915 --> 00:00:44.985
who lost much of their power to companies

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:49.267
because the internet is not built
around the nation-state system

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:51.331
around which governments have power.

00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:53.212
The internet is transnational.

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:56.275
It's not international,
and it's not national,

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.139
and therefore the companies
became very powerful.
