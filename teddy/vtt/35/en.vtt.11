Who is going to help those leaders
do the right thing?

00:05:32.846 --> 00:05:35.425
BF: So who is going to help them?

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:39.585
Because I'd love
to interview you for an hour,

00:05:39.609 --> 00:05:44.838
but give me your biggest fear
and your best hope

00:05:44.862 --> 00:05:46.743
for how this is going to work out.

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:55.720
FC: My biggest hope
is that we will become each stewards

00:05:55.744 --> 00:05:57.334
of this new digital world.

00:05:57.358 --> 00:05:58.739
That's my biggest hope,

00:05:58.763 --> 00:06:03.787
because I do think, often,
we want to put the blame on others.
