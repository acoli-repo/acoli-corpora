00:02:57.803 --> 00:03:04.803
the system to create norms for those
unfortunately is not in place.

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.713
So we do have an issue.

00:03:06.737 --> 00:03:10.387
We have a system
of cooperation and governance

00:03:10.411 --> 00:03:13.245
that really needs to be created right now

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.000
so that companies, governments
and the citizenry can agree

00:03:18.024 --> 00:03:20.366
how this new digital world
is going to advance.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.572
BF: So what gives
a digital company any incentive?

00:03:23.596 --> 00:03:25.621
Let's say -- Facebook comes to mind --

00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:28.590
they would say they have
their users' best interests at heart,

00:03:28.614 --> 00:03:31.153
but I think a lot of people
would disagree with that.
