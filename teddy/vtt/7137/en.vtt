00:00:01.997 --> 00:00:03.630
This is a lump of coal.

00:00:03.663 --> 00:00:06.263
It was mined a while ago
in the Ruhr region in Germany,

00:00:06.263 --> 00:00:08.130
about 50 miles from where I grew up.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.563
As coal goes,
it's actually quite high-end.

00:00:10.597 --> 00:00:13.230
It's very dry, it has
a high share of carbon in it.

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:15.563
Both those things mean
you can't only burn it

00:00:15.563 --> 00:00:17.030
to produce power and heat,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.797
but you can use it to make steel.

00:00:19.897 --> 00:00:21.363
Now why am I telling you this?

00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:23.097
By the end of this talk,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.630
I want to have convinced you
that we can make a huge step forward

00:00:26.663 --> 00:00:28.763
in the great fight against climate change

00:00:28.797 --> 00:00:32.930
by just spending one to two percent more
on things that we buy.
