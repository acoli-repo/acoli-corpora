00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:33.663
狄倫: ♫ Oh my name it is nothin', ♫

00:02:33.663 --> 00:02:38.191
♫ my age it means less, ♫

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:45.010
♫ the country I come from is called the Midwest. ♫

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.636
KF: 在這個例子中，狄倫也承認

00:02:46.636 --> 00:02:49.076
自己可能聽過 "The Patriot Game" 卻忘了

00:02:49.076 --> 00:02:50.635
於是當曲調再次在腦海浮現

00:02:50.635 --> 00:02:52.946
便以為是自己的創作

00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:54.178
最後一組， "Who's Going To Buy You Ribbons"

00:02:54.178 --> 00:02:55.738
另一首傳統民謠

00:02:55.738 --> 00:02:58.035
對比 "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right"

00:02:58.035 --> 00:02:59.860
這次主要是歌詞上的相似

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.751
Paul Clayton: ♫ It ain't no use to sit and sigh now, ♫
