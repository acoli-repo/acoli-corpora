00:00:28.377 --> 00:00:30.290
takes the Beatles' "White Album,"

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.067
combines it with Jay-Z's "The Black Album"

00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:33.891
to create "The Grey Album."

00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:35.810
"The Grey Album" becomes an immediate sensation online,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.570
and the Beatles' record company sends out countless

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.810
cease-and-desist letters for "unfair competition

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.691
and dilution of our valuable property."

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:47.683
Now, "The Grey Album" is a remix.

00:00:47.683 --> 00:00:50.080
It is new media created from old media.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.665
It was made using these three techniques:

00:00:52.665 --> 00:00:55.907
copy, transform and combine.

00:00:55.907 --> 00:00:57.829
It's how you remix. You take existing songs,

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.549
you chop them up, you transform the pieces,

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:01.389
you combine them back together again,
