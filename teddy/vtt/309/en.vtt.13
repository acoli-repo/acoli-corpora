00:06:26.608 --> 00:06:30.544
what it covers. Spoiler alert: Unlocking your phone

00:06:30.544 --> 00:06:33.481
by sliding an icon with your finger. (Laughter)

00:06:33.481 --> 00:06:36.498
I'm only exaggerating a little bit. It's a broad patent.

00:06:36.498 --> 00:06:39.347
Now, can someone own this idea?

00:06:39.347 --> 00:06:41.777
Now, back in the '80s, there were no software patents,

00:06:41.777 --> 00:06:44.938
and it was Xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface.

00:06:44.938 --> 00:06:47.856
What if they had patented pop-up menus,

00:06:47.856 --> 00:06:52.280
scrollbars, the desktop with icons that look like folders

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.267
and sheets of paper?

00:06:54.267 --> 00:06:56.616
Would a young and inexperienced Apple

00:06:56.616 --> 00:06:59.485
have survived the legal assault from a much larger

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:03.565
and more mature company like Xerox?
