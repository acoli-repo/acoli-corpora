Paul Clayton: 
♫ It ain't no use to sit and sigh now, ♫

00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:14.615
♫ darlin', and it ain't 
no use to sit and cry now. ♫

00:03:14.615 --> 00:03:20.560
BD: ♫ It ain’t no use 
to sit and wonder why, babe, ♫

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.212
♫ if you don't know by now, ♫

00:03:24.212 --> 00:03:29.603
♫ and it ain't no use 
to sit and wonder why, babe, ♫

00:03:29.603 --> 00:03:32.490
♫ it'll never do somehow. ♫
