The technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.547
right now other than probably its newfound accessibility.

00:06:03.547 --> 00:06:05.480

So it's not multi-touch as a whole that's patented.

00:06:08.023 --> 00:06:10.160
It's the small parts of it that are,

and it's in these small details where

00:06:11.464 --> 00:06:14.582

00:06:23.796 --> 00:06:26.608
It's a 28-page software patent, but I will summarize

00:06:26.608 --> 00:06:30.544
what it covers. Spoiler alert: Unlocking your phone
