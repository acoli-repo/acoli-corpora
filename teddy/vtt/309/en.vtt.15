00:07:28.384 --> 00:07:32.023
"I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this." (Laughter)

00:07:32.023 --> 00:07:35.527
Okay, so in other words, great artists steal, but not from me.

00:07:35.527 --> 00:07:37.878
(Laughter)

00:07:37.878 --> 00:07:41.486
Now, behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion

00:07:41.486 --> 00:07:43.705
We have a strong predisposition towards protecting

00:07:43.705 --> 00:07:45.634
what we feel is ours.

00:07:45.634 --> 00:07:47.552
We have no such aversion towards copying

00:07:47.552 --> 00:07:50.285
what other people have, because we do that nonstop.

00:07:50.285 --> 00:07:52.760
So here's the sort of equation we're looking at.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.417
We've got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property,

00:07:55.417 --> 00:07:58.202
plus massive rewards or settlements

00:07:58.202 --> 00:08:00.399
in infringement cases, plus huge legal fees
