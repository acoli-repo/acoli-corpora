♫ it'll never do somehow. ♫

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.762
KF: Okay, now, there's a lot of these.

00:03:34.762 --> 00:03:36.776
It's been estimated that two thirds of the melodies

00:03:36.776 --> 00:03:39.319
Dylan used in his early songs were borrowed.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.175
This is pretty typical among folk singers.

00:03:41.175 --> 00:03:43.538
Here's the advice of Dylan's idol, Woody Guthrie.

00:03:43.538 --> 00:03:45.068
"The worlds are the important thing.

00:03:45.068 --> 00:03:46.900
Don't worry about tunes. Take a tune,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.576
sing high when they sing low,

00:03:48.576 --> 00:03:51.784
sing fast when they sing slow, and you've got a new tune."

00:03:51.784 --> 00:03:55.781
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:57.728
And that's, that's what Guthrie did right here,

00:03:57.728 --> 00:04:00.335
and I'm sure you all recognize the results.
