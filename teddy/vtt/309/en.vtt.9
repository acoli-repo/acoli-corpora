00:04:29.383 --> 00:04:33.046
Now, American copyright and patent laws run counter

00:04:33.046 --> 00:04:35.769
to this notion that we build on the work of others.

00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:38.436
Instead, these laws and laws around the world

00:04:38.436 --> 00:04:42.158
use the rather awkward analogy of property.

00:04:42.158 --> 00:04:44.601
Now, creative works may indeed be kind of like property,

00:04:44.601 --> 00:04:46.910
but it's property that we're all building on,

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.399
and creations can only take root and grow

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:52.115
once that ground has been prepared.

00:04:52.115 --> 00:04:54.961
Henry Ford once said, "I invented nothing new.

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.964
I simply assembled the discoveries of other men

00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:59.551
behind whom were centuries of work.

00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:01.934
Progress happens when all the factors that make for it
