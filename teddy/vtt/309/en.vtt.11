00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.200
called multi-touch.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.653
You can do multi-fingered gestures on it,

00:05:33.653 --> 00:05:37.264
and boy have we patented it. (Laughter)

00:05:37.264 --> 00:05:41.430
KF: Yes. And yet, here is multi-touch in action.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.451
This is at TED, actually, about a year earlier.

00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:45.919
This is Jeff Han, and, I mean, that's multi-touch.

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.670
It's the same animal, at least.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.437
Let's hear what Jeff Han has to say about this

00:05:49.437 --> 00:05:51.263
newfangled technology.

00:05:51.263 --> 00:05:53.431
Jeff Han: Multi-touch sensing isn't anything --

00:05:53.431 --> 00:05:55.637
isn't completely new. I mean, people like Bill Buxton

00:05:55.637 --> 00:05:57.286
have been playing around with it in the '80s.

00:05:57.286 --> 00:06:00.485
The technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here
