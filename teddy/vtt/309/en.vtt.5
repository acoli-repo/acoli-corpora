BD: ♫ Oh my name it is nothin', ♫

00:02:33.663 --> 00:02:38.191
♫ my age it means less, ♫

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:45.010
♫ the country I come from is called the Midwest. ♫

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.636
KF: Okay, so in this case, Dylan admits

00:02:46.636 --> 00:02:49.076
he must have heard "The Patriot Game," he forgot about it,

00:02:49.076 --> 00:02:50.635
then when the song kind of bubbled back up

00:02:50.635 --> 00:02:52.946
in his brain, he just thought it was his song.

00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:54.178
Last one, this is "Who's Going To Buy You Ribbons,"

00:02:54.178 --> 00:02:55.738
another traditional folk tune.

00:02:55.738 --> 00:02:58.035
Alongside that is "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right."

00:02:58.035 --> 00:02:59.860
This one's more about the lyric.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.751
Paul Clayton: ♫ It ain't no use to sit and sigh now, ♫
