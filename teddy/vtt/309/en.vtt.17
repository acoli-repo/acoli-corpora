He records a song called "Blind Willie McTell,"

00:08:30.572 --> 00:08:32.758
named after the blues singer, and the song

00:08:32.758 --> 00:08:36.428
is a voyage through the past, through a much darker time,

00:08:36.428 --> 00:08:39.578
but a simpler one, a time when musicians like Willie McTell

00:08:39.578 --> 00:08:42.098
had few illusions about what they did.

00:08:42.098 --> 00:08:44.348
"I jump 'em from other writers

00:08:44.348 --> 00:08:46.913
but I arrange 'em my own way."

00:08:46.913 --> 00:08:48.630
I think this is mostly what we do.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.996
Our creativity comes from without, not from within.

00:08:51.996 --> 00:08:54.917
We are not self-made. We are dependent on one another,

00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:57.742
and admitting this to ourselves isn't an embrace

00:08:57.742 --> 00:09:00.576
of mediocrity and derivativeness.
