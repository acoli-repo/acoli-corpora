00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:01.389
you combine them back together again,

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:03.366
and you've got a new song, but that new song

00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.100
is clearly comprised of old songs.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.413
But I think these aren't just the components of remixing.

00:01:09.413 --> 00:01:12.457
I think these are the basic elements of all creativity.

00:01:12.457 --> 00:01:14.268
I think everything is a remix,

00:01:14.268 --> 00:01:18.959
and I think this is a better way to conceive of creativity.

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:21.952
All right, let's head back to 1964, and let's hear

00:01:21.952 --> 00:01:24.973
where some of Dylan's early songs came from.

00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:26.850
We'll do some side-by-side comparisons here.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.056
All right, this first song you're going to hear

00:01:28.056 --> 00:01:30.470
is "Nottamun Town." It's a traditional folk tune.
