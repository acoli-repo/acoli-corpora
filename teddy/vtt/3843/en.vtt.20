00:09:57.121 --> 00:10:00.526
The future crime scenario,
it's here today,

00:10:00.526 --> 00:10:02.026
and we've got to be careful.

00:10:02.026 --> 00:10:04.321
We have to manage the issues
of the public safety

00:10:04.321 --> 00:10:06.987
against rights to individual privacy.

00:10:06.987 --> 00:10:09.138
But it's not just the cops
who are innovating.

00:10:09.138 --> 00:10:11.982
We've heard extraordinary activities
of civil society groups

00:10:11.982 --> 00:10:15.117
who are engaging in local 
and global collective action,

00:10:15.117 --> 00:10:18.950
and this is leading to digital protest
and real revolution.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.136
But most worrying
of all are criminal gangs

00:10:23.136 --> 00:10:26.045
who are going online
and starting to colonize cyberspace.

00:10:26.045 --> 00:10:29.177
In Ciudad Juárez in Mexico,
where I've been working,

00:10:29.177 --> 00:10:31.531
groups like the Zetas
and the Sinaloa cartel
