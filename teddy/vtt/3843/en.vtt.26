00:12:58.329 --> 00:13:01.684
and as a result, we're seeing violence
going down in their communities.

00:13:01.684 --> 00:13:05.362
We've also got to make our cities safer,
more inclusive, and livable for all.

00:13:05.362 --> 00:13:09.129
The fact is, social cohesion matters.

00:13:09.129 --> 00:13:11.609
Mobility matters in our cities.

00:13:11.609 --> 00:13:14.679
We've got to get away from this model
of segregation, exclusion,

00:13:14.679 --> 00:13:16.095
and cities with walls.

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:18.905
My favorite example of how to do this
comes from Medellín.

00:13:18.905 --> 00:13:20.910
When I lived in Colombia
in the late 1990s,

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.541
Medellín was the murder capital 
of the world, but it changed course,

00:13:24.541 --> 00:13:28.800
and it did this by deliberately investing
in its low-income and most violent areas

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.208
and integrating them
with the middle-class ones
