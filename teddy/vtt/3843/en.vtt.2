00:00:58.535 --> 00:01:01.847
to get a sense that our planet
is spinning out of control, right?

00:01:01.847 --> 00:01:06.396
There's this feeling that international
instability is the new normal.

00:01:06.396 --> 00:01:08.527
But I want you to take a closer look,

00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:11.739
and I think you'll see that
the geography of violence is changing,

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:15.547
because it's not so much our nation states
that are gripped by conflict and crime

00:01:15.547 --> 00:01:23.071
as our cities: Aleppo, Bamako, Caracas, 
Erbil, Mosul, Tripoli, Salvador.

00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:26.196
Violence is migrating to the metropole.

00:01:26.196 --> 00:01:28.921
And maybe this is to be expected, right?

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:32.868
After all, most people today,
they live in cities, not the countryside.
