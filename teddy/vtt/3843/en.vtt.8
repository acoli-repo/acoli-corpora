00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.527
if unheralded, accomplishments
of human history,

00:04:00.527 --> 00:04:03.827
and we should be really excited, right?

00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:05.655
Well, yeah, we should.

00:04:05.655 --> 00:04:10.044
There's just one problem:
These two scourges are still with us.

00:04:10.044 --> 00:04:16.137
You see, 525,000 people --
men, women, boys and girls --

00:04:16.148 --> 00:04:19.329
die violently every single year.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.929
Research I've been doing
with Keith Krause and others

00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:27.386
has shown that between 50,000 and 60,000
people are dying in war zones violently.

00:04:27.386 --> 00:04:32.400
The rest, almost 500,000 people,
are dying outside of conflict zones.
