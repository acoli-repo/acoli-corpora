00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.208
and integrating them
with the middle-class ones

00:13:31.208 --> 00:13:32.880
through a network of cable cars,

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.527
of public transport,
and first-class infrastructure,

00:13:35.527 --> 00:13:40.349
and in the process, it dropped homicide
by 79 percent in just under two decades.

00:13:40.349 --> 00:13:42.389
And finally, there's technology.

00:13:43.119 --> 00:13:45.901
Technology has enormous
promise but also peril.

00:13:45.901 --> 00:13:48.449
We've seen examples here
of extraordinary innovation,

00:13:48.449 --> 00:13:50.242
and much of it coming from this room,

00:13:50.242 --> 00:13:52.610
The police are engaging 
in predictive analytics.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.200
Citizens are engaging
in new crowdsourcing solutions.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.847
Even my own group is involved
in developing applications

00:13:57.847 --> 00:14:02.199
to provide more accountability over police
and increase safety among citizens.
