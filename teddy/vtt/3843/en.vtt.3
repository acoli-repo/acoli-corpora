00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:32.868
After all, most people today,
they live in cities, not the countryside.

00:01:32.868 --> 00:01:38.704
Just 600 cities, including 30 megacities,
account for two thirds of global GDP.

00:01:38.704 --> 00:01:40.463
But when it comes to cities,

00:01:40.463 --> 00:01:43.122
the conversation is
dominated by the North,

00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:46.521
that is, North America, Western Europe,
Australia and Japan,

00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:49.668
where violence is 
actually at historic lows.

00:01:49.668 --> 00:01:54.369
As a result, city enthusiasts, they talk
about the triumph of the city,

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.515
of the creative classes, and the mayors
that will rule the world.

00:01:58.315 --> 00:02:01.801
Now, I hope that mayors
do one day rule the world,
