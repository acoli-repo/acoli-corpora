in a 50-year-long secular decline.

00:03:34.911 --> 00:03:39.218
What's more, we're seeing
a dramatic reduction in homicide.

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:41.435
Manuel Eisner and others have shown

00:03:41.435 --> 00:03:45.145
that for centuries, we've seen

Most Northern cities today are 100 times

These two facts -- the decline in armed 
conflict and the decline in murder --

00:03:56.271 --> 00:03:57.950
are amongst the most extraordinary,

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.527
if unheralded, accomplishments
of human history,
