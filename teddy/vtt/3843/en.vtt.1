but only if we focus on our cities,
especially the most fragile ones.

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:34.408
You see, I've been thinking
about this a lot.

00:00:34.408 --> 00:00:36.320
For the last 20 years, I've been working

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.888
in countries and cities
ripped apart by conflict,

00:00:39.888 --> 00:00:43.905
violence, terrorism, or some
insidious combination of all.

00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:47.411
I've tracked gun smugglers
from Russia to Somalia,

00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:50.583
I've worked with warlords
in Afghanistan and the Congo,

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:55.705
I've counted cadavers in Colombia, in 
Haiti, in Sri Lanka, in Papua New Guinea.

00:00:56.285 --> 00:00:58.535
You don't need to be
on the front line, though,

00:00:58.535 --> 00:01:01.847
to get a sense that our planet
is spinning out of control, right?
