00:10:58.224 --> 00:11:02.283
where some cities are going to thrive
and drive global growth

00:11:02.283 --> 00:11:05.219
and others are going to stumble
and pull it backwards.

00:11:05.219 --> 00:11:08.445
If we're going to change course,
we need to start a conversation.

00:11:08.445 --> 00:11:11.436
We can't only focus
on those cities that work,

00:11:11.436 --> 00:11:13.944
the Singapores, the Kuala Lumpurs,

00:11:13.944 --> 00:11:15.824
the Dubais, the Shanghais.

00:11:15.824 --> 00:11:20.028
We've got to bring those fragile cities
into the conversation.

00:11:20.028 --> 00:11:22.558
One way to do this might be
to start twinning

00:11:22.558 --> 00:11:25.298
our fragile cities with our healthier
and wealthier ones,

00:11:25.298 --> 00:11:27.811
kickstarting a process of learning
and collaboration

00:11:27.811 --> 00:11:32.050
and sharing of practices,
of what works and what doesn't.
