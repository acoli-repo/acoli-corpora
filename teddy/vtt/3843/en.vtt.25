00:12:27.595 --> 00:12:30.050
We also got to focus on those hot people.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:34.139
It's tragic, but being young,
unemployed, uneducated, male,

00:12:34.139 --> 00:12:38.136
increases the risks
of being killed and killing.

00:12:38.136 --> 00:12:40.821
We have to break this cycle of violence

00:12:40.821 --> 00:12:44.155
and get in there early with our children,
our youngest children,

00:12:44.155 --> 00:12:46.764
and valorize them, not stigmatize them.

00:12:47.214 --> 00:12:50.584
There's wonderful work that's happening
that I've been involved with

00:12:50.584 --> 00:12:52.875
in Kingston, Jamaica
and right here in Rio,

00:12:52.875 --> 00:12:56.173
which is putting education,
employment, recreation

00:12:56.173 --> 00:12:58.329
up front for these high-risk groups,

00:12:58.329 --> 00:13:01.684
and as a result, we're seeing violence
going down in their communities.
