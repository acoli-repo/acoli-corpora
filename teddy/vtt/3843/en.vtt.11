00:05:28.614 --> 00:05:31.702
and it all happened so fast.

00:05:31.702 --> 00:05:33.227
You all know the figures, right?

00:05:33.227 --> 00:05:35.469
There's 7.3 billion people
in the world today;

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:37.858
there will be 9.6 billion by 2050.

00:05:37.858 --> 00:05:39.922
But consider this one fact:

00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:43.114
In the 1800s, one in 30
people lived in cities,

00:05:43.114 --> 00:05:45.634
today it's one in two,

00:05:45.634 --> 00:05:48.792
and tomorrow virtually everyone
is going to be there.

00:05:48.792 --> 00:05:52.878
And this expansion in urbanization
is going to be neither even nor equitable.

00:05:52.878 --> 00:05:54.521
The vast majority, 90 percent,

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:58.733
will be happening in the South,
in cities of the South.

00:05:58.737 --> 00:06:01.864
So urban geographers and demographers,
