00:01:58.315 --> 00:02:01.801
Now, I hope that mayors
do one day rule the world,

00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:03.838
but, you know, the fact is,

00:02:03.838 --> 00:02:08.207
we don't hear any conversation, really,
about what is happening in the South.

00:02:08.207 --> 00:02:12.584
And by South, I mean
Latin America, Africa, Asia,

00:02:12.584 --> 00:02:15.312
where violence in some
cases is accelerating,

00:02:15.312 --> 00:02:17.913
where infrastructure is overstretched,

00:02:17.913 --> 00:02:22.268
and where governance is sometimes
an aspiration and not a reality.

00:02:22.268 --> 00:02:26.591
Now, some diplomats
and development experts and specialists,

00:02:26.591 --> 00:02:29.256
they talk about 40 to 50 fragile states

00:02:29.256 --> 00:02:32.878
that will shape security
in the 21st century.
