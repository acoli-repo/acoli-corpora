00:04:55.528 --> 00:05:00.765
and the most dangerous of all, it's 
San Pedro Sula, Honduras' second city,

00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:05.581
with a staggering homicide rate
of 187 murders per 100,000 people.

00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:08.720
That's 23 times the global average.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.447
Now, if violence is
re-concentrating geographically,

00:05:11.447 --> 00:05:14.260
it's also being reconfigured
to the world's new topography,

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.799
because when it comes to cities,
the world ain't flat,

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:19.077
like Thomas Friedman likes to say.

00:05:19.077 --> 00:05:20.413
It's spiky.

00:05:20.413 --> 00:05:24.327
The dominance of the city
as the primary mode of urban living

00:05:24.327 --> 00:05:28.614
is one of the most extraordinary
demographic reversals in history,

00:05:28.614 --> 00:05:31.702
and it all happened so fast.
