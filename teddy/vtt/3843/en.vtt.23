00:11:27.811 --> 00:11:32.050
and sharing of practices,
of what works and what doesn't.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.642
A wonderful example of this is coming
from El Salvador and Los Angeles,

00:11:35.642 --> 00:11:39.802
where the mayors in San Salvador
and Los Angeles are collaborating

00:11:39.802 --> 00:11:43.755
on getting ex-gang members
to work with current gang members,

00:11:43.755 --> 00:11:46.543
offering tutoring, education,

00:11:46.543 --> 00:11:49.863
and in the process are helping
incubate cease-fires and truces,

00:11:49.863 --> 00:11:52.410
and we've seen homicide rates
go down in San Salvador,

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.233
once the world's most violent city,

00:11:54.233 --> 00:11:55.877
by 50 percent.

00:11:55.877 --> 00:11:58.426
We can also focus 
on hot cities, but also hot spots.

00:11:58.426 --> 00:12:02.728
Place and location matter fundamentally
in shaping violence in our cities.
