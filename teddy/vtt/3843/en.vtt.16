00:07:58.076 --> 00:08:00.828
And Tokyo? It's 46.

00:08:00.828 --> 00:08:04.229
Same for most Western European cities.

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:07.409
Now, it's not just youth
that necessarily predicts violence.

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:09.453
That's one factor among many,

00:08:09.453 --> 00:08:12.429
but youthfulness combined
with unemployment, lack of education,

00:08:12.429 --> 00:08:16.535
and -- this is the kicker -- 
being male, is a deadly proposition.

00:08:16.535 --> 00:08:20.036
They're statistically correlated,
all those risk factors, with youth,

00:08:20.036 --> 00:08:23.163
and they tend to relate
to increases in violence.

00:08:24.033 --> 00:08:27.358
Now, for those of you who are
parents of teenage sons,

00:08:27.358 --> 00:08:29.304
you know what I'm talking about, right?

00:08:29.304 --> 00:08:32.214
Just imagine your boy
without any structure
