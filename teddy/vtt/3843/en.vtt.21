00:10:29.177 --> 00:10:31.531
groups like the Zetas
and the Sinaloa cartel

00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:33.152
are hijacking social media.

00:10:33.152 --> 00:10:35.736
They're using it to recruit,
to sell their products,

00:10:35.736 --> 00:10:37.966
to coerce, to intimidate and to kill.

00:10:37.966 --> 00:10:41.149
Violence is going virtual.

00:10:41.149 --> 00:10:43.282
So this is just a partial sketch

00:10:43.282 --> 00:10:45.958
of a fast-moving and dynamic
and complex situation.

00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.807
I mean, there are many other megarisks

00:10:47.807 --> 00:10:50.242
that are going to define
fragility in our time,

00:10:50.242 --> 00:10:52.141
not least income inequality,

00:10:52.141 --> 00:10:55.879
poverty, climate change, impunity.

00:10:55.879 --> 00:10:58.224
But we're facing a stark dilemma

00:10:58.224 --> 00:11:02.283
where some cities are going to thrive
and drive global growth
