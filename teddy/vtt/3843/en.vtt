00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.870
We can cut violent deaths
around the world

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.960
by 50 percent in the next three decades.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.191
All we have to do
is drop killing by 2.3 percent a year,

00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:17.644
and we'll hit that target.

00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:19.339
You don't believe me?

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.613
Well, the leading epidemiologists
and criminologists around the world

00:00:22.613 --> 00:00:25.004
seem to think we can, and so do I,

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:30.139
but only if we focus on our cities,
especially the most fragile ones.
