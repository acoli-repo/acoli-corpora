00:07:29.226 --> 00:07:32.125
is the proportion of young people
living in our fragile cities

00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:35.627
is much larger than those living 
in our healthier and wealthier ones.

00:07:35.627 --> 00:07:37.146
In some fragile cities,

00:07:37.146 --> 00:07:40.727
75 percent of the population
is under the age of 30.

00:07:40.727 --> 00:07:45.479
Think about that:
Three in four people are under 30.

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:48.324
It's like Palo Alto on steroids.

00:07:48.324 --> 00:07:51.064
Now, if you look at Mogadishu for example,

00:07:51.064 --> 00:07:55.174
in Mogadishu the mean age is 16 years old.

00:07:55.174 --> 00:07:58.076
Ditto for Dhaka, Dili and Kabul.

00:07:58.076 --> 00:08:00.828
And Tokyo? It's 46.
