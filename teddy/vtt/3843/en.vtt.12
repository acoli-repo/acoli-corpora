00:05:58.737 --> 00:06:01.864
So urban geographers and demographers,

00:06:01.864 --> 00:06:06.159
they tell us that it's not necessarily
the size or even the density of cities

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:08.249
that predicts violence, no.

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:10.501
Tokyo, with 35 million people,

00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:15.229
is one of the largest, and some might say
safest, urban metropolises in the world.

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.976
No, it's the speed of
urbanization that matters.

00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:24.823
I call this turbo-urbanization, and it's 
one of the key drivers of fragility.

00:06:24.823 --> 00:06:29.611
When you think about the incredible
expansion of these cities,

00:06:29.611 --> 00:06:33.218
and you think about turbo-urbanization,
think about Karachi.
