One of the major challenges
we had in preparing the case

00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:06.645
was figuring out how best
to communicate the science.

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:10.910
So in order to argue that what Myriad did
was not an invention,

00:09:10.934 --> 00:09:14.211
and that isolated BRCA genes
were products of nature,

00:09:15.124 --> 00:09:17.837
we had to explain a couple
of basic concepts, like:

00:09:17.861 --> 00:09:20.005
What's a gene? What's DNA?

00:09:20.029 --> 00:09:23.745
How is DNA isolated,
and why isn't that an invention?

00:09:25.168 --> 00:09:29.030
We spent hours and hours
with our plaintiffs and experts,

00:09:29.054 --> 00:09:31.990
trying to come up with ways
of explaining these concepts
