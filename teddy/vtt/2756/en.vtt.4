Gene patents typically contain
dozens of claims,

00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:08.302
but the most controversial of these
are to so-called "isolated DNA" --

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:13.140
namely, a piece of DNA
that has been removed from a cell.

00:02:14.073 --> 00:02:15.372
Gene patent proponents say,

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:18.570
"See? We didn't patent
the gene in your body,

00:02:18.594 --> 00:02:20.529
we patented an isolated gene."

00:02:21.148 --> 00:02:22.349
And that's true,

00:02:22.373 --> 00:02:29.106
but the problem is that any use
of the gene requires that it be isolated.
