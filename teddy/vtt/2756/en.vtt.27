I want the justices to have
the very same reaction that I had

00:13:31.132 --> 00:13:34.219
when you brought this issue
to me seven years ago."

00:13:34.896 --> 00:13:37.053
Well, I certainly couldn't
argue with that.

00:13:37.981 --> 00:13:40.864
The Supreme Court only hears
about one percent

00:13:40.888 --> 00:13:42.554
of the cases that it receives,

00:13:42.578 --> 00:13:44.169
and it agreed to hear ours.

00:13:45.772 --> 00:13:49.899
The day of the oral argument arrives,
and it was really, really exciting --

00:13:49.923 --> 00:13:51.358
long line of people outside,

00:13:51.382 --> 00:13:54.146
people had been standing in line
since 2:30 in the morning

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:55.904
to try to get into the courthouse.

00:13:55.928 --> 00:13:57.899
Two breast cancer organizations,

00:13:57.923 --> 00:13:59.591
Breast Cancer Action and FORCE,

00:13:59.615 --> 00:14:02.316
had organized a demonstration
on the courthouse steps.
