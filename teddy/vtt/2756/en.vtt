00:00:01.424 --> 00:00:04.582
It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005.

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:08.924
I was working at the ACLU
as the organization's science advisor.

00:00:09.388 --> 00:00:11.995
I really, really loved my job,

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.655
but I was having one of those days

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.248
where I was feeling
just a little bit discouraged.

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:21.369
So I wandered down the hallway
to my colleague Chris Hansen's office.

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:26.021
Chris had been at the ACLU
for more than 30 years,

00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:29.120
so he had deep institutional
knowledge and insights.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.613
I explained to Chris
that I was feeling a little bit stuck.
