It had forced multiple labs
that were offering BRCA testing to stop.

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:04.915
It charged a lot of money for its test --

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:06.622
over 3,000 dollars.

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:09.424
It had stopped sharing its clinical data

00:07:09.448 --> 00:07:11.735
with the international
scientific community.

00:07:12.522 --> 00:07:14.425
And perhaps worst of all,

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:16.885
for a period of several years,

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:20.622
Myriad refused to update its test
to include additional mutations

00:07:20.646 --> 00:07:24.267
that had been identified
by a team of researchers in France.

00:07:24.974 --> 00:07:27.482
It has been estimated
that during that period,

00:07:27.506 --> 00:07:28.879
for several years,

00:07:28.903 --> 00:07:32.655
as many as 12 percent of women
undergoing testing
