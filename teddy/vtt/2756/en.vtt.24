00:12:00.305 --> 00:12:02.731
So even with this remarkable development,

00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:04.434
we expected to lose.

00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:05.805
And we did.

00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:07.541
Sort of.

00:12:08.357 --> 00:12:10.944
Ends up split decision, 2 to 1.

00:12:11.743 --> 00:12:14.239
But the two judges who ruled against us,

00:12:14.263 --> 00:12:16.504
did so for completely different reasons.

00:12:17.275 --> 00:12:19.101
The first one, Judge Lourie,

00:12:19.125 --> 00:12:22.140
made up his own novel,
biological theory --

00:12:22.164 --> 00:12:23.332
totally wrong.

00:12:23.356 --> 00:12:24.367
(Laughter)

00:12:24.391 --> 00:12:26.609
He decided Myriad had created
a new chemical --

00:12:26.633 --> 00:12:28.498
made absolutely no sense.

00:12:28.522 --> 00:12:31.308
Myriad didn't even argue this,
so it came out of the blue.
