Allowing patent holders,

00:03:00.593 --> 00:03:01.877
often private companies,

00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:06.387
to lock up stretches of the human genome
was harming patients.

00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:08.110
Consider Abigail,

00:03:08.134 --> 00:03:10.527
a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome,

00:03:10.551 --> 00:03:13.975
a serious heart condition that,
if left untreated,

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:15.777
can result in sudden death.

00:03:16.911 --> 00:03:20.833
The company that obtained a patent on two
genes associated with this condition

00:03:20.857 --> 00:03:23.339
developed a test to diagnose the syndrome.

00:03:23.363 --> 00:03:26.187
But then they went bankrupt
and they never offered it.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.988
So another lab tried to offer the test,

00:03:29.012 --> 00:03:32.000
but the company that held the patents
threatened to sue the lab
