and reproductive technologies,

00:01:00.653 --> 00:01:02.794
and biobanking, and ...

00:01:02.818 --> 00:01:04.660
oh, there's this really cool issue,

00:01:04.684 --> 00:01:07.333
functional MRI and using it
for lie detection, and ...

00:01:07.357 --> 00:01:09.478
oh, and of course, there's gene patents."

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:11.131
"Gene patents?"

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:14.049
"Yes, you know, patents on human genes."

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.579
"No!

00:01:15.603 --> 00:01:18.064
You're telling me that the US government

00:01:18.088 --> 00:01:21.012
has been issuing patents
on part of the human body?

00:01:21.543 --> 00:01:23.226
That can't be right."

00:01:23.861 --> 00:01:27.320
I went back to my office
and sent Chris three articles.

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:31.281
And 20 minutes later,
he came bursting in my office.
