that states that is has

00:11:40.396 --> 00:11:44.084
reconsidered this issue
in light of the district court's opinion,

00:11:44.108 --> 00:11:47.294
and has concluded that isolated DNA
is not patent eligible.

00:11:47.818 --> 00:11:49.629

00:11:52.773 --> 00:11:54.853
The Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit

00:11:54.877 --> 00:11:56.560
hears all patent cases,

00:11:56.584 --> 00:11:59.742
and it has a reputation for being
very, very pro-patent.
