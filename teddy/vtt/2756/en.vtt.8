You can't patent products of nature --

00:04:02.148 --> 00:04:06.357
the air, the water, minerals,
elements of the periodic table.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.282
And you can't patent laws of nature --

00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:12.472
the law of gravity, E = mc2.

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.715
These things are just too fundamental
and must remain free to all

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.562
and reserved exclusively to none.

00:04:20.348 --> 00:04:22.495
It seemed to us that DNA,

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:25.035
the most fundamental structure of life,

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:27.715
that codes for the production
of all of our proteins,

00:04:27.739 --> 00:04:30.965
is both a product of nature
and a law of nature,
