00:06:29.404 --> 00:06:32.526
We found the prime candidate
to sue in Myriad Genetics,

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.405
a company that's based
in Salt Lake City, Utah.

00:06:36.718 --> 00:06:38.968
Myriad held patents on two genes,

00:06:38.992 --> 00:06:42.313
the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.884
Women with certain mutations
along these genes

00:06:45.908 --> 00:06:48.534
are considered to be
at a significantly increased risk

00:06:48.558 --> 00:06:50.503
of developing breast and ovarian cancer.

00:06:51.834 --> 00:06:53.714
Myriad had used its patents to maintain

00:06:53.738 --> 00:06:57.947
a complete monopoly on BRCA testing
in the United States.

00:06:58.544 --> 00:07:02.732
It had forced multiple labs
that were offering BRCA testing to stop.
