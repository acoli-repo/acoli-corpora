00:10:57.283 --> 00:11:00.593
Judge Sweet's clerk
working for him at the time,

00:11:00.617 --> 00:11:02.097
was not just a lawyer --

00:11:02.121 --> 00:11:03.835
he was a scientist.

00:11:03.859 --> 00:11:05.457
He was not just a scientist --

00:11:05.481 --> 00:11:08.627
he had a PhD in molecular biology.

00:11:08.651 --> 00:11:10.402
(Laughter)

00:11:10.426 --> 00:11:13.001
What an incredible stroke of luck!

00:11:14.058 --> 00:11:15.358
Myriad then appealed

00:11:15.382 --> 00:11:17.877
to the US Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit.

00:11:18.496 --> 00:11:20.512
And here things got really interesting.

00:11:21.465 --> 00:11:24.525
First, in a pivotal moment of this case,

00:11:25.187 --> 00:11:27.818
the US government switched sides.

00:11:28.739 --> 00:11:32.488
So in the district court the government
submitted a brief on Myriad's side.
