00:07:28.903 --> 00:07:32.655
as many as 12 percent of women
undergoing testing

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:35.081
received the wrong answer --

00:07:36.377 --> 00:07:40.146
a negative test result
that should have been positive.

00:07:41.485 --> 00:07:43.226
This is Kathleen Maxian.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:47.429
Kathleen's sister Eileen
developed breast cancer at age 40

00:07:47.453 --> 00:07:49.293
and she was tested by Myriad.

00:07:50.032 --> 00:07:51.758
The test was negative.

00:07:51.782 --> 00:07:53.308
The family was relieved.

00:07:53.332 --> 00:07:57.120
That meant that Eileen's cancer
most likely didn't run in the family,

00:07:57.144 --> 00:08:00.159
and that other members of her family
didn't need to be tested.
