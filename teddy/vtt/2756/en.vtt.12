00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:06.722

that was not like
your typical patent case --

00:06:09.645 --> 00:06:11.527
more like a civil rights case.

00:06:12.756 --> 00:06:15.598
We set out to identify

were harming patients and innovation.

00:06:29.404 --> 00:06:32.526
We found the prime candidate
to sue in Myriad Genetics,
