00:09:29.054 --> 00:09:31.990
trying to come up with ways
of explaining these concepts

00:09:32.014 --> 00:09:33.557
simply yet accurately.

00:09:34.306 --> 00:09:37.638
And we ended up relying heavily
on the use of metaphors,

00:09:37.662 --> 00:09:38.818
like gold.

00:09:39.789 --> 00:09:42.073
So isolating DNA --

00:09:42.097 --> 00:09:44.597
it's like extracting gold from a mountain

00:09:45.105 --> 00:09:47.121
or taking it out of a stream bed.

00:09:47.145 --> 00:09:50.819
You might be able to patent
the process for mining the gold,

00:09:50.843 --> 00:09:52.924
but you can't patent the gold itself.

00:09:53.929 --> 00:09:56.672
It might've taken a lot
of hard work and effort

00:09:56.696 --> 00:09:58.556
to dig the gold out of the mountain;

00:09:59.127 --> 00:10:01.408
you still can't patent it,
it's still gold.
