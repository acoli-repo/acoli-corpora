00:00:08.755 --> 00:00:12.842
He was born in the 1330s 
in the Chaghatayid Khanate

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:16.220
formerly the Mongol Empire
in Central Asia.

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:19.849
On the unforgiving steppe,
he rose from a lowly sheep thief

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.685
to become one of historyâ€™s 
greatest conquerors,

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:28.274
uniting nearly all of Central Asia, 
Afghanistan, and Iran under his rule.

00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:32.278
But was he a great state builder 
or a bloodthirsty tyrant?
