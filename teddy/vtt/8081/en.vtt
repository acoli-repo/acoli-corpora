We all know we're tracked
everywhere we go.

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:07.378
But as a lawyer, a technologist
and anti-surveillance activist,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.672
I'm here to tell you two things:

00:00:09.714 --> 00:00:12.550
the threat is way worse than you realize

00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:15.470
and the solutions simpler than you think.

00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:18.306
And no, it's not wearing a tinfoil hat.

00:00:18.347 --> 00:00:19.474
(Laughter)

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:23.227
You may know that advertisers
can record every link you click

00:00:23.227 --> 00:00:25.313
and every place you've been,

00:00:25.313 --> 00:00:29.025
but you may not realize
the government can buy that data, too.

00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:35.281
If the NYPD wants to track a BLM protest,
they can buy the data.
