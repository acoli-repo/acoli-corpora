"I'm not really interested in the theological 
aspects of the green monkey frog.

What's this about the
change in blood pressure?"

00:03:36.168 --> 00:03:38.572
Now, this is an Italian chemist

00:03:38.572 --> 00:03:41.187
who's working on a new treatment
for high blood pressure

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:44.037
based on peptides in the skin
of the green monkey frog,

00:03:44.037 --> 00:03:46.319
and other scientists are looking

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.160
at a cure for drug-resistant Staph aureus.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.749
How ironic if these isolated 
Indians and their magic frog

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:55.858
prove to be one of the cures.

00:03:55.858 --> 00:03:58.047
Here's an ayahuasca shaman

00:03:58.047 --> 00:04:00.960
in the northwest Amazon, in
the middle of a yage ceremony.
