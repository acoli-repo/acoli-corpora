00:03:58.047 --> 00:04:00.960
in the northwest Amazon, in
the middle of a yage ceremony.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.974
I took him to Los Angeles to
meet a foundation officer

00:04:03.974 --> 00:04:07.462
looking for support for monies
to protect their culture.

00:04:07.462 --> 00:04:10.060
This fellow looked at the
medicine man, and he said,

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.207
"You didn't go to 
medical school, did you?"

00:04:13.207 --> 00:04:15.037
The shaman said, "No, I did not."

00:04:15.037 --> 00:04:17.668
He said, "Well, then what can
you know about healing?"

00:04:17.668 --> 00:04:19.432
The shaman looked at him and he said,

00:04:19.432 --> 00:04:23.248
"You know what? If you have 
an infection, go to a doctor.

00:04:23.248 --> 00:04:29.809
But many human afflictions are diseases 
of the heart, the mind and the spirit.

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:34.361
Western medicine can't 
touch those. I cure them."
