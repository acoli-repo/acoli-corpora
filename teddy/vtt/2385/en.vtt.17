00:08:27.786 --> 00:08:31.434
all that's left is an imprint in stone,
as you see here.

00:08:31.434 --> 00:08:34.004
Let's move to the western Amazon,

00:08:34.004 --> 00:08:37.091
which is really the epicenter
of isolated peoples.

00:08:37.091 --> 00:08:39.129
Each of these dots represents

00:08:39.129 --> 00:08:41.422
a small, uncontacted tribe,

00:08:41.422 --> 00:08:46.380
and the big reveal today is we believe
there are 14 or 15 isolated groups

00:08:46.381 --> 00:08:49.762
in the Colombian Amazon alone.

00:08:49.762 --> 00:08:52.004
Why are these people isolated?

00:08:52.004 --> 00:08:54.711
They know we exist, they
know there's an outside world.

00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:56.731
This is a form of resistance.

00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:58.866
They have chosen to remain isolated,

00:08:58.866 --> 00:09:02.439
and I think it is their
human right to remain so.
