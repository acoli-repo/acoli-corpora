00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.876
Now, I'm an ethnobotanist.

00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:04.121
That's a scientist who 
works in the rainforest

00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:07.552
to document how people use local plants.

00:00:07.552 --> 00:00:10.608
I've been doing this for a long time,

00:00:10.608 --> 00:00:12.377
and I want to tell you,

00:00:12.377 --> 00:00:15.344
these people know these forests
and these medicinal treasures

00:00:15.344 --> 00:00:18.493
better than we do and
better than we ever will.

00:00:18.493 --> 00:00:20.801
But also, these cultures,

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:22.345
these indigenous cultures,

00:00:22.345 --> 00:00:27.024
are disappearing much faster
than the forests themselves.

00:00:27.024 --> 00:00:29.974
And the greatest and
most endangered species

00:00:29.974 --> 00:00:31.778
in the Amazon Rainforest
