My colleague, the late
great Loren McIntyre,

00:02:30.448 --> 00:02:32.612
discoverer of the source 
lake of the Amazon,

00:02:32.612 --> 00:02:35.056
Laguna McIntyre in the Peruvian Andes,

00:02:35.056 --> 00:02:38.161
was lost on the Peru-Brazil
border about 30 years ago.

00:02:38.161 --> 00:02:42.756
He was rescued by a group of 
isolated Indians called the Matsés.

00:02:42.756 --> 00:02:46.535
They beckoned for him to follow
them into the forest, which he did.

00:02:46.535 --> 00:02:48.959
There, they took out palm leaf baskets.

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.441
There, they took out these
green monkey frogs —

00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:53.439
these are big suckers,
they're like this —

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.962
and they began licking them.

00:02:55.962 --> 00:02:58.930
It turns out, they're
highly hallucinogenic.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.832
McIntyre wrote about this and it was read 
by the editor of High Times magazine.
