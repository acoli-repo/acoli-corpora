The Akuriyos have 35 words for honey,

00:07:31.452 --> 00:07:33.502
and other Indians look up to them

00:07:33.502 --> 00:07:37.757
as being the true masters
of the emerald realm.

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:40.072
Here you see the face of my friend Pohnay.

00:07:40.072 --> 00:07:41.815
When I was a teenager rocking out

00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:44.259
to the Rolling Stones in my
hometown of New Orleans,

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:46.794
Pohnay was a forest nomad

00:07:46.794 --> 00:07:49.291
roaming the jungles of
the northeast Amazon

00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:52.521
in a small band, looking for game,

00:07:52.531 --> 00:07:54.626
looking for medicinal plants,

00:07:54.626 --> 00:07:56.023
looking for a wife,

00:07:56.023 --> 00:07:58.301
in other small nomadic bands.

00:07:58.301 --> 00:08:00.779
But it's people like these
