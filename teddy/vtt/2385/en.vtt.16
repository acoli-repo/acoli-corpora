00:07:58.301 --> 00:08:00.779
But it's people like these

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:02.712
that know things that we don't,

00:08:02.712 --> 00:08:06.822
and they have lots of 
lessons to teach us.

00:08:06.832 --> 00:08:10.230
However, if you go into most of
the forests of the Amazon,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.037
there are no indigenous peoples.

00:08:12.037 --> 00:08:13.971
This is what you find:

00:08:13.971 --> 00:08:17.120
rock carvings which indigenous peoples,

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.550
uncontacted peoples, used to sharpen
the edge of the stone axe.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.622
These cultures that once danced,

00:08:23.622 --> 00:08:26.203
made love, sang to the gods,

00:08:26.203 --> 00:08:27.786
worshipped the forest,

00:08:27.786 --> 00:08:31.434
all that's left is an imprint in stone,
as you see here.
