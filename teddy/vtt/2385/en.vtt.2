00:00:59.613 --> 00:01:01.606
walked into a village,

00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:04.073
and the shaman said, "You're limping."

00:01:04.073 --> 00:01:06.632
And I'll never forget
this as long as I live.

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:08.466
He looked me in the face and he said,

00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:12.382
"Take off your shoe and give 
me your machete."

00:01:12.382 --> 00:01:14.587
(Laughter)

00:01:14.587 --> 00:01:16.571
He walked over to a palm tree

00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:18.117
and carved off a fern,

00:01:18.117 --> 00:01:19.429
threw it in the fire,

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.121
applied it to my foot,

00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:22.950
threw it in a pot of water,

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.076
and had me drink the tea.

00:01:25.076 --> 00:01:28.518
The pain disappeared for seven months.

00:01:28.518 --> 00:01:30.444
When it came back, I went
to see the shaman again.
