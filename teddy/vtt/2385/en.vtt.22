00:10:59.981 --> 00:11:01.940
since Schultes in '43.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.812
And we'll end up here
with the Bell Mountain

00:11:04.812 --> 00:11:07.070
just to the east of the picture.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.760
Let me show you what it looks like today.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.937
Not only is this a treasure
trove of botanical diversity,

00:11:12.937 --> 00:11:15.715
not only is it home to
three isolated tribes,

00:11:15.715 --> 00:11:17.503
but it's the greatest treasure trove

00:11:17.503 --> 00:11:20.828
of pre-Colombian art in the world:

00:11:20.828 --> 00:11:23.367
over 200,000 paintings.

00:11:23.367 --> 00:11:26.011
The Dutch scientist Thomas van der Hammen

00:11:26.011 --> 00:11:31.697
described this as the Sistine Chapel
of the Amazon Rainforest.
