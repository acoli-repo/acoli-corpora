00:05:29.335 --> 00:05:31.505
I took this picture from a small plane

00:05:31.505 --> 00:05:34.453
flying over the eastern border
of the Xingu indigenous reserve

00:05:34.453 --> 00:05:37.502
in the state of Mato Grosso
to the northwest of here.

00:05:37.502 --> 00:05:39.155
The top half of the picture,

00:05:39.155 --> 00:05:40.857
you see where the Indians live.

00:05:40.857 --> 00:05:42.414
The line through the middle

00:05:42.414 --> 00:05:44.761
is the eastern border of the reserve.

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:48.239
Top half Indians, bottom half white guys.

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:50.411
Top half wonder drugs,

00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:53.996
bottom half just a bunch
of skinny-ass cows.

00:05:53.996 --> 00:05:57.469
Top half carbon sequestered
in the forest where it belongs,

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:00.143
bottom half carbon in the atmosphere
