00:13:27.221 --> 00:13:30.068
We call these "inhuman safaris."

00:13:30.068 --> 00:13:32.166
These are Indians again 
on the Peru border,

00:13:32.166 --> 00:13:35.384
who were overflown by flights
sponsored by missionaries.

00:13:35.384 --> 00:13:38.315
They want to get in there
and turn them into Christians.

00:13:38.315 --> 00:13:40.510
We know how that turns out.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.284
What's to be done?

00:13:42.284 --> 00:13:44.710
Introduce technology
to the contacted tribes,

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.612
not the uncontacted tribes,

00:13:46.612 --> 00:13:49.745
in a culturally sensitive way.

00:13:49.745 --> 00:13:53.891
This is the perfect marriage of 
ancient shamanic wisdom

00:13:53.891 --> 00:13:56.717
and 21st century technology.

00:13:56.717 --> 00:13:59.728
We've done this now with over 30 tribes,

00:13:59.728 --> 00:14:02.652
mapped, managed and increased protection
