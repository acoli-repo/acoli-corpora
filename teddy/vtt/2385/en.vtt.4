00:01:59.888 --> 00:02:01.924
can sometimes, sometimes, sometimes

00:02:01.924 --> 00:02:03.570
cure things we cannot.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.952
Here you see a medicine man
in the northeast Amazon

00:02:05.952 --> 00:02:07.532
treating leishmaniasis,

00:02:07.532 --> 00:02:09.863
a really nasty protozoal disease

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:12.824
that afflicts 12 million

00:02:12.824 --> 00:02:15.527

00:02:15.527 --> 00:02:18.028
