00:12:59.223 --> 00:13:03.574
This is their perception of why you 
shouldn't mess with uncontacted Indians.

00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:05.551
But the world is changing.

00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:08.319
These are Mashco-Piros
on the Brazil-Peru border

00:13:08.319 --> 00:13:10.460
who stumbled out of the jungle

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.414
because they were essentially chased out

00:13:12.414 --> 00:13:14.792
by drug runners and timber people.

00:13:14.792 --> 00:13:17.425
And in Peru, there's
a very nasty business.

00:13:17.425 --> 00:13:19.245
It's called human safaris.

00:13:19.245 --> 00:13:22.277
They will take you in to isolated
groups to take their picture.

00:13:22.277 --> 00:13:25.323
Of course, when you give them 
clothes, when you give them tools,

00:13:25.323 --> 00:13:27.221
you also give them diseases.

00:13:27.221 --> 00:13:30.068
We call these "inhuman safaris."
