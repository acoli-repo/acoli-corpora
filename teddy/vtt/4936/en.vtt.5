00:02:29.444 --> 00:02:31.994
from even to odd or vice versa.

00:02:31.994 --> 00:02:36.944
Traveling diagonally – as the light 
does here – does both at once,

00:02:36.944 --> 00:02:41.334
so the x and y coordinates of any points 
the light passes through

00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:44.742
must be both even, or both odd.

00:02:44.742 --> 00:02:48.100
This observation is more 
powerful than it seems.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.310
In particular, it means that we have a 
way to identify the kinds of points

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.472
the light won’t ever go through

00:02:54.472 --> 00:02:57.692
If one of the coordinates is even 
and the other is odd,

00:02:57.692 --> 00:02:59.112
the light will miss them.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:02.472
That means it’ll miss the top 
two corners of the room,
