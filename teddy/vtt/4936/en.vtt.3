So in which corner should 
you place the diffuser

00:01:31.263 --> 00:01:34.213
to flood the vampire lair with sunlight?

00:01:34.213 --> 00:01:36.933
Pause the video if you want to figure
it out for yourself.

Answer in 1

00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:45.385
You could tackle this problem 
by examining smaller rooms,

00:01:45.385 --> 00:01:48.215
and you’d find a lot 
of interesting patterns.

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:53.485
But there’s one insight that can unravel 
this riddle in almost no time at all.

00:01:53.485 --> 00:01:56.006
Let’s draw the chamber 
on a coordinate grid,

00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:59.056
with the Southwest corner 
at the point (0,0).

00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:00.846
The light passes through grid points
