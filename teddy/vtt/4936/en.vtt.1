00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.459
strike your diffuser,

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:34.499
and illuminate the great chamber 
where the vampires sleep.

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:36.099
You set the final mirror

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:40.009
and sneak through an opening 
in the corner of the great chamber.

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:42.169
The diffuser must be wall-mounted,

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:44.749
but the walls are crowded with coffins,

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:46.799
which you don’t dare disturb.

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:51.549
The only open spots are in the other 
three corners of the room.

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:56.165
The light will enter through the southwest
corner at a 45 degree angle

00:00:56.165 --> 00:00:59.615
and bounce off the perfectly smooth 
metallic walls

00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:02.605
until it hits one of the 
other three corners.
