00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:02.472
That means it’ll miss the top 
two corners of the room,

00:03:02.472 --> 00:03:06.412
since those points have one even 
and one odd coordinate.

00:03:06.412 --> 00:03:10.732
The Southeast corner is the 
only option for the diffuser.

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:14.442
And indeed, when that precious 
beam of sunlight enters the hall,

00:03:14.442 --> 00:03:15.972
it bounces between the walls

00:03:15.972 --> 00:03:19.342
and strikes the Southeast corner, spot on.

00:03:19.342 --> 00:03:21.632
The vampires, sensing the intrusion,

00:03:21.632 --> 00:03:25.282
burst from their coffins 
and turn to dust in the light.

00:03:25.282 --> 00:03:27.682
It was a “high stakes” test,

00:03:27.682 --> 00:03:31.132
and you passed with flying colors.
