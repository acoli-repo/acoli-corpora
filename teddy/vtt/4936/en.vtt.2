00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:02.605
until it hits one of the 
other three corners.

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:04.345
But which corner will it hit?

00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:10.845
You know the room is a rectangle 49 meters
wide and 78 meters long.

00:01:10.845 --> 00:01:12.740
You could probably find the answer

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.070
by drawing a scale model of the room 
and tracing the path of the light,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.803
but the sun will be in its 
place in just minutes,

00:01:19.803 --> 00:01:22.513
and you’ve got no time to spare.

00:01:22.513 --> 00:01:25.483
Fortunately, there’s a different way
to solve this puzzle

00:01:25.483 --> 00:01:28.103
that’s both simple and elegant.

00:01:28.103 --> 00:01:31.263
So in which corner should 
you place the diffuser
