00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:00.846
The light passes through grid points

00:02:00.846 --> 00:02:05.256
with coordinates that are either 
both even or both odd.

00:02:05.256 --> 00:02:10.181
This is true even after it bounces off 
one or more walls.

00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:12.654
Another way of thinking about it is this:

00:02:12.654 --> 00:02:16.034
since the light travels at a 
45 degree angle,

00:02:16.034 --> 00:02:19.764
it always crosses the diagonal 
of a unit square.

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:23.394
Traveling 1 meter horizontally 
changes the x coordinate

00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:26.324
from even to odd or vice versa.

00:02:26.324 --> 00:02:29.444
Traveling 1 meter vertically 
changes the y coordinate

00:02:29.444 --> 00:02:31.994
from even to odd or vice versa.
