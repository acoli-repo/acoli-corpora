00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.736
but the Russians,
they brought a Mir space station.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.816
It was actually the training module,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.336
and you could go inside
and check it all out.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.936
It was the real thing --

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.096
where the buttons were,
where the wires were,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.216
where the astronauts were eating,
where they were working.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.136
And when I came home,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.440
the first thing I did,
I started drawing spaceships.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.376
Now, these weren't
science fiction spaceships, no.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.296
They were actually technical drawings.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.976
They were cutaway sections

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.936
of what kind of structure
would be made out of,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.520
where the wires were,
where the screws were.
