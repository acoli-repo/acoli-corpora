Second, space. Space is limited. Right?

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.456
This is the Ariane 5 rocket.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.736
The space you have there

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.320
is about four and a half meters
by seven meters, not that much.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.136
So it needs to be an architectural system

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.416
that is both compact,
or compactable, and light,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.080
and I think I've got one right here.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.456
It's very compact,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.056
and it's very light.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.736
And actually,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.200
this is one I made earlier.
