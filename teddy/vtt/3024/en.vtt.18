00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.976
and then it will take another 20 minutes
before it can tell me,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.200
"Oh yeah, I went left."

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.736
So the distance,

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.976
so rovers and robots

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and going to have to work autonomously.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.016
The only issue with it

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.456
is that missions to Mars are highly risky.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.936
We've only seen it a few weeks ago.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.416
So what if half the mission
doesn't arrive at Mars.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.696
What do we do?

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.816
Well, instead of building
just one or two rovers
