00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.256
We need mass to protect
ourselves from the temperatures,

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.896
from the radiation

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.640
and from the meteorites.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.440
So this is how we solved it.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.016
We have indeed the blue part,
as you can see.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.776
That's an inflatable for our Moon base.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.280
It gives a lot of living space
and a lot of lab space,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.776
and attached to it you have a cylinder,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.856
and that has all
the support structures in,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.120
all the life support and also the airlock.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.376
And on top of that, we have a structure,
that domed structure,
