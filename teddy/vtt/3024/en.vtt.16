00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.440
And you see the printers
printing these dome structures.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.616
There's a big difference
between Mars and the Moon,

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.016
and let me explain it.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.536
This diagram shows you to scale

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.256
the size of Earth and the Moon
and the real distance,

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.200
about 400,000 kilometers.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.400
If we then go to Mars,

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.376
the distance from Mars to Earth --

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.616
and this picture here

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.656
is taken by the rover on Mars,
Curiosity, looking back at Earth.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.159
You kind of see the little speckle there,
that's Earth, 400 million kilometers away.
