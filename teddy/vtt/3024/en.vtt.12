The problem with the Moon is,
what are the local materials?

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.576
Well, there's not that many.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.176
Actually, we have one.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.400
It's moondust,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.480
or, fancier scientific name,
regolith, Moon regolith.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.376
Great thing is, it's everywhere, right?

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.416
The surface is covered with it.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.960
It's about 20 centimeters
up to a few meters everywhere.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.040
But how are we going to build with it?

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.120
Well, we're going to use a 3D printer.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.776
Whenever I ask any of you
what a 3D printer is,
