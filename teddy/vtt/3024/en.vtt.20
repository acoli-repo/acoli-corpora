00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.280
It's really good at digging regolith.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.496
Then we have the transporter,

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.336
great at taking regolith
and bringing it to the structure.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.976
And the last ones,
the little ones with the little legs,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.456
they don't need to move a lot.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.416
What they do is they go
and sit on a layer of regolith

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.376
and then microwave it together,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.120
and layer by layer
create that dome structure.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.360
Now --

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.856
we also want to try that out,

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.216
so we went out on a road trip,
