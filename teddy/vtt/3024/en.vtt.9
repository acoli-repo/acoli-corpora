00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.616
And then third,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.416
but definitely not last,

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.080
the Moon does not have any atmosphere,

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.896
which means any meteorites coming into it
will not get burned up,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.296
and they'll hit the surface.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.600
That's why the Moon is full of craters.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.960
Again, we need to protect
the astronauts from that.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.976
So what kind of structure do we need?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.816
Well, the best thing is really a cave,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.256
because a cave has a lot of mass,
and we need mass.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.256
We need mass to protect
ourselves from the temperatures,
