00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.216
so we went out on a road trip,

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:36.960
and we created our own swarm of robots.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.896
There you go.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.456
So we built 10 of those.
It's a small swarm.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.496
And we took six tons of sand,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.896
and we tried out how these little robots

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.256
would actually be able
to move sand around,

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.376
Earth sand in this case.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.656
And they were not teleoperated. Right?

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.056
Nobody was telling them go left, go right,
or giving them a predescribed path.
