00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.096
I must have been about 12 years old

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.176
when my dad took me
to an exhibition on space,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.680
not far from here, in Brussels.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.656
And the year was about --
I think it was 1988,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.520
so it was the end of the Cold War.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.016
There was a bit of an upmanship going on
between the Americans and the Russians

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.280
bringing bits to that exhibition.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.520
NASA brought a big blow-up space shuttle,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.736
but the Russians,
they brought a Mir space station.
