00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.416
could be anything up to 200 degrees.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.336
On one side of the base,
it could be 100 degrees Celsius

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.840
and on the other side,
it could be minus 100 degrees.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.280
We need to protect ourselves from that.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.960
The Moon also does not have
any magnetic fields,

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.096
which means that any radiation --
solar radiation, cosmic radiation --

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.440
will hit the surface.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.536
We need to protect ourselves
from that as well,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.160
protect the astronauts from that.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.616
And then third,
