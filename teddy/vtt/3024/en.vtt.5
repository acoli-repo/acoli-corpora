00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.936
So for me, that's kind of
a long camping trip, isn't it,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.400
but a rather expensive one.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.776
Now, the tricky thing,

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.736
when you're going to build
on another planet or a moon,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.296
is how to get it there,
how to get it there.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.336
So first of all,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.576
to get a kilogram, for example,
to the Moon's surface,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.200
it will cost about 200,000 dollars,

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.216
very expensive.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.480
So you want to keep it very light.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.416
Second, space. Space is limited. Right?
