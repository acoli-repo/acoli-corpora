00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.376
And on top of that, we have a structure,
that domed structure,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.776
that protects ourselves,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.160
has a lot of mass in it.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.576
Where are we going
to get this material from?

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.696
Are we going to bring concrete and cement
from Earth to the Moon?

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.256
Well, of course not,
because it's way too heavy.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.536
It's too expensive.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.416
So we're going to go
and use local materials.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.536
Now, local materials are something
we deal with on Earth as well.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.936
Wherever we build
or whatever country we build in,

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.456
we always look at,
what are the local materials here?

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.336
The problem with the Moon is,
what are the local materials?
