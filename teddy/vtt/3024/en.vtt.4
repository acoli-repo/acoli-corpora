Whenever you go to another place,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.416
as an architect

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.040
and try to design something,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.816
you look at the local architecture,
the precedents that are there.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.296
Now, on the Moon,
it's kind of difficult, of course,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.576
because there's only this.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.480
There's only the Apollo missions.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.536
So last that we went there,
I wasn't even born yet,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.800
and we only spent about three days there.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.936
So for me, that's kind of
a long camping trip, isn't it,
