00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.816
But that was not only with the robots.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.296
It was also with the habitats.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.120
On the Mars project,
we decided to do three domes,

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.136
because if one didn't arrive,

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.176
the other two could still form a base,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.336
and that was mainly because
each of the domes

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.296
actually have a life support system
built in the floor,

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.520
so they can work independently.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.600
So in a way, you might think,
well, this is pretty crazy.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:02.216
Why would you, as an architect,
get involved in space?
