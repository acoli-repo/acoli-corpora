00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.976
and then it lays down
a thin layer of regolith,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.416
and then you would have
the robot that will solidify it,

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.456
layer by layer,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.416
until it creates, after a few months,

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.640
the full base.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.176
You might have noticed

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.416
that it's quite a particular
structure that we're printing,

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.200
and I've got a little example here.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.616
What we call this
is a closed-cell foam structure.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.816
Looks quite natural.
