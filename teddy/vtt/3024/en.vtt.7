00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.200
this is one I made earlier.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.936
Now, there's one problem with it,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.440
that inflatables

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.920
are quite fragile.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.640
They need to be protected,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.200
specifically, when you go
to a very harsh environment like the Moon.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.800
Look at it like this.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.336
The temperature difference on a Moon base

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.416
could be anything up to 200 degrees.
