00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.816
Well, instead of building
just one or two rovers

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.216
like we did on the Moon,

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.856
we're going to build hundreds of them.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.416
And it's a bit like
a termite's mound, you know?

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.976
Termites, I would take half
of the colony of the termites away,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.496
they would still be able
to build the mound.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.536
It might take a little bit longer.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.776
Same here.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.816
If half of our rovers
or robots don't arrive,

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.136
well, it will take a bit longer,
but you will still be able to do it.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.216
So here we even have
three different rovers.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.040
In the back, you see the digger.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.280
It's really good at digging regolith.
