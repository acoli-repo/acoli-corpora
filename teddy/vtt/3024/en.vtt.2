where the wires were,
where the screws were.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.696
So fortunately, I didn't
become a space engineer,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.360
but I did become an architect.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.696
These are some of the projects
that I've been involved with

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.976
over the last decade and a half.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.456
All these projects are quite different,
quite different shapes,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.336
and it is because they are built
for different environments.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.920
They have different constraints.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.456
And I think design
becomes really interesting

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.440
when you get really harsh constraints.
