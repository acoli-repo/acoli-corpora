00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.440
when you get really harsh constraints.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.520
Now, these projects
have been all over the world.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.616
A few years ago,
this map wasn't good enough.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.056
It was too small.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.000
We had to add this one,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.136
because we were going to do
a project on the Moon

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.896
for the European Space Agency;

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.416
they asked us to design a Moon habitat --

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.576
and one on Mars with NASA,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.920
a competition to look
at a habitation on Mars.
