00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.816
Looks quite natural.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.496
The reason why we're using this

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.576
as part of that shell structure

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.360
is that we only need
to solidify certain parts,

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.376
which means we have to bring
less binder from Earth,

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.000
and it becomes much lighter.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.040
Now --

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.536
that approach of designing something

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.496
and then covering it
with a protective dome

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.680
we also did for our Mars project.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.776
You can see it here, three domes.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.440
And you see the printers
printing these dome structures.
