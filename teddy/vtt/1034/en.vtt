00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
OK. We've heard a lot of people

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
speak at this conference

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
about the power of the human mind.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And what I'd like to do today

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is give you a vivid example

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
of how that power can be unleashed

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
when someone is in a survival situation,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
how the will to survive can bring that out in people.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest;

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And when it occurred, I was the only doctor on the mountain.
