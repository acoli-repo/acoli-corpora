00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And the Sherpas told us then

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that was a very bad omen,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and we should have listened to them.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Everest is an extreme environment.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
There's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Near the summit, temperatures

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
can be 40 degrees below zero.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's actually a wind-chill factor

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
which is lower than a summer day on Mars.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I remember one time being up near the summit,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I reached into my down jacket

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
for a drink from my water bottle,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
inside my down jacket,
