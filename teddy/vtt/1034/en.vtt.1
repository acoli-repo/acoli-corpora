00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And when it occurred, I was the only doctor on the mountain.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So I'll take you through that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and we'll see what it's like

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
when someone really

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
summons the will to survive.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
OK, this is Mount Everest.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's 29,035 feet high.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I've been there six times: Four times I did work with National Geographic,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
making tectonic plate measurements;

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
twice, I went with NASA

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
doing remote sensing devices.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It was on my fourth trip to Everest

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that a comet passed over the mountain. Hyakutake.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And the Sherpas told us then
