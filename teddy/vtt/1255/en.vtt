Take a look at this picture.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
These African students are doing their homework

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
under streetlights at the airport in the capital city

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
because they don't have any electricity at home.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now, I haven't met these particular students,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but I've met students like them.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's just pick one -- for example, the one in the green shirt.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's give him a name, too: Nelson.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'll bet Nelson has a cellphone.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So here is the puzzle.
