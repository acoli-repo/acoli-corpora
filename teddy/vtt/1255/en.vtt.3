00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
That's the kind of rules that the cellphone company

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The president has seen how those rules worked well.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but ran into a firestorm of protest

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
from businesses and consumers

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So he was stuck with rules that prevented him

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
from letting the win-win solution help his country.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights.
