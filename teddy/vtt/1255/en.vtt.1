I'll bet Nelson has a cellphone.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So here is the puzzle.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Why is it that Nelson has access

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to a cutting-edge technology, like the cellphone,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but doesn't have access to a 100-year-old technology

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
for generating electric light in the home?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now, in a word, the answer is "rules."

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that's available

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
when people can bring new technologies in

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and make them available to someone like Nelson.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
What kinds of rules?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
