00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:35.223
I began craving wild, open spaces,

00:03:35.223 --> 00:03:38.665
and so I set out to find the places
others had written off

00:03:38.665 --> 00:03:42.543
as too cold, too remote,
and too dangerous to surf,

00:03:42.543 --> 00:03:45.353
and that challenge intrigued me.

00:03:45.353 --> 00:03:49.485
I began this sort of personal crusade
against the mundane,

00:03:49.485 --> 00:03:52.109
because if there's
one thing I've realized,

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.961
it's that any career,

00:03:53.961 --> 00:03:57.722
even one as seemingly glamorous
as surf photography,

00:03:57.722 --> 00:04:00.148
has the danger of becoming monotonous.
