"Pain is a kind of shortcut
to mindfulness.

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.218
It makes us suddenly aware
of everything in the environment.

00:01:06.218 --> 00:01:08.192
It brutally draws us in

00:01:08.192 --> 00:01:12.718
to a virtual sensory awareness
of the world much like meditation."

00:01:13.047 --> 00:01:16.537
If shivering is a form of meditation,
then I would consider myself a monk.

00:01:16.537 --> 00:01:17.387
(Laughter)

00:01:17.387 --> 00:01:20.266
Now, before we get into the why

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:23.981
would anyone ever want to surf
in freezing cold water?

00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:26.558
I would love to give you
a little perspective

00:01:26.558 --> 00:01:29.162
on what a day in my life can look like.
