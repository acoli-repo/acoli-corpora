And one of my favorite things
about these places

00:05:30.552 --> 00:05:34.453
was simply the challenge and
the creativity it took just to get there:

00:05:34.453 --> 00:05:36.659

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:40.828
trying to pinpoint any remote stretch
of beach or reef we could actually get to.

00:05:41.418 --> 00:05:44.848

00:05:44.848 --> 00:05:47.757
snowmobiles, six-wheel
Soviet troop carriers,

00:05:47.757 --> 00:05:51.054
and a couple of super-sketchy
helicopter flights.

00:05:51.054 --> 00:05:53.260
(Laughter)

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.920
Helicopters really scare me, by the way.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.042
There was this one particularly
bumpy boat ride

00:05:59.042 --> 00:06:02.158
up the coast of Vancouver Island
to this kind of remote surf spot,
