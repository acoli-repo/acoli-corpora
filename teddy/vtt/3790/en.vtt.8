00:03:57.722 --> 00:04:00.148
has the danger of becoming monotonous.

00:04:00.648 --> 00:04:03.702
So in my search to break up
this monotony, I realized something:

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:06.656
There's only about a third
of the Earth's oceans that are warm,

00:04:06.656 --> 00:04:09.587
and it's really just that thin band
around the equator.

00:04:09.587 --> 00:04:12.095
So if I was going to find perfect waves,

00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:14.672
it was probably going
to happen somewhere cold,

00:04:14.672 --> 00:04:16.553
where the seas are notoriously rough,

00:04:16.553 --> 00:04:19.246
and that's exactly where I began to look.

00:04:19.246 --> 00:04:21.777
And it was my first trip to Iceland

00:04:21.777 --> 00:04:24.496
that I felt like I found
exactly what I was looking for.

00:04:24.846 --> 00:04:28.023
I was blown away
by the natural beauty of the landscape,

00:04:28.023 --> 00:04:32.219
but most importantly, I couldn't believe
we were finding perfect waves
