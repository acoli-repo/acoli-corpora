00:04:58.254 --> 00:05:02.976
I felt like I stumbled onto
one of the last quiet places,

00:05:02.976 --> 00:05:05.991
somewhere that I found a clarity
and a connection with the world

00:05:05.991 --> 00:05:08.913
I knew I would never find
on a crowded beach.

00:05:10.073 --> 00:05:13.231
I was hooked. I was hooked. (Laughter)

Cold water was constantly on my mind,

00:05:16.087 --> 00:05:17.399
and from that point on,

my career focused on these types of harsh

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.605
and it took me to places like Russia,
Norway, Alaska, Iceland, Chile,

00:05:24.605 --> 00:05:27.534
the Faroe Islands,
and a lot of places in between.

00:05:27.534 --> 00:05:30.552
And one of my favorite things
