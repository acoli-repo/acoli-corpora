00:06:28.123 --> 00:06:31.204
that I really learned
to appreciate the cold.

00:06:32.294 --> 00:06:34.206
So this is the place

00:06:34.206 --> 00:06:37.573
where some of the largest,
the most violent storms in the world

00:06:37.573 --> 00:06:40.627
send huge waves smashing
into the coastline.

00:06:40.627 --> 00:06:44.605
We were in this tiny, remote fjord,
just inside the Arctic Circle.

00:06:44.605 --> 00:06:47.151
It had a greater population
of sheep than people,

00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:50.201
so help if we needed it
was nowhere to be found.

00:06:50.936 --> 00:06:53.151
I was in the water 
taking pictures of surfers,

00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:55.281
and it started to snow.

00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:59.867
And then the temperature began to drop.
