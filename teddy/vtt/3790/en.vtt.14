00:07:00.458 --> 00:07:03.843
And I told myself, there's not a chance
you're getting out of the water.

00:07:03.843 --> 00:07:07.437
You traveled all this way, and this is
exactly what you've been waiting for:

00:07:07.437 --> 00:07:09.519
freezing cold conditions
with perfect waves.

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:12.537
And although I couldn't even feel
my finger to push the trigger,

00:07:12.537 --> 00:07:14.049
I knew I wasn't getting out.

00:07:14.049 --> 00:07:16.842
So I just did whatever I could.
I shook it off, whatever.

00:07:16.842 --> 00:07:18.525
But that was the point that I felt

00:07:18.525 --> 00:07:20.644
this wind gush through
the valley and hit me,

00:07:20.644 --> 00:07:26.056
and what started as this light snowfall
quickly became a full-on blizzard,

00:07:26.058 --> 00:07:30.226
and I started to lose
perception of where I was.
