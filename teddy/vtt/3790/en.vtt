00:00:01.461 --> 00:00:07.177
So if I told you that
this was the face of pure joy,

00:00:07.177 --> 00:00:09.968
would you call me crazy?

00:00:10.678 --> 00:00:11.918
I wouldn't blame you,

00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:16.172
because every time I look at this
Arctic selfie, I shiver just a little bit.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.919
I want to tell you
a little bit about this photograph.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.485
I was swimming around
in the Lofoten Islands in Norway,

00:00:23.485 --> 00:00:25.190
just inside the Arctic Circle,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.348
and the water was hovering
right at freezing.

00:00:28.348 --> 00:00:32.179
The air? A brisk -10 with windchill,
