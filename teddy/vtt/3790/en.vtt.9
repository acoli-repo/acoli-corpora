00:04:28.023 --> 00:04:32.219
but most importantly, I couldn't believe
we were finding perfect waves

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:35.229
in such a remote and rugged
part of the world.

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.915
At one point, we got to the beach

00:04:37.915 --> 00:04:41.018
only to find massive chunks of ice
had piled on the shoreline.

00:04:41.018 --> 00:04:43.371
They created this barrier
between us and the surf,

00:04:43.371 --> 00:04:45.761
and we had to weave 
through this thing like a maze

00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:47.348
just to get out into the lineup.

00:04:47.348 --> 00:04:48.473
and once we got there,

00:04:48.473 --> 00:04:51.511
we were pushing aside these ice chunks
trying to get into waves.

00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:55.468
It was an incredible experience,
one I'll never forget,

00:04:55.468 --> 00:04:58.254
because amidst those harsh conditions,

00:04:58.254 --> 00:05:02.976
I felt like I stumbled onto
one of the last quiet places,
