00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:30.635
At the moment,

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:34.147
there is no clear fair-trade solution.

00:06:35.287 --> 00:06:38.155
But there has been
a huge amount of progress.

00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:42.295
The US has recently passed legislation

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:46.143
to target bribery
and misconduct in the Congo.

00:06:46.167 --> 00:06:50.076
Recent UK legislation
could be used in the same way.

00:06:51.726 --> 00:06:57.981
In February, Nokia unveiled its new policy
on sourcing minerals in the Congo,

00:06:58.005 --> 00:07:04.873
and there is a petition to Apple
to make a conflict-free iPhone.
