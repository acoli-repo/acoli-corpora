00:07:26.506 --> 00:07:30.250
When I first came to the UK, 21 years ago,

00:07:30.274 --> 00:07:31.588
I was homesick.

00:07:32.643 --> 00:07:36.716
I missed my family
and the friends I left behind.

00:07:37.845 --> 00:07:40.842
Communication was extremely difficult.

00:07:41.467 --> 00:07:45.171
Sending and receiving
letters took months --

00:07:45.195 --> 00:07:46.701
if you were lucky.

00:07:46.725 --> 00:07:48.454
Often, they never arrived.

00:07:50.172 --> 00:07:55.515
Even if I could have afforded
the phone bills home,

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:57.931
like most people in the Congo,

00:07:57.955 --> 00:08:00.970
my parents did not own a phone line.
