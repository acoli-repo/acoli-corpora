The mobile phone
is an instrument of freedom

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.667
and an instrument of oppression.

00:05:40.015 --> 00:05:46.386
TED has always celebrated
what technology can do for us,

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.941
technology in its finished form.

00:05:48.965 --> 00:05:54.807
It is time to be asking questions
about technology.

00:05:54.831 --> 00:05:56.442
Where does it come from?

00:05:57.164 --> 00:05:58.418
Who makes it?

00:05:59.815 --> 00:06:00.969
