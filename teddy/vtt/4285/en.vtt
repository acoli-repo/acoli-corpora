00:00:01.147 --> 00:00:03.086
I want to talk to you today

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.373
about a difficult topic
that is close to me,

00:00:06.397 --> 00:00:09.482
and closer than you might realize to you.

00:00:11.053 --> 00:00:16.335
I came to the UK 21 years ago,
as an asylum-seeker.

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:18.339
I was 21.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.805
I was forced to leave
the Democratic Republic of the Congo,

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.947
my home, where I was a student activist.

00:00:28.836 --> 00:00:32.674
I would love my children to be able
to meet my family in the Congo.
