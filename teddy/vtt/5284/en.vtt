In ancient Kyoto, a devout Shinto scholar 
lived a simple life,

00:00:11.758 --> 00:00:15.717
but he was often distracted 
from his prayers by the bustling city.

00:00:15.717 --> 00:00:19.197
He felt that his neighbors 
were polluting his soul,

00:00:19.197 --> 00:00:23.057
and he sought to perform 
some kind of personal haraeâ€”

00:00:23.057 --> 00:00:27.447
a purification ritual that would cleanse
his body and his mind.

00:00:27.447 --> 00:00:31.937
He decided to travel 
to the revered Hie Shrine.
