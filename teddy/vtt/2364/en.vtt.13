00:06:28.291 --> 00:06:32.529
In our country,
there are groups of students

00:06:32.553 --> 00:06:35.348
who chronically underperform,

00:06:35.372 --> 00:06:38.520
for example, children in inner cities,

00:06:38.544 --> 00:06:42.003
or children on Native American
reservations.

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:45.764
And they've done so poorly for so long

00:06:45.788 --> 00:06:48.871
that many people think it's inevitable.

00:06:49.404 --> 00:06:55.295
But when educators create
growth mindset classrooms

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:57.690
steeped in yet,

00:06:57.714 --> 00:07:00.834
equality happens.
