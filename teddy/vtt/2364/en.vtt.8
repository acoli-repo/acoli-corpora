00:03:59.392 --> 00:04:03.367
First of all, we can praise wisely,

00:04:03.391 --> 00:04:06.599
not praising intelligence or talent.

00:04:06.623 --> 00:04:08.433
That has failed.

00:04:08.457 --> 00:04:10.095
Don't do that anymore.

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:14.623
But praising the process
that kids engage in,

00:04:14.647 --> 00:04:18.904
their effort, their strategies,
their focus, their perseverance,

00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:20.577
their improvement.

00:04:20.601 --> 00:04:26.629
This process praise creates kids
who are hardy and resilient.

00:04:27.344 --> 00:04:30.106
There are other ways to reward yet.
