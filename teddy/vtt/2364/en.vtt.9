We recently teamed up with game scientists

00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:36.921
from the University of Washington

00:04:36.945 --> 00:04:42.053

In this game, students were rewarded
for effort, strategy and progress.

00:04:48.313 --> 00:04:50.845
The usual math game

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:55.275

00:04:58.393 --> 00:05:01.160
And we got more effort,
