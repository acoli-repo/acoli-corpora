00:01:26.978 --> 00:01:31.255
From their more fixed mindset perspective,

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:35.201
their intelligence
had been up for judgment,

00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:36.956
and they failed.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:43.295
Instead of luxuriating
in the power of yet,

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.365
they were gripped in the tyranny of now.

00:01:47.722 --> 00:01:49.650
So what do they do next?

00:01:49.674 --> 00:01:52.080
I'll tell you what they do next.

00:01:52.104 --> 00:01:58.317
In one study, they told us
they would probably cheat the next time

00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:02.253
instead of studying more
if they failed a test.
