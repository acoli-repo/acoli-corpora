00:00:01.039 --> 00:00:03.150
The power of yet.

00:00:03.944 --> 00:00:06.523
I heard about a high school in Chicago

00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:10.699
where students had to pass
a certain number of courses to graduate,

00:00:10.723 --> 00:00:16.222
and if they didn't pass a course,
they got the grade "Not Yet."

00:00:16.246 --> 00:00:18.675
And I thought that was fantastic,

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.460
because if you get a failing grade,
you think, I'm nothing, I'm nowhere.

00:00:22.484 --> 00:00:25.384
But if you get the grade "Not Yet",

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:28.903
you understand that
you're on a learning curve.

00:00:28.927 --> 00:00:32.313
It gives you a path into the future.
