00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:32.287
On the left, you see
the fixed-mindset students.

00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:34.744
There's hardly any activity.

00:02:34.768 --> 00:02:37.045
They run from the error.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.670
They don't engage with it.

00:02:39.694 --> 00:02:43.341
But on the right, you have the students
with the growth mindset,

00:02:43.365 --> 00:02:47.284
the idea that abilities can be developed.

00:02:47.308 --> 00:02:49.229
They engage deeply.

00:02:49.253 --> 00:02:52.310
Their brain is on fire with yet.

00:02:52.334 --> 00:02:53.962
They engage deeply.

00:02:54.652 --> 00:02:56.655
They process the error.

00:02:56.679 --> 00:03:01.235
They learn from it and they correct it.
