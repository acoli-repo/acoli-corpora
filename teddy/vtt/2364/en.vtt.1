It gives you a path into the future.

00:00:32.337 --> 00:00:36.101
"Not Yet" also gave me insight

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:40.401
into a critical event early in my career,

00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:42.104
a real turning point.

00:00:42.598 --> 00:00:44.069
I wanted to see

00:00:44.093 --> 00:00:49.530
how children coped
with challenge and difficulty,

00:00:49.554 --> 00:00:52.722
so I gave 10-year-olds

00:00:52.746 --> 00:00:56.275
problems that were
slightly too hard for them.

00:00:57.085 --> 00:01:02.084
Some of them reacted
in a shockingly positive way.
