00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:07.273
more engagement
over longer periods of time,

00:05:07.297 --> 00:05:12.791
and more perseverance when they hit
really, really hard problems.

00:05:13.489 --> 00:05:17.083

give kids greater confidence,

00:05:20.575 --> 00:05:26.952
give them a path into the future
that creates greater persistence.
