WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'd like to talk a little bit this morning

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about what happens if we move from design

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to design thinking.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now this rather old photo up there

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
is actually the first project I was ever hired to do,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
something like 25 years ago.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's a woodworking machine, or at least a piece of one,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and my task was to

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
make this thing a little bit more modern,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
a little bit easier to use.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I thought, at the time, I did a pretty good job.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Unfortunately, not very long afterwards

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the company went out of business.
