Cloe Shasha Brooks: Hello, welcome.

00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:09.573
You are watching a TED interview series

00:00:09.606 --> 00:00:12.309
called How to Deal
with Difficult Feelings.

00:00:12.342 --> 00:00:15.612
I’m Cloe Shasha Brooks,
your host and a curator at TED.

00:00:15.612 --> 00:00:18.916
And today we'll be focusing
specifically on anxiety.

00:00:19.283 --> 00:00:22.352
So first I'll be speaking with author
and model Naomi Shimada

00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:25.188
about the anxiety
associated with social media.

00:00:25.222 --> 00:00:27.624
She coauthored a book
called “Mixed Feelings:

00:00:27.658 --> 00:00:30.994
Exploring the emotional impact
of our digital habits."
