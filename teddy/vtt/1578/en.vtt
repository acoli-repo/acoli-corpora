A few words about how I got started,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and it has a lot to do with happiness, actually.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000

and very much to myself.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and I would make things.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
