Turns out there are numerous problems
in making it on your own.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.376
You don't recognize the issues
that are standing in your way

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.616
or if you do,

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.776
you don't necessarily
know how to fix them.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.936
And the result is
that somewhere along the way,

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.560
you stop improving.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.096
And I thought about that,

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.760
and I realized that was exactly
what had happened to me as a surgeon.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.016
I'd entered practice in 2003,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.616
and for the first several years,

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.016
it was just this steady, upward
improvement in my learning curve.
