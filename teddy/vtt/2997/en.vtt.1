00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.816
which is how people improve
in the face of complexity --

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.040
or don't.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.736
The women here are delivering in a region

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.080
where the typical birth center
has a one-in-20 death rate for the babies,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.840
and the moms are dying at a rate
ten times higher than they do elsewhere.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.256
Now, we've known the critical practices

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.800
that stop the big killers
in birth for decades,

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.616
and the thing about it is
that even in this place --

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.056
in this place especially,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.840
the simplest things are not simple.
