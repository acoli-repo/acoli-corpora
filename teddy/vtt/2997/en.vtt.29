the sterile equipment that you needed.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.120
(Applause)

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.456
I was watching this delivery,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.320
and suddenly I realized that the mood
in that room had changed.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.696
The nurse was looking
at the community health worker

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.176
who had come in with the woman

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.880
because that baby
did not seem to be alive.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.800
She was blue and floppy and not breathing.
