00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.616
The results?

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.176
Over the next three decades,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.320
Harvard won just four times.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.296
Harvard hired a coach.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.096
(Laughter)

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.080
And it became the way that sports works.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.496
But is it necessary then?

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.960
Does it transfer into other fields?

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.576
I decided to ask, of all people,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.840
Itzhak Perlman.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.296
He had trained the Dorothy DeLay way

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.560
and became arguably the greatest
violinist of his generation.
