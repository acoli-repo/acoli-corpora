One of the beautiful things about
getting to write for "The New Yorker"

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.056
is I call people up,
and they return my phone calls.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.616
(Laughter)

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.336
And Perlman returned my phone call.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.837
So we ended up having
an almost two-hour conversation

00:06:13.861 --> 00:06:17.341
about how he got
to where he got in his career.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.320
And I asked him, I said,
"Why don't violinists have coaches?"

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.296
And he said, "I don't know,

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.840
but I always had a coach."

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.816
"You always had a coach?"

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.000
"Oh yeah, my wife, Toby."
