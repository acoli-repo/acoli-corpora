And I had to think,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.080
you know, there was something
fundamentally profound about this.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.896
He was describing what great coaches do,

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.936
and what they do is they are
your external eyes and ears,

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.360
providing a more accurate
picture of your reality.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.040
They're recognizing the fundamentals.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.976
They're breaking your actions down

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.400
and then helping you
build them back up again.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.816
After two months of coaching,

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.080
I felt myself getting better again.
