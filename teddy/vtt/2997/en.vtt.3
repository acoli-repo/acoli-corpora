00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.320
Ten percent of babies are born
with difficulty breathing everywhere.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.696
We know what to do.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.280
You dry the baby with a clean cloth
to stimulate them to breathe.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.616
If they don't start to breathe,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.536
you suction out their airways.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.496
And if that doesn't work,
you give them breaths with the baby mask.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.776
But these are skills that they've learned
mostly from textbooks,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.120
and that baby mask is broken.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.976
In this one disturbing image for me

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.120
is a picture that brings home
just how dire the situation is.
