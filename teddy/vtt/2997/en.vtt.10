00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.320
That seems absurd.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.320
Expertise means not needing to be coached.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.430
So then which view is right?

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.800
I learned that coaching came into sports
as a very American idea.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.416
In 1875,

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.816
Harvard and Yale played one of the very
first American-rules football games.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.680
Yale hired a head coach;

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.800
Harvard did not.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.616
The results?
