Successful child delivery
requires a successful team of people.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.496
A whole team has to be
skilled and coordinated;

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.496
the nurses who do the deliveries
in a place like this,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.176
the doctor who backs them up,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.776
the supply clerk who's responsible
for 22 critical drugs and supplies

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.176
being in stock and at the bedside,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.776
the medical officer in charge,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.800
responsible for the quality
of the whole facility.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.280
The thing is they are all
experienced professionals.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.560
I didn't meet anybody who hadn't been
part of thousands of deliveries.
