00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.120
is a picture that brings home
just how dire the situation is.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.376
This is a baby 10 minutes after birth,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.600
and he's alive,

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.240
but only just.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.536
No clean cloth,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.840
has not been dried,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.240
not warming skin to skin,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.600
an unsterile clamp across the cord.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.936
He's an infection waiting to happen,

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.600
and he's losing
his temperature by the minute.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.256
Successful child delivery
requires a successful team of people.
