00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.176
That is that you go to school,

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.816
you study, you practice,
you learn, you graduate,

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.496
and then you go out into the world

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.176
and you make your way on your own.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.360
A professional is someone who is capable
of managing their own improvement.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.336

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.616
That's how doctors learn,

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.056
that's how lawyers do,

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.360
scientists ...

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.720
musicians.
