Now, the contrasting view
comes out of sports.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.920
And they say "You are never done,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.736
everybody needs a coach."

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.960
Everyone.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.360
The greatest in the world needs a coach.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.440
So I tried to think
about this as a surgeon.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.096
Pay someone to come
into my operating room,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.200
observe me and critique me.
