00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.496
I lead a health systems innovation center
called Ariadne Labs,

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.456
where we work on problems
in the delivery of health care,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.080
including global childbirth.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.856
As part of it,

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.136
we had worked with
the World Health Organization

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.000
to devise a safe childbirth checklist.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.536
It lays out the fundamentals.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.216
It breaks down the fundamentals --

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.056
the critical actions
a team needs to go through

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.376
when a woman comes in in labor,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.336
when she's ready to push,

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.016
when the baby is out,

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.480
and then when the mom and baby
are ready to go home.
