I didn't meet anybody who hadn't been
part of thousands of deliveries.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.056
But against the complexities
that they face,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.120
they seem to be at their limits.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.720
They were not getting better anymore.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.800
It's how good you're going to be
that really matters.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.720
It presses on a fundamental question.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.320
How do professionals
get better at what they do?

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.136
How do they get great?

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.856
And there are two views about this.
