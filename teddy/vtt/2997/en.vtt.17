"Did you notice that the light
had swung out of the wound

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.816
during the case?

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.576
You spent about half an hour

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.960
just operating off the light
from reflected surfaces."

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.616
"Another thing I noticed," he said,

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.936
"Your elbow goes up in the air
every once in a while.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.616
That means you're not in full control.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.656
A surgeon's elbows should be down
at their sides resting comfortably.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.256
So that means if you feel
your elbow going in the air,

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.520
you should get a different instrument,
or just move your feet."

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.960
It was a whole other level of awareness.
