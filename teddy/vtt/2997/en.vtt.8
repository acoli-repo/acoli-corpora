00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.336
And the thing is, it works.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.536
Consider for example legendary
Juilliard violin instructor Dorothy DeLay.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.256
She trained an amazing roster
of violin virtuosos:

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.816
Midori, Sarah Chang, Itzhak Perlman.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.976
Each of them came to her as young talents,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.079
and they worked with her over years.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.296
What she worked on most, she said,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.856
was inculcating in them
habits of thinking and of learning

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.616
so that they could make their way
in the world without her

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.840
when they were done.
