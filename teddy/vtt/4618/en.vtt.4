Ted Nelson launches Project Xanadu,

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.621
and he said,

00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:06.663
"Well, what if it wasn't just limited
to the things that I have?

00:02:06.704 --> 00:02:10.121
What if I could connect ideas
across a larger body of work?"

00:02:10.996 --> 00:02:13.746
In 1982, researchers
at the University of Maryland

00:02:13.788 --> 00:02:16.121
developed a system they called HyperTIES.

00:02:16.163 --> 00:02:19.579
They were the first
to use text itself as a link marker.

00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:22.829
They figured out that this blue link
on a gray background

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.288
was going to work really well
in terms of contrast,

00:02:25.288 --> 00:02:27.079
and people would be able to see it.

00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:30.038
Apple invented HyperCard in 1987.
