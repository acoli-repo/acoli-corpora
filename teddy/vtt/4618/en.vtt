I remember thinking to myself,

00:00:02.079 --> 00:00:05.371
"This is going to change everything
about how we communicate."

00:00:05.413 --> 00:00:06.579
[Small thing.]

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:07.746
[Big idea.]

[Margaret Gould Stewart on the Hyperlink]

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:14.121
A hyperlink is an interface element,

00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:15.538
and what I mean by that is,

00:00:15.538 --> 00:00:19.079
when you're using software
on your phone or your computer,

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.246
there's a lot of code behind the interface

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:24.663
that's giving all the instructions
for the computer on how to manage it,

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:27.704
but that interface is the thing
that humans interact with:

00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:30.579
when we press on this,
then something happens.
