Apple invented HyperCard in 1987.

00:02:30.704 --> 00:02:32.663
You had these stacks of cards,

00:02:32.663 --> 00:02:34.954
and you could create links
in between the cards.

00:02:34.996 --> 00:02:40.454
HyperCard actually created the ability
to jump around in a story.

00:02:40.454 --> 00:02:43.371
These kinds of notions
of nonlinear storytelling

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:45.913
got a huge boost
when the hyperlink came along,

00:02:45.954 --> 00:02:50.079
because it gave people the opportunity
to influence the narrative.

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.454
These ideas and inventions, among others,

00:02:52.496 --> 00:02:55.954
inspired Tim Berners-Lee,
the inventor of the World Wide Web.

00:02:57.246 --> 00:02:59.496
The hyperlink almost feels
like a LEGO block,

00:02:59.538 --> 00:03:04.204
this very basic building block
to a very complex web of connections
