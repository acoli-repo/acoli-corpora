is the domain of the hyperlink.

00:01:00.912 --> 00:01:02.412
Back when I was in school --

00:01:02.412 --> 00:01:05.871
this is before people had
wide access to the internet --

00:01:05.913 --> 00:01:07.746
if I was going to do a research paper,

00:01:07.746 --> 00:01:10.496
I would have to physically walk
to the library,

00:01:10.538 --> 00:01:12.829
and if they had the book
that you needed, great.

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:14.663
You sometimes had to send out for it,

00:01:14.704 --> 00:01:16.579
so the process could take weeks.

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.496
And it's kind of crazy
to think about that now,

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:22.746
because, like all great innovations,

00:01:22.788 --> 00:01:24.954
it's not long after
we get access to something

00:01:24.996 --> 00:01:27.246
that we start to take it for granted.

00:01:27.288 --> 00:01:28.704
Back in 1945,

00:01:28.746 --> 00:01:31.288
there was this guy, Vannevar Bush.
