there was this guy, Vannevar Bush.

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.329
He was working for the US government,

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.538
and one of the ideas
that he put forth was,

00:01:35.538 --> 00:01:38.204
"Wow, humans are creating
so much information,

00:01:38.204 --> 00:01:41.454
and we can't keep track
of all the books that we've read

00:01:41.496 --> 00:01:44.163
or the connections
between important ideas."

00:01:46.163 --> 00:01:48.496

a personal library

00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:52.621
of all of the books and articles
that you have access to.

00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:57.371
And that idea of connecting sources
captured people's imaginations.
