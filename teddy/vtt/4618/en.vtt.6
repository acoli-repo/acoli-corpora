WEBVTT

00:02:59.538 --> 00:03:04.204
this very basic building block
to a very complex web of connections

00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:05.788
that exists all around the world.

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.538
Because of the way
that hyperlinks were first constructed,

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.454
they were intended
to be not only used by many people,

00:03:12.496 --> 00:03:14.538
but created by many people.

00:03:14.538 --> 00:03:18.704
To me, it's one of the most democratic
designs ever created.
