It's called the human immune system.

00:00:31.447 --> 00:00:34.676
I can see from your face that
you're having some problems with this.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.776
Don't worry. I know it's very complicated.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.457
I don't want to take you
through the gory details,

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:43.709
I just want to tell you about some
of the amazing features of this product.

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.662
First of all, it cleverly uses redundancy

00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:49.818
by having millions of copies
of each component --

00:00:49.842 --> 00:00:52.027

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.801
before they're actually needed,

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:57.320
to create a massive buffer
against the unexpected.

00:00:58.276 --> 00:01:01.636
And it cleverly leverages diversity
