00:12:59.242 --> 00:13:02.014
we can shape, rather than control,

00:13:02.928 --> 00:13:06.138
unpredictable and complex situations.

00:13:07.551 --> 00:13:10.661
It's a little like the difference
between throwing a ball

00:13:11.403 --> 00:13:12.708
and releasing a bird.

00:13:13.685 --> 00:13:15.628
The ball would head in a straight line,

00:13:15.652 --> 00:13:17.870
probably towards the intended target,

00:13:17.894 --> 00:13:21.001
and the bird certainly would not.

00:13:23.455 --> 00:13:25.049
So what do you think?

00:13:25.073 --> 00:13:28.360
Sounds a little impractical,
a little theoretical, perhaps?

00:13:29.821 --> 00:13:30.978
Not at all.
