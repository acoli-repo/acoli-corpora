00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:33.710
badgered by investors
and buffeted by change,

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.894
we might forgive you
for not even worrying too much

00:04:36.918 --> 00:04:38.619
about what happens 30 years out.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.348
But here's something that should
keep you awake at night:

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.425
the probability that your company
will not be around in five year's time,

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.088
on average, is now
a staggering 32 percent.

00:04:52.164 --> 00:04:56.208
That's a one in three chance
that your company will be taken over

00:04:56.232 --> 00:04:59.025
or will fail within just five years.
