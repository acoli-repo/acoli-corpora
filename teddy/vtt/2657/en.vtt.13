Let's first take a look at what happens
when the corporate immune system

00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:32.373
collapses.

00:06:33.202 --> 00:06:37.744
This beautiful building is part
of the Shitennoji Temple Complex

00:06:37.768 --> 00:06:39.091
in Osaka, Japan.

00:06:39.672 --> 00:06:42.512
In fact, it's one of the oldest
temples in Japan.

00:06:43.165 --> 00:06:45.393
It was built by a Korean artisan,

00:06:45.417 --> 00:06:48.486
because at the time,
Japan was not yet building temples.

00:06:48.933 --> 00:06:53.673
And this Korean artisan went on
to found a temple-building company.

00:06:55.017 --> 00:06:58.422
Amazingly, his company, Kongō Gumi,

00:06:58.446 --> 00:07:03.670
was still around 1,428 years later.
