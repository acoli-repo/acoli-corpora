Unfortunately, there's one
very tiny problem,

00:03:32.562 --> 00:03:35.827
and that is that the user
of this product, you or I,

00:03:35.851 --> 00:03:39.524
would probably die
within one week of the next winter,

00:03:39.548 --> 00:03:43.412
when we encountered a new strain
of the influenza virus.

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:49.361
I first became interested
in biology and business,

00:03:49.385 --> 00:03:51.764
and longevity and resilience,

00:03:51.788 --> 00:03:54.039
when I was asked a very unusual question

00:03:54.063 --> 00:03:56.735
by the CEO of a global tech company.

00:03:57.257 --> 00:03:58.707
And the question was:

00:03:58.731 --> 00:04:04.893
What do we have to do to make sure
that our company lasts 100 years?
