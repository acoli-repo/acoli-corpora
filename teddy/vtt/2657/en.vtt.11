00:05:26.461 --> 00:05:30.091
Together, we looked at a variety
of biological systems,

00:05:30.115 --> 00:05:33.381
ranging from natural tropical rainforests

00:05:33.405 --> 00:05:36.327
through to managed forests and fisheries.

00:05:36.351 --> 00:05:38.075
And we asked ourselves the question:

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:42.957
What makes these systems
resilient and enduring?

00:05:44.176 --> 00:05:48.321
And what we found
was that the same six principles

00:05:48.345 --> 00:05:51.370
that we saw underpinning
the miracle of the human immune system

00:05:51.394 --> 00:05:54.455
actually cropped up again and again,

00:05:55.157 --> 00:05:58.191
from redundancy through to embeddedness.

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:03.275
In fact, we saw these principles
not only in biologically enduring systems,
