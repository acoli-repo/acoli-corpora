WEBVTT

00:01:27.173 --> 00:01:30.394
you have the very rapidly reacting
innate immune system

00:01:30.418 --> 00:01:34.440
and then you have the highly targeted
adaptive immune system.

00:01:35.017 --> 00:01:38.862
The point is, that if one system fails,
another can take over,

00:01:38.886 --> 00:01:41.937
creating a virtually foolproof system.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.461
I can see I'm losing you, Bob,
but stay with me,

00:01:45.485 --> 00:01:48.789
because here is the really killer feature.

00:01:49.773 --> 00:01:52.340
The product is completely adaptive.

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.331
It's able to actually develop
targeted antibodies

00:01:57.355 --> 00:01:59.871
to threats that it's never
even met before.
