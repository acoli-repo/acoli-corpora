Didn't they teach you 80-20?

00:03:01.693 --> 00:03:05.121
And furthermore, you're saying
that this product is siloed.

00:03:05.676 --> 00:03:07.081
It overreacts,

00:03:07.105 --> 00:03:08.644
makes things up as it goes along

00:03:08.668 --> 00:03:11.159
and is actually designed
for somebody else's benefit.

00:03:11.183 --> 00:03:14.790
I'm sorry to break it to you,
but I don't think this one is a winner.

00:03:15.267 --> 00:03:17.213
If we went with Bob's philosophy,

00:03:17.237 --> 00:03:20.705
I think we'd actually end up
with a more efficient immune system.

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:23.735
And efficiency is always important
in the short term.

00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:28.298
Less complex, more efficient,
more bang for the buck.

00:03:28.322 --> 00:03:29.680
Who could say no to that?
