00:08:32.025 --> 00:08:34.011
to medical systems to biomaterials.

00:08:34.035 --> 00:08:36.720
Some of these diversification
attempts failed.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.064
But in aggregate,

00:08:39.088 --> 00:08:43.428
it was able to adapt
its portfolio sufficiently

00:08:43.452 --> 00:08:45.227
to survive and flourish.

00:08:46.633 --> 00:08:49.476
As the CEO, Mr. Komori, put it,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.736
the strategy succeeded
because it had "more pockets and drawers"

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.151
than the rivals.

00:08:55.175 --> 00:08:56.326
He meant, of course,

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.777
that they were able to create
more options than the rivals.
