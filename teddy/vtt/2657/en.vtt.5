And Bob may say something like,

the effort and passion

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.672
that have gone into your presentation,

00:02:44.696 --> 00:02:45.850

00:02:47.078 --> 00:02:50.131
But honestly, it's total nonsense.

00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:55.450
You seem to be saying that the key
selling points of your product

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:58.175
are that it is inefficient and complex.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.770
Didn't they teach you 80-20?
