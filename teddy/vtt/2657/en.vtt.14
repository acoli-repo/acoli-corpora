00:06:58.446 --> 00:07:03.670
was still around 1,428 years later.

00:07:03.694 --> 00:07:07.294
In fact, it became the oldest
continuously operating company

00:07:07.318 --> 00:07:08.562
in the world.

00:07:09.986 --> 00:07:11.999
So how is Kongō Gumi doing today?

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.737
Not too well, I'm afraid.

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:17.912
It borrowed very heavily

00:07:17.936 --> 00:07:20.714
during the bubble period
of the Japanese economy,

00:07:20.738 --> 00:07:22.201
to invest in real estate.

00:07:22.225 --> 00:07:25.656
And when the bubble burst,
it couldn't refinance its loans.

00:07:26.463 --> 00:07:27.751
The company failed,

00:07:27.775 --> 00:07:30.992
and it was taken over
by a major construction company.
