Imagine that you are a product designer.

00:00:04.686 --> 00:00:06.132
And you've designed a product,

00:00:06.156 --> 00:00:09.780
a new type of product,
called the human immune system.

00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:12.626
You're pitching this product

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.807
to a skeptical, strictly
no-nonsense manager.

00:00:16.378 --> 00:00:17.824
Let's call him Bob.

00:00:17.848 --> 00:00:20.010
I think we all know
at least one Bob, right?

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:22.713
How would that go?

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:25.957
Bob, I've got this incredible idea

00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:28.613
for a completely new type
of personal health product.

00:00:28.637 --> 00:00:30.808
It's called the human immune system.
