00:00:58.276 --> 00:01:01.636
And it cleverly leverages diversity

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.381
by having not just leukocytes
but B cells, T cells,

00:01:05.405 --> 00:01:07.613
natural killer cells, antibodies.

00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:09.645
The components don't really matter.

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:11.239
The point is that together,

00:01:11.263 --> 00:01:15.879
this diversity of different approaches
can cope with more or less anything

00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:18.056
that evolution has been able to throw up.

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:23.292
And the design is completely modular.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.149
You have the surface barrier
of the human skin,

00:01:27.173 --> 00:01:30.394
you have the very rapidly reacting
innate immune system
