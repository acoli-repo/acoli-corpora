through dialogue, through inner dialogues.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.336
And you can even see this inner voice

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.000
as the missing link
between thought and actions.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.776
So I hope I've left you
with a better appreciation,

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.256
a new appreciation of all of your voices

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.816
and the role it plays
inside and outside of you --

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.256
as your voice is a very critical
determinant of what makes you humans

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.560
and of how you interact with the world.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.336
Thank you.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.200
(Applause)
