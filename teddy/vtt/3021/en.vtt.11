And you vocal posture,
when you talk to your spouse,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.880
can help predict not only if,
but also when you will divorce.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.000
So there is a lot to learn
from listening to voices.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.456
And I believe this has to start
with understanding

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.496
that we have more than one voice.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.376
So, I'm going to talk
about three voices that most of us posses,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.720
in a model of what I call the mask.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.496
So when you look at the mask,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.800
what you see is a projection
of a character.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.496
Let's call that your outward voice.
