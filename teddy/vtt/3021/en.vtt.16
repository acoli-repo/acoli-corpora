00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.560
And when you try to observe it,
what you will see is inside of the mask.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.920
And that's your inward voice.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.576
So to understand why it's different,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.280
let's try to understand the mechanism
of perception of this inward voice.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.496
Because your body has many ways
of filtering it differently

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.536
from the outward voice.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.056
So to perceive this voice,
it first has to travel to your ears.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.656
And your outward voice
travels through the air

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.176
while your inward voice
travels through your bones.
