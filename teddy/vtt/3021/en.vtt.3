00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.560
has relived the evolution
of our whole species.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.136
And talking about babies,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.800
when you were starting to develop
in your mother's womb,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.816
the first sensation that you had
coming from the outside world,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.776
at only three weeks old,
when you were about the size of a shrimp,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.496
were through the tactile sensation

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.320
coming from the vibrations
of your mother's voice.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.416
So, as we can see, the human voice
is quite meaningful and important

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.416
at the level of the species,
