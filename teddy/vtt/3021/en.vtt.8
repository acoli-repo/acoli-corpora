00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.856
And by listening to the voice,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.656
we can understand possible failures
of what happens inside.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.880
For example:

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.336
listening to very specific
types of turbulences

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.656
and nonlinearity of the voice

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.136
can help predict
very early stages of Parkinson's,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.560
just through a phone call.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.140
Listening to the breathlessness
of the voice

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.950
can help detect heart disease.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.496
And we also know that the changes of tempo
inside individual words
