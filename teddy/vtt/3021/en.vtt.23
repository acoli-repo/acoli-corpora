00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.056
So in our lab, we are also
working on small devices

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.616
to help those people
make those distinctions

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.280
and know if a voice
is internal or external.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.096
You can also think about the inner voice
as the voice that speaks in your dream.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.216
This inner voice can take many forms.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.456
And in your dreams, you actually unleash
the potential of this inner voice.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.536
That's another work
we are doing in our lab:

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.720
trying to access
this inner voice in dreams.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.576
So even if you can't always control it,

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.136
the inner voice --
you can always engage with it

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.496
through dialogue, through inner dialogues.
