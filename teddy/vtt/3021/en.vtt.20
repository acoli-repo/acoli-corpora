00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.760
so maybe we don't need
to spend energy analyzing the signal.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.216
And this is called a corollary discharge

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.736
and it happens for every motion
that your body does.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.976
The exact definition
of a corollary discharge

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.256
is a copy of a motor command
that is sent by the brain.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.976
This copy doesn't create any motion itself

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.976
but instead is sent
to other regions of the brain

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.160
to inform them of the impending motion.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.600
And for the voice, this corollary
discharge also has a different name.
