It's a neurological filter.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.216
Neurologists found out recently

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.016
that when you open your mouth
to create a sound,

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.840
your own auditory cortex shuts down.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.296
So you hear your voice

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:49.600
but your brain actually never listens
to the sound of your voice.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.576
Well, evolutionarily
that might make sense,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.576
because we know cognitively
what we are going to sound like

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.760
so maybe we don't need
to spend energy analyzing the signal.
