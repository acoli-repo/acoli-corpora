If you ask evolutionary biologists

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.136
when did humans become humans,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.256
some of them will say that,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.176
well, at some point
we started standing on our feet,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.520
became biped and became
the masters of our environment.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.176
Others will say that because our brain
started growing much bigger,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.280
that we were able to have
much more complex cognitive processes.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.056
And others might argue
that it's because we developed language
