00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.256
and my research
focuses on the relationship

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.360
people have with their own voice
and with the voices of others.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.816
I study what we can learn
from listening to voices,

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.216
from the various fields,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.120
from neurology to biology,
cognitive sciences, linguistics.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.736
In our group we create
tools and experiences

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.496
to help people gain a better
applied understanding of their voice

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.576
in order to reduce the biases,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.696
to become better listeners,
