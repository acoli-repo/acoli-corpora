We rarely use our voice for ourselves;
we use it as a gift to give to others.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.816
It is how we touch each other.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.776
It's a dialectical grooming.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.216
But what do we think about our own voice?

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.976
So please raise your hand

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.016
if you don't like the sound of your voice
when you hear it on a recording machine.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.256
(Laughter)

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.496
Yeah, thank you, indeed,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.416
most people report not liking
the sound of their voice recording.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.656
So what does that mean?

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.376
Let's try to understand that
in the next 10 minutes.
