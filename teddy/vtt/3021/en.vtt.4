00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.416
at the level of the species,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.976
at the level of the society --

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.936
this is how we communicate
and create bonds,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.416
and at the personal
and interpersonal levels --

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.576
with our voice, we share much more
than words and data,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.736
we share basically who we are.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.136
And our voice is indistinguishable
from how other people see us.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.080
It is a mask that we wear in society.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.810
But our relationship with our own voice
is far from obvious.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.616
We rarely use our voice for ourselves;
we use it as a gift to give to others.
