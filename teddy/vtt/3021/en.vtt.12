00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.496
Let's call that your outward voice.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.336
This is also the most classic way
to think about the voice,

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.256
it's a way of projecting
yourself in the world.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.536
The mechanism for this projection
is well understood.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.896
Your lungs contract your diaphragm

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.176
and that creates a self-sustained
vibration of your vocal fold,

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.696
that creates a sound.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.896
And then the way you open and close
the cavities in you mouth,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.616
your vocal tract is going to
transform the sound.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.856
So everyone has the same mechanism.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.656
But voices are quite unique.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.456
It's because very subtle differences
in size, physiology, in hormone levels
