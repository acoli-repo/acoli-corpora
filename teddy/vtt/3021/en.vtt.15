00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.336
Generally, for male voices
there's a big change at puberty.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.696
And then for female voices,

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.960
there is a change at each pregnancy
and a big change at menopause.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.456
So all of that is the voice
other people hear when you talk.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.680
So why is it that we're so
unfamiliar with it?

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.016
Why is it that it's not
the voice that we hear?

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.256
So, let's think about it.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.800
When you wear a mask,
you actually don't see the mask.
