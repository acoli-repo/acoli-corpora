00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.456
It's because very subtle differences
in size, physiology, in hormone levels

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.120
are going to make very subtle
differences in your outward voice.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.856
And your brain is very good

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.680
at picking up those subtle differences
from other people's outward voices.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.016
In our lab, we are working
on teaching machines

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.456
to understand those subtle differences.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.336
And we use deep learning to create
a real-time speaker identification system

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.136
to help raise awareness
on the use of the shared vocal space --
