00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.056
And others might argue
that it's because we developed language

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.360
that allowed us to evolve as a species.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.496
Interestingly, those three
phenomena are all connected.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.296
We are not sure how or in which order,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.856
but they are all linked

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.640
with the change of shape of a little bone
in the back of your neck

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.000
that changed the angle
between our head and our body.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.816
That means we were able to stand upright

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.976
but also for our brain
to evolve in the back

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.616
and for our voice box to grow
from seven centimeters for primates
