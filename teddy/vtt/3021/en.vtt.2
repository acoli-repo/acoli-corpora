and for our voice box to grow
from seven centimeters for primates

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.760
to 11 and up to 17 centimetres for humans.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.480
And this is called
the descent of the larynx.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.240
And the larynx is the site of your voice.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.320
When baby humans are born today,
their larynx is not descended yet.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.480
That only happens
at about three months old.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.296
So, metaphorically, each of us here

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.560
has relived the evolution
of our whole species.
