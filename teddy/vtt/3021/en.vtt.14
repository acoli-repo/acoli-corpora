00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.136
to help raise awareness
on the use of the shared vocal space --

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.560
so who talks and who never
talks during meetings --

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.280
to increase group intelligence.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.080
And one of the difficulties with that
is that your voice is also not static.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.136
We already said that it changes
with every person you talk to

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.096
but it also changes generally
throughout your life.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.336
At the beginning
and at the end of the journey,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.056
male and female voices are very similar.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.616
It's very hard to distinguish

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.760
the voice of a very young girl
from the voice of a very young boy.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:33.376
But in between, your voice
becomes a marker of your fluid identity.
