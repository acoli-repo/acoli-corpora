Lindsay Levin: So Dave,
in just a few months,

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:06.888
you transition into a new role
as CEO of consumer retail at Amazon.

00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:08.431
That's a big role.

00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:10.950
How will climate sit
as a priority for you,

00:00:10.974 --> 00:00:13.493
given all the other things
you'll have on your plate?

00:00:13.517 --> 00:00:16.588
Dave Clark: We've spent
much of our end of the summer

00:00:16.612 --> 00:00:18.627
in smoke-filled Seattle,

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:23.406
unable to enjoy the majestic
Pacific Northwest due to all the fires

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.643
that encompassed the West Coast
of the US this summer.

00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:32.676
Climate is a very real challenge
for all of us, not just at Amazon,
