00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960
At least one out of every three people
will experience some form of insomnia

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.003
in their lifetime.

00:00:07.086 --> 00:00:11.591
Insomnia is when you consistently
have difficulties either falling asleep,

00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:13.718
difficulties staying asleep

00:00:13.718 --> 00:00:18.097
or you just donâ€™t feel refreshed
or restored by your sleep the next day.

00:00:18.264 --> 00:00:20.058
Now, when sleep becomes difficult,

00:00:20.058 --> 00:00:25.063
there are many things that people
understandably turn to for help,

00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:27.857
but not all of them work especially well.
