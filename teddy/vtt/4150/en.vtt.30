That's a racist idea in and of itself.

00:15:00.875 --> 00:15:02.476
And so I'm talking about groups,

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.351
and if you believe that groups are equals,

00:15:05.375 --> 00:15:06.976
then the only other alternative,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.476
the only other explanation
to persisting inequity and injustice,

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.851
is power and policy.

00:15:13.875 --> 00:15:20.226
And to then spend your time transforming
and challenging power and policy

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.875
is to spend your time being anti-racist.

00:15:25.625 --> 00:15:29.476
WPR: So we have some questions
that are coming in from the audience.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.184
