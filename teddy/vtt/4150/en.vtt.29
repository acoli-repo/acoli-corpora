which is one of the reasons
why they were infected.

00:14:32.167 --> 00:14:35.226
But there are white people
who didn't take coronavirus seriously.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.018
No one has ever proven,
actually studies have shown

00:14:38.042 --> 00:14:42.351
that black people were more likely
to take the coronavirus seriously

00:14:42.375 --> 00:14:43.684
than white people.

00:14:43.708 --> 00:14:45.726
We're not talking about individuals here,

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.268
and we certainly should not
be individualizing groups.

00:14:49.292 --> 00:14:52.601
We certainly should not be looking
at the individual behavior

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:56.309
of one Latinx person or one black person,

00:14:56.333 --> 00:14:58.643
and saying they're
representatives of the group.

00:14:58.667 --> 00:15:00.851
That's a racist idea in and of itself.
