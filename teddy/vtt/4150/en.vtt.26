for their vulnerability to illness.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.809
So I'm curious, in line with that,

00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:06.684
what is the relationship
between anti-racism

00:13:06.708 --> 00:13:09.042
and the potential for systemic change?

00:13:11.458 --> 00:13:14.684
IXK: I think it's a direct relationship,

00:13:14.708 --> 00:13:17.000
because when you are --

00:13:18.917 --> 00:13:22.601
when you believe
and have consumed racist ideas,

00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:25.851
you're not going to even believe
change is necessary

00:13:25.875 --> 00:13:29.893
because you're going to believe
that racial inequality is normal.

00:13:29.917 --> 00:13:32.559
Or, you're not going
to believe change is possible.
