00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:31.643
whether we're talking about Donald Trump,

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:35.434
who, right after he said
that majority-black Baltimore

00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:39.768
is a rat and rodent-infested mess
that no human being would want to live in,

00:01:39.792 --> 00:01:42.309
and he was challenged as being racist,

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:46.476
he said, "Actually, I'm the least racist
person anywhere in the world."

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.351
And so really the heartbeat
of racism itself

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.434
has always been denial,

00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:54.143
and the sound of that heartbeat

00:01:54.167 --> 00:01:57.018
has always been, "I'm not racist."

00:01:57.042 --> 00:01:59.768
And so what I'm trying to do with my work

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:04.309
is to really get Americans
to eliminate the concept of "not racist"
