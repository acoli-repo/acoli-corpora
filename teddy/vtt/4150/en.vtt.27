00:13:29.917 --> 00:13:32.559
Or, you're not going
to believe change is possible.

00:13:32.583 --> 00:13:37.351
In other words, you're going to believe
that the reason why black people

00:13:37.375 --> 00:13:41.018
are being killed by police
at such high rates

00:13:41.042 --> 00:13:45.934
or the reason why Latinx people
are being infected at such high rates

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.143
is because there's
something wrong with them,

00:13:48.167 --> 00:13:49.518
and nothing can be changed.

00:13:49.542 --> 00:13:53.601
And so you wouldn't even
begin to even see the need

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:56.184
for systemic structural change,

00:13:56.208 --> 00:14:00.393
let alone be a part of the struggle
for systemic structural change.
