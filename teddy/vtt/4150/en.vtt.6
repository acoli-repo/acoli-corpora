00:02:56.167 --> 00:03:00.059
about whether we're
supporting racist policies,

00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:01.934
and admit when we are,

00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:04.101
because to be anti-racist

00:03:04.125 --> 00:03:07.726
is to admit when
we expressed a racist idea,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.768
is to say, "You know what?

00:03:09.792 --> 00:03:12.143
When I was doing that in Central Park,

00:03:12.167 --> 00:03:14.268
I was indeed being racist.

00:03:14.292 --> 00:03:15.684
But I'm going to change.

00:03:15.708 --> 00:03:18.393
I'm going to strive to be anti-racist."

00:03:18.417 --> 00:03:19.934
And to be racist

00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:22.309
is to constantly deny

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:26.018
the racial inequities
that pervade American society,

00:03:26.042 --> 00:03:31.143
to constantly deny the racist ideas
that pervade American minds.
