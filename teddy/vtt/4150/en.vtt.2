00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:05.684
like countless other Americans have said
right after they engaged in a racist act,

00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:07.559
"I am not racist."

00:01:07.583 --> 00:01:09.976
And I say countless Americans,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.643
because when you really think
about the history of Americans

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:15.934
expressing racist ideas,

00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:18.893
supporting racist policies,

00:01:18.917 --> 00:01:21.518
you're really talking
about a history of people

00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:23.476
who have claimed they're not racist,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.101
because everyone claims
that they're not racist,

00:01:26.125 --> 00:01:29.601
whether we're talking
about the Amy Coopers of the world,

00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:31.643
whether we're talking about Donald Trump,
