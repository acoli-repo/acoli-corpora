00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:31.184
and so when a person in one moment

00:09:31.208 --> 00:09:33.559
is expressing a racist idea,

00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:37.518
in that moment they are being racist
when they're saying black people are lazy.

00:09:37.542 --> 00:09:38.976
If in the very next moment

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.434
they're appreciating the cultures
of native people,

00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:44.083
they're being anti-racist.

00:09:46.875 --> 00:09:49.059
WPR: And we're going to get
to some questions

00:09:49.083 --> 00:09:50.643
from our community in a moment,

00:09:50.667 --> 00:09:54.434
but I think when a lot of people hear
this idea that you're putting forward,

00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:56.101
this idea of anti-racism,

00:09:56.125 --> 00:09:58.184
there's this feeling
that this is something

00:09:58.208 --> 00:10:00.351
that only concerns the white community.
