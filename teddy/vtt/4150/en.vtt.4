WEBVTT

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:04.309
is to really get Americans
to eliminate the concept of "not racist"

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:05.934
from their vocabulary,

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:08.976
and realize we're either being racist

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.309
or anti-racist.

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:15.101
We're either expressing ideas
that suggest certain racial groups

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.476
are better or worse than others,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.851
superior or inferior than others.

00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:21.601
We're either being racist,

00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:23.101
or we're being anti-racist.

00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:29.059
We're expressing notions
that the racial groups are equals,

00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:32.309
despite any cultural
or even ethnic differences.
