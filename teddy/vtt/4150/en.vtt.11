00:05:29.083 --> 00:05:32.018
is to believe that there's nothing wrong

00:05:32.042 --> 00:05:34.851
or inferior about black people
or any other racial group.

00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:36.351
There's nothing dangerous

00:05:36.375 --> 00:05:39.643
about black people
or any other racial group.

00:05:39.667 --> 00:05:43.643
And so when we see these
racial disparities all around us,

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:46.184
we see them as abnormal,

00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:51.476
and then we start to figure out, OK,
what policies are behind

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.309
so many black people
being killed by police?

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:57.684
What policies are behind
so many Latinx people

00:05:57.708 --> 00:06:00.559
being disproportionately
infected with COVID?
