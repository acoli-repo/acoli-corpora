And anyone who is not viewing
racism as the problem

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:34.292
is not being anti-racist.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:42.059
CS: You touched on this a bit
in your beginning talk here,

00:12:42.083 --> 00:12:46.143
but you've talked about how
racism is the reason

00:12:46.167 --> 00:12:48.434
that black communities
and communities of color

00:12:48.458 --> 00:12:50.934
are systematically
disadvantaged in America,

00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.768
which has led to so many more deaths
from COVID-19 in those communities.

00:12:54.792 --> 00:12:57.893
And yet the media is often
placing the blame on people of color

00:12:57.917 --> 00:13:01.226
for their vulnerability to illness.
