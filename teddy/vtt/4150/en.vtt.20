and nonwhite, other ethnic minorities

00:10:08.583 --> 00:10:12.708

this idea of anti-racism?

00:10:13.417 --> 00:10:14.726

people of color commonly say,

00:10:21.208 --> 00:10:22.893
"I can't be racist,

00:10:22.917 --> 00:10:25.184
because I'm a person of color."

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:32.018
And then some people of color
say they can't be racist
