Do you think it's possible
to control someone's attention?

00:00:05.664 --> 00:00:08.665
Even more than that,
what about predicting human behavior?

00:00:10.157 --> 00:00:12.012
I think those are interesting ideas.

00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:14.235
For me, that would be
the perfect superpower,

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.592
actually kind of an evil way
of approaching it.

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:19.719
But for myself, in the past,
I've spent the last 20 years

00:00:19.743 --> 00:00:23.221
studying human behavior
from a rather unorthodox way:

00:00:23.245 --> 00:00:24.541
picking pockets.

00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:26.717
When we think of misdirection,

00:00:26.741 --> 00:00:29.082
we think of something
as looking off to the side,

00:00:29.106 --> 00:00:31.331
when actually the things
right in front of us
