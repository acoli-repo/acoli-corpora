00:10:59.433 --> 00:11:01.580
that allows you to subscribe
to 311 complaints

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.648
around your own home,
or around your office.

00:11:03.648 --> 00:11:06.075
You put in your address,
you get local complaints.

00:11:06.075 --> 00:11:09.449
And it's not just the tech community
that are after these things.

00:11:09.449 --> 00:11:12.071
It's urban planners like 
the students I teach at Pratt.

00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:13.990
It's policy advocates, it's everyone,

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.553
it's citizens from a diverse
set of backgrounds.

00:11:16.553 --> 00:11:19.339
And with some small, incremental changes,

00:11:19.339 --> 00:11:22.564
we can unlock the passion
and the ability of our citizens

00:11:22.564 --> 00:11:25.720
to harness open data
and make our city even better,

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.346
whether it's one dataset,
or one parking spot at a time.

00:11:29.346 --> 00:11:31.668
Thank you.
