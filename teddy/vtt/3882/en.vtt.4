00:01:59.544 --> 00:02:03.506
and they get slower and slower and slower
until about 8:35 in the morning,

00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:06.199
when they end up at around
11 and a half miles per hour.

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:09.761
The average taxi is going 11 and a half
miles per hour on our city streets,

00:02:09.761 --> 00:02:11.748
and it turns out it stays that way

00:02:11.748 --> 00:02:15.116
for the entire day.

00:02:15.116 --> 00:02:16.489
(Laughter)

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.669
So I said to myself, I guess
there's no rush hour in New York City.

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:21.206
There's just a rush day.

00:02:21.206 --> 00:02:24.056
Makes sense. And this is important
for a couple of reasons.

00:02:24.056 --> 00:02:27.693
If you're a transportation planner,
this might be pretty interesting to know.

00:02:27.693 --> 00:02:29.668
But if you want to get somewhere quickly,

00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:33.136
you now know to set your alarm for
4:45 in the morning and you're all set.
