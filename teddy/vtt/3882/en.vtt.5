00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:33.136
you now know to set your alarm for
4:45 in the morning and you're all set.

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:34.180
New York, right?

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.942
But there's a story behind this data.

00:02:35.942 --> 00:02:38.127
This data wasn't
just available, it turns out.

00:02:38.127 --> 00:02:41.746
It actually came from something called
a Freedom of Information Law Request,

00:02:41.746 --> 00:02:42.822
or a FOIL Request.

00:02:42.822 --> 00:02:46.288
This is a form you can find on the
Taxi and Limousine Commission website.

00:02:46.288 --> 00:02:49.114
In order to access this data,
you need to go get this form,

00:02:49.114 --> 00:02:50.960
fill it out, and they will notify you,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.090
and a guy named Chris Whong
did exactly that.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.980
Chris went down, and they told him,

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.807
"Just bring a brand new hard drive 
down to our office,

00:02:57.807 --> 00:03:01.231
leave it here for five hours,
we'll copy the data and you take it back."
