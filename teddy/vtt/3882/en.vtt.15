00:07:27.761 --> 00:07:31.173
You can download data in any format,
be it CSV or PDF or Excel document.

00:07:31.173 --> 00:07:33.720
Whatever you want,
you can download the data that way.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.072
The problem is, once you do,

00:07:35.072 --> 00:07:38.758
you will find that each agency
codes their addresses differently.

00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:40.899
So one is street name, 
intersection street,

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:43.390
street, borough, address, building,
building address.

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.570
So once again, you're spending time,
even when we have this portal,

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.176
you're spending time
normalizing our address fields.

00:07:49.176 --> 00:07:51.599
And that's not the best use 
of our citizens' time.

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:53.395
We can do better than that as a city.

00:07:53.395 --> 00:07:55.040
We can standardize our addresses,

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.225
and if we do, 
we can get more maps like this.

00:07:57.225 --> 00:07:59.510
This is a map of fire hydrants
in New York City,

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.041
but not just any fire hydrants.
