00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:31.612
and instead of just counting
the number of cabs,

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:33.555
we can start to ask different questions.

00:01:33.555 --> 00:01:34.755
So I had a question.

00:01:34.755 --> 00:01:36.456
When's rush hour in New York City?

00:01:36.456 --> 00:01:39.037
It can be pretty bothersome.
When is rush hour exactly?

00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:41.662
And I thought to myself,
these cabs aren't just numbers,

00:01:41.662 --> 00:01:44.373
these are GPS recorders
driving around in our city streets

00:01:44.373 --> 00:01:46.286
recording each and every ride they take.

00:01:46.286 --> 00:01:48.608
There's data there,
and I looked at that data,

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:52.569
and I made a plot of the average speed of
taxis in New York City throughout the day.

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.981
You can see that from about midnight
to around 5:18 in the morning,

00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:59.544
speed increases, and at that point,
things turn around,

00:01:59.544 --> 00:02:03.506
and they get slower and slower and slower
until about 8:35 in the morning,
