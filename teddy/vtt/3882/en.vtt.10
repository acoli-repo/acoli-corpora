00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:01.193
but let's not release it in PDF form,

00:05:01.193 --> 00:05:03.932
because then we're having our citizens
write PDF scrapers.

00:05:03.932 --> 00:05:06.008
It's not the best use
of our citizens' time,

00:05:06.008 --> 00:05:08.012
and we as a city can do better than that.

00:05:08.012 --> 00:05:10.748
Now, the good news is that
the de Blasio administration

00:05:10.748 --> 00:05:13.280
actually recently released this data
a few months ago,

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.438
and so now we can
actually have access to it,

00:05:15.438 --> 00:05:17.974
but there's a lot of data
still entombed in PDF.

00:05:17.974 --> 00:05:21.171
For example, our crime data
is still only available in PDF.

00:05:21.171 --> 00:05:24.926
And not just our crime data,
our own city budget.

00:05:24.926 --> 00:05:28.655
Our city budget is only readable
right now in PDF form.

00:05:28.655 --> 00:05:30.796
And it's not just us
that can't analyze it --
