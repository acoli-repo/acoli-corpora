00:06:58.218 --> 00:07:00.831
you'd see just a snippet of it, 
a year or a few months.

00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:04.221
It was actually on the Department
of Environmental Protection's website.

00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:08.099
And each one of these links is an Excel 
sheet, and each Excel sheet is different.

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:10.729
Every heading is different:
you copy, paste, reorganize.

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:13.681
When you do you can make maps
and that's great, but once again,

00:07:13.681 --> 00:07:16.650
we can do better than that 
as a city, we can normalize things.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.034
And we're getting there, because
there's this website that Socrata makes

00:07:20.034 --> 00:07:21.575
called the Open Data Portal NYC.

00:07:21.575 --> 00:07:23.832
This is where 1,100 data sets 
that don't suffer

00:07:23.832 --> 00:07:25.613
from the things I just told you live,

00:07:25.613 --> 00:07:27.761
and that number is growing,
and that's great.

00:07:27.761 --> 00:07:31.173
You can download data in any format,
be it CSV or PDF or Excel document.
