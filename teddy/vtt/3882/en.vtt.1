00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:30.419
Most city agencies give us statistics.

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:31.902
This is from a report this year

00:00:31.902 --> 00:00:33.794
from the Taxi and Limousine Commission,

00:00:33.794 --> 00:00:37.070
where we learn that there's about
13,500 taxis here in New York City.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.360
Pretty interesting, right?

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.144
But did you ever think about
where these numbers came from?

00:00:41.144 --> 00:00:44.047
Because for these numbers to exist,
someone at the city agency

00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:47.927
had to stop and say, hmm, here's a number
that somebody might want want to know.

00:00:47.927 --> 00:00:50.177
Here's a number 
that our citizens want to know.

00:00:50.177 --> 00:00:52.007
So they go back to their raw data,

00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:53.804
they count, they add, they calculate,

00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:55.271
and then they put out reports,

00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:57.448
and those reports
will have numbers like this.

00:00:57.448 --> 00:00:59.988
The problem is, how do they know
all of our questions?

00:00:59.988 --> 00:01:01.231
We have lots of questions.
