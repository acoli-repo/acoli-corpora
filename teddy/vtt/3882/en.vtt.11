00:05:28.655 --> 00:05:30.796
And it's not just us
that can't analyze it --

00:05:30.796 --> 00:05:33.751
our own legislators
who vote for the budget

00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:35.694
also only get it in PDF.

00:05:35.694 --> 00:05:39.538
So our legislators cannot analyze 
the budget that they are voting for.

00:05:39.538 --> 00:05:43.146
And I think as a city we can do
a little better than that as well.

00:05:43.146 --> 00:05:45.634
Now, there's a lot of data
that's not hidden in PDFs.

00:05:45.634 --> 00:05:47.334
This is an example of a map I made,

00:05:47.334 --> 00:05:50.260
and this is the dirtiest waterways
in New York City.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.769
Now, how do I measure dirty?

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:53.626
Well, it's kind of a little weird,

00:05:53.626 --> 00:05:55.739
but I looked at the level
of fecal coliform,

00:05:55.739 --> 00:05:59.245
which is a measurement of fecal matter
in each of our waterways.

00:05:59.245 --> 00:06:02.519
The larger the circle,
the dirtier the water,
