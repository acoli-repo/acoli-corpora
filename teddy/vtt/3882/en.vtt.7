00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.527
Now, not every dataset
is behind a FOIL Request.

00:03:30.527 --> 00:03:34.329
Here is a map I made with the most
dangerous intersections in New York City

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.207
based on cyclist accidents.

00:03:36.207 --> 00:03:38.146
So the red areas are more dangerous.

00:03:38.146 --> 00:03:40.699
And what it shows is first
the East side of Manhattan,

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:44.310
especially in the lower area of Manhattan,
has more cyclist accidents.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.329
That might make sense

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.225
because there are more cyclists
coming off the bridges there.

00:03:48.225 --> 00:03:50.239
But there's other hotspots worth studying.

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.908
There's Williamsburg.
There's Roosevelt Avenue in Queens.

00:03:52.908 --> 00:03:55.760
And this is exactly the kind of data
we need for Vision Zero.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.750
This is exactly what we're looking for.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.885
But there's a story
behind this data as well.

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:01.952
This data didn't just appear.
