00:00:59.988 --> 00:01:01.231
We have lots of questions.

00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:04.571
In fact, in some ways there's literally
an infinite number of questions

00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:06.220
that we can ask about our city.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.695
The agencies can never keep up.

00:01:07.695 --> 00:01:11.751
So the paradigm isn't exactly working,
and I think our policymakers realize that,

00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:15.710
because in 2012, Mayor Bloomberg
signed into law what he called

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.547
the most ambitious and comprehensive
open data legislation in the country.

00:01:19.547 --> 00:01:21.120
In a lot of ways, he's right.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.981
In the last two years, 
the city has released 1,000 datasets

00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:25.591
on our open data portal,

00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:27.355
and it's pretty awesome.

00:01:27.355 --> 00:01:29.323
So you go and look at data like this,

00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:31.612
and instead of just counting
the number of cabs,
