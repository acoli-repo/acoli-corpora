00:02:57.807 --> 00:03:01.231
leave it here for five hours,
we'll copy the data and you take it back."

00:03:01.231 --> 00:03:03.263
And that's where this data came from.

00:03:03.263 --> 00:03:06.268
Now, Chris is the kind of guy
who wants to make the data public,

00:03:06.268 --> 00:03:10.052
and so it ended up online for all to use,
and that's where this graph came from.

00:03:10.052 --> 00:03:13.570
And the fact that it exists is amazing.
These GPS recorders -- really cool.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.688
But the fact that we have citizens
walking around with hard drives

00:03:16.688 --> 00:03:19.270
picking up data from city agencies
to make it public --

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.660
it was already kind of public,
you could get to it,

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.472
but it was "public," it wasn't public.

00:03:23.472 --> 00:03:25.434
And we can do better than that as a city.

00:03:25.434 --> 00:03:28.190
We don't need our citizens
walking around with hard drives.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.527
Now, not every dataset
is behind a FOIL Request.
