John Krauss was like,

00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:33.564
I'm not going to copy and paste this data.
I'm going to write a program.

00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:35.852
It's called the NYPD Crash Data Band-Aid,

00:04:35.852 --> 00:04:38.884
and it goes to the NYPD's website
and it would download PDFs.

00:04:38.884 --> 00:04:42.010
Every day it would search;
if it found a PDF, it would download it

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.260
and then it would run
some PDF-scraping program,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.596
and out would come the text,

00:04:45.596 --> 00:04:49.161
and it would go on the Internet,
and then people could make maps like that.

00:04:49.161 --> 00:04:52.590
And the fact that the data's here,
the fact that we have access to it --

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.040
Every accident, by the way,
is a row in this table.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.876
You can imagine how many PDFs that is.

00:04:56.876 --> 00:04:59.083
The fact that we
have access to that is great,

00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:01.193
but let's not release it in PDF form,
