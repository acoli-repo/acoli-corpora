00:06:27.526 --> 00:06:31.174
In Coney Island Creek, which is not
the Coney Island you swim in, luckily.

00:06:31.174 --> 00:06:32.332
It's on the other side.

00:06:32.332 --> 00:06:36.210
But Coney Island Creek, 94 percent
of samples taken over the last five years

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.367
have had fecal levels so high

00:06:38.367 --> 00:06:41.460
that it would be against state law
to swim in the water.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.189
And this is not the kind of fact
that you're going to see

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:45.726
boasted in a city report, right?

00:06:45.726 --> 00:06:47.976
It's not going to be 
the front page on nyc.gov.

00:06:47.976 --> 00:06:49.556
You're not going to see it there,

00:06:49.556 --> 00:06:52.074
but the fact that we can get 
to that data is awesome.

00:06:52.074 --> 00:06:53.847
But once again, it wasn't super easy,

00:06:53.847 --> 00:06:56.205
because this data was not
on the open data portal.

00:06:56.205 --> 00:06:58.218
If you were to go to the open data portal,

00:06:58.218 --> 00:07:00.831
you'd see just a snippet of it, 
a year or a few months.
