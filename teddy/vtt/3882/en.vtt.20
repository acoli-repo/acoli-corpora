00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.739
let's pass legislation that requires you
to post it with the underlying data,

00:10:02.739 --> 00:10:04.767
because that data
is coming from somewhere.

00:10:04.767 --> 00:10:07.249
I don't know where, but it's
coming from somewhere,

00:10:07.249 --> 00:10:08.974
and you can release it with the PDF.

00:10:08.974 --> 00:10:11.385
And let's adopt and share
some open data standards.

00:10:11.385 --> 00:10:13.866
Let's start with our addresses
here in New York City.

00:10:13.866 --> 00:10:15.940
Let's just start
normalizing our addresses.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.002
Because New York is a leader in open data.

00:10:18.002 --> 00:10:20.791
Despite all this, we are absolutely
a leader in open data,

00:10:20.791 --> 00:10:23.912
and if we start normalizing things,
and set an open data standard,

00:10:23.912 --> 00:10:27.546
others will follow. The state will follow,
and maybe the federal government,

00:10:27.546 --> 00:10:28.991
Other countries could follow,

00:10:28.991 --> 00:10:32.402
and we're not that far off from a time
where you could write one program
