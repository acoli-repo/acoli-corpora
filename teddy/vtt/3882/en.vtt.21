WEBVTT

00:10:28.991 --> 00:10:32.402
and we're not that far off from a time
where you could write one program

00:10:32.402 --> 00:10:34.292
and map information from 100 countries.

00:10:34.292 --> 00:10:36.779
It's not science fiction.
We're actually quite close.

00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:39.019
And by the way, who are we
empowering with this?

00:10:39.019 --> 00:10:42.024
Because it's not just John Krauss
and it's not just Chris Whong.

00:10:42.024 --> 00:10:45.119
There are hundreds of meetups
going on in New York City right now,

00:10:45.119 --> 00:10:46.144
active meetups.

00:10:46.144 --> 00:10:48.716
There are thousands of people
attending these meetups.

00:10:48.716 --> 00:10:51.084
These people are going after work
and on weekends,

00:10:51.084 --> 00:10:53.720
and they're attending these meetups
to look at open data

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.360
and make our city a better place.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.433
Groups like BetaNYC, who just last week 
released something called citygram.nyc

00:10:59.433 --> 00:11:01.580
that allows you to subscribe
