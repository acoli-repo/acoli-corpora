00:00:00.711 --> 00:00:03.531
Six thousand miles of road,

00:00:03.531 --> 00:00:05.734
600 miles of subway track,

00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:07.378
400 miles of bike lanes

00:00:07.378 --> 00:00:09.199
and a half a mile of tram track,

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:11.152
if you've ever been to Roosevelt Island.

00:00:11.152 --> 00:00:14.486
These are the numbers that make up
the infrastructure of New York City.

00:00:14.486 --> 00:00:17.105
These are the statistics
of our infrastructure.

00:00:17.105 --> 00:00:20.811
They're the kind of numbers you can find
released in reports by city agencies.

00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:24.010
For example, the Department
of Transportation will probably tell you

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.791
how many miles of road they maintain.

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:28.612
The MTA will boast how many miles
of subway track there are.

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:30.419
Most city agencies give us statistics.
