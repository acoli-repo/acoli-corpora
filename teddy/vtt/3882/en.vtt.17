00:08:28.237 --> 00:08:30.975
And that seemed a little strange
to me when I noticed it,

00:08:30.975 --> 00:08:34.244
so I did a little digging and it turns out
what you had is a hydrant

00:08:34.244 --> 00:08:36.240
and then something called
a curb extension,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.299
which is like a seven-foot
space to walk on,

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:39.455
and then a parking spot.

00:08:39.455 --> 00:08:41.709
And so these cars came along,
and the hydrant --

00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:43.620
"It's all the way over there, I'm fine,"

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:47.094
and there was actually a parking spot
painted there beautifully for them.

00:08:47.094 --> 00:08:50.249
They would park there, and the NYPD
disagreed with this designation

00:08:50.249 --> 00:08:51.307
and would ticket them.

00:08:51.307 --> 00:08:53.651
And it wasn't just me 
who found a parking ticket.

00:08:53.651 --> 00:08:55.797
This is the Google 
Street View car driving by

00:08:55.797 --> 00:08:57.414
finding the same parking ticket.

00:08:57.414 --> 00:09:01.918
So I wrote about this on my blog,
on I Quant NY, and the DOT responded,
