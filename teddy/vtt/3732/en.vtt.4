00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:01.434
access decent health care,

00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:05.184
retire in some security without worrying

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:08.184
on just what he earned there at the park.

00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:10.559
Mind you, Grandpa fought the unions,

00:02:10.583 --> 00:02:11.958
and he fought them hard.

00:02:12.583 --> 00:02:14.559
He said he didn't like to be forced

00:02:14.583 --> 00:02:17.143
to do something
he wanted to do voluntarily.

00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:21.518
That was rank paternalism of course
and maybe even a tiny bit of BS.

00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:23.125
He wasn't an angel,

00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:27.059
and everyone wasn't well
and fairly treated across the company,

00:02:27.083 --> 00:02:28.542
something that's well-known.
