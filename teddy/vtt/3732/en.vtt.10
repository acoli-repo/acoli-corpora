Yes, I think Disney can do better.

00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:06.559
And I believe that many of the thousands
of magnificent people

00:05:06.583 --> 00:05:08.809
who work at the Walt Disney Company

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:11.958
wish that it would do better
just as much as I do.

00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:14.684
For almost a century,

00:05:14.708 --> 00:05:16.809
Disney has turned a pretty profit

00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:20.601
on the idea that families
are a kind of magic,

00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:22.851
that love is important,

00:05:22.875 --> 00:05:24.667
that imaginations matter.

00:05:25.208 --> 00:05:27.393
That's why it turns
your stomach a little bit

00:05:27.417 --> 00:05:30.934
when I tell you that Cinderella
might be sleeping in her car.
