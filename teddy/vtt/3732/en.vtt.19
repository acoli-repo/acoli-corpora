Jiminy would want us to remember
that nobody works in a vacuum,

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:33.768
that the men and women who run companies

00:09:33.792 --> 00:09:38.184
actively cocreate the reality
we all have to share.

00:09:38.208 --> 00:09:40.393
And just like with global warming,

00:09:40.417 --> 00:09:44.393
we are, each of us, responsible
for the collective consequences

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:47.125
of our individual decisions and actions.

00:09:48.417 --> 00:09:51.768
I believe that the most profitable
business ecosystem

00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:53.143
in the history of the world

00:09:53.167 --> 00:09:54.434
can do better.

00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:58.226
I believe we can take
just a little bit off of the upside,

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.601
take a tiny bit of pressure off
the speed at which things are happening.
