00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.643
Of all the characters
in all the Disney films

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:06.958
the one I love the most
is Jiminy Cricket from "Pinocchio."

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:09.768
My favorite scene in the movie

00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:12.809
is when the blue fairy
is saying to Pinocchio,

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:15.476
"Always let your conscience
be your guide."

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.851
Pinocchio asks, "What are conscience?"

00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:20.476
and Jiminy Cricket
is scandalized by the question.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.809
"What are conscience!

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:23.309
What are conscience!

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:27.309
Conscience is that still, small voice
that people won't listen to.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.875
That's just the trouble
with the world today."
