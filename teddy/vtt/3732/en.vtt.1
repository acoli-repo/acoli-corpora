I love the way Jiminy Cricket
is always there

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:37.226
with a nerdy, ethical thing

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.184
just as Pinocchio's coming up
with some kind of good plan.

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:44.143
I think of him as speaking
truth to puppet.

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:46.643
I always wondered what it was
about Jiminy Cricket

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:48.101
that made me love him so much

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:49.393
and one day it hit me.

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:51.583
It was because he sounds
like my grandfather.

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:55.809
My grandfather was
a very sweet and cuddly man,

00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:58.292
and I loved him to the moon and back.

00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:02.143
But I shared him with a big, wide world.
