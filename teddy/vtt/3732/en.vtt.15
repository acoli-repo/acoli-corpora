00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:30.476
We're going to have to use
our imaginations.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.750
You're going to have to invite
Jiminy Cricket back to the party.

00:07:35.125 --> 00:07:38.375
Now, Jiminy Cricket might start
with some low-hanging fruit,

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:41.601
like, greed is not good,

00:07:41.625 --> 00:07:45.601
like the world is not divided
into makers and takers,

00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:47.226
and that nobody ever,

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.518
without any help,

00:07:48.542 --> 00:07:50.809
pulled themselves up
by their own bootstraps --

00:07:50.833 --> 00:07:53.958
if you know anything about physics
you'll understand why that is.

00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:59.018
Jiminy might remind us that every
single person who works for us,

00:07:59.042 --> 00:08:00.851
without exception,
