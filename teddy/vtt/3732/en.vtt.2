00:01:03.917 --> 00:01:06.518
and together with his younger

00:01:06.542 --> 00:01:10.393
he came from a very humble
upbringing in Kansas

00:01:10.417 --> 00:01:14.792
and started and ran one of the most
iconic businesses in the world.

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:18.726

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.101

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:26.268

anybody who worked there,

00:01:26.292 --> 00:01:28.667
I was in deep doo-doo when we got home.
