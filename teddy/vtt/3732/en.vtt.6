among others,

who popularized the idea
of shareholder primacy.

00:03:05.167 --> 00:03:10.333
Now, shareholder primacy is a pretty
reasonable idea when you think about it.

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:12.934
Shareholders own the company,

00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:17.226
shareholders want profits and growth,

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.559
so therefore you prioritize
profits and growth.

00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:22.434
Very sensible.

00:03:22.458 --> 00:03:26.976
But unfortunately, shareholder primacy
was an idea that became a mindset

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.559
and then that mindset jumped the rails,

00:03:29.583 --> 00:03:32.684
and it came to fundamentally
alter everything
