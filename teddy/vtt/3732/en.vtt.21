00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.309
and those are times
none of us want to go back to

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:33.684
for all kinds of good reasons.

00:10:33.708 --> 00:10:36.934
I know there are a lot of CEOs today
who are just as well-meaning

00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:39.726
and just as decent as my grandfather was,

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.893
but they're working at a time
with very different expectations

00:10:42.917 --> 00:10:45.250
and much more cutthroat context.

00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.643
But here's the good news.

00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:51.309
Expectations and contexts are made

00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:53.559
and they can be unmade, too.

00:10:53.583 --> 00:10:56.559
There is so much to learn
from the simple integrity

00:10:56.583 --> 00:10:59.792
of how my grandfather
understood his job as CEO.
