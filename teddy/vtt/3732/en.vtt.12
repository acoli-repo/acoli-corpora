If I told you how bad it was for workers
at Amazon or McDonald's or Walmart,

00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:07.143
or any one of a thousand other places
you've never heard of,

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:11.726
it's not going to hit you as viscerally
as if I tell you that 73 percent,

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.393
or three out of four of the people
who smile when you walk in,

00:06:15.417 --> 00:06:18.059
who help you comfort that crying baby,

00:06:18.083 --> 00:06:21.684
who maybe help you have the best
vacation you ever have,

00:06:21.708 --> 00:06:24.167

the happiest place on earth.

00:06:28.583 --> 00:06:31.851
And the people who work there
take incredible pride
