00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:01.226
And soon enough,

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.518
this new mindset had taken hold
across every business school

00:04:04.542 --> 00:04:06.042
and across every sector.

00:04:06.917 --> 00:04:10.893
Profits were to be pursued
by any means necessary,

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.184
unions were kneecapped,

00:04:13.208 --> 00:04:14.518
taxes were slashed,

00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:15.851
and with the same machete,

00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:17.976
so was the safety net.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.268
I don't need to tell you
about the inequality

00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:22.375
that's been the result of these shifts.

00:04:23.042 --> 00:04:25.018
We all know the story well.

00:04:25.042 --> 00:04:28.976
The bottom line is that everything
that turns a gig into a livelihood

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.018
was stripped away from an American worker.
