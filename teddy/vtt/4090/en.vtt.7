WEBVTT

00:03:30.963 --> 00:03:32.631
Our comprehensive model

00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:36.082
uniquely positions the Harlem
Children's Zone in the fight of COVID.

00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:39.358
The success that we have
on the ground in Harlem

00:03:39.382 --> 00:03:40.564
makes it imperative,

00:03:40.588 --> 00:03:43.676
and it is our responsibility
to share what we know works

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.032
with the country.

00:03:45.453 --> 00:03:50.998
We have developed a comprehensive
COVID-19 relief and recovery response

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:52.268
for our community,

00:03:52.292 --> 00:03:54.061
that was surfaced from our community,

00:03:54.085 --> 00:03:57.656
focused on five primary areas of need,

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.333
and already servicing
families like Sean's.
