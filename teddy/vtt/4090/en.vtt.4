00:01:59.839 --> 00:02:02.577
there's significant economic devastation,

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:04.744
where one in four
of our families in Harlem

00:02:04.768 --> 00:02:06.449
report food insecurity,

00:02:06.473 --> 00:02:10.839
and 57 percent report a loss of income
or a loss of their job.

00:02:12.362 --> 00:02:15.696
But to better understand the work
of the Harlem Children's Zone,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.323
I want to share a story with you,

00:02:17.347 --> 00:02:19.347
about a second-grade scholar named Sean.

00:02:20.617 --> 00:02:22.467
Sean is a beautiful Black boy

00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:25.633
whose smile would light up
any room that he's in.

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.942
And when quarantine began in March,

00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:31.616
we noticed that Sean
wasn't attending virtual school.
