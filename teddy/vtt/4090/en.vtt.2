WEBVTT

00:00:58.028 --> 00:01:00.833
and have close to 1,000 students
enrolled in college.

00:01:01.807 --> 00:01:04.768
We weave together
a net of services so tightly,

00:01:04.792 --> 00:01:07.033
so that no one will fall
through the cracks.

00:01:07.576 --> 00:01:10.234
And we've inspired global practitioners.

00:01:10.258 --> 00:01:13.480
We've had over 500-plus
communities across the US

00:01:13.504 --> 00:01:15.030
and 70-plus countries

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:17.054
come and visit us to learn our model.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:21.442
You see, the problems of the globe,
and the problems of the world

00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:24.284
are not neatly siloed into buckets.

00:01:24.657 --> 00:01:27.117
So therefore the solutions
must be comprehensive,

00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:28.799
they must be holistic.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:31.847
And now we're in the midst
of a global pandemic.
