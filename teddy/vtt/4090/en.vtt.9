00:04:29.092 --> 00:04:31.834
So we need to ensure
our families have connectivity,

00:04:31.858 --> 00:04:34.244
and also all school-age
children in a household

00:04:34.268 --> 00:04:36.268
have the proper learning devices.

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:39.276
Four, zero learning loss.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.879
We know that there's a generation
of students at risk

00:04:41.903 --> 00:04:44.132
of losing an entire year
of their education.

00:04:44.514 --> 00:04:48.677
We need to make sure that we are providing
high-quality virtual programing,

00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:53.058
in addition to having safe
reentry planned for school reentry.

00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:56.558
And five, mitigating
the mental health crisis.

00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:59.468
There's a generation at risk
of having PTSD,

00:04:59.492 --> 00:05:01.761
due to the massive amounts
of toxic stress.
