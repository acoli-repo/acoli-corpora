00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:02.603
Good evening.

00:00:02.627 --> 00:00:05.762
It is such a blessing to work
at the Harlem Children's Zone,

00:00:05.786 --> 00:00:09.544
an African-American-led organization
that has pioneered the field

00:00:09.568 --> 00:00:13.687
of comprehensive place-based services,
from cradle to career.

00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:17.131
And that word, "comprehensive,"
is so key to what we do.

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:19.876
You know, most interventions
focus on one piece

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.161
of a complicated, giant puzzle.

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:24.796
But that's not enough to solve the puzzle.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.416
You don't solve education
without understanding the home context

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.577
or the home environment
of our young scholar.
