00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.577
or the home environment
of our young scholar.

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:34.625
Or the broader context of health,
nutrition or criminal justice.

00:00:35.704 --> 00:00:39.220
The unit of change for us
is not the individual child,

00:00:39.244 --> 00:00:40.971
it's the entire neighborhood.

00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:43.701
You have to do multiple things
at the same time.

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:47.970
And we have 20 years of data
to prove that this works.

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:51.355
We've had 7,000 graduates
of our baby college,

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.695
we've eliminated the Black-white
achievement gap in our schools.

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.004
We've reduced obesity rates
in our health programs

00:00:58.028 --> 00:01:00.833
and have close to 1,000 students
enrolled in college.
