00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:31.616
we noticed that Sean
wasn't attending virtual school.

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:34.220
And after some investigation,

00:02:34.244 --> 00:02:38.101
we've come to learn that Sean's mom
was hospitalized due to COVID.

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:41.599
So he was at home
with grandma and his baby sibling,

00:02:41.623 --> 00:02:43.853
who was his only viable support system,

00:02:43.877 --> 00:02:45.877

Grandma was struggling.

00:02:50.316 --> 00:02:51.760
limited diapers,

00:02:51.784 --> 00:02:53.784
and Sean didn't even have a computer.

00:02:54.878 --> 00:02:56.783
When mom was released from the hospital,

00:02:56.807 --> 00:02:58.577
their challenges deepened,

00:02:58.601 --> 00:03:00.799
because they could no longer
stay with grandma,
