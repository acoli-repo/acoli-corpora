00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:00.418
And then national impact,

00:06:00.442 --> 00:06:02.410
not only through policy advocacy,

00:06:02.434 --> 00:06:04.434
but through capacity building at scale.

00:06:05.887 --> 00:06:07.736
Our answer to COVID-19,

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.942
the despair and inequities
plaguing our communities,

00:06:10.966 --> 00:06:14.323
is targeting neighborhoods
with comprehensive services.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.690
We have certainly not lost hope.

00:06:17.317 --> 00:06:20.325
And we invite you to join us
on the front lines of this war.

00:06:21.238 --> 00:06:22.388
Thank you.
