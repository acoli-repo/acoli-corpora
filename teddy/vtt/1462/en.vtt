When I first arrived in beautiful Zimbabwe,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
it was difficult to understand that 35 percent of the population

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is HIV positive.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
For instance, this is Herbert with his grandmother.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
When I first met him, he was sitting on his grandmother's lap.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
He has been orphaned, as both of his parents died of AIDS,
