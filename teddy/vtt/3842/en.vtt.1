00:00:25.452 --> 00:00:30.428
The downside, though, is that swallowing
any medication leads to its dilution.

00:00:31.134 --> 00:00:36.759
And this is a big problem,
particularly in HIV patients.

00:00:36.783 --> 00:00:39.936
When they take their anti-HIV drugs,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.026
these drugs are good for lowering
the virus in the blood,

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.269
and increasing the CD4 cell counts.

00:00:46.618 --> 00:00:50.983
But they are also notorious
for their adverse side effects,

00:00:51.007 --> 00:00:56.500
but mostly bad, because they get diluted
by the time they get to the blood,

00:00:56.524 --> 00:00:59.401
and worse, by the time
they get to the sites

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:04.887
where it matters most:
within the HIV viral reservoirs.
