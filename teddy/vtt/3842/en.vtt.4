Lasers, of course.

00:02:00.976 --> 00:02:03.840
If they can be used for dentistry,

00:02:03.864 --> 00:02:06.715
for diabetic wound-healing and surgery,

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:09.444
they can be used for anything imaginable,

00:02:09.468 --> 00:02:12.732
including transporting drugs into cells.

00:02:13.403 --> 00:02:18.633
As a matter of fact,
we are currently using laser pulses

00:02:18.657 --> 00:02:22.286
to poke or drill extremely tiny holes,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.222
which open and close almost
immediately in HIV-infected cells,

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:29.516
in order to deliver drugs within them.
