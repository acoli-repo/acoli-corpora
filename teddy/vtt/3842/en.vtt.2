within the HIV viral reservoirs.

00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:10.274
These areas in the body --
such as the lymph nodes,

00:01:10.298 --> 00:01:13.183
the nervous system,
as well as the lungs --

00:01:13.207 --> 00:01:15.711
where the virus is sleeping,

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:18.943
and will not readily
get delivered in the blood

00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:23.994
of patients that are under
consistent anti-HIV drugs therapy.

00:01:24.502 --> 00:01:28.188
However, upon discontinuation of therapy,

00:01:28.212 --> 00:01:31.869
the virus can awake
and infect new cells in the blood.
