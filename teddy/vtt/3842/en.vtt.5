00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.468
"How is that possible?" you may ask.

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:39.452
Well, we shine a very powerful
but super-tiny laser beam

00:02:39.476 --> 00:02:43.280
onto the membrane of HIV-infected cells

00:02:43.304 --> 00:02:47.355
while these cells are immersed
in liquid containing the drug.

00:02:48.395 --> 00:02:53.253
The laser pierces the cell,
while the cell swallows the drug

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:55.115
in a matter of microseconds.

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:57.018
Before you even know it,

00:02:57.042 --> 00:03:00.066
the induced hole
becomes immediately repaired.
