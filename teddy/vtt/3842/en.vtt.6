the induced hole
becomes immediately repaired.

00:03:01.246 --> 00:03:05.666
Now, we are currently testing
this technology in test tubes

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.197
or in Petri dishes,

00:03:07.221 --> 00:03:11.557
but the goal is to get
this technology in the human body,

00:03:11.581 --> 00:03:13.239
apply it in the human body.

00:03:13.928 --> 00:03:15.811
"How is that possible?" you may ask.

00:03:16.422 --> 00:03:20.602
Well, the answer is:
through a three-headed device.

00:03:21.506 --> 00:03:24.428
Using the first head, which is our laser,

00:03:24.452 --> 00:03:27.609
we will make an incision
in the site of infection.

00:03:28.498 --> 00:03:31.126
Using the second head, which is a camera,
