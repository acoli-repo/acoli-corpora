What do you do when you have a headache?

00:00:03.832 --> 00:00:05.494
You swallow an aspirin.

00:00:06.247 --> 00:00:10.570
But for this pill to get
to your head, where the pain is,

00:00:10.594 --> 00:00:15.971
it goes through your stomach, intestines
and various other organs first.

00:00:16.947 --> 00:00:22.069
Swallowing pills is the most effective
and painless way of delivering

00:00:22.093 --> 00:00:24.095
any medication in the body.

00:00:25.452 --> 00:00:30.428
The downside, though, is that swallowing
any medication leads to its dilution.
