Using the second head, which is a camera,

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.377
we meander to the site of infection.

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:38.580
Finally, using a third head,
which is a drug-spreading sprinkler,

00:03:38.604 --> 00:03:41.611
we deliver the drugs directly
at the site of infection,

00:03:41.635 --> 00:03:45.736
while the laser is again used
to poke those cells open.

00:03:46.815 --> 00:03:50.045
Well, this might not seem
like much right now.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.743
But one day, if successful,
this technology can lead

00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:58.996
to complete eradication
of HIV in the body.

00:03:59.401 --> 00:04:01.766
Yes. A cure for HIV.
