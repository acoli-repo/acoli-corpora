And here on Earth, amazing experiments

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.976
are being done to try

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.694

from the DNA forms we know.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.976

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.828
or whether, indeed, it's just us.

00:11:19.823 --> 00:11:22.308
Either answer, in its own way,

00:11:22.332 --> 00:11:24.178
is awe-inspiring,

00:11:25.407 --> 00:11:26.976

and ask these questions
