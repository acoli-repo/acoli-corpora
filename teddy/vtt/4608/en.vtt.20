00:09:57.834 --> 00:10:00.038
interacting with each other
in a beautiful way,

00:10:00.062 --> 00:10:02.839
and that that can happen more
efficiently at a small scale.

00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:05.976
So, just as on Earth,
clunky stereo systems have shrunk

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.976
to beautiful, tiny iPods,
maybe intelligent life itself,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.724
in order to reduce its footprint
on the environment,

00:10:11.748 --> 00:10:13.691
has turned itself microscopic.

00:10:13.715 --> 00:10:16.024
So the Solar System
might be teeming with aliens,

00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:17.653
and we're just not noticing them.

00:10:17.677 --> 00:10:20.676
Maybe the very ideas in our heads
are a form of alien life.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.250
Well, okay, that's a crazy thought.

00:10:24.274 --> 00:10:25.599
The aliens made me say it.

00:10:26.445 --> 00:10:30.223
But it is cool that ideas do seem
to have a life all of their own
