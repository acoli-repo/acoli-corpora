00:02:59.968 --> 00:03:02.892
But he and other physicists
now believe in a reality

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:05.099
that is unimaginably bigger still.

00:03:06.002 --> 00:03:08.184
I mean, first of all,
the 100 billion galaxies

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:09.716
within range of our telescopes

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.329
are probably a minuscule
fraction of the total.

00:03:12.353 --> 00:03:16.355
Space itself is expanding
at an accelerating pace.

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.758
The vast majority of the galaxies

00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:22.389
are separating from us so fast
that light from them may never reach us.

00:03:23.257 --> 00:03:25.981
Still, our physical reality here on Earth

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:29.937
is intimately connected
to those distant, invisible galaxies.

00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:32.156
We can think of them
as part of our universe.
