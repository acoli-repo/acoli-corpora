00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.868
I gaze out at all those
mountains and deserts

00:02:02.892 --> 00:02:05.594
and try to get my head
around how vast our Earth is.

00:02:06.608 --> 00:02:09.370
And then I remember
that there's an object we see every day

00:02:09.394 --> 00:02:12.992
that would literally fit
one million Earths inside it:

00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:14.032
the Sun.

00:02:14.056 --> 00:02:15.666
It seems impossibly big.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.150
But in the great scheme
of things, it's a pinprick,

00:02:19.174 --> 00:02:23.118
one of about 400 billion stars
in the Milky Way galaxy,

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:25.194
which you can see on a clear night

00:02:25.218 --> 00:02:27.361
as a pale white mist
stretched across the sky.

00:02:28.511 --> 00:02:29.610
And it gets worse.

00:02:29.634 --> 00:02:32.919
There are maybe 100 billion galaxies
detectable by our telescopes.
