00:06:27.265 --> 00:06:30.265
Well, this is the famous question
asked by Enrico Fermi in 1950:

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:31.767
Where is everybody?

00:06:33.006 --> 00:06:36.820
Conspiracy theorists claim that UFOs
are visiting all the time

00:06:36.844 --> 00:06:38.990
and the reports are just being covered up,

00:06:39.014 --> 00:06:41.858
but honestly, they aren't very convincing.

00:06:41.882 --> 00:06:43.311
But that leaves a real riddle.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.020
In the past year,
the Kepler space observatory

00:06:47.044 --> 00:06:49.925
has found hundreds of planets
just around nearby stars.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.311
And if you extrapolate that data,

00:06:52.335 --> 00:06:55.697
it looks like there could
be half a trillion planets

00:06:55.721 --> 00:06:57.086
just in our own galaxy.

00:06:58.267 --> 00:07:00.354
If any one in 10,000 has conditions
