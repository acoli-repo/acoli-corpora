00:02:29.634 --> 00:02:32.919
There are maybe 100 billion galaxies
detectable by our telescopes.

00:02:33.758 --> 00:02:38.037
So if each star was the size
of a single grain of sand,

00:02:38.061 --> 00:02:40.061
just the Milky Way has enough stars

00:02:40.085 --> 00:02:42.743
to fill a 30-foot by 30-foot
stretch of beach

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:44.608
three feet deep with sand.

00:02:45.903 --> 00:02:48.605
And the entire Earth
doesn't have enough beaches

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.239
to represent the stars
in the overall universe.

00:02:51.263 --> 00:02:54.814
Such a beach would continue for literally
hundreds of millions of miles.

00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:58.976
Holy Stephen Hawking,
that is a lot of stars.

00:02:59.968 --> 00:03:02.892
But he and other physicists
now believe in a reality
