00:07:30.001 --> 00:07:32.545
and started creating technologies,

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:35.809
those technologies would have
had millions of years

00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:37.837
to grow in complexity and power.

00:07:39.166 --> 00:07:40.745
On Earth,

00:07:40.769 --> 00:07:43.640
we've seen how dramatically
technology can accelerate

00:07:43.664 --> 00:07:45.025
in just 100 years.

00:07:46.407 --> 00:07:49.976
In millions of years,
an intelligent alien civilization

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.707
could easily have spread out
across the galaxy,

00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:56.114
perhaps creating giant
energy-harvesting artifacts

00:07:56.138 --> 00:07:58.539
or fleets of colonizing spaceships

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:01.739
or glorious works of art
that fill the night sky.
