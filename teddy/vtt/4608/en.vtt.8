and might flash in and out
of existence in a nanosecond.

00:04:01.085 --> 00:04:04.560
But nonetheless, combined,
they make up a vast multiverse

00:04:04.584 --> 00:04:07.622
of possible universes
in up to 11 dimensions,

00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:11.380
featuring wonders
beyond our wildest imagination.

00:04:12.206 --> 00:04:15.079
The leading version of string theory
predicts a multiverse

00:04:15.103 --> 00:04:16.976
made up of 10 to the 500 universes.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.869
That's a one followed by 500 zeros,

00:04:20.892 --> 00:04:23.294
a number so vast that if every atom

00:04:23.318 --> 00:04:27.424
in our observable universe
had its own universe,

00:04:27.448 --> 00:04:29.877
and all of the atoms
in all those universes each had

00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:31.884
their own universe,
