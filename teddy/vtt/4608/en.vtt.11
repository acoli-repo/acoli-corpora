00:05:28.515 --> 00:05:32.567
and marry the person of your dreams,
and in another, not so much.

00:05:33.293 --> 00:05:36.277
Well, there are still some scientists
who would say, hogwash.

00:05:36.301 --> 00:05:40.206
The only meaningful answer to the question
of how many universes there are is one.

00:05:40.822 --> 00:05:41.976
Only one universe.

00:05:42.678 --> 00:05:45.876
And a few philosophers
and mystics might argue

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.549
that even our own universe is an illusion.

00:05:49.672 --> 00:05:51.053
So, as you can see, right now

00:05:51.077 --> 00:05:54.748
there is no agreement
on this question, not even close.

00:05:54.772 --> 00:05:58.259
All we know is the answer is somewhere
between zero and infinity.

00:05:59.173 --> 00:06:01.147
Well, I guess we know one other thing.
