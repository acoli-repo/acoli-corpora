00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:31.884
their own universe,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.322
and you repeated that for two more cycles,

00:04:34.346 --> 00:04:37.747
you'd still be at a tiny
fraction of the total,

00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:41.248
namely, one trillion trillion trillion
trillion trillion trillion trillion

00:04:41.272 --> 00:04:46.008
trillion trillion trillion trillion
trillion trillion trillion trillionth.

00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:47.734
(Laughter)

00:04:47.758 --> 00:04:52.223
But even that number
is minuscule compared to another number:

00:04:53.012 --> 00:04:54.020
infinity.

00:04:54.488 --> 00:04:57.679
Some physicists think the space-time
continuum is literally infinite

00:04:57.703 --> 00:05:01.080
and that it contains an infinite number
of so-called pocket universes
