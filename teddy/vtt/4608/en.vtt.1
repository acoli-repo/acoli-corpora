because they're unknown.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.638
I used to puzzle about a lot of things
as a boy, for example:

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:39.077
What would it feel like to be a dog?

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:40.976
Do fish feel pain?

00:00:41.412 --> 00:00:42.862
How about insects?

00:00:43.784 --> 00:00:46.648
Was the Big Bang just an accident?

00:00:47.607 --> 00:00:48.976
And is there a God?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.533
And if so, how are we so sure
that it's a He and not a She?

00:00:53.557 --> 00:00:56.742
Why do so many innocent people
and animals suffer terrible things?

00:00:57.544 --> 00:00:59.464
Is there really a plan for my life?
