00:01:00.596 --> 00:01:02.347
Is the future yet to be written,

00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:05.764
or is it already written
and we just can't see it?

00:01:05.788 --> 00:01:08.732
But then, do I have free will?
I mean, who am I anyway?

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:10.280
Am I just a biological machine?

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.656
But then, why am I conscious?
What is consciousness?

00:01:15.768 --> 00:01:17.705
Will robots become conscious one day?

00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:21.697
I mean, I kind of assumed that some day

00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:24.377
I would be told the answers
to all these questions.

00:01:25.557 --> 00:01:27.401
Someone must know, right?

00:01:28.517 --> 00:01:30.826
Guess what? No one knows.
