00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:32.156
We can think of them
as part of our universe.

00:03:32.744 --> 00:03:34.976
They make up a single, giant edifice

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.460
obeying the same physical laws
and all made from the same types of atoms,

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:42.021
electrons, protons, quarks, neutrinos,
that make up you and me.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.969
However, recent theories in physics,
including one called string theory,

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:49.976
are now telling us there could be
countless other universes

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.976
built on different types of particles,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.381
with different properties,
obeying different laws.

00:03:54.928 --> 00:03:57.436
Most of these universes
could never support life,

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.436
and might flash in and out
of existence in a nanosecond.
