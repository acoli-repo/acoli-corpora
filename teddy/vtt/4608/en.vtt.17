because it's paranoid
of any potential competitors.

00:08:32.926 --> 00:08:35.827
It's just sitting there
ready to obliterate

00:08:35.851 --> 00:08:37.568
anything that becomes a threat.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.976
Or maybe they're not that intelligent,

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.951
or perhaps the evolution
of an intelligence

00:08:44.975 --> 00:08:47.023
capable of creating
sophisticated technology

00:08:47.047 --> 00:08:49.017
is far rarer than we've assumed.

00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:53.824
After all, it's only happened once
on Earth in four billion years.

00:08:53.848 --> 00:08:55.976
Maybe even that was incredibly lucky.

00:08:56.452 --> 00:08:59.579
Maybe we are the first
such civilization in our galaxy.
