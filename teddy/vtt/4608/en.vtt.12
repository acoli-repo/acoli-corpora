Well, I guess we know one other thing.

00:06:01.782 --> 00:06:04.976
This is a pretty cool time
to be studying physics.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.653
We just might be undergoing
the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge

00:06:08.677 --> 00:06:10.488
that humanity has ever seen.

00:06:10.512 --> 00:06:13.211

[Why can't we see evidence of alien life?]

00:06:17.704 --> 00:06:20.853
Somewhere out there in that vast universe

00:06:20.877 --> 00:06:23.937
there must surely be countless
other planets teeming with life.

00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:25.976
But why don't we see any evidence of it?

00:06:27.265 --> 00:06:30.265
Well, this is the famous question
asked by Enrico Fermi in 1950:
