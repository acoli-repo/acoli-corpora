00:10:26.445 --> 00:10:30.223
But it is cool that ideas do seem
to have a life all of their own

00:10:30.247 --> 00:10:32.718
and that they outlive their creators.

00:10:33.724 --> 00:10:37.047
Maybe biological life
is just a passing phase.

00:10:39.459 --> 00:10:40.976
Well, within the next 15 years,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.976
we could start seeing
real spectroscopic information

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.810
from promising nearby planets

00:10:45.834 --> 00:10:48.370
that will reveal just
how life-friendly they might be.

00:10:48.394 --> 00:10:51.976
And meanwhile, SETI, the Search
for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.976
is now releasing its data to the public

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.976
so that millions of citizen scientists,
maybe including you,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.477
can bring the power of the crowd
to join the search.
