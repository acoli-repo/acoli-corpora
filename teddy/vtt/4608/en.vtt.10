00:04:57.703 --> 00:05:01.080
and that it contains an infinite number
of so-called pocket universes

00:05:01.104 --> 00:05:02.247
with varying properties.

00:05:03.107 --> 00:05:04.236
How's your brain doing?

00:05:05.061 --> 00:05:06.976
Quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.652
I mean, the theory's been proven
true beyond all doubt,

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:11.885
but interpreting it is baffling,

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.006
and some physicists think
you can only un-baffle it

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.632
if you imagine that huge numbers
of parallel universes

00:05:17.656 --> 00:05:20.237
are being spawned every moment,

00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:23.785
and many of these universes would actually
be very like the world we're in,

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:25.961
would include multiple copies of you.

00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:28.491
In one such universe,
you'd graduate with honors

00:05:28.515 --> 00:05:32.567
and marry the person of your dreams,
and in another, not so much.
