More importantly, thanks to the presence 
of human aesthetic in the process,

00:04:00.246 --> 00:04:09.327
we'll theoretically generate melodies
we would consider beautiful.

00:04:09.327 --> 00:04:13.567
But does this satisfy our intuition
for what is truly creative?

00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:16.111
Is it enough to make something
original and beautiful,

00:04:16.111 --> 00:04:22.397
or does creativity require intention
and awareness of what is being created?

00:04:22.397 --> 00:04:26.193
Perhaps the creativity in this case
is really coming from the programmers,

00:04:26.193 --> 00:04:29.018
even if they don't understand the process.

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:31.204
What is human creativity, anyways?
