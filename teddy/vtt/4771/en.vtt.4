00:01:56.248 --> 00:02:01.221
and tried to model a natural process
that allows creativity to form?

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.473
We happen to know of at least
one such process

00:02:03.473 --> 00:02:07.995
that has lead to original, valuable,
and even beautiful outcomes:

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:10.783
the process of evolution.

00:02:10.783 --> 00:02:12.981
And evolutionary algorithms,

00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:16.240
or genetic algorithms
that mimic biological evolution,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.543
are one promising approach

00:02:18.543 --> 00:02:24.563
to making machines generate original
and valuable artistic outcomes.

00:02:24.563 --> 00:02:27.554
So how can evolution make 
a machine musically creative?

00:02:27.554 --> 00:02:29.665
Well, instead of organisms,

00:02:29.665 --> 00:02:41.378
we can start with an initial
population of musical phrases,
