00:02:55.051 --> 00:03:00.005
we can apply selection using 
an operation called a fitness function.

00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:04.307
Just as biological fitness is determined
by external environmental pressures,

00:03:04.307 --> 00:03:08.464
our fitness function can be determined
by an external melody

00:03:08.464 --> 00:03:11.310
chosen by human musicians, or music fans,


00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:20.115
to represent the ultimate 
beautiful melody.

00:03:20.115 --> 00:03:23.301
The algorithm can then compare
between our musical phrases

00:03:23.301 --> 00:03:25.098
and that beautiful melody,

00:03:25.098 --> 00:03:28.951
and select only the phrases
that are most similar to it.

00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:31.969
Once the least similar sequences
are weeded out,
