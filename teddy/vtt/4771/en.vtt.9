00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:31.204
What is human creativity, anyways?

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:34.039
Is it something more than a system
of interconnected neurons

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.182
developed by biological 
algorithmic processes

00:04:37.182 --> 00:04:40.615
and the random experiences 
that shape our lives?

00:04:40.615 --> 00:04:44.152
Order and chaos,
machine and human.

00:04:44.152 --> 00:04:48.268
These are the dynamos at the heart
of machine creativity initiatives

00:04:48.268 --> 00:04:54.270
that are currently making music, 
sculptures, paintings, poetry and more.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.747
The jury may still be out

00:04:55.747 --> 00:05:00.051
as to whether it's fair to call 
these acts of creation creative.
