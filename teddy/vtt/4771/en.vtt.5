00:02:29.665 --> 00:02:41.378
we can start with an initial
population of musical phrases,

00:02:41.378 --> 00:02:42.841
and a basic algorithm

00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:45.765
that mimics reproduction 
and random mutations

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.177
by switching some parts,

00:02:48.177 --> 00:02:49.939
combining others,

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.353
and replacing random notes.

00:02:52.353 --> 00:02:55.051
Now that we have 
a new generation of phrases,

00:02:55.051 --> 00:03:00.005
we can apply selection using 
an operation called a fitness function.
