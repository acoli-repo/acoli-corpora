00:00:57.392 --> 00:01:03.814
The Lovelace Test, formalized in 2001,
proposes a way of scrutinizing this idea.

00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:07.256
A machine can pass this test
if it can produce an outcome

00:01:07.256 --> 00:01:12.260
that its designers cannot explain 
based on their original code.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.609
The Lovelace Test is, by design,
more of a thought experiment

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:18.020
than an objective scientific test.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.039
But it's a place to start.

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.233
At first glance,

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:25.153
the idea of a machine creating 
high quality, original music in this way

00:01:25.153 --> 00:01:27.308
might seem impossible.

00:01:27.308 --> 00:01:30.202
We could come up with an extremely
complex algorithm
