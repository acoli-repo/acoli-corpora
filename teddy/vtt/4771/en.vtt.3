00:01:27.308 --> 00:01:30.202
We could come up with an extremely
complex algorithm

00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:34.343
using random number generators,
chaotic functions, and fuzzy logic

00:01:34.343 --> 00:01:36.802
to generate a sequence of musical notes

00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:39.476
in a way that would be 
impossible to track.

00:01:39.476 --> 00:01:43.271
But although this would yield countless
original melodies never heard before,

00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:47.214
only a tiny fraction of them
would be worth listening to.

00:01:47.214 --> 00:01:49.551
With the computer having no way
to distinguish

00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:51.974
between those which
we would consider beautiful

00:01:51.974 --> 00:01:54.611
and those which we won't.

00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:56.248
But what if we took a step back

00:01:56.248 --> 00:02:01.221
and tried to model a natural process
that allows creativity to form?
