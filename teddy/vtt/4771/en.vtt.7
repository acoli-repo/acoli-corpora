00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:31.969
Once the least similar sequences
are weeded out,

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:36.498
the algorithm can reapply mutation
and recombination to what's left,

00:03:36.498 --> 00:03:40.802
select the most similar, or fitted ones,
again from the new generation,

00:03:40.802 --> 00:03:48.412
and repeat for many generations.

00:03:48.412 --> 00:03:52.728
The process that got us there has so much
randomness and complexity built in

00:03:52.728 --> 00:03:56.298
that the result might 
pass the Lovelace Test.

00:03:56.298 --> 00:04:00.246
More importantly, thanks to the presence 
of human aesthetic in the process,
