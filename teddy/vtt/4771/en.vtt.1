00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:32.832
for over 170 years.

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:35.840
In 1843, Lady Ada Lovelace,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.149
an English mathematician considered
the world's first computer programmer,

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.577
wrote that a machine could not have
human-like intelligence

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:49.007
as long as it only did what humans
intentionally programmed it to do.

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:50.709
According to Lovelace,

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:53.694
a machine must be able 
to create original ideas

00:00:53.694 --> 00:00:57.392
if it is to be considered intelligent.

00:00:57.392 --> 00:01:03.814
The Lovelace Test, formalized in 2001,
proposes a way of scrutinizing this idea.
