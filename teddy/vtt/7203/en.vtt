So, human relationships with animals
can be pretty weird.

00:00:05.756 --> 00:00:08.836
We put them in categories
based on how we see them.

00:00:08.836 --> 00:00:11.636
So there's pets and they're, like,
members of the family.

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:13.516
And then there's farm animals

00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:17.436
and they're often very similar to pets
in terms of their cognitive abilities

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:19.356
and their emotional abilities.

00:00:19.356 --> 00:00:20.916
But of course, we eat them.

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:23.756
And then there's wild animals.

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:27.876
And I've been wondering
what wild animals even are anymore.

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:31.756
Like, you can get a degree
in wildlife management,
