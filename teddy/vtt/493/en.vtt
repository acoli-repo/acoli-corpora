00:00:01.722 --> 00:00:04.656
When I was a kid,
I was afraid of the dark.

00:00:06.032 --> 00:00:08.632
The darkness is where the monsters are.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.724
And I had this little night light
outside of my bedroom

00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:16.416
so that it would never get too dark.

00:00:17.973 --> 00:00:22.838
But over time, my fear of the dark
turned to curiosity.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.348
What is out there in the "dark-dark?"

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.777
And it turns out

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:34.427
that trying to understand the darkness
is something that's fascinated humans
