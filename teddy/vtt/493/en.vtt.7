It seems like the universe
is just infinite, which it is,

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:37.356
but the observable universe is finite.

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.155
Which means we can win the battle.

00:03:42.402 --> 00:03:44.408
But if you're going to map the universe,

00:03:45.283 --> 00:03:48.054
you're not going to do it
with one or two of your besties.

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.187
Mapping the universe takes an army,

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.434
an army of curious, creative, craftspeople

00:03:55.458 --> 00:03:58.863
who, working together,
can accomplish the extraordinary.
