We think that the Milky Way,
and all the Milky Ways,

00:07:06.858 --> 00:07:09.498
have this really disturbing past

00:07:09.522 --> 00:07:12.773
of literally blowing themselves apart.

00:07:13.597 --> 00:07:17.177
It's like every average guy you know

00:07:17.201 --> 00:07:19.922
has a history as a punk rock teenager.

00:07:20.582 --> 00:07:21.915
That's very bizarre.

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:26.775
Stars are blowing up in these systems,

00:07:26.799 --> 00:07:28.783
black holes are growing at their centers

00:07:28.807 --> 00:07:31.363
and emitting a tremendous
amount of energy.
