00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:03.032
You never get 250 billion jelly beans
in your hand. You know?

00:05:05.543 --> 00:05:08.765
We're nowhere near mapping
all of those stars yet.

00:05:09.345 --> 00:05:11.767
So we have to choose
the most interesting ones.

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:16.979
In SDSS-V, we're mapping six million stars

00:05:17.003 --> 00:05:19.089
where we think we can measure their age.

00:05:19.662 --> 00:05:21.836
Because if you can measure
the age of a star,

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.641
that's like having six million clocks
spread all throughout the Milky Way.

00:05:25.665 --> 00:05:27.103
And with that information,

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:31.747
we can unravel the history
and fossil record of our galaxy
