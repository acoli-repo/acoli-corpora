She was able to do this

00:11:00.195 --> 00:11:04.720
because SDSS, since its beginning
and by mandate from the Sloan Foundation,

00:11:04.744 --> 00:11:07.379
has made its data both publicly available

00:11:07.403 --> 00:11:11.196
and usable to a broad range of audiences.

00:11:11.792 --> 00:11:14.537
She's a citizen -- yeah, clap for that.

00:11:14.561 --> 00:11:15.712
Clap for that.

00:11:15.736 --> 00:11:18.982
(Applause)

00:11:19.006 --> 00:11:20.538
Hanny is a citizen scientist,

00:11:20.562 --> 00:11:22.346
or as I like to call them,

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.653
"citizen warriors."

00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:30.585
And she shows that you don't have to be
a fancy astrophysicist to participate.
