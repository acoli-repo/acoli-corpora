00:04:28.464 --> 00:04:30.339
and one for the galaxies.

00:04:30.363 --> 00:04:32.641
My survey has two hemispheres,

00:04:32.665 --> 00:04:36.966
five telescopes, or 11,
depending on how you count,

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.549
10 spectrographs

00:04:38.573 --> 00:04:40.323
and millions of objects.

00:04:40.347 --> 00:04:41.732
It's a monster.

00:04:41.756 --> 00:04:43.321
So let's go through the mappers.

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:51.803
The Milky Way galaxy has 250 billion
plus or minus a few hundred billion stars.

00:04:53.497 --> 00:04:55.934
That is not a number
that you hold in your head.

00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.299
That is a number that doesn't
make practical sense

00:04:58.323 --> 00:04:59.608
to pretty much anybody.

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:03.032
You never get 250 billion jelly beans
in your hand. You know?
