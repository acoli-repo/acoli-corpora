00:06:27.574 --> 00:06:33.352
it's emitting lots of X-rays
and optical and UV and radio waves.

00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:36.387
We can actually learn
how these objects grow.

00:06:36.956 --> 00:06:42.498
And in SDSS, we're looking at over
half a million supermassive black holes,

00:06:42.522 --> 00:06:44.988
to try to understand how they formed.

00:06:46.022 --> 00:06:47.267
Like I said,

00:06:48.109 --> 00:06:51.087
we live in the Milky Way,
you guys are all familiar with that.

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:55.660
The Milky Way is a completely
average galaxy.

00:06:56.605 --> 00:06:58.138
Nothing funny going on.

00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:00.792
But it's ours, which is great.
