00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:02.948
you would spend over 30 years,

00:03:02.972 --> 00:03:06.511
you would map 1,000 stars
extremely precisely.

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:09.202
You would move
the front line to the battle.

00:03:09.552 --> 00:03:13.514
And that's what Tycho Brahe
and his buddy, or his assistant, really,

00:03:13.538 --> 00:03:16.307
Johannes Kepler did back in the 1600s.

00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:18.601
And they moved the line,

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:20.451
figured out how planets worked,

00:03:20.475 --> 00:03:22.229
how they moved around the Sun.

00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:25.784
But it wasn't until about 100 years ago

00:03:25.808 --> 00:03:28.079
that we realized

00:03:28.103 --> 00:03:29.471
it's a big universe.
