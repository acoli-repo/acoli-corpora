00:07:59.966 --> 00:08:02.950
hosts the two-and-a-half-meter
telescope, the du Pont.

00:08:03.734 --> 00:08:06.337
Two and a half meters
is the size of our mirror,

00:08:06.361 --> 00:08:08.388
which was huge for Tycho and Kepler.

00:08:08.412 --> 00:08:10.226
But it's actually not so big today.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.647
There are way bigger telescopes out there.

00:08:12.671 --> 00:08:17.803
But in SDSS we use new instruments
on these old telescopes

00:08:17.827 --> 00:08:19.494
to make them interesting.

00:08:20.422 --> 00:08:25.085
We capture light from all
of those objects into our aperture,

00:08:25.109 --> 00:08:28.037
and that light is then focused
at the focal plane,

00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:30.403
where our instruments sit
and process that light.
