00:13:00.109 --> 00:13:02.863
You can see SDSS kick in around Y2K.

00:13:03.921 --> 00:13:06.501
If we stay on this line,

00:13:06.525 --> 00:13:12.430
we will map every large galaxy
in the observable universe by 2060.

00:13:13.406 --> 00:13:14.760
Think about that.

00:13:14.784 --> 00:13:18.910
Think about it: we've gone
from arranging clamshells

00:13:18.934 --> 00:13:23.021
to general relativity to SDSS
in a few thousand years --

00:13:23.045 --> 00:13:25.355
and if we hang on 40 more,

00:13:27.077 --> 00:13:29.140
we can map all the galaxies.

00:13:29.859 --> 00:13:31.709
But we have to stay on the line.
