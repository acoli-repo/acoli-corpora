Understanding the universe is battle.

00:02:02.728 --> 00:02:06.101
It is unrelenting, it is time-varying,

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.592
and it is one we are all in together.

00:02:09.292 --> 00:02:13.656
It is a battle in the darkness
against the darkness.

00:02:14.853 --> 00:02:18.472
Which is why Orion has weapons.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.323
In any case, if you're
going to engage in this battle,

00:02:25.347 --> 00:02:27.260
you need to know the battlefield.

00:02:27.284 --> 00:02:28.482

00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:31.172
mapping the sky involves
three essential elements.
