And she shows that you don't have to be
a fancy astrophysicist to participate.

00:11:31.037 --> 00:11:32.712
You just have to be curious.

00:11:34.425 --> 00:11:35.999
A few years ago,

00:11:36.023 --> 00:11:39.355
my four-year-old asked,
"Can moons have moons?"

00:11:39.989 --> 00:11:41.958
And I set about to answer this question

00:11:41.982 --> 00:11:45.569
because even though many
four-year-olds over all of time

00:11:45.593 --> 00:11:47.606
have probably asked this question,

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.395
many experts, including myself,
didn't know the answer.

00:11:52.157 --> 00:11:56.005
These are the moons in our solar system
that can host hypothetical submoons.

00:11:56.491 --> 00:12:00.506
And that just goes to show you
that there are so many basic questions
