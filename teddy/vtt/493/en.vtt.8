00:04:00.476 --> 00:04:02.302
I lead this army of creatives,

00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:06.225
in the fifth generation
of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, SDSS.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.125
And this is how astronomers have managed
to shepherd individual curiosity

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:13.260
through its industrial age,

00:04:13.284 --> 00:04:16.641
preserving the individual ability
to make discoveries

00:04:16.665 --> 00:04:20.551
but putting into place mega machinery
to truly advance the frontier.

00:04:21.822 --> 00:04:24.885
In SDSS, we divide the sky
into three mappers:

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:28.440
one for the stars, one for the black holes

00:04:28.464 --> 00:04:30.339
and one for the galaxies.
