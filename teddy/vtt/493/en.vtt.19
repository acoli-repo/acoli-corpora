00:09:30.475 --> 00:09:31.625
One more thing.

00:09:32.966 --> 00:09:35.427
Stars are exploding all the time,

00:09:35.451 --> 00:09:39.169
like this one did back in 1987
in our cosmic backyard.

00:09:41.427 --> 00:09:44.792
Black holes are growing all the time.

00:09:47.088 --> 00:09:50.596
There is a new sky every night.

00:09:51.438 --> 00:09:54.771
Which means we can't just
map the sky one time.

00:09:54.795 --> 00:09:57.329
We have to map the sky multiple times.

00:09:58.782 --> 00:10:03.011
So in SDSS-V, we're going back
to each part of the sky multiple times
