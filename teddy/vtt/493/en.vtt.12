00:05:58.576 --> 00:06:00.680
And it's not just like a basketball

00:06:00.704 --> 00:06:04.434
that you smoosh down into a little point
and it's super dense and that's weird.

00:06:04.458 --> 00:06:07.125
No, smooshed basketballs have a surface.

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:10.529
These things don't have surfaces,
and we know that now.

00:06:11.228 --> 00:06:12.902
Because we've seen it.

00:06:12.926 --> 00:06:14.298
Or the lack of it.

00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:17.617
What's really interesting
about black holes

00:06:17.641 --> 00:06:21.247
is that we can learn a lot about them
by studying the material

00:06:21.271 --> 00:06:26.074
just as it passes through that point
of no information return.

00:06:26.098 --> 00:06:27.550
Because at that point,

00:06:27.574 --> 00:06:33.352
it's emitting lots of X-rays
and optical and UV and radio waves.
