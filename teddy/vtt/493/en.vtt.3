00:01:29.553 --> 00:01:31.409
But in any case, the point is clear:

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.837
astronomers have been
mapping the sky for a long time.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.640
Why?

00:01:38.227 --> 00:01:43.625
It's our calling card
as a species in the galaxy

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.608
to figure things out.

00:01:46.203 --> 00:01:48.339
We know our planet,

00:01:48.363 --> 00:01:49.964
we cure our diseases,

00:01:49.988 --> 00:01:51.728
we cook our food,

00:01:51.752 --> 00:01:53.577
we leave our planet.

00:01:56.426 --> 00:01:57.626
But it's not easy.

00:01:59.037 --> 00:02:01.902
Understanding the universe is battle.
