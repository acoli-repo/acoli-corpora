00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:31.172
mapping the sky involves
three essential elements.

00:02:31.196 --> 00:02:34.383
You've got objects
that are giving off light,

00:02:34.407 --> 00:02:37.748
you've got telescopes
that are collecting that light,

00:02:37.772 --> 00:02:39.208
and you've got instruments

00:02:39.232 --> 00:02:42.172
that are helping you understand
what that light is.

00:02:42.196 --> 00:02:45.565
Many of you have mapped
the Moon phases over time

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:50.109

And you've understood
what that means with your brains,

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:55.482
your brains being one
of your more basic instruments.

00:02:55.506 --> 00:02:57.453
Now, if you and a buddy get together,

00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:02.948
you would spend over 30 years,
