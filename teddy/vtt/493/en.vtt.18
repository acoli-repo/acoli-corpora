00:08:59.634 --> 00:09:01.029
I have 1,000 of these,

00:09:01.053 --> 00:09:04.350
500 in the focal plane
of each telescope in each hemisphere.

00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:07.939
And this is how they move on the sky.

00:09:08.411 --> 00:09:10.698
So these are our objects and a star field,

00:09:10.722 --> 00:09:12.897
so you've got stars,
galaxies, black holes.

00:09:12.921 --> 00:09:17.873
And our robots move to those objects
as we pass over them

00:09:17.897 --> 00:09:19.482
in order to capture the light

00:09:19.506 --> 00:09:23.387
from those stars and galaxies
and black holes, and yes,

00:09:23.411 --> 00:09:25.625
it is weird to capture black hole light,

00:09:25.649 --> 00:09:28.608
but we've already gone over
that black holes are weird.
