00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:02.783
I'm a lifelong traveler.

00:00:02.783 --> 00:00:04.442
Even as a little kid,

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:07.922
I was actually working out
that it would be cheaper

00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:10.048
to go to boarding school in England

00:00:10.048 --> 00:00:15.168
than just to the best school down the road
from my parents' house in California.

00:00:15.168 --> 00:00:18.547
So, from the time I was nine years old

00:00:18.547 --> 00:00:21.775
I was flying alone several times a year

00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:25.241
over the North Pole, just to go to school.

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:28.876
And of course the more I flew
the more I came to love to fly,

00:00:28.884 --> 00:00:32.150
so the very week after I graduated
from high school,
