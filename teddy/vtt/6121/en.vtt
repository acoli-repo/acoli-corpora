00:00:00.282 --> 00:00:03.936
So, I had graduated
seven years ago from Berkeley

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.522
with a dual degree in molecular
and cell biology and linguistics,

00:00:08.546 --> 00:00:11.475
and I had gone to a career fair
here on campus,

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:14.950
where I'd gotten an interview
with a start-up called Theranos.

00:00:15.788 --> 00:00:16.939
And at the time,

00:00:16.963 --> 00:00:19.939
there wasn't really that much
information about the company,

00:00:19.963 --> 00:00:24.033
but the little that was there
was really impressive.

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:28.144
Essentially, what the company
was doing was creating a medical device

00:00:28.168 --> 00:00:32.558
where you would be able
to run your entire blood panel
