00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I was basically concerned about what was going on in the world.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I couldn't understand

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the starvation, the destruction,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
the killing of innocent people.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Making sense of those things

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is a very difficult thing to do.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And when I was 12, I became an actor.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I was bottom of the class. I haven't got any qualifications.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I was told I was dyslexic.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In fact, I have got qualifications.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I got a D in pottery, which was the one thing that I did get --

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which was useful, obviously.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And so concern
