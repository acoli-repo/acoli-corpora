00:04:23.136 --> 00:04:31.334
and together, they asked 17,500 adults
about their history of exposure

00:04:31.334 --> 00:04:36.051
to what they called "adverse 
childhood experiences," or ACEs.

00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:40.838
Those include physical, emotional,
or sexual abuse;

00:04:40.838 --> 00:04:44.764
physical or emotional neglect;

00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:47.858
parental mental illness,
substance dependence, incarceration;

00:04:47.858 --> 00:04:50.637
parental separation or divorce;

00:04:50.637 --> 00:04:53.172
or domestic violence.

00:04:53.172 --> 00:04:57.608
For every yes, you would get
a point on your ACE score.

00:04:57.608 --> 00:04:59.116
And then what they did

00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:04.366
was they correlated these ACE scores
against health outcomes.
