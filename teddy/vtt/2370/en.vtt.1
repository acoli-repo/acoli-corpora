Folks who are exposed in very high doses

00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:34.292
have triple the lifetime risk
of heart disease and lung cancer

00:00:34.292 --> 00:00:38.951
and a 20-year difference
in life expectancy.

00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:45.593
And yet, doctors today are not trained
in routine screening or treatment.

00:00:46.203 --> 00:00:51.558
Now, the exposure I'm talking about is
not a pesticide or a packaging chemical.

00:00:51.558 --> 00:00:53.988
It's childhood trauma.

00:00:54.968 --> 00:00:57.686
Okay. What kind of trauma
am I talking about here?

00:00:57.686 --> 00:01:01.995
I'm not talking about failing a test
or losing a basketball game.
