or as a mental health problem --

00:01:34.088 --> 00:01:39.776
And then something happened
to make me rethink my entire approach.

00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:41.648
When I finished my residency,

00:01:41.648 --> 00:01:45.372
I wanted to go someplace
where I felt really needed,

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:48.530
someplace where I could make a difference.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.646
So I came to work for
California Pacific Medical Center,

00:01:51.646 --> 00:01:55.472
one of the best private hospitals
in Northern California,

00:01:55.472 --> 00:02:00.000
and together, we opened a clinic
in Bayview-Hunters Point,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.733
one of the poorest, most underserved
neighborhoods in San Francisco.
