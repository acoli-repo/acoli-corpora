00:00:00.653 --> 00:00:02.265
In the mid-'90s,

00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:04.872
the CDC and Kaiser Permanente


00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:08.992
discovered an exposure
that dramatically increased the risk

00:00:08.992 --> 00:00:14.413
for seven out of 10 of the leading
causes of death in the United States.

00:00:14.953 --> 00:00:18.344
In high doses, it affects
brain development,

00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:22.011
the immune system, hormonal systems,

00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:26.684
and even the way our DNA
is read and transcribed.

00:00:26.684 --> 00:00:30.205
Folks who are exposed in very high doses
