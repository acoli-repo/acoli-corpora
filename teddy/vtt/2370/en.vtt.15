00:07:27.296 --> 00:07:30.593
are more likely to engage
in high-risk behavior,

00:07:30.593 --> 00:07:32.497
and that's important to know.

00:07:32.497 --> 00:07:38.116
But it turns out that even if you don't
engage in any high-risk behavior,

00:07:38.116 --> 00:07:43.257
you're still more likely
to develop heart disease or cancer.

00:07:44.101 --> 00:07:50.026
The reason for this has to do with
the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis,

00:07:50.027 --> 00:07:53.696
the brain's and body's
stress response system

00:07:53.696 --> 00:07:57.476
that governs our fight-or-flight response.

00:07:57.476 --> 00:07:59.431
How does it work?

00:07:59.431 --> 00:08:03.169
Well, imagine you're walking
in the forest and you see a bear.
