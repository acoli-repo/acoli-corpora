I'm not talking about failing a test
or losing a basketball game.

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:06.736
I am talking about threats
that are so severe or pervasive

00:01:06.736 --> 00:01:11.333
that they literally get under our skin
and change our physiology:

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.725
things like abuse or neglect,

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:17.495
or growing up with a parent 
who struggles with mental illness

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:19.477
or substance dependence.

00:01:19.887 --> 00:01:21.444
Now, for a long time,

00:01:21.444 --> 00:01:24.441
I viewed these things in the way 
I was trained to view them,

00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:28.533
either as a social problem --
refer to social services --

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:33.116
or as a mental health problem --
refer to mental health services.
