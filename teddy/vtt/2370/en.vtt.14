00:06:57.505 --> 00:07:00.036
the pleasure and reward
center of the brain

00:07:00.036 --> 00:07:02.682
that is implicated
in substance dependence.

00:07:02.682 --> 00:07:05.404
It inhibits the prefrontal cortex,

00:07:05.404 --> 00:07:09.461
which is necessary for impulse control
and executive function,

00:07:09.461 --> 00:07:11.528
a critical area for learning.

00:07:11.528 --> 00:07:13.216
And on MRI scans,

00:07:13.216 --> 00:07:17.204
we see measurable differences
in the amygdala,

00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:19.846
the brain's fear response center.

00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:23.766
So there are real neurologic reasons

00:07:23.766 --> 00:07:27.296
why folks exposed
to high doses of adversity

00:07:27.296 --> 00:07:30.593
are more likely to engage
in high-risk behavior,
