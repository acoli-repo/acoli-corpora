00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:31.794
then we can begin to use the right 
tool kit to come up with solutions.

00:12:31.794 --> 00:12:35.522
From tobacco to lead poisoning 
to HIV/AIDS,

00:12:35.522 --> 00:12:40.535
the United States actually has
quite a strong track record

00:12:40.535 --> 00:12:43.439
with addressing public health problems,

00:12:43.439 --> 00:12:48.942
but replicating those successes
with ACEs and toxic stress

00:12:48.942 --> 00:12:53.539
is going to take determination
and commitment,

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:57.511
and when I look at what
our nation's response has been so far,

00:12:57.511 --> 00:12:59.355
I wonder,

00:12:59.355 --> 00:13:03.154
why haven't we taken this more seriously?
