00:12:59.355 --> 00:13:03.154
why haven't we taken this more seriously?

00:13:03.154 --> 00:13:06.976
You know, at first I thought
that we marginalized the issue

00:13:06.976 --> 00:13:08.900
because it doesn't apply to us.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.198
That's an issue for those kids
in those neighborhoods.

00:13:12.198 --> 00:13:16.387
Which is weird, because the data
doesn't bear that out.

00:13:16.387 --> 00:13:20.520
The original ACEs study
was done in a population

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.307
that was 70 percent Caucasian,

00:13:23.307 --> 00:13:26.465
70 percent college-educated.

00:13:26.465 --> 00:13:29.947
But then, the more I talked to folks,

00:13:29.947 --> 00:13:34.454
I'm beginning to think that maybe
I had it completely backwards.
