in a way that recognizes that they may
need more aggressive treatment,

00:11:01.344 --> 00:11:05.771
given the changes to their hormonal
and immune systems.

00:11:05.771 --> 00:11:09.863
So the other thing that happens
when you understand this science

00:11:09.863 --> 00:11:12.861
is that you want to shout it
from the rooftops,

00:11:12.861 --> 00:11:17.191
because this isn't just an issue
for kids in Bayview.

00:11:17.191 --> 00:11:20.825
I figured the minute
that everybody else heard about this,

00:11:20.825 --> 00:11:24.308
it would be routine screening,
multi-disciplinary treatment teams,

00:11:24.308 --> 00:11:29.105
and it would be a race to the most
effective clinical treatment protocols.

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:33.225
Yeah. That did not happen.
