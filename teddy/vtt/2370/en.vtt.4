00:01:55.472 --> 00:02:00.000
and together, we opened a clinic
in Bayview-Hunters Point,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.733
one of the poorest, most underserved
neighborhoods in San Francisco.

00:02:04.263 --> 00:02:06.118
Now, prior to that point,

00:02:06.118 --> 00:02:08.980
there had been only
one pediatrician in all of Bayview

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.423
to serve more than 10,000 children,

00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:17.072
so we hung a shingle, and we were able
to provide top-quality care

00:02:17.072 --> 00:02:19.057
regardless of ability to pay.

00:02:19.057 --> 00:02:23.219
It was so cool. We targeted
the typical health disparities:

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:28.026
access to care, immunization rates,
asthma hospitalization rates,

00:02:28.026 --> 00:02:30.183
and we hit all of our numbers.
