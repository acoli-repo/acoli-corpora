Most of the kids I was seeing
had experienced such severe trauma

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:04.224
that it felt like something else
was going on.

00:03:04.224 --> 00:03:08.206
Somehow I was missing something important.

00:03:09.516 --> 00:03:13.317
Now, before I did my residency,
I did a master's degree in public health,

00:03:13.317 --> 00:03:16.410
and one of the things that they teach you
in public health school

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.295
is that if you're a doctor

00:03:18.295 --> 00:03:22.079
and you see 100 kids
that all drink from the same well,

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.477
and 98 of them develop diarrhea,

00:03:25.477 --> 00:03:27.763
you can go ahead
and write that prescription

00:03:27.763 --> 00:03:32.092
for dose after dose
after dose of antibiotics,
