00:07:59.431 --> 00:08:03.169
Well, imagine you're walking
in the forest and you see a bear.

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:07.326
Immediately, your hypothalamus
sends a signal to your pituitary,

00:08:07.326 --> 00:08:09.927
which sends a signal 
to your adrenal gland that says,

00:08:09.927 --> 00:08:13.478
"Release stress hormones!
Adrenaline! Cortisol!"

00:08:13.478 --> 00:08:16.099
And so your heart starts to pound,

00:08:16.099 --> 00:08:18.233
Your pupils dilate, your airways open up,

00:08:18.234 --> 00:08:24.482
and you are ready to either
fight that bear or run from the bear.

00:08:24.482 --> 00:08:26.798
And that is wonderful

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:30.289
if you're in a forest
and there's a bear.
