00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:30.289
if you're in a forest
and there's a bear.

00:08:30.289 --> 00:08:32.843
(Laughter)

00:08:32.843 --> 00:08:38.256
But the problem is what happens
when the bear comes home every night,

00:08:38.256 --> 00:08:43.904
and this system is activated
over and over and over again,

00:08:43.904 --> 00:08:48.408
and it goes from being
adaptive, or life-saving,

00:08:48.408 --> 00:08:52.533
to maladaptive, or health-damaging.

00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:58.036
Children are especially sensitive
to this repeated stress activation,

00:08:58.036 --> 00:09:01.270
because their brains and bodies
are just developing.
