00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.497
(Rainforest noises)

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.167
In the summer of 2011,
as a tourist,

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:17.593
I visited the rainforests of Borneo
for the very first time,

00:00:17.593 --> 00:00:19.641
and as you might imagine,

00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:24.911
it was the overwhelming sounds
of the forest that struck me the most.

00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:27.721
There's this constant cacophony of noise.

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:30.136
Some things actually do stick out.
