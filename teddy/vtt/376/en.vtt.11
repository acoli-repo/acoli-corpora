00:05:29.178 --> 00:05:31.585
We have to put them in this box
that you see here,

00:05:31.585 --> 00:05:33.152
and we do have to power them.

00:05:33.152 --> 00:05:35.915
Powering them is one of the greater
engineering challenges

00:05:35.915 --> 00:05:37.215
that we had to deal with,

00:05:37.215 --> 00:05:39.967
because powering a cell phone
under a tree canopy,

00:05:39.967 --> 00:05:42.219
any sort of solar power
under a tree canopy,

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:44.029
was an as-yet-unsolved problem,

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:46.886
and that's this unique
solar panel design that you see here,

00:05:46.886 --> 00:05:51.205
which in fact is built also from recycled
byproducts of an industrial process.

00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:53.829
These are strips that are cut down.

00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:57.335
So this is me putting it all together

00:05:57.335 --> 00:05:59.216
in my parents' garage, actually.

00:05:59.216 --> 00:06:01.793
Thanks very much to them
for allowing me to do that.
