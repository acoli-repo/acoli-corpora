00:07:57.586 --> 00:08:01.440
Word of this spread, possibly
because we told a lot of people,

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.877
and in fact, then some really
amazing stuff started to happen.

00:08:04.877 --> 00:08:08.546
People from around the world
started to send us emails, phone calls.

00:08:08.546 --> 00:08:10.635
What we saw was that people
throughout Asia,

00:08:10.635 --> 00:08:13.377
people throughout Africa,
people throughout South America,

00:08:13.377 --> 00:08:15.288
they told us that they could use it too,

00:08:15.288 --> 00:08:16.568
and what's most important,

00:08:16.568 --> 00:08:19.066
what we'd found that
we thought might be exceptional,

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:21.648
in the forest there was
pretty good cell phone service.

00:08:21.648 --> 00:08:23.525
That was not exceptional, we were told,

00:08:23.525 --> 00:08:27.468
and that particularly is on the periphery
of the forests that are most under threat.

00:08:27.468 --> 00:08:29.768
And then something 
really amazing happened,

00:08:29.768 --> 00:08:33.251
which was that people started sending us
their own old cell phones.
