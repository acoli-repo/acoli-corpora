00:01:56.745 --> 00:02:01.217
just a few hundred meters away 
from a ranger station in a sanctuary,

00:02:01.217 --> 00:02:05.022
that in fact nobody could hear it when
someone who has a chainsaw gets fired up.

00:02:05.022 --> 00:02:09.687
It sounds impossible,
but in fact, it was quite true.

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:11.523
So how do we stop illegal logging?

00:02:11.523 --> 00:02:14.952
It's really tempting, as an engineer,
always to come up with a high-tech,

00:02:14.952 --> 00:02:16.713
super-crazy high-tech solution,

00:02:16.713 --> 00:02:18.663
but in fact, you're in the rainforest.

00:02:18.663 --> 00:02:21.040
It has to be simple,
it has to be scalable,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.048
and so what we also noticed
while were there was that

00:02:24.048 --> 00:02:26.374
everything we needed was already there.

00:02:26.374 --> 00:02:29.125
We could build a system
that would allow us to stop this

00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:31.407
using what's already there.
