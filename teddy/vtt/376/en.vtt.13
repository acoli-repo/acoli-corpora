00:06:29.006 --> 00:06:31.119
not the same place, but another place,

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:32.790
to another gibbon reserve

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.635
that was threatened daily
by illegal logging.

00:06:36.505 --> 00:06:40.424
On the very second day, it picked up
illegal chainsaw noises.

00:06:40.424 --> 00:06:42.623
We were able to get a real-time alert.

00:06:42.623 --> 00:06:43.970
I got an email on my phone.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.686
Actually, we had just climbed the tree.
Everyone had just gotten back down.

00:06:47.686 --> 00:06:49.926
All these guys are smoking cigarettes,

00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:52.783
and then I get an email,
and they all quiet down,

00:06:52.783 --> 00:06:54.887
and in fact you can hear the chainsaw

00:06:54.887 --> 00:06:56.816
really, really faint in the background,

00:06:56.816 --> 00:06:59.121
but no one had noticed it 
until that moment.

00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:02.395
And so then we took off
to actually stop these loggers.
