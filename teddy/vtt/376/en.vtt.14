00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:02.395
And so then we took off
to actually stop these loggers.

00:07:02.395 --> 00:07:03.904
I was pretty nervous.

00:07:03.904 --> 00:07:08.130
This is the moment where we've actually
arrived close to where the loggers are.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.244
This is the moment where you can see
where I'm actually regretting

00:07:11.244 --> 00:07:13.245

00:07:13.245 --> 00:07:15.988

But he went, so I had to go, walking up,

00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:24.290
and in fact, he made it over the hill,

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.527
and interrupted the loggers in the act.

00:07:27.527 --> 00:07:29.189
For them, it was such a surprise --

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:31.569
they had never, ever
been interrupted before --
