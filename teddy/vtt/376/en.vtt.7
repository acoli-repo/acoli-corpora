00:03:29.551 --> 00:03:33.393
because it's something that we've
definitely all heard about forever.

00:03:33.393 --> 00:03:36.312
People in my generation
have heard about saving the rainforest

00:03:36.312 --> 00:03:38.212
since we were kids,

00:03:38.212 --> 00:03:40.460
and it seems that the message
has never changed:

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.982
We've got to save the rainforest,
it's super urgent,

00:03:42.982 --> 00:03:45.688
this many football fields
have been destroyed yesterday.

00:03:45.688 --> 00:03:48.992
and yet here we are today,
about half of the rainforest remains,

00:03:48.992 --> 00:03:53.319
and we have potentially more urgent 
problems like climate change.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.228
But in fact, this is the little-known fact
that I didn't realize at the time:

00:03:57.228 --> 00:04:00.189
