using what's already there.

00:02:31.407 --> 00:02:33.639
Who was there? What was 
already in the forest?

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:34.787
Well, we had people.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:38.072
We had this group there that was 
dedicated, three full-time guards,

00:02:38.072 --> 00:02:39.846
that was dedicated to go and stop it,

00:02:39.846 --> 00:02:42.960
but they just needed to know
what was happening out in the forest.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.853
The real surprise, this is the big one,

00:02:44.853 --> 00:02:47.236
was that there was connectivity
out in the forest.

00:02:47.236 --> 00:02:50.150
There was cell phone service
way out in the middle of nowhere.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.081
We're talking hundreds of kilometers
from the nearest road,

00:02:53.081 --> 00:02:56.653
there's certainly no electricity,
but they had very good cell phone service,

00:02:56.653 --> 00:02:59.276
these people in the towns
were on Facebook all the time,

00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:01.226
they're surfing the web on their phones,
