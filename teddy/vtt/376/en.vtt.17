00:08:29.768 --> 00:08:33.251
which was that people started sending us
their own old cell phones.

00:08:33.251 --> 00:08:35.201
So in fact what we have now is a system

00:08:35.201 --> 00:08:38.544
where we can use people on the ground,
people who are already there,

00:08:38.544 --> 00:08:41.609
who can both improve
and use the existing connectivity,

00:08:41.609 --> 00:08:44.286
and we're using old cell phones
that are being sent to us

00:08:44.286 --> 00:08:45.779
by people from around the world

00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:49.072
that want their phones to be doing 
something else in their afterlife,

00:08:49.072 --> 00:08:49.826
so to speak.

00:08:49.826 --> 00:08:52.755
And if the rest of the device
can be completely recycled,

00:08:52.755 --> 00:08:55.471
then we believe it's
an entirely upcycled device.

00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:59.125
So again, this didn't come
because of any sort of high-tech solution.

00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:01.438
It just came from using
what's already there,
