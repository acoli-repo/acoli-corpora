It just came from using
what's already there,

00:09:01.438 --> 00:09:04.294
and I'm thoroughly convinced
that if it's not phones,

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.663
that there's always
going to be enough there

00:09:06.663 --> 00:09:08.474
that you can build similar solutions

00:09:08.474 --> 00:09:10.540
that can be very effective
in new contexts.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.676
Thank you very much.

00:09:12.676 --> 00:09:17.204
