Some things actually do stick out.

00:00:30.136 --> 00:00:34.562
For example, this here is a big bird,
a rhinoceros hornbill.

00:00:34.562 --> 00:00:38.734
This buzzing is a cicada.

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:42.047
This is a family of gibbons.

00:00:42.047 --> 00:00:46.161
It's actually singing to each other
over a great distance.

00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:50.334
The place where this was recorded
was in fact a gibbon reserve,

00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:52.371
which is why you can hear so many of them,

00:00:52.372 --> 00:00:57.302
but in fact the most important noise that 
was coming out of the forest that time

00:00:57.302 --> 00:00:58.834
was one that I didn't notice,

00:00:58.834 --> 00:01:01.943
and in fact nobody there
had actually noticed it.
