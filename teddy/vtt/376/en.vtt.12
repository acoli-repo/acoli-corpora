Thanks very much to them
for allowing me to do that.

00:06:01.793 --> 00:06:06.149
As you can see,
this is a device up in a tree.

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:09.734
What you can see from here, perhaps,
is that they are pretty well obscured

00:06:09.734 --> 00:06:11.536
up in the tree canopy at a distance.

00:06:11.536 --> 00:06:15.013
That's important, because although
they are able to hear chainsaw noises

00:06:15.013 --> 00:06:16.783
up to a kilometer in the distance,

00:06:16.783 --> 00:06:19.303
allowing them to cover
about three square kilometers,

00:06:19.303 --> 00:06:22.481
if someone were to take them,
it would make the area unprotected.

00:06:23.281 --> 00:06:26.034
So does it actually work?

00:06:26.034 --> 00:06:29.006
Well, to test it,
we took it back to Indonesia,

00:06:29.006 --> 00:06:31.119
not the same place, but another place,
