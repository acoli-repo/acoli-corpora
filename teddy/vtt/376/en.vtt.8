00:03:57.228 --> 00:04:00.189
Deforestation accounts 
for more greenhouse gas

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:04.229
than all of the world's planes,
trains, cars, trucks and ships combined.

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:06.945
It's the second highest contributor
to climate change.

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:09.778
Also, according to Interpol,

00:04:09.778 --> 00:04:13.307
as much as 90 percent of the logging
that takes place in the rainforest

00:04:13.307 --> 00:04:17.088
is illegal logging,
like the illegal logging that we saw.

00:04:17.088 --> 00:04:21.132
So if we can help people in the forest
enforce the rules that are there,

00:04:21.132 --> 00:04:25.056
then in fact we could eat heavily
into this 17 percent

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:27.667
and potentially have a major impact
in the short term.

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:32.832
It might just be the cheapest,
fastest way to fight climate change.
