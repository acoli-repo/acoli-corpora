00:00:58.834 --> 00:01:01.943
and in fact nobody there
had actually noticed it.

00:01:02.373 --> 00:01:04.361
So, as I said, this was a gibbon reserve.

00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:07.170
They spend most of their time
rehabilitating gibbons,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.731
but they also have
to spend a lot of their time

00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:13.423
protecting their area from illegal logging
that takes place on the side.

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:15.466
And so if we take the sound of the forest

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:19.023
and we actually turn down the gibbons,
the insects, and the rest,

00:01:19.023 --> 00:01:22.689
in the background, the entire time,
in recordings you heard,

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.403
was the sound of a chainsaw
at great distance.

00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:30.397
They had three full-time guards
who were posted around this sanctuary
