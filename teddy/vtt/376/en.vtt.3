00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:30.397
They had three full-time guards
who were posted around this sanctuary

00:01:30.397 --> 00:01:34.599
whose job was in fact
to guard against illegal logging,

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:38.058
and one day, we went walking,
again as tourists, out into the forest,

00:01:38.058 --> 00:01:40.311
and within five minutes' walk,

00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:43.690
we stumbled upon somebody
who was just sawing a tree down,

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.951
five minutes' walk, a few hundred meters
from the ranger station.

00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:49.009
They hadn't been able
to hear the chainsaws,

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.826
because as you heard,
the forest is very, very loud.

00:01:52.826 --> 00:01:56.745
It struck me as quite unacceptable
that in this modern time,

00:01:56.745 --> 00:02:01.217
just a few hundred meters away 
from a ranger station in a sanctuary,
