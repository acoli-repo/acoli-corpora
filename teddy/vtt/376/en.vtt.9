00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:32.832
It might just be the cheapest,
fastest way to fight climate change.

00:04:32.832 --> 00:04:34.830
And so here's the system that we imagine.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.024
It looks super high tech.

00:04:36.024 --> 00:04:38.657
The moment a sound of a chainsaw
is heard in the forest,

00:04:38.657 --> 00:04:40.829
the device picks up the sound
of the chainsaw,

00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:44.436
it sends an alert through the standard
GSM network that's already there

00:04:44.436 --> 00:04:46.523
to a ranger in the field

00:04:46.523 --> 00:04:49.340
who can in fact show up in real time
and stop the logging.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.249
It's no more about going out
and finding a tree that's been cut.

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.425
It's not about seeing 
a tree from a satellite

00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:57.061
in an area that's been clear cut,

00:04:57.061 --> 00:04:59.259
it's about real-time intervention.

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.390
So I said it was the cheapest
and fastest way to do it,
