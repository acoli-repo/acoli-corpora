00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.390
So I said it was the cheapest
and fastest way to do it,

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.315
but in fact, actually, as you saw,
they weren't able to do it,

00:05:05.315 --> 00:05:07.199
so it may not be so cheap and fast.

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.635
But if the devices in the trees
were actually cell phones,

00:05:10.635 --> 00:05:12.191
it could be pretty cheap.

00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:16.478
Cell phones are thrown away
by the hundreds of millions every year,

00:05:16.478 --> 00:05:18.599
hundreds of millions in the U.S. alone,

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.780
not counting the rest of the world,
which of course we should do,

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.311
but in fact, cell phones are great.

00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:25.644
They're full of sensors.

00:05:25.644 --> 00:05:27.796
They can listen
to the sounds of the forest.

00:05:27.796 --> 00:05:29.178
We do have to protect them.

00:05:29.178 --> 00:05:31.585
We have to put them in this box
that you see here,
