00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:01.226
they're surfing the web on their phones,

00:03:01.226 --> 00:03:04.335
and this sort of got me thinking
that in fact it would be possible

00:03:04.335 --> 00:03:06.494
to use the sounds of the forest,

00:03:06.494 --> 00:03:08.886
pick up the sounds 
of chainsaws programmatically,

00:03:08.886 --> 00:03:10.534
because people can't hear them,

00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:12.221
and send an alert.

00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:14.803
But you have to have a device
to go up in the trees.

00:03:14.803 --> 00:03:18.454
So if we can use some device
to listen to the sounds of the forest,

00:03:18.454 --> 00:03:20.687
connect to the cell phone
network that's there,

00:03:20.687 --> 00:03:22.721
and send an alert to people on the ground,

00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:26.271
perhaps we could have a solution
to this issue for them.

00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:29.551
But let's take a moment
to talk about saving the rainforest,

00:03:29.551 --> 00:03:33.393
because it's something that we've
definitely all heard about forever.
