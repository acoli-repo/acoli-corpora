00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.859
have given neurolinguists a glimpse

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:05.714
into how specific aspects of language
learning affect the bilingual brain.

00:02:05.714 --> 00:02:09.009
It's well known that the brain's
left hemisphere is more dominant

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.622
and analytical in logical processes,

00:02:11.622 --> 00:02:16.202
while the right hemisphere is more active
in emotional and social ones,

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:20.075
though this is a matter of degree,
not an absolute split.

00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:22.883
The fact that language involves
both types of functions

00:02:22.883 --> 00:02:25.861
while lateralization develops
gradually with age,

00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:28.799
has lead to the critical 
period hypothesis.

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.430
According to this theory,
