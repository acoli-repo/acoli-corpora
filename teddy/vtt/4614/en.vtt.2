00:01:01.612 --> 00:01:04.915
they can be classified into
three general types.

00:01:04.915 --> 00:01:07.767
For example, let's take Gabriella,

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:12.007
whose family immigrates to the US 
from Peru when she's two-years old.

00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:13.823
As a compound bilingual,

working with two sets of concepts,
