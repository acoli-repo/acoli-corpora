¿Hablas español? Parlez-vous français? 
你会说中文吗？

00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:18.333
If you answered, "sí," "oui," or "会"
and you're watching this in English,

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:23.469
chances are you belong to the world's
bilingual and multilingual majority.

00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:25.563
And besides having 
an easier time traveling

00:00:25.563 --> 00:00:27.471
or watching movies without subtitles,

00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:29.895
knowing two or more languages
means that your brain

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:34.777
may actually look and work differently
than those of your monolingual friends.
