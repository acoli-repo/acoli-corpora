can also help delay the onset of diseases,
like Alzheimer's and dementia

00:03:31.334 --> 00:03:33.225
by as much as five years.

00:03:33.225 --> 00:03:35.943
The idea of major cognitive 
benefits to bilingualism

00:03:35.943 --> 00:03:37.519
may seem intuitive now,

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.507
but it would have surprised 
earlier experts.

00:03:40.507 --> 00:03:44.194
Before the 1960s, bilingualism
was considered a handicap

00:03:44.194 --> 00:03:45.999
that slowed a child's development

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:50.652
by forcing them to spend too much energy
distinguishing between languages,

00:03:50.652 --> 00:03:54.089
a view based largely on flawed studies.

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:56.178
And while a more recent study did show

00:03:56.178 --> 00:03:59.415
that reaction times and errors increase
for some bilingual students

00:03:59.415 --> 00:04:01.427
in cross-language tests,
