00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.430
According to this theory,

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.406
children learn languages more easily

00:02:32.406 --> 00:02:35.196
because the plasticity 
of their developing brains

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:38.975
lets them use both hemispheres
in language acquisition,

00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:42.992
while in most adults, language 
is lateralized to one hemisphere,

00:02:42.992 --> 00:02:44.898
usually the left.

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:47.684
If this is true, learning a language
in childhood

00:02:47.684 --> 00:02:52.480
may give you a more holistic grasp
of its social and emotional contexts.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.810
Conversely, recent research showed

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.520
that people who learned 
a second language in adulthood

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.423
exhibit less emotional bias
and a more rational approach
