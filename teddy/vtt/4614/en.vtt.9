it does make your brain more healthy,
complex and actively engaged,

00:04:30.897 --> 00:04:33.422
and even if you didn't have 
the good fortune

00:04:33.422 --> 00:04:35.651
of learning a second language as a child,

00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:37.794
it's never too late to do 
yourself a favor

00:04:37.794 --> 00:04:40.572
and make the linguistic 
leap from, "Hello,"

00:04:40.572 --> 00:04:43.559
to, "Hola," "Bonjour" or "你好’s"

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:48.081
because when it comes to our brains
a little exercise can go a long way.
