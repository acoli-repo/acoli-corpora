It was the end of October
in the mountains in Austria.

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:08.878
I was there on a field trip
with my architecture students from Zurich.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.026
And when we reached a high valley,

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.268
I surprised them with the news
that there was no hut

00:00:16.292 --> 00:00:17.910
or hotel booked for the night.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:21.219
It was not a mistake.

00:00:21.243 --> 00:00:23.131
It was totally on purpose.

00:00:25.093 --> 00:00:28.910
The challenge was to build our own shelter
with whatever we could find.
