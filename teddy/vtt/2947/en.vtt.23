WEBVTT

00:11:29.126 --> 00:11:30.554
is our humidfier.

00:11:32.372 --> 00:11:35.302
We love our six tons of dirt at home

00:11:35.326 --> 00:11:37.816
not only because
it's healthy and sustainable.

00:11:38.397 --> 00:11:41.453
Its archaic warmth
is touching deep within.

00:11:42.708 --> 00:11:47.430
My personal dream is to build
a mud skyscraper right in Manhattan.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.859
(Laughter)

00:11:49.883 --> 00:11:51.034
Yeah.

00:11:51.058 --> 00:11:53.257
(Applause)

00:11:53.281 --> 00:11:54.830
And this dream isn't so crazy

00:11:54.854 --> 00:11:57.046
if you think of the mud city
of Shibam in Yemen

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.935
that was built in the 16th century

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:02.227
and has lasted now for 500 years.
