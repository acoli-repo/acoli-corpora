(Laughter)

00:08:36.603 --> 00:08:38.610
Of course, this was a small-scale project,

00:08:38.634 --> 00:08:41.730
but in terms of awareness-building
and in terms of education,

00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:44.284
it was like an acupuncture trigger point.

00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:49.281
And in fact, in more and more countries,

00:08:49.305 --> 00:08:54.290
load-bearing earthen structures
are not allowed to be built anymore

00:08:54.314 --> 00:08:57.816
although they're traditional
and have lasted for hundreds of years,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.856
and not because the material is weak,

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.032
but because there are
no architects and engineers
