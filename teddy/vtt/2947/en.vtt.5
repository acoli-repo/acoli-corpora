00:02:29.338 --> 00:02:33.696
it was all built by craftsmen
from the village.

00:02:35.613 --> 00:02:38.897
And this is the METI school
after six months of construction.

00:02:38.921 --> 00:02:41.264
(Applause)

00:02:41.288 --> 00:02:42.447
Thank you.

00:02:42.471 --> 00:02:44.073
(Applause)

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:48.202
Load-bearing earth walls
that really ground the school,

00:02:48.226 --> 00:02:51.820
and large bamboo structures
that bring the lightness in.

00:02:53.635 --> 00:02:56.056
That's the classroom on the ground floor.

00:02:57.072 --> 00:02:58.842
Attached to it are the caves.

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:02.177
They're for reading,
for snuggling, for solo work,
