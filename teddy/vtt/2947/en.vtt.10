00:04:59.397 --> 00:05:00.872
and the answer is no.

00:05:01.311 --> 00:05:05.050
There is no stabilizer,
no coating on these walls,

00:05:05.074 --> 00:05:06.398
only in the foundation.

00:05:08.294 --> 00:05:10.112
So this is the close-up of the wall

00:05:10.136 --> 00:05:13.596
after 10 rainy seasons,

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.060
and as much as I grew a bit older,

00:05:16.084 --> 00:05:17.806
the wall got some wrinkles as well.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.997
The edges my not be as sharp as before,

00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:22.173
but it still looks pretty good,

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:23.927
and if it needs repairing,

00:05:23.951 --> 00:05:25.942
it is really easy to do.

00:05:25.966 --> 00:05:27.709
You just take the broken part,

00:05:27.733 --> 00:05:30.471
make it wet, and put it back on the wall,
