00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.032
but because there are
no architects and engineers

00:09:03.056 --> 00:09:05.492
who know how to deal with that material.

00:09:05.516 --> 00:09:07.190
So education on all levels,

00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:09.890
for craftsmen, engineers and architects,

00:09:09.914 --> 00:09:11.681
is really strongly needed.

00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:15.429
Equally important
is technological development,

00:09:15.453 --> 00:09:18.546
like prefabrication developed
by my colleague Martin Rauch,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:22.556
who is an Austrian artist
and expert in earthen structures.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.190
And he has created technologies
for rammed earth elements,

00:09:26.214 --> 00:09:28.647
for prefabrication
of rammed earth elements

00:09:28.671 --> 00:09:32.432
that include insulation,
wall heatings and coolings
