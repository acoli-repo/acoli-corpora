00:01:27.512 --> 00:01:30.368
And this is what I tried to do
with my architecture as well.

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:34.740
In terms of suitable building
materials for my school,

00:01:34.764 --> 00:01:36.192
I didn't have to look far.

00:01:36.718 --> 00:01:38.573
They were right under my feet:

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:43.587
mud, earth, dirt, clay,
however you call it ...

00:01:44.788 --> 00:01:47.121
and bamboo that was growing all around.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.535
Electricity in remote Bangladesh is rare,

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:54.765
but we didn't need it.

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.388
We had human energy

00:01:56.412 --> 00:01:58.610
and the people were happy
to have the work.
