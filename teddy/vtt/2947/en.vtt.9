and second rule, a good roof
that protects from the top,

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.440
and third rule, erosion control.

00:04:34.193 --> 00:04:36.479
Mud walls need speed breakers

00:04:36.503 --> 00:04:40.711
so that the rainwater
cannot run down the wall fast,

00:04:40.735 --> 00:04:44.017
and these speed breakers
could be lines of bamboo

00:04:44.041 --> 00:04:47.622
or stones or straw mixed into the mud,

00:04:47.646 --> 00:04:52.907
just like a hill needs trees or rocks
in order to prevent erosion.

00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:54.304
It works just the same way.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.373
And people always ask me
if I have to add cement to the mud,

00:04:59.397 --> 00:05:00.872
and the answer is no.
