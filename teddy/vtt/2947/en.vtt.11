make it wet, and put it back on the wall,

00:05:30.495 --> 00:05:32.518
and it will look the same as before.

00:05:32.542 --> 00:05:34.085
Wish that would work on me, too.

00:05:34.109 --> 00:05:37.410
(Laughter)

00:05:38.685 --> 00:05:40.841
Yeah, and the great thing is,

00:05:40.865 --> 00:05:43.286
if an earth wall is not needed anymore,

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.551
it can go back to the ground it came from,

00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:48.483
turn into a garden,

00:05:48.507 --> 00:05:52.030
or get fully recycled
without any loss of quality.

00:05:52.607 --> 00:05:54.698
There's no other material
that can do this,

00:05:54.722 --> 00:05:59.047
and this is why mud is so excellent
in terms of environmental performance.
