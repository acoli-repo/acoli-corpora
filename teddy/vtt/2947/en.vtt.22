00:10:57.104 --> 00:11:01.355
such as mud, stones, timber,
bamboo, earth,

00:11:01.379 --> 00:11:05.267
that are totally effective options
for all sorts of purposes.

00:11:05.926 --> 00:11:08.473
This, for example,
is an office building that we did

00:11:08.497 --> 00:11:10.878
for Omicron Electronics in Austria.

00:11:10.902 --> 00:11:13.799
Mud is healthy for the planet,
but also for the human bodies,

00:11:13.823 --> 00:11:16.465
and the material is low-tech,

00:11:16.489 --> 00:11:18.712
but the performance is high-tech.

00:11:18.736 --> 00:11:22.815
The earth walls keep the highly
sophisticated tools in the building safe

00:11:22.839 --> 00:11:24.750
by naturally regulating moisture.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.102
And this wall in my own home

00:11:29.126 --> 00:11:30.554
is our humidfier.
