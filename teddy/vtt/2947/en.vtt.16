00:07:57.734 --> 00:08:01.710
precisely 60 tons of dirt
right in front of the main facade

00:08:01.734 --> 00:08:03.336
of the Graduate School of Design.

00:08:05.478 --> 00:08:07.622
Students and faculty
rolled up their sleeves,

00:08:07.646 --> 00:08:08.801
got their hands dirty

00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:12.224
and transformed the front
into a warm place for people to gather.

00:08:13.248 --> 00:08:14.964
Children would climb the structures,

00:08:14.988 --> 00:08:16.505
skaters would ride the ramp,

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:18.275
students having lunch breaks,

00:08:18.299 --> 00:08:22.371
and it was particularly fascinating to see
how many people were touching the wall,

00:08:22.395 --> 00:08:26.248
and we usually don't go around cities
caressing our facades, right?

00:08:26.272 --> 00:08:28.133
