00:10:30.411 --> 00:10:33.885
And this trend is happening very fast.

00:10:33.909 --> 00:10:36.885
Within only a couple of years,

00:10:36.909 --> 00:10:39.902
China has consumed more cement
than the United States

00:10:39.926 --> 00:10:42.162
in the entire 20th century.

00:10:42.618 --> 00:10:46.127
And this trend of replacing
natural building materials

00:10:46.151 --> 00:10:48.404
with materials that require
a lot of energy,

00:10:48.428 --> 00:10:50.214
that are energy-intensive,

00:10:50.238 --> 00:10:52.279
and that emit CO2

00:10:52.303 --> 00:10:55.643
is really clearly contributing
to climate change.

00:10:55.667 --> 00:10:57.080
And we have alternatives,

00:10:57.104 --> 00:11:01.355
such as mud, stones, timber,
bamboo, earth,
