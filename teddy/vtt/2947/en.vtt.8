When we think of mud, we think of dirt --

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:03.583
it's ugly, it's nondurable --

00:04:03.607 --> 00:04:06.138
and this is the image I want to change.

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.906
In fact, it's the 11th rainy season
for this school now,

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.184
really harsh, horizontal monsoon rains,

00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:16.755
and the walls are standing strong.

00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:21.640
(Applause)

00:04:21.664 --> 00:04:23.006
So how does it work?

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.186
First rule, a good foundation
that keeps the wall dry from the ground,

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.906
and second rule, a good roof
that protects from the top,
