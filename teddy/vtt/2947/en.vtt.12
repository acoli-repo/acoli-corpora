00:06:00.421 --> 00:06:02.556
What about the economic sustainability?

00:06:03.252 --> 00:06:04.518
When we built the school,

00:06:04.542 --> 00:06:06.919
I practically lived
on the construction site,

00:06:06.943 --> 00:06:09.967
and in the evening, I used to go
with the workers to the market,

00:06:09.991 --> 00:06:12.067
and I could see
how they spent their money.

00:06:12.984 --> 00:06:16.284
And they would buy
the vegetables from their neighbors,

00:06:16.308 --> 00:06:19.593
they would get a new haircut
or a new blouse from the tailor.

00:06:20.858 --> 00:06:24.716
And because the main part
of the building budget

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.885
was spent on craftsmanship,

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:29.341
the school wasn't just a building,

00:06:29.365 --> 00:06:33.529
it became a real catalyst
for local development,
