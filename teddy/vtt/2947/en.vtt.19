00:09:28.671 --> 00:09:32.432
that include insulation,
wall heatings and coolings

00:09:32.456 --> 00:09:34.257
and all sorts of electrical fittings

00:09:34.281 --> 00:09:36.574
that can be layered
to multistoried buildings,

00:09:36.598 --> 00:09:39.275
and this is important in order to scale up

00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:41.267
and in order to [speed] up the processes,

00:09:41.291 --> 00:09:44.591
like in the Ricola Herb Center
in Switzerland.

00:09:46.555 --> 00:09:49.683
And finally, we need good built projects

00:09:49.707 --> 00:09:52.802
that prove you can build
with an ancient material

00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:54.694
in a very modern way.

00:09:55.434 --> 00:09:59.128
It is not a matter
of how old a material is;

00:09:59.152 --> 00:10:02.633
it's a matter of our creative
ability to use it today.
