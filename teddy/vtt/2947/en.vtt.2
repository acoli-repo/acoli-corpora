00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.239
I went to Bangladesh
to a remote village called Rudrapur

00:01:02.263 --> 00:01:05.628
with the aim to design and build
a school as my thesis project.

00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:09.383
I had lived in that village before
when I was 19 and a volunteer

00:01:09.407 --> 00:01:12.344
at Dipshikha, a Bangladeshi NGO
for rural development.

00:01:12.368 --> 00:01:14.050
And what I had learned from them

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:18.852
was that the most sustainable strategy
for sustainable development

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:24.035
is to cherish and to use
your very own resources and potential,

00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:27.488
and not get dependent on external factors.

00:01:27.512 --> 00:01:30.368
And this is what I tried to do
with my architecture as well.
