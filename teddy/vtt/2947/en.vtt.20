it's a matter of our creative
ability to use it today.

00:10:04.936 --> 00:10:07.191
These, for example, are three hostels

00:10:07.215 --> 00:10:09.562
that I did in China in the village Baoxi,

00:10:09.586 --> 00:10:12.372
about six hours by bus from Shanghai.

00:10:13.859 --> 00:10:16.550
The outside shape is woven bamboo,

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:20.137
and the inside core
is stones and rammed earth.

00:10:21.058 --> 00:10:23.514
And it is a traditional building material.

00:10:23.538 --> 00:10:25.731
Even large parts
of the Great Wall of China

00:10:25.755 --> 00:10:27.400
have been built with rammed earth,

00:10:27.424 --> 00:10:29.717
but it's getting replaced by concrete.
