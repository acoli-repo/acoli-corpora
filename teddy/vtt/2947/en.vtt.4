00:02:00.188 --> 00:02:02.127
Tools were an issue, too,

00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:03.714
but we had these guys,

00:02:03.738 --> 00:02:05.166
water buffalos.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.866
We had also tried a bit cows,

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.469
but interestingly,
they were too intelligent.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.906
They were always stepping
in the holes of the previous round.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.788
They wouldn't mix the mud, the straw --

00:02:16.812 --> 00:02:17.862
(Laughter)

00:02:17.886 --> 00:02:20.521
the sand, which are
the ingredients in the walls.

00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:24.545
And except a small team of consultants

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.672
like my partner
for realization, Eike Roswag,

00:02:26.696 --> 00:02:29.314
and my basket-weaver cousin, Emmanuel,

00:02:29.338 --> 00:02:33.696
it was all built by craftsmen
from the village.
