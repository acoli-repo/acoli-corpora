are living in earth houses,

00:07:38.668 --> 00:07:40.954
and it is a traditional building material

00:07:40.978 --> 00:07:43.691
in Europe just as much as in Africa.

00:07:46.076 --> 00:07:47.617
Strangely enough,

00:07:47.641 --> 00:07:51.306
mud is not considered worthy
of being studied at universities ...

00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:55.479

00:07:55.503 --> 00:07:57.710
(Laughter)

00:07:57.734 --> 00:08:01.710
precisely 60 tons of dirt
right in front of the main facade
