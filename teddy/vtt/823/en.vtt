00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.000
First, a video.

00:00:09.397 --> 00:00:12.199
Yes, it is a scrambled egg.

00:00:14.151 --> 00:00:15.484
But as you look at it,

00:00:15.508 --> 00:00:19.619
I hope you'll begin to feel
just slightly uneasy.

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:24.727
Because you may notice
that what's actually happening

00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:26.976
is that the egg is unscrambling itself.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.699
And you'll now see the yolk
and the white have separated.

00:00:29.723 --> 00:00:32.746
And now they're going to be
poured back into the egg.
