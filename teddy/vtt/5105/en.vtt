00:00:01.143 --> 00:00:02.801
I'm going to tell you a story.

00:00:04.048 --> 00:00:05.439
I'm going to tell you a story

00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:08.642
about how the deadliest
consumer product imaginable

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:09.816
came to be.

00:00:10.413 --> 00:00:11.679
It's the cigarette.

00:00:12.572 --> 00:00:15.104
The cigarette is the only consumer product

00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:17.667
that, when used as intended,

00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:21.500
will kill half of all long-term users
prematurely, later in life.

00:00:22.347 --> 00:00:23.572
But this is also a story

00:00:23.596 --> 00:00:27.022
about the work that we're doing
at the Food and Drug Administration,

00:00:27.046 --> 00:00:29.450
and specifically,
the work that we're doing

00:00:29.474 --> 00:00:32.625
to create the cigarette of the future,
