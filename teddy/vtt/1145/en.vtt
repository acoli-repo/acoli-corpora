00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
First of all, I'm a geek.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm an organic food-eating,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
carbon footprint-minimizing, robotic surgery geek.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I really want to build green,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but I'm very suspicious

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
of all of these well-meaning articles,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
people long on moral authority

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and short on data,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
telling me how to do these kinds of things.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And so I have to figure this out for myself.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
For example: Is this evil?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I have dropped a blob of organic yogurt

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
from happy self-actualized local cows
