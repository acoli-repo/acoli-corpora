00:00:00.996 --> 00:00:04.236
Hello, my name is Dom Price
and I'm a work futurist,

00:00:04.276 --> 00:00:07.036
which is a made-up job
that no one's called me out on yet,

00:00:07.036 --> 00:00:09.076
but it's got me here on this stage today.

00:00:09.116 --> 00:00:11.516
My job's all about predicting the future,

00:00:11.556 --> 00:00:13.676
the future of work, society,

00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:15.996
the economy and education.

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:18.716
Which, surely you can imagine
this year of all the years,

00:00:18.756 --> 00:00:20.156
it's been pretty fascinating.

00:00:20.476 --> 00:00:23.836
Now, there's a huge amount
of self-help literature out there

00:00:23.876 --> 00:00:27.196
that will help you be happier over time.

00:00:27.196 --> 00:00:29.396
But today, I want
to talk to you specifically

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:32.436
about being happy in a year like 2020.
