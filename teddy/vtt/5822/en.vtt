I've spent the last couple of years
traveling around the world

00:00:03.397 --> 00:00:07.130
giving talks to big corporations
and little bitty start-ups

00:00:07.163 --> 00:00:10.030
and lots of leadership teams
and women's groups,

00:00:10.063 --> 00:00:12.097
and what I've been talking
to people about,

00:00:12.097 --> 00:00:14.297
I've been trying really hard
to convince people

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.297
that we can change the way we work.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.697
But every time I do a talk,

00:00:17.697 --> 00:00:20.163
somebody comes backstage
or follows me offstage

00:00:20.197 --> 00:00:23.197
and says, "You know,
I'm so inspired by what you say.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.763
It's so great, it makes so much sense.

00:00:25.797 --> 00:00:27.663
But we can't."

00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:30.230
"We can't because we're regulated."
