00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.096
Twenty years ago,

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.056
when I was a barrister
and human rights lawyer

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.055
in full-time legal practice in London,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.256
and the highest court in the land

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.696
still convened, some would say
by an accident of history,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.040
in this building here,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.896
I met a young man
who had just quit his job

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.349
in the British Foreign Office.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.216
When I asked him, "Why did you leave,"

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.440
he told me this story.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.216
He had gone to his boss
one morning and said,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.360
"Let's do something
about human rights abuses in China."
