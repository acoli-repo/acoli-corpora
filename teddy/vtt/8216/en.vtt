It's easy to tell when someone's
not paying attention,

00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:14.886
but it can be surprisingly tricky to know
what truly excellent listening looks like.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.057
Behavioral scientists have found
that good listening

00:00:19.057 --> 00:00:23.770
is one of the most important things 
we can do to improve our relationships,

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.608
develop our worldview, and potentially
even change people's minds.

00:00:28.983 --> 00:00:32.737
So, what can we do to become
better listeners?
