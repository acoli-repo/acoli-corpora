00:00:01.272 --> 00:00:02.649
Picture this:

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:03.742
It's Monday morning,

00:00:03.742 --> 00:00:04.861
you're at the office,

00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:06.615
you're settling in for the day at work,

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:09.437
and this guy that you sort of 
recognize from down the hall,

00:00:09.437 --> 00:00:11.273
walks right into your cubicle

00:00:11.273 --> 00:00:12.675
and he steals your chair.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:13.917
Doesn't say a word â€”

00:00:13.917 --> 00:00:15.305
just rolls away with it.

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:17.788
Doesn't give you any information
about why he took your chair

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:19.899
out of all the other chairs 
that are out there.

00:00:19.899 --> 00:00:22.041
Doesn't acknowledge the fact 
that you might need your chair

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:23.582
to get some work done today.

00:00:23.582 --> 00:00:25.839
You wouldn't stand for 
it. You'd make a stink.

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.866
You'd follow that guy
back to his cubicle

00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:31.178
and you'd say, "Why my chair?"
