He pulled us aside because he believed
we were unconventional in the boardroom.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.117
That unconventionality was exactly
why he wanted us to think about

00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:08.104

But he also knew it was

00:06:13.552 --> 00:06:15.955

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:25.183
of somebody bending the rules.

00:06:25.207 --> 00:06:28.051
Because he decided to co-conspire with us,

00:06:28.075 --> 00:06:30.861
he not only changed
the career trajectories
