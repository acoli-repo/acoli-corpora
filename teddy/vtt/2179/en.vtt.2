00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:03.242
and we were actually faced
with an interesting problem:

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.389
we didn't have enough
women in the workforce.

00:01:06.397 --> 00:01:08.391
And just to give you some context,

00:01:08.415 --> 00:01:11.792
27 percent of women work in India.

00:01:11.816 --> 00:01:13.272
If you look at most of Asia,

00:01:13.296 --> 00:01:15.779
that number is around 48 percent.

00:01:15.803 --> 00:01:18.190
So we knew the numbers were deplorable,

00:01:18.214 --> 00:01:21.196
and it was manifesting itself
in our own organization.

00:01:21.655 --> 00:01:24.819
So we decided -- actually,
I'll just give you a quick example

00:01:24.843 --> 00:01:27.639
of a young engineer, a 25-year-old woman,

00:01:27.663 --> 00:01:29.961
who told us a great story
about her daily life,

00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:33.063
to just exemplify it for us.
