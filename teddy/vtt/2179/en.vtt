00:00:01.373 --> 00:00:04.812
So I've been thinking about
how to explain this concept to you,

00:00:04.836 --> 00:00:08.754
and I've decided I'm just going to start
with something we all understand.

00:00:08.778 --> 00:00:11.292
To achieve great heights
or change the world,

00:00:11.316 --> 00:00:14.201
no matter how smart we are,
we all need people.

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:17.190
And for conventional people,

00:00:17.214 --> 00:00:20.924
the universe seems to conspire
to make them successful.

00:00:21.313 --> 00:00:22.644
For the unconventional,

00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:26.967
I think we need something
that I like to call "co-conspirators."

00:00:27.587 --> 00:00:32.146
Co-conspirators are different
not because they're different themselves,
