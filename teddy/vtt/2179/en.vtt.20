00:09:58.951 --> 00:10:00.911
and we need to find more solutions,

00:10:00.935 --> 00:10:05.299
we need unconventional people
in our boardrooms and at the table.

00:10:05.323 --> 00:10:06.607
For that to happen,

00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:08.377
we need co-conspirators.

00:10:08.789 --> 00:10:09.995
In my own life,

00:10:10.019 --> 00:10:11.649
whether it's because of my gender,

00:10:11.673 --> 00:10:13.707
my ethnicity or sometimes,

00:10:13.731 --> 00:10:17.508
as I've been living in this part
of the world for over a decade, my accent,

00:10:17.532 --> 00:10:20.251
I'm often perceived to be unconventional.

00:10:20.275 --> 00:10:23.467
It's my co-conspirators that have
shown me the path forward,

00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:27.393
and actually, it's my co-conspirators
that keep me seeking out

00:10:27.417 --> 00:10:29.809
the unconventional paths to go down.
