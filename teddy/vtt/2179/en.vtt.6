They identified complex diseases

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:04.474
early enough to be able
to prevent and cure them.

00:03:05.474 --> 00:03:07.037
And then we took them to lunch.

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:10.905
We gave them a lavish lunch
and thanked them for the role they played

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:14.643
for freeing up a young woman
to work shoulder to shoulder with us

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:16.927
to literally change the world.

00:03:17.418 --> 00:03:20.035
There wasn't a dry eye in the room.

00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:23.709
Every one of these women
were grateful and proud.

00:03:23.733 --> 00:03:26.329
They were proud of who
their daughters-in-law were,

00:03:26.353 --> 00:03:30.004
but they were grateful to be included
as part of the conversation.
