00:05:28.373 --> 00:05:30.889
We knew what was keeping
the CEO up at night

00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:33.578
and what he thought
were tailwinds to the business.

00:05:34.717 --> 00:05:37.822
And when we walked into
that presentation later in the day,

00:05:37.846 --> 00:05:42.153
we actually got buy-in with both the CEO

00:05:42.177 --> 00:05:43.957
and his senior staff.

00:05:43.981 --> 00:05:46.960
And it wasn't just because
of our analysis or our strategy.

00:05:46.984 --> 00:05:48.856
It was because we were prepped

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.744
to be able to communicate in a way
that the team could absorb.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.926
Now, this senior colleague of ours
didn't pull us aside,

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.833
because he wanted to gossip.

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:02.356
He pulled us aside because he believed
we were unconventional in the boardroom.
