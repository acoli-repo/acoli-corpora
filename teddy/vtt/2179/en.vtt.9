00:04:29.618 --> 00:04:33.472
a group of us, my peers and I,
were asked to work on a strategy

00:04:33.496 --> 00:04:36.725
for a business that hadn't
been doing too well over the last decade

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:38.111
and was being neglected.

00:04:38.724 --> 00:04:40.536
We put our hearts and souls into it,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.245
and we did a lot of analysis
on our nights and weekends

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:45.794
and put together what we thought
was a good strategy.

00:04:45.818 --> 00:04:48.000
And after presenting it
to a number of people

00:04:48.024 --> 00:04:49.643
that we were getting buy-in with,

00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:52.386
we were actually asked to present
to the global CEO

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.296
at his annual strategy meet
that happened over a week.

00:04:56.947 --> 00:05:00.379
And we were both excited and apprehensive
as we flew into headquarters.
