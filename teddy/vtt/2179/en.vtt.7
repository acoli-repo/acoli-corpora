00:03:26.353 --> 00:03:30.004
but they were grateful to be included
as part of the conversation.

00:03:30.028 --> 00:03:31.389
And I wondered at the time

00:03:31.413 --> 00:03:35.491
whether what we'd done
was just a great touchy-feely moment

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:36.709
and was cute

00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:39.161
but really wasn't going to have
long-term impact.

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:42.364
And a couple of days later,
one of my mentees swung by my office,

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:44.207
and she was super excited.

00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:46.668
She said, "I went home
from work yesterday,

00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:49.773
and I was bracing myself,
because I was really late,

00:03:49.797 --> 00:03:52.136
and I was bracing myself for a lecture,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.938
and my mother-in-law
turned to my husband and said,

00:03:54.962 --> 00:03:57.302
'Can you please get up
and make her a cup of tea?

00:03:57.326 --> 00:03:58.588
She's exhausted.

00:03:58.612 --> 00:04:00.930
She's saving lives. You work at a bank.'"
