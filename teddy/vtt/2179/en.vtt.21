00:10:30.322 --> 00:10:32.592
So what I'd like to ask
of all of you today

00:10:32.616 --> 00:10:34.683
is that you look around
and find the people

00:10:34.707 --> 00:10:36.680
that inspire you to co-conspire.

00:10:37.025 --> 00:10:39.533
I promise you that your empathy

00:10:39.557 --> 00:10:41.279
and your courage

00:10:41.303 --> 00:10:43.022
will change someone's life

00:10:43.046 --> 00:10:45.045
and may even change the world.

00:10:45.496 --> 00:10:46.691
Thank you.

00:10:46.715 --> 00:10:49.428
