00:00:00.904 --> 00:00:05.786
Since 1997, researchers
at the University of Sussex

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.010
have monitored global trends
in armed conflict.

00:00:09.863 --> 00:00:13.043
Their research clearly shows

00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:16.871
that in Africa, over the last 10 years,

00:00:16.895 --> 00:00:20.576
armed conflict has gone up by sevenfold.

00:00:20.927 --> 00:00:22.460
Let's think about that:

00:00:22.847 --> 00:00:26.690
sevenfold in a single decade.

00:00:28.622 --> 00:00:29.772
Why is this?
