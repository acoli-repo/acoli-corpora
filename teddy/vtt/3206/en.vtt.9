running up and down
the beautiful rock formations

00:04:30.144 --> 00:04:32.877
that dot the countryside around his home.

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:36.395
Despite this beauty, Saminu knew

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.140
that the first chance he got,
he would leave.

00:04:40.315 --> 00:04:42.283
He did not want to be a farmer.

00:04:43.431 --> 00:04:48.836
Growing up, he saw his parents
work so hard as farmers,

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.843
but barely get by.

00:04:51.934 --> 00:04:56.339
As he says, they had "babu" -- nothing.

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:03.885
