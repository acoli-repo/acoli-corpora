00:05:26.538 --> 00:05:30.795
Hence, Saminu left to the city,

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.314
where he soon realized
that life was not easy.

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:39.302
He borrowed a very old motorcycle,

00:05:40.276 --> 00:05:43.815
with tires that were
more patches than tires,

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:46.290
to become a motorcycle taxi driver.

00:05:47.553 --> 00:05:51.045
He lived in constant fear every day

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:55.887
that his precious, tattered motorcycle
would be ripped away from him,

00:05:55.911 --> 00:05:57.763
as it had before.

00:05:59.934 --> 00:06:02.806
But he got it back, thankfully.
