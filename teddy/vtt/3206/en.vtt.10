Young farmers like Saminu

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.607
do not have access to the cash

00:05:06.631 --> 00:05:10.058
to buy the farming products
to pair with their hard work

00:05:10.082 --> 00:05:11.882
to be successful.

00:05:14.462 --> 00:05:16.287
When their meager harvest came in,

00:05:16.311 --> 00:05:21.570
desperate for cash, they would sell
most of it at fire-sale prices,

00:05:21.594 --> 00:05:25.724
when, if they could just wait six months,
they could get 50 percent more.

00:05:26.538 --> 00:05:30.795
