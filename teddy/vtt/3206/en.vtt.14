00:06:58.204 --> 00:07:00.847
we simply developed a model

00:07:00.871 --> 00:07:04.307
to bring the professional management
and investment to scale

00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:07.104
to these grassroot leaders.

00:07:08.006 --> 00:07:13.153
We called it "Babban Gona" --
"great farm" in Hausa.

00:07:14.948 --> 00:07:19.519
Upon reaching the village in 2012,

00:07:19.543 --> 00:07:21.805
I traveled from community to community,

00:07:21.829 --> 00:07:25.686
trying to convince people of our idea,

00:07:26.152 --> 00:07:30.535
trying to recruit farmer members.
