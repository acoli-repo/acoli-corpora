00:00:00.362 --> 00:00:04.256
Narrator: We have you here today
specifically to try and learn

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.185
a little bit about how the brain
processes visual illusions.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.765
Wei Ji Ma: My name is Wei Ji Ma.

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:14.094
I'm a professor of neuroscience
and psychology at New York University.

00:00:14.118 --> 00:00:15.269
N: Great.

00:00:15.293 --> 00:00:19.229
WJM: Our research focuses mostly
on perception and decision-making.

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:21.810
What's out there in the world,
the brain has no idea,

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:24.108
but it's trying to do its best
to figure it out.

00:00:24.132 --> 00:00:27.669
And even though that process
is pretty sophisticated,

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:29.922
sometimes it goes wrong.
