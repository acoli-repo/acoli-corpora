00:00:58.371 --> 00:01:01.868
for example, in the areas
of politics, economics or religion?

00:01:01.892 --> 00:01:05.406
WJM: I probably don't want to go that far,
but there's a metaphor there.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.983
It's good to consider
other points of view.

00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:10.003
It's good to consider your own certainty.

00:01:10.027 --> 00:01:13.087
Illusions are merely a window
in this kind of processing

00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:14.516
that's going on all the time,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.914
where our brain builds beliefs
of what might be happening in the world.

00:01:17.938 --> 00:01:20.492
N: What if we looked at
a different illusion every day

00:01:20.516 --> 00:01:22.544
as a reminder that our brains can be wrong

00:01:22.568 --> 00:01:25.083
about the things
we are most certain about?

00:01:26.813 --> 00:01:29.215
WJM: As a scientist,
I wouldn't be able to tell you

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:30.488
that that's going to work,
