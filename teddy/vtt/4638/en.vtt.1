(Glass breaks)

00:00:32.617 --> 00:00:34.885
The first step is that
light enters your eyes.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:36.933
Just from the table
or from the coffee cup,

00:00:36.957 --> 00:00:38.714
you get an image in your eye,

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:41.002
but the hard work only starts after that.

00:00:41.026 --> 00:00:45.115
Very often, the incoming signals
are not complete and they're not perfect,

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:47.338
and your brain has to make sense of them.

00:00:47.362 --> 00:00:49.983
There are cases where
this inference process goes wrong,

00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:52.055
and that's when you have
a visual illusion.

00:00:53.291 --> 00:00:56.975
N: Can visual illusions be proof
that our brains make similar mistakes

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:58.347
about other things,

00:00:58.371 --> 00:01:01.868
for example, in the areas
of politics, economics or religion?
