00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.519
I have a confession to make.

00:00:01.519 --> 00:00:03.309
I'm a business professor

00:00:03.309 --> 00:00:05.839
whose ambition has been
to help people learn to lead.

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.280
But recently, I've discovered

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.239
that what many of us

So along with three co-conspirators,

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.200
I spent nearly a decade observing
up close and personal

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.679
exceptional leaders of innovation.

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.880
We studied 16 men and women,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.439
located in seven countries
across the globe,
