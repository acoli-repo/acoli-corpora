00:10:26.795 --> 00:10:31.686
This generated, on average,
a demobilization every six hours,

00:10:31.686 --> 00:10:35.746
so this was incredible and it was about:
Come home at Christmas.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.001
Then came the peace process,

00:10:41.001 --> 00:10:43.442
and when the peace process started,

00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:45.762
the whole mindset
of the guerrilla changed.

00:10:45.762 --> 00:10:48.087
And it changed because

00:10:48.087 --> 00:10:50.836
it makes you think, "Well,
if there's a peace process,

00:10:50.836 --> 00:10:52.778
this is probably going to be over.

00:10:52.778 --> 00:10:54.890
At some point I'm going to get out."

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.096
And their fears completely changed,

00:10:57.096 --> 00:11:00.324
and their fears were not about,
"Am I going to get killed?"
