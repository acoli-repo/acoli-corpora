00:06:56.435 --> 00:07:02.013
because you can easily recruit
but you can't get the older commanders.

00:07:02.013 --> 00:07:05.696
So we thought, well,
we'll use the same strategy.

00:07:05.696 --> 00:07:08.262
We'll have commanders
talking to commanders.

00:07:08.262 --> 00:07:12.038
And we even went as far
as asking ex-commanders of the guerrilla

00:07:12.038 --> 00:07:14.773
to fly on helicopters with microphones

00:07:14.773 --> 00:07:18.234
telling the people that
used to fight with them,

00:07:18.234 --> 00:07:20.347
"There is a better life out there,"

00:07:20.347 --> 00:07:22.924
"I'm doing good,"
"This is not worth it," etc.

00:07:22.924 --> 00:07:28.030
But, as you can all imagine,
it was very easy to counteract,

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.583
because what was
the guerrilla going to say?
