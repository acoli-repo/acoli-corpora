She had been recruited when she was 15,
and she left when she was 17,

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:33.199
so there were a lot
of other complications,

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.931
but they did eventually meet.

00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:40.206
I don't know if they're together now,
but I can find out. (Laughter)

00:06:40.206 --> 00:06:48.177
But what I can tell you is that
our radio strategy was working.

00:06:48.177 --> 00:06:51.861
The problem is that it was working
in the lower ranks of the guerrilla.

00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:54.224
It was not working with the commanders,

00:06:54.224 --> 00:06:56.435
the people that are
more difficult to replace,

00:06:56.435 --> 00:07:02.013
because you can easily recruit
but you can't get the older commanders.
