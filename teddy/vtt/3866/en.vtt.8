00:03:56.713 --> 00:04:01.173
and from those conversations
came the underlying insight

00:04:01.173 --> 00:04:03.670
that has guided this whole campaign,

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.060
which is that guerrillas are as much
prisoners of their organizations

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.533
as the people they hold hostage.

00:04:11.533 --> 00:04:14.313
And at the beginning, we were
so touched by these stories,

00:04:14.313 --> 00:04:16.596
we were so amazed by these stories,

00:04:16.596 --> 00:04:19.735
that we thought that maybe 
the best way to talk to the guerrillas

00:04:19.735 --> 00:04:22.570
was to have them talk to themselves,

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.354
so we recorded about a hundred
different stories during the first year,

00:04:27.354 --> 00:04:29.722
and we put them on
the radio and television

00:04:29.722 --> 00:04:34.067
so that the guerrillas in the jungle
could hear stories, their stories,
