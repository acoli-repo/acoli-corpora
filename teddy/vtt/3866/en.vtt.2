00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:01.480
by getting into the drug trade,
by illegal mining.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.301
There has been terrorism.
There have been random bombs.

00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:09.576
So it's not good.
It's not really good.

00:01:09.576 --> 00:01:14.376
And if you look at the human cost
of this war over 50 years,

00:01:14.376 --> 00:01:19.197
we have had more than
5.7 million displaced population.

00:01:19.197 --> 00:01:22.265
It's one of the biggest displaced
populations in the world,

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:26.374
and this conflict has cost
over 220,000 lives.

00:01:26.374 --> 00:01:29.432
So it's a little bit like
the Bolívar wars again.

00:01:29.432 --> 00:01:32.587
It's a lot of people who
have died unnecessarily.
