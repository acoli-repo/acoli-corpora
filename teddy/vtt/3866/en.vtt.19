said, "That's really good,
Christmas trees are really cool,

00:09:33.369 --> 00:09:35.899
but you know what?
We really don't walk anymore.

00:09:35.899 --> 00:09:37.351
We use rivers."

00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:40.738
So rivers are the highways of the jungle,

00:09:40.738 --> 00:09:42.935
and this is something we learned,

00:09:42.935 --> 00:09:48.237
and most of the recruiting was being done
in and around the river villages.

00:09:48.237 --> 00:09:50.520
So we went to these river villages,

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.421
and we asked the people,

00:09:52.421 --> 00:09:55.775
and probably some of them were
direct acquaintances of the guerrillas.

00:09:55.775 --> 00:09:59.769
We asked them, "Can you send
guerrillas a message?"

00:09:59.769 --> 00:10:03.159
We collected over 6,000 messages.
