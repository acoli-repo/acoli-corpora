00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:32.209
So how do we know these trees worked?

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.215
Well, we got 331, which is okay,

00:02:34.215 --> 00:02:39.480
but we also know that
not a lot of guerrillas saw them,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.984
but we know that a lot of
guerrillas heard about them,

00:02:41.984 --> 00:02:43.191
and we know this

00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:46.295
because we are constantly talking
to demobilized guerrillas.

00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:49.050
So let me take you back
four years before the trees.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.735
Four years before the trees,
we were approached by the government

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:56.882
to help them come up with
a communications strategy

00:02:56.882 --> 00:03:00.082
to get as many guerrillas
as we could out of the jungle.
