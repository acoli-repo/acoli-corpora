00:01:56.785 --> 00:02:02.412
that we put in nine strategic 
pathways in the jungle

00:02:02.412 --> 00:02:04.421
covered with Christmas lights.

00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:10.599
These trees helped us 
demobilize 331 guerrillas,

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.097
roughly five percent
of the guerrilla force at the time.

00:02:15.097 --> 00:02:17.675
These trees were lit up at night,

00:02:17.675 --> 00:02:20.044
and they had a sign beside them

00:02:20.044 --> 00:02:24.735
that said, "If Christmas can come
to the jungle, you can come home.

00:02:24.735 --> 00:02:26.435
Demobilize.

00:02:26.435 --> 00:02:28.916
At Christmas, everything is possible."

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:32.209
So how do we know these trees worked?
