We didn't understand in Colombia, 
if you live in the cities,

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.803
you're very far away from where 
the war is actually happening,

00:03:34.803 --> 00:03:36.816
so you don't really understand it,

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:38.982
and we asked the government 
to give us access

00:03:38.982 --> 00:03:41.524
to as many demobilized
guerrillas as possible.

00:03:41.524 --> 00:03:43.980
And we talked to about 60 of them

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.074
before we felt we fully
understood the problem.

00:03:49.074 --> 00:03:52.386
We talked about -- they told us why 
they had joined the guerrillas,

00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:55.025
why the left the guerrillas,
what their dreams were,

00:03:55.025 --> 00:03:56.713
what their frustrations were,

00:03:56.713 --> 00:04:01.173
and from those conversations
came the underlying insight
