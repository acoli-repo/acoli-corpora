00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.350
Ten years ago, 
the flame of Vesta went out.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.090
The priestesses knew that they couldn't
keep it a secret.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.761
The future of Rome depended upon it.

00:03:35.761 --> 00:03:38.631
They went to the chief priest
and he opened an investigation

00:03:38.631 --> 00:03:41.179
to discover why the flame had failed.

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.229
Someone came forward and claimed
that one of the Vestals

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.120
was no longer a virgin.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.818
That was the beginning of the end.

00:03:47.818 --> 00:03:51.579
The accused protested her innocence,
but it wasn't enough.

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.380
She was tried and found guilty.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.090
That Vestal's death was meant
to protect the city,

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.809
but Licinia weeps for what has been lost
and for what she knows now.
