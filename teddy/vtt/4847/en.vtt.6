Licinia directs her energy towards
being the best priestess she can be.

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:10.756
She's worried that someday the state
will claim her life for its own purposes

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:13.108
to protect itself from danger.

00:03:13.108 --> 00:03:16.567
Licinia could be accused of incestum,
meaning unchastity,

00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:21.238
at any time and be sacrificed whether
she's innocent or guilty.

00:03:21.238 --> 00:03:26.970

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.350
Ten years ago, 
the flame of Vesta went out.
