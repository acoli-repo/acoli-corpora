00:00:27.662 --> 00:00:30.142
but she won't emerge alive.

00:00:30.142 --> 00:00:32.542
At the threshold, the priestess pauses,

00:00:32.542 --> 00:00:35.172
claims her innocence one last time,

00:00:35.172 --> 00:00:39.351
then enters the chamber never
to be seen again by the Roman people.

00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:42.843
The priestess is one 
of Rome's six Vestal Virgins,

00:00:42.843 --> 00:00:48.342
each carefully selected as children
from Rome's most aristocratic families.

00:00:48.342 --> 00:00:51.203
But now with her death,
there are only five,

00:00:51.203 --> 00:00:53.863
and a new priestess must be chosen.

00:00:53.863 --> 00:00:56.904
The six-year-old Licinia witnessed
the spectacle,

00:00:56.904 --> 00:01:02.143
never suspecting that a few days later,
she'd be chosen as the next Vestal Virgin.
