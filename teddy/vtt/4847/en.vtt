00:00:07.312 --> 00:00:10.691
A lone priestess walks towards
an underground chamber.

00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:14.232
People line the streets to watch
as she proclaims her innocence.

00:00:14.232 --> 00:00:15.472
It doesn't matter.

00:00:15.472 --> 00:00:17.922
She's already been judged
and found guilty.

00:00:17.922 --> 00:00:18.949
The sentence?

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.552
Live burial.

00:00:20.552 --> 00:00:25.052
The underground chamber contains
a portion of bread, water, milk, and oil.

00:00:25.052 --> 00:00:27.662
She will have a lamp, a bed,
and a blanket,

00:00:27.662 --> 00:00:30.142
but she won't emerge alive.
