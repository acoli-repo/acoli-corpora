00:01:29.704 --> 00:01:33.365
Her most important duty is keeping vigil
over the flame of Vesta,

00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:35.716
the virgin goddess of the hearth.

00:01:35.716 --> 00:01:39.595
Vesta doesn't have a statue
like other Roman gods and goddesses.

00:01:39.595 --> 00:01:44.765
Instead, she's represented by the flame
which burns day and night in her temple

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:48.269
located next to the Forum in the center
of the city.

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:52.455
Like all Vestal priestesses, Licinia
spends part of each day on shift,

00:01:52.455 --> 00:01:55.165
watching and tending to the flame.

00:01:55.165 --> 00:01:57.071
The flame represents two things.

00:01:57.071 --> 00:02:01.286
The first is the continuation of Rome
as a power in the world.
