For the Romans, a Vestal's virginity
signaled not only her castitas,

00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:17.156
or modest spirit and body,

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:19.616

00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:29.288
and the safety of Rome itself 
depends upon it.

00:02:29.288 --> 00:02:33.288
Licinia learns to collect water each day
from a nearby fountain
