00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.616
for patients with kidney failure
and other organ diseases,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.240
organ supply has been an issue.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.816
Over the last few decades,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.880
the issue only worsened as organ demand
has exponentially increased.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.696
Currently in the US,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.896
there are close to 115,000 patients

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.680
in need of a lifesaving organ transplant.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.336
By the end of my talk,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.120
one more patient
will be added to this list.
