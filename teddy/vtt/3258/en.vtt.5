00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.600
It's a process of transplanting
animal organs into humans.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.496
You may want to ask, why pig organs?

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.336
Because some pigs carry organs
with similar size and physiology

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.560
to human organs.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.696
Over the last half a century,

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.576
pioneers of transplantation
have tried hard to make it happen,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.480
but with limited to no success.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.280
Why is that?

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.640
Two fundamental hurdles stood in the way.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.416
First is a problem of rejection.
