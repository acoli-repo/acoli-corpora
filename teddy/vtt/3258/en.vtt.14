00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.456
How do we do it?

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.600
It is simple, yet very complex.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.096
We started by making changes
in a pig's cell to make it virus-free

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.896
and human-immune-compatible.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.696
The nucleus of that cell
is then implanted into a pig egg

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.616
and allowed to divide into an embryo.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.936
The resulting embryo is then placed
into the uterus of a surrogate mother

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.000
and allowed to divide into a pig.
