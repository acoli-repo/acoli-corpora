00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.280
and worked with Dr. George Church.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.656
While working in Church's lab,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.360
I started to learn and experiment
with the genetic makeup of mammals.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.456
Among all the experiments,

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.680
one particular one
took me closer to Laika.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.456
In 2013, my colleagues and I
made changes in a human cell

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.936
using a tool you may have heard about

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.496
called CRISPR.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.736
We were one of the first two groups

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.136
to report the successful use
of such a tool in changing our DNA.
