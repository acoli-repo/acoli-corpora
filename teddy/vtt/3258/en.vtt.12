00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:04.136
to report the successful use
of such a tool in changing our DNA.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.680
It was an exciting moment
in scientific discovery.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.136
The gene-editing tool CRISPR
has two components.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.656
It has a scissor called the enzyme CRISPR

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.360
and what is called a guide RNA.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.056
Think about it as genetic scissors
with a microscope.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.176
The microscope is a guide RNA,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.216
which brings the scissors
to the place we want to cut
