00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.000
and allowed to divide into a pig.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.040
Basically, it's a process of cloning.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.616
The piglet then carries organs
whose genetic makeup

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.240
hopefully wouldn't be rejected
by the human immune system.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:49.376
In 2015, our team decided to tackle
the viral transmission problem first.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:55.576
We wanted to take out
all 62 copies of the PERV virus

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.000
from the pig genome,

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.336
but at the time,
it was nearly mission impossible.
