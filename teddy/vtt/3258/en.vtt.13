00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.216
which brings the scissors
to the place we want to cut

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.256
and says, "Here it is,"

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.520
and the enzyme CRISPR just cuts
and repairs the DNA in the way we want.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.936
Shortly after we reported our study,

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.896
physicians at Mass General Hospital
were intrigued by the medical applications

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.496
of our research.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.016
They reached out to us,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.136
and together, we began to see
the potential to use CRISPR

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.760
to solve the organ shortage crisis.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.456
How do we do it?
