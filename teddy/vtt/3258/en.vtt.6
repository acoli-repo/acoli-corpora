00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.416
First is a problem of rejection.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.256
When our immune system
sees a new organ as foreign,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.520
it will reject it.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.720
Second, and this one is specific
to the organs from the pig,

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.176
every pig carries a virus
that is benign to the pig,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.856
but can be transmitted into humans.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.376
It is called the porcine
endogenous retrovirus (PERV),

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.400
and this virus has the potential
to cause a viral epidemic similar to HIV.
