00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.736
That is the place well described
in a lot of legendary stories,

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.400
like the "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.160
That is the place I call home.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.656
Growing up in the mountain,

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.760
I started to have
a strong connection with nature.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.736
This is me when I was seven years old

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.176
standing in front
of an ancient Buddhist temple

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.216
with a monkey on my shoulder.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.816
I still vividly remember
how my friends and I

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.016
would toss peanuts around
to distract the monkeys
