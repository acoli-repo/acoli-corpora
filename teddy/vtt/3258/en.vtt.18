00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.216
Laika represents the first critical step

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.976
in establishing safe xenotransplantation.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.896
It is also a platform

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.896
that we can do further
genetic modification on

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.120
to solve the immunology problem.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.856
Since then, we have created
more than 30 pigs without PERV,

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:25.480
and they may be the most advanced
geno-modified animal living on earth.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.696
We named Laika after the Soviet dog

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.040
who was the first animal
to orbit the earth.
