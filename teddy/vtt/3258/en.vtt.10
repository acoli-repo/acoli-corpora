How is our immune system capable
of fighting off so many pathogens

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.520
but smart enough not to attack ourselves.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.800
Questions like this tormented me.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.720
I know it sounds nerdy,
but you know I'm a scientist.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.256
After college, I decided
I didn't want to just ask the questions,

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.440
I wanted to answer them, so I did.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.616
In 2008, I was lucky enough to be accepted

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.176
into the PhD program at Harvard University

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.280
and worked with Dr. George Church.
