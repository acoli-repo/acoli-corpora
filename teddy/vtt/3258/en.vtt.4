00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.776
Today, I am optimistic to say
that we are on our way there,

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.000
thanks to Laika.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.936
Using gene editing technology,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.816
it's now possible to exquisitely create
a human-transplantable organ

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.400
that can be safely grown in pigs.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.176
Before we jump into the incredible
science that makes it happen,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.600
let's have a better understanding
what xenotransplantation is.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.600
It's a process of transplanting
animal organs into humans.
