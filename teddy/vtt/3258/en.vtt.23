00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.416
The next steps involve
trying to get to the point

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.216
where a human body
won't reject a transplant.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.040
What's involved in solving that?

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.416
Luhan Yang: It's a very
complicated process.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:43.896
So we need to take out
the antigen of the pigs.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.336
In addition, we can learn
a lot from cancer.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.536
How can cancer invade
or circumvent our immune system

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:56.016
so that we can utilize the trick of cancer

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.376
and implement that on the pig organ

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.480
to fool our immune system
to not attack the organ.
