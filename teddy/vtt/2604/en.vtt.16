00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.096
And so we decided
to give it a catchy title,

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.296
and we called it: "Where's The Flux?"

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.400
I will let you work out the acronym.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.880
(Laughter)

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.536
So this isn't the end of the story.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.736
Around the same time
I was writing this paper,

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.896
I met with a colleague
of mine, Jason Wright,

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.136
and he was also writing a paper
on Kepler data.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.336
And he was saying that with Kepler's
extreme precision,

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.216
it could actually detect
alien megastructures around stars,

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.440
but it didn't.
