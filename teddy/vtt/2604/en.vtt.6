00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.416
And so, for example, let's take Jupiter.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.576
Planets don't get
much bigger than Jupiter.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.376
Jupiter will make a one percent drop
in a star's brightness.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.576
Earth, on the other hand,
is 11 times smaller than Jupiter,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.416
and the signal
is barely visible in the data.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.720
So back to our mystery.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.400
A few years ago, Planet Hunters were
sifting through data looking for transits,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.160
and they spotted a mysterious signal
coming from the star KIC 8462852.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.936
The observations in May of 2009
were the first they spotted,
