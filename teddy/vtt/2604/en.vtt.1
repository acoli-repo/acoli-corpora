WEBVTT

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.400
It began in 2009 with the launch
of NASA's Kepler mission.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.056
Kepler's main scientific objective

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.056
was to find planets
outside of our solar system.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.656
It did this by staring
at a single field in the sky,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.520
this one, with all the tiny boxes.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.896
And in this one field,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.336
it monitored the brightness
of over 150,000 stars

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.776
continuously for four years,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.440
taking a data point every 30 minutes.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.496
It was looking for what
astronomers call a transit.
