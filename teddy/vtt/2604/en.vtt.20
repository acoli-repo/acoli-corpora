00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.216
So they would go
and build huge structures.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.016
These giant megastructures,

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.760
like ginormous solar panels,
are called Dyson spheres.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.736
This image above

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.936
are lots of artists' impressions
of Dyson spheres.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.976
It's really hard to provide perspective
on the vastness of these things,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.816
but you can think of it this way.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.880
The Earth-Moon distance
is a quarter of a million miles.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.936
The simplest element
on one of these structures

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.400
is 100 times that size.
