00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.400
is 100 times that size.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.720
They're enormous.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.496
And now imagine one of these structures
in motion around a star.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.616
You can see how it would produce
anomalies in the data

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.856
such as uneven, unnatural looking dips.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.856
But it remains that even
alien megastructures

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.296
cannot defy the laws of physics.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.760
You see, anything that uses
a lot of energy

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.560
is going to produce heat,
