My colleague, Debra Fischer,
founder of the Planet Hunters project,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.736
said that people at the time were saying,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.880
"You're crazy. There's no way
that a computer will miss a signal."

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.776
And so it was on, the classic
human versus machine gamble.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.976
And if we found one planet,
we would be thrilled.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.456
When I joined the team four years ago,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.920
we had already found a couple.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.016
And today, with the help
of over 300,000 science enthusiasts,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.816
we have found dozens,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.096
and we've also found
one of the most mysterious stars
