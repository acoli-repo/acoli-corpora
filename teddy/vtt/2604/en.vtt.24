Personally, as a scientist,
my money is on the natural explanation.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.360
But don't get me wrong, I do think
it would be awesome to find aliens.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:11.320
Either way, there is something new
and really interesting to discover.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.896
So what happens next?

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.576
We need to continue to observe this star

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.016
to learn more about what's happening.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.616
But professional astronomers, like me,

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.456
we have limited resources
for this kind of thing,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.400
and Kepler is on to a different mission.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.616
And I'm happy to say that once again,
