00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.456
First, somebody said, you know,
what if this star was very young

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.080
and it still had the cloud of material
it was born from surrounding it.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.456
And then somebody else said,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.256
well, what if the star
had already formed planets,

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.496
and two of these planets had collided,

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.640
similar to the Earth-Moon forming event.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.976
Well, both of these theories
could explain part of the data,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.416
but the difficulties were that the star
showed no signs of being young,

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.376
and there was no glow
from any of the material

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.496
that was heated up by the star's light,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.376
and you would expect this
if the star was young

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.960
or if there was a collision
and a lot of dust was produced.
