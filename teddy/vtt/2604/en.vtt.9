00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.016
We described this feature
as both smooth and clean.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.056
It also is asymmetric,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.736
having a gradual dimming
that lasts almost a week,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.920
and then it snaps right back up to normal
in just a matter of days.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.176
And again, after this, not much happens

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.896
until February of 2013.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.536
Things start to get really crazy.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.056
There is a huge complex of dips
in the light curve that appear,

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.216
and they last for like a hundred days,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.480
all the way up
into the Kepler mission's end.
