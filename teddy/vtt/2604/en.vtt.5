00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.096
and we've also found
one of the most mysterious stars

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.320
in our galaxy.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.496
So to understand this,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.720
let me show you what a normal transit
in Kepler data looks like.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.056
On this graph on the left-hand side
you have the amount of light,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.936
and on the bottom is time.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.016
The white line
is light just from the star,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.416
what astronomers call a light curve.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.296
Now, when a planet transits a star,
it blocks out a little bit of this light,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.776
and the depth of this transit
reflects the size of the object itself.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.416
And so, for example, let's take Jupiter.
