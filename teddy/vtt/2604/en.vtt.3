At the same time
of the first data release,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.200
astronomers at Yale
were wondering an interesting thing:

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.600
What if computers missed something?

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.720
And so we launched the citizen
science project called Planet Hunters

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.960
to have people look at the same data.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.376
The human brain has an amazing ability
for pattern recognition,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.616
sometimes even better than a computer.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.176
However, there was a lot
of skepticism around this.
