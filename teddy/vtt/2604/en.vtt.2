00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.496
It was looking for what
astronomers call a transit.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.536
This is when the planet's orbit
is aligned in our line of sight,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.696
just so that the planet
crosses in front of a star.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.096
And when this happens,
it blocks out a tiny bit of starlight,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.840
which you can see as a dip in this curve.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.016
And so the team at NASA
had developed very sophisticated computers

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.760
to search for transits
in all the Kepler data.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.056
At the same time
of the first data release,
