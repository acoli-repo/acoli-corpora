00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.656
And what's more exciting

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.320
is that there's more data to come.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.176
There are new missions that are coming up

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.880
that are observing millions more stars

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.240
all over the sky.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:19.800
And just think: What will it mean
when we find another star like this?

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.600
And what will it mean
if we don't find another star like this?

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.496
Thank you.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:33.441
