00:05:29.327 --> 00:05:33.767
has an area of over 1,000 times
the area of our planet Earth.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.440
This is truly remarkable.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.736
And so the citizen scientists,
when they saw this,

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.456
they notified the science team
that they found something weird enough

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.920
that it might be worth following up.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.736
And so when the science team looked at it,

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.141
we're like, "Yeah, there's probably
just something wrong with the data."

00:05:52.165 --> 00:05:54.696
But we looked really, really, really hard,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.120
and the data were good.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.776
And so what was happening
had to be astrophysical,
