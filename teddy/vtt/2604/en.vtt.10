00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.480
all the way up
into the Kepler mission's end.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.256
These dips have variable shapes.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.496
Some are very sharp, and some are broad,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.776
and they also have variable durations.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.960
Some last just for a day or two,
and some for more than a week.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.456
And there's also up and down trends
within some of these dips,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.160
almost like several independent events
were superimposed on top of each other.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:27.136
And at this time, this star drops
in its brightness over 20 percent.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.303
This means that whatever
is blocking its light

00:05:29.327 --> 00:05:33.767
has an area of over 1,000 times
the area of our planet Earth.
