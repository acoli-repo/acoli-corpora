00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.216
it had this strange slope
that you can see on the left side.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.576
This seemed to indicate

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.976
that whatever was getting in the way
and blocking the starlight

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.920
was not circular like a planet.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.136
There are few more dips that happened,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.520
but for a couple of years,
it was pretty quiet.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.560
And then in March of 2011, we see this.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.216
The star's light drops
by a whole 15 percent,

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.416
and this is huge compared to a planet,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.440
which would only make a one percent drop.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.016
We described this feature
as both smooth and clean.
