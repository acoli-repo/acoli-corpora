00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.480
And then I showed him this weird data
that our citizen scientists had found,

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:36.775
and he said to me,

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.576
"Aw crap, Tabby.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.559
Now I have to rewrite my paper."

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.640
So yes, the natural
explanations were weak,

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.056
and we were curious now.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.256
So we had to find a way
to rule out aliens.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.136
So together, we convinced
a colleague of ours

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.416
who works on SETI, the Search
for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.360
that this would be
an extraordinary target to pursue.
