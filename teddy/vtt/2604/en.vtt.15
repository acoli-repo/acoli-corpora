00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.776
And these are only the comets

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.416
that happen to pass
between us and the star.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.896
And so in reality, we're talking
thousands to tens of thousands of comets.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.376
But of all the bad ideas we had,

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.536
this one was the best.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.496
And so we went ahead
and published our findings.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.736
Now, let me tell you, this was one
of the hardest papers I ever wrote.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.096
Scientists are meant to publish results,

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.280
and this situation was far from that.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.096
And so we decided
to give it a catchy title,
