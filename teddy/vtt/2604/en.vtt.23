But if we're already invoking aliens
in this explanation,

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.776
then who is to say they didn't
efficiently clean up all this mess

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.336
for recycling purposes?

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.376
(Laughter)

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.360
You can see how this quickly
captures your imagination.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.016
Well, there you have it.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.256
We're in a situation that could unfold

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.696
to be a natural phenomenon
we don't understand

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.280
or an alien technology
we don't understand.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.840
Personally, as a scientist,
my money is on the natural explanation.
