The observations in May of 2009
were the first they spotted,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.818
and they started talking about this
in the discussion forums.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.416
They said and object like Jupiter

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.336
would make a drop like this
in the star's light,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.696
but they were also saying it was giant.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.936
You see, transits normally
only last for a few hours,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.080
and this one lasted for almost a week.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.416
They were also saying
that it looks asymmetric,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.696
meaning that instead of the clean,
U-shaped dip that we saw with Jupiter,

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.216
it had this strange slope
that you can see on the left side.
