00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.816
and we don't observe this.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.536
But it could be something as simple

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.016
as they're just reradiating it away
in another direction,

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.240
just not at Earth.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.440
Another idea that's one
of my personal favorites

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.096
is that we had just witnessed
an interplanetary space battle

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.120
and the catastrophic
destruction of a planet.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.776
Now, I admit that this
would produce a lot of dust

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.696
that we don't observe.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.056
But if we're already invoking aliens
in this explanation,
