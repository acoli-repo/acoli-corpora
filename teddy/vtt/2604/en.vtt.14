00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.960
or if there was a collision
and a lot of dust was produced.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.416
And so somebody else said,

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.416
well, how about a huge swarm of comets

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.096
that are passing by this star
in a very elliptical orbit?

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.520
Well, it ends up that this is actually
consistent with our observations.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.256
But I agree, it does feel
a little contrived.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.576
You see, it would take hundreds of comets

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.240
to reproduce what we're observing.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.776
And these are only the comets
