00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We live in difficult and challenging

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
economic times, of course.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And one of the first victims

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of difficult economic times,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I think, is public spending of any kind,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but certainly in the firing line at the moment

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is public spending for science,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and particularly curiosity-led science

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and exploration.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So I want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that that's a ridiculous

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and ludicrous thing to do.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But I think to set the scene,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I want to show -- the next slide is not my attempt
