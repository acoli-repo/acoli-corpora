00:12:28.339 --> 00:12:31.631
and it's that work that defines System 2.

00:12:32.117 --> 00:12:35.546
The thinking of System 2,
that slower thinking,

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:39.094
is effortful and it's focused,

00:12:39.118 --> 00:12:41.986
which means that when
you're doing one thing

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:43.515
you're severely impaired,

00:12:43.539 --> 00:12:47.619
or in some cases quite incapable
of doing other things.

00:12:47.643 --> 00:12:53.231
So you couldn't compute 17 times 14
while taking a left turn into traffic --

00:12:53.255 --> 00:12:56.962
and you'd better not try,
because it would blind you, actually --

00:12:56.986 --> 00:13:01.387
if you went on with a computation,
you might not see traffic.
