but her actual GPA is more likely to be --

00:10:00.298 --> 00:10:04.667
DK: The best guess about her GPA
is that it's slightly above average

00:10:04.691 --> 00:10:07.151
but very slightly above average.

00:10:07.175 --> 00:10:08.744
That's the best guess,

00:10:08.768 --> 00:10:15.275
because indeed, reading age
is an inferior cue to a person's GPA,

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:21.480
and yet intuitively, we predict
as if we could predict perfectly,

00:10:21.504 --> 00:10:23.541
on the basis of weak evidence.

00:10:23.565 --> 00:10:27.318
That was one of the major findings
of our early research.

00:10:27.696 --> 00:10:29.542
CA: So this work, and much more --

00:10:29.566 --> 00:10:32.900
you've had many other
superproductive partnerships --
