00:14:37.882 --> 00:14:40.833
What we can do, maybe,

00:14:40.857 --> 00:14:45.288
is when you realize you're in a situation

00:14:45.312 --> 00:14:48.659
where you know that you're likely
to make a mistake --

00:14:49.436 --> 00:14:52.055
slow down and use System 2.

00:14:52.079 --> 00:14:54.984

CA: So whoever came up with "count to 10
before losing your temper" had a point.
