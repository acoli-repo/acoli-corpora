00:11:58.987 --> 00:12:00.172
and you drive,

00:12:00.196 --> 00:12:02.487
it's System 1-type behavior.

00:12:02.511 --> 00:12:06.354
Emotions are part
of that fast reaction system.

00:12:06.866 --> 00:12:09.355
But it's both emotion and skills.

00:12:10.276 --> 00:12:15.786
And then, you have another system,
another way of thinking,

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:22.778
which is exemplified by what happens
if I ask you to multiply 17 by four.

00:12:23.434 --> 00:12:24.625
Now, you can do it,

00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:26.133
you can do it in your head,

00:12:26.157 --> 00:12:28.315
but it will take you some work,

00:12:28.339 --> 00:12:31.631
and it's that work that defines System 2.
