00:05:58.466 --> 00:06:00.317
DK: And so we had a heated argument --

00:06:00.341 --> 00:06:03.697
the Israelis like to argue
and it was one of those arguments

00:06:03.721 --> 00:06:09.609
where, you know, no quarter is given
but people really quite like each other.

00:06:09.633 --> 00:06:13.581
At the end of that argument,
we decided we wanted to pursue it.

00:06:14.097 --> 00:06:16.362
And I think I won the argument,

00:06:16.386 --> 00:06:21.207
so Amos was interested in following up
the ideas that I had expressed,

00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:25.397
and then we got together
and we started collaborating.

00:06:25.925 --> 00:06:29.295
And then, eventually, fairly quickly,

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:32.069
we discovered that we really
liked each other
