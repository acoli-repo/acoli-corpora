00:01:27.184 --> 00:01:32.474
CA: My goal today is to talk with Danny
about how we view our own minds.

00:01:33.114 --> 00:01:36.722
He's been examining human behavior
for close to 60 years,

00:01:36.746 --> 00:01:38.460
so what an incredible opportunity

00:01:38.484 --> 00:01:41.806
to look back on some of the insights
he's gained over that time

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.034
and discuss how they apply
to our modern age.

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:47.035
Danny, welcome.

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:49.356
DK: It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:49.697 --> 00:01:51.844
CA: Danny, you've had
this extraordinary life.

00:01:51.868 --> 00:01:53.201
You're in your 80s now.

00:01:53.225 --> 00:01:57.462
Tell us a bit about what put you
on this path in the first place.

00:01:58.228 --> 00:02:02.506
DK: I think I've been a psychologist
since I was a child.
