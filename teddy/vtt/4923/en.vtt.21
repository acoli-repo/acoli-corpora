you've had many other
superproductive partnerships --

00:10:32.924 --> 00:10:37.677
eventually led, really, to the field
of behavioral economics' flourishing.

00:10:38.042 --> 00:10:43.170
DK: Well, I'm sometimes described
as among the founding fathers

00:10:43.194 --> 00:10:44.582
of behavioral economics.

00:10:44.606 --> 00:10:45.954
I am not.

00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:49.686
I can't accept
the credit for that paternity.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.177
I'm sort of the godfather.

00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:56.344
The real father of behavioral
economics is Richard Thaler,

00:10:56.368 --> 00:11:00.005
who got the Nobel Prize this year
and is my best living friend.
