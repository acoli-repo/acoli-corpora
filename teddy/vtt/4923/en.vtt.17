00:08:25.951 --> 00:08:30.045
CA: That's possibly because
I don't know what the GPA stands for.

00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:33.204
DK: That's right,
you didn't go to school here.

00:08:33.642 --> 00:08:35.014
I'll tell you what happens,

00:08:35.038 --> 00:08:39.292
because it's an example
of how intuition works.

00:08:39.316 --> 00:08:44.504
So you hear she was a precocious reader --

00:08:44.528 --> 00:08:46.216
quite a precocious reader.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.134
And you have an impression
of how precocious she was.

00:08:49.648 --> 00:08:51.791
It's not that you're
thinking in percentiles,

00:08:51.815 --> 00:08:54.703
but you have an impression
of how strong it is.

00:08:54.727 --> 00:08:57.704
And let's say it is in percentiles,

00:08:57.728 --> 00:08:59.363
so she is somewhere --

00:08:59.387 --> 00:09:01.814
maybe the 95th percentile.
