00:02:55.592 --> 00:03:00.898
it was 1941, there was a curfew for Jews,

00:03:00.922 --> 00:03:03.598
and we had to wear a Star of David --

00:03:03.622 --> 00:03:08.727
a yellow star for which
we had to pay with coupons --

00:03:08.751 --> 00:03:10.326
the coupons for clothing.

00:03:10.665 --> 00:03:15.912
And I was visiting a friend
of mine and playing,

00:03:15.936 --> 00:03:19.020
and I was told it was
about seven o'clock --

00:03:19.044 --> 00:03:20.845
I had missed the curfew.

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:23.500
So I put on my sweater inside out

00:03:23.524 --> 00:03:24.838
and I walked home.

00:03:24.862 --> 00:03:27.131
And not far from home --

00:03:27.155 --> 00:03:29.590
it was a deserted street --

00:03:29.614 --> 00:03:33.907
I saw somebody walking toward me
and he was a German soldier.
