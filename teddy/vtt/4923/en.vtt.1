00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:37.770
but in psychology and beyond.

The thing about Danny
is that he understands,

00:00:41.157 --> 00:00:43.517
more than pretty much anyone,

00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:46.511
just how weird our minds are.

00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:50.774
And that means that he has something
unexpected and fascinating to say

00:00:50.798 --> 00:00:53.471
about almost every psychological topic,

00:00:53.495 --> 00:00:56.019
on everything from decision-making

00:00:56.043 --> 00:00:57.959
through to something like happiness.
