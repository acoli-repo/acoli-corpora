DK: I think I've been a psychologist
since I was a child.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.173
I really --

00:02:04.197 --> 00:02:06.018
I always blame my mother for it,

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:08.312
or give her credit for it.

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:12.487
She was a very interesting gossip
and I loved to follow her gossip --

00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:14.900
the sense that people are very interesting

00:02:14.924 --> 00:02:16.389
and very complicated

00:02:16.413 --> 00:02:18.998
and that nothing was black or white.

00:02:19.327 --> 00:02:20.702
I spent a lot of time --

00:02:20.726 --> 00:02:22.687
and I had a lot of time during the war --

00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:24.800
I spent the war years in France --

00:02:24.824 --> 00:02:26.754
CA: Under Nazi occupation?

00:02:26.778 --> 00:02:30.804
DK: Yes, under Nazi occupation
in [unclear] Southern France,
