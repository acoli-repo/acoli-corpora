and he hugged me very tight,

00:04:00.788 --> 00:04:04.500

and took a wallet out

00:04:04.524 --> 00:04:08.159

So that was a story that fit
with what my mother was telling me

00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:16.348
about people being very complicated

00:04:16.372 --> 00:04:18.600
and nothing being quite black or white.

00:04:19.123 --> 00:04:21.744
CA: No one who you think is evil

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.173
DK: That's right, that sort of thing.

00:04:27.197 --> 00:04:29.551
CA: And so this idea
of the nuance of human nature

00:04:29.575 --> 00:04:31.614
really does seem to have been a foundation
