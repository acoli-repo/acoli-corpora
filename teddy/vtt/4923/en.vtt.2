(TED2010) Daniel Kahneman: There is a huge
wave of interest in happiness

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.441
among researchers.

00:01:03.465 --> 00:01:05.385
There is a lot of happiness coaching --

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.620
everybody would like
to make people happier.

00:01:07.644 --> 00:01:11.562
But there are several cognitive traps
that sort of make it almost impossible

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:13.477
to think straight about happiness,

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:17.053
and the first of these traps
is a reluctance to admit complexity.

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:22.705
It turns out that the word "happiness"
is just not a useful word anymore,

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.380
because we apply it
to too many different things.

00:01:27.184 --> 00:01:32.474
CA: My goal today is to talk with Danny
about how we view our own minds.
