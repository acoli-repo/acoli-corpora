00:10:56.368 --> 00:11:00.005
who got the Nobel Prize this year
and is my best living friend.

00:11:00.502 --> 00:11:01.908
I think he's a genius,

00:11:01.932 --> 00:11:06.010
I think that the Nobel Prize was overdue

00:11:06.034 --> 00:11:08.540
and I'm very, very happy he got it.

00:11:09.337 --> 00:11:12.322
CA: In the way that you have
described your thinking

00:11:12.346 --> 00:11:14.552
in the book that you published
a few years ago,

00:11:14.576 --> 00:11:17.172
"Thinking Fast and Slow,"

00:11:17.196 --> 00:11:21.965
you talk about these two different
systems of thinking that humans have.

00:11:21.989 --> 00:11:24.073
Can you elaborate on that a bit?

00:11:24.097 --> 00:11:27.419
DK: Yeah, you know,
it's intuitively very obvious

00:11:27.443 --> 00:11:32.713
that there are two quite different
ways in which thoughts come to mind.
