00:16:59.233 --> 00:17:01.901
The emotional memory that we keep --

00:17:01.925 --> 00:17:03.851
how much we like the memory,

00:17:03.875 --> 00:17:05.822
how much we hate it --

00:17:05.846 --> 00:17:09.367
that's very strongly affected
by how it ends,

00:17:09.391 --> 00:17:10.854
how the episode ended,

00:17:10.878 --> 00:17:14.480
like the screech
at the end of the symphony.

00:17:14.504 --> 00:17:19.350
And it's completely insensitive
to the duration of the experience,

00:17:19.374 --> 00:17:21.839
so, almost completely insensitive.

00:17:21.863 --> 00:17:26.383
So how we feel about memories
really doesn't correspond

00:17:26.407 --> 00:17:29.137
to essential aspects of experience.

00:17:29.161 --> 00:17:30.805
