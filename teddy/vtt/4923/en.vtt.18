00:08:59.387 --> 00:09:01.814
maybe the 95th percentile.

00:09:02.274 --> 00:09:06.847
Now, you also have an idea
about the distribution of GPA.

00:09:08.113 --> 00:09:14.454
And if you picked the 95th percentile
for Julie's reading ability,

00:09:15.448 --> 00:09:20.051
you find the GPA
which is also the 95th percentile.

00:09:21.092 --> 00:09:23.480
And that's the number
that comes to your mind.

00:09:23.928 --> 00:09:26.748
Now this is a very complex calculation.

00:09:26.772 --> 00:09:29.884
Nobody's aware that this is what they did,

00:09:29.908 --> 00:09:32.025
but in fact, this is what they do.
