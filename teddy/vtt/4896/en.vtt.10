00:04:53.854 --> 00:05:00.358
and life -- every living thing that you
see is the result of the action

00:05:00.382 --> 00:05:02.602
of a single molecule

00:05:02.626 --> 00:05:08.066
or two molecules or something,
depending on what kind of organism it is.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:15.057
So this submicroscopic entity
commands vast resources.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.276
Now, humans take this
to a wholly different level,

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.022
where we are capable of becoming
cosmically significant,

00:05:23.046 --> 00:05:26.522
not just dominating
the surface of a planet,

00:05:26.546 --> 00:05:29.518
but dominating the galaxy and further out.
