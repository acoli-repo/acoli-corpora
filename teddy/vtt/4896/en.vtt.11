CA: Well, how so?

00:05:31.673 --> 00:05:35.863
You mean by kind of Star Trek-like
exploration or something else?

00:05:35.887 --> 00:05:39.762
DD: Yes, Star Trek,
or rather, colonization.

00:05:40.282 --> 00:05:42.289
It's what we do.

00:05:43.147 --> 00:05:49.847
Humans evolved, unlike
all other existing organisms,

00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:53.936
to find new environments

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.141
which are initially lethal to them

00:05:57.165 --> 00:06:01.206
and to change the environment
such that they can live comfortably there.
