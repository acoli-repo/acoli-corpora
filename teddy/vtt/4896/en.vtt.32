00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:05.270
But we know that human-type knowledge,
explanatory knowledge, can do that.

00:16:05.294 --> 00:16:06.926
CA: That's really powerful.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.942
So what happened at some point
along the evolutionary chain is

00:16:09.966 --> 00:16:11.411
these minds were created

00:16:11.435 --> 00:16:14.682
that were capable of a different,
more powerful kind of knowledge,

00:16:14.706 --> 00:16:15.872
explanatory knowledge.

00:16:15.896 --> 00:16:20.496
So this seems to me to come right,
then, to the heart of why you believe

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.974
we are not just chemical scum.

00:16:22.998 --> 00:16:25.235
And to me,

00:16:25.259 --> 00:16:27.709
it's a profoundly inspiring
view in many ways,

00:16:27.733 --> 00:16:29.640
of how we can think of who we are,

00:16:29.664 --> 00:16:31.828
which is that, for whatever reason,
