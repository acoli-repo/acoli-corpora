00:14:59.157 --> 00:15:04.267
Now, humans can transcend that
in at least two ways.

00:15:04.847 --> 00:15:10.101
One is that the amount
of information in our brains

00:15:10.125 --> 00:15:13.633
is vastly more than the amount in our DNA.

00:15:14.268 --> 00:15:17.974
So the DNA has built up knowledge
by evolution and so on,

00:15:17.998 --> 00:15:20.903
but we have added to that,

00:15:20.927 --> 00:15:24.291
both by culture
and by individual thinking.

00:15:24.315 --> 00:15:29.672
And the brain simply holds more
bits of information than DNA does.

00:15:29.696 --> 00:15:32.561
And the other thing is,
which is more important,
