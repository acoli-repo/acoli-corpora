In a book called "The Fabric of Reality,"

00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.724
David argued that the way in which
we think of knowledge

00:02:04.748 --> 00:02:07.050
as broken up into all these
different fields

00:02:07.074 --> 00:02:08.235
is misguided.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.169
Actually, all of knowledge is connected,

00:02:10.193 --> 00:02:13.783
and if we spent a bit more time
understanding those connections,

00:02:13.807 --> 00:02:15.998
understanding the context of what we know,

00:02:16.022 --> 00:02:18.715
that is where real
understanding comes from,

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.784
where the real breakthroughs come from.

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:24.323
Believe it or not, I honestly think
it was reading that book

00:02:24.347 --> 00:02:27.615
that finally gave me the courage,
18 years ago, to leave my company

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.344
and take over leadership of TED,
