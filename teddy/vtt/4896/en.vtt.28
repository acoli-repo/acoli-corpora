00:13:59.014 --> 00:14:01.315
from the philosopher Karl Popper,

00:14:01.339 --> 00:14:04.551
who spoke of knowledge
without a knowing subject.

00:14:05.067 --> 00:14:09.536
And the two main types of knowledge
that he was interested in

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.864
were scientific knowledge
in human minds on the one hand

00:14:13.888 --> 00:14:19.796
and knowledge in the form
of adaptations in genes

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.773
of living organisms

00:14:21.797 --> 00:14:22.977
on the other hand.

00:14:23.001 --> 00:14:28.290
Now, that second type of knowledge
is not knowledge in a knowing subject.

00:14:28.314 --> 00:14:34.656
But nevertheless, it's information
that is spectacularly honed
