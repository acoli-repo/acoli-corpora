00:03:29.546 --> 00:03:32.022
We started thinking
we were the center of everything,

00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:34.974
and then we gradually discovered
that, no, we're just a planet

00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:36.149
revolving around a star,

00:03:36.173 --> 00:03:39.197
and then that star is just one
of a hundred billion in a galaxy,

00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:42.284
and that galaxy is one
of hundreds of billions of other galaxies,

00:03:42.308 --> 00:03:43.477
and goodness knows ...

00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:46.751
We become, very quickly,
completely insignificant.

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.045
You, I think, disagree
with that characterization.

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.291
Explain why.

00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:54.807
DD: I do, and you're right
that that's the prevailing view,

00:03:54.831 --> 00:03:57.672
because that's the view
that's kind of forced on us

00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:01.085
by a narrow conception of what science is.
