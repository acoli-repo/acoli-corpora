00:07:58.696 --> 00:08:01.244
which tells them that there’s life here.

00:08:01.268 --> 00:08:04.819
And then they would detect, if they
kept watching the Earth for a while --

00:08:04.843 --> 00:08:08.918
I mean, I'm kind of imagining them
with technology similar to ours --

00:08:08.942 --> 00:08:11.474
they could detect more
if they had better technology.

00:08:11.498 --> 00:08:15.355
But if they watched the Earth
for a couple of decades,

00:08:15.379 --> 00:08:18.228
they would see that the mean
temperature of the planet

00:08:18.252 --> 00:08:21.158
is changing faster than it possibly could.

00:08:21.855 --> 00:08:26.085
Only artificial intervention can change
the temperature of the Earth

00:08:26.109 --> 00:08:28.172
as fast as it has been changing.

00:08:28.196 --> 00:08:33.323
This is inexplicable without the presence
of intelligent beings.
