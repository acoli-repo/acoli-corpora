What you're saying is,
"It is, in principle, possible

00:09:32.674 --> 00:09:36.086
for this species that has evolved on Earth

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.435
to have a future that is imaginable --

00:09:39.459 --> 00:09:41.672
it may not happen, but it is imaginable --

00:09:41.696 --> 00:09:47.315
where it can become indefinitely more
influential in our solar system,

00:09:47.339 --> 00:09:50.363
eventually, maybe our galaxy,
and maybe beyond that."

00:09:50.387 --> 00:09:55.379
And so it's that fact that
that is possible in principle,

00:09:55.403 --> 00:09:59.045
which creates this anchor,
this fundamental idea that knowledge --

00:09:59.069 --> 00:10:04.624
there's no limit to how powerful
an influence it can eventually have,
