00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.344
and take over leadership of TED,

00:02:30.368 --> 00:02:34.133
which back then was
an annual conference in California,

00:02:34.157 --> 00:02:37.807
devoted to bringing together
technology, entertainment and design.

00:02:38.173 --> 00:02:40.156
You see, if Deutsch was right,

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.971
the sharing of accessible knowledge
between different disciplines

00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:45.987
wasn't just a short-term fad

00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:49.075
and wasn't just limited
to those three subjects.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.717
It was something
the world would always need.

00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:54.276
So, he inspired me to take the leap.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.475
And here we are.

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.672
And honestly, David, it's an honor
to be speaking with you today.

00:02:58.696 --> 00:02:59.880
Welcome.

00:02:59.904 --> 00:03:04.396
DD: Well, it's very nice to be here,
and thanks for the dramatic introduction.
