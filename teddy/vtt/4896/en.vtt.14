well, already that's sounding
a little silly,

00:07:02.016 --> 00:07:03.461
that's science fiction anyway,

00:07:03.485 --> 00:07:06.117
and how can that possibly mean much?

00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:09.871
But your whole second book,
this idea of "The Beginning of Infinity,"

00:07:09.895 --> 00:07:14.514
is arguing that knowledge,
in principle, has infinite reach,

00:07:14.538 --> 00:07:17.308
and therefore, if you don't include that
in your worldview,

00:07:17.332 --> 00:07:21.720
you are missing out on something
fundamentally important.

00:07:21.744 --> 00:07:27.611
Talk a bit more about how
we could think of that reach of knowledge.

00:07:27.635 --> 00:07:31.277
DD: Perhaps it's more illuminating
to think of this the other way around.
