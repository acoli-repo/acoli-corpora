and to change the environment
such that they can live comfortably there.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.389
Here I am, sitting in Oxford,

00:06:03.413 --> 00:06:08.802
and if it weren't for technology,
I would die within hours,

00:06:09.257 --> 00:06:12.360
because without clothes, without shelter,

00:06:12.384 --> 00:06:17.744
without medical attention,
without sources of food from far away,

00:06:17.768 --> 00:06:20.686
I would be very hard put to it to forage.

00:06:21.133 --> 00:06:26.543
And the territory here supported
only a tiny number of people

00:06:26.567 --> 00:06:28.432
in the early days of our species,

00:06:28.456 --> 00:06:30.918
whereas now, it supports tens of millions.
