00:14:28.314 --> 00:14:34.656
But nevertheless, it's information
that is spectacularly honed

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:38.141
for its ability to cause physical effects.

00:14:38.165 --> 00:14:43.625
So, the genes for the eye can cause
physical effects of focusing,

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:46.839
which can then change
the trajectory of the animal,

00:14:46.863 --> 00:14:49.324
which can then make it kill another animal

00:14:49.348 --> 00:14:51.948
or escape from another animal and so on.

00:14:52.442 --> 00:14:57.449
And the program in DNA
has punched above its weight

00:14:57.473 --> 00:14:59.133
by a vast factor.

00:14:59.157 --> 00:15:04.267
Now, humans can transcend that
in at least two ways.
