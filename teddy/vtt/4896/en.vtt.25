00:12:28.577 --> 00:12:31.188
because it's been evolving
for exactly as long

00:12:31.212 --> 00:12:33.577
from the original source of life on Earth.

00:12:33.601 --> 00:12:39.301
So there is no special status in biology

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:40.958
to humans,

00:12:40.982 --> 00:12:43.910
and we should come off our high horse."

00:12:43.934 --> 00:12:46.312
Now, the implication of what
you're saying is,

00:12:46.336 --> 00:12:47.924
actually, that's not quite right;

00:12:47.948 --> 00:12:53.049
that knowledge, which somehow became
part of the human evolutionary story

00:12:53.073 --> 00:12:54.247
at some point,

00:12:54.271 --> 00:12:59.279
is special and allows this
particular species to do things

00:12:59.303 --> 00:13:02.014
that are not just a different
kind of thing from others,
