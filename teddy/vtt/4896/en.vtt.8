00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:01.085
by a narrow conception of what science is.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.466
According to that view,
you classify things in the universe

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.443
in a sort of hierarchy
of more massive and powerful

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:12.925
versus less massive,

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:14.102
and so on.

00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:18.368
And so, we're used to the fact
that the big objects,

00:04:18.392 --> 00:04:23.768
like the supermassive black holes
in the center of a galaxy

00:04:23.792 --> 00:04:27.101
affect a star, can rip a star to pieces,

00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:29.504
but the star being ripped to pieces

00:04:29.528 --> 00:04:32.371
hardly affects
the supermassive black hole.
