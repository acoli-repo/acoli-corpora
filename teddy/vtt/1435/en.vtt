Philosophers, dramatists, theologians

00:00:04.214 --> 00:00:06.420
have grappled with
this question for centuries:

00:00:06.444 --> 00:00:07.976
what makes people go wrong?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.976
Interestingly, I asked this question
when I was a little kid.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.056
I grew up in the South Bronx,
inner-city ghetto in New York,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.563
and I was surrounded by evil,

00:00:15.587 --> 00:00:18.143
as all kids are who grew up
in an inner city.

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.492
And I had friends
who were really good kids,

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:24.808
who lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde
scenario -- Robert Louis Stevenson.

00:00:24.832 --> 00:00:27.976
That is, they took drugs,
got in trouble, went to jail.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.859
Some got killed, and some did it
without drug assistance.
