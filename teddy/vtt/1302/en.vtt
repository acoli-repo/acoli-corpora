00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm going to start here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is a hand-lettered sign

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that appeared in a mom and pop bakery

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
in my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The store owned one of those machines

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that can print on plates of sugar.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And kids could bring in drawings

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and have the store print a sugar plate

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
for the top of their birthday cake.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But unfortunately, one of the things kids liked to draw

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
was cartoon characters.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
They liked to draw the Little Mermaid,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
they'd like to draw a smurf, they'd like to draw Micky Mouse.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But it turns out to be illegal
