Two sisters take the same DNA test.

00:00:11.187 --> 00:00:17.994
The results show that one sister 
is 10% French, the other 0%.

00:00:17.994 --> 00:00:20.724
Both sisters share the same two parents,

00:00:20.724 --> 00:00:23.284
and therefore the same set 
of ancestors.

00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:28.574
So how can one be 10% more French 
than the other?

00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:34.178
Tests like these rely on our DNA 
to answer questions about our ancestry,
