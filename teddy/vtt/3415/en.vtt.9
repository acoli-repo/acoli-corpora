00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:30.545
So while Civil Rights
protects some victims,

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.250
we should want to protect all victims.

00:04:33.274 --> 00:04:35.994
Rather than going
institution by institution,

00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:39.488
fighting for reform on campus,
in the military, in the workplace,

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:42.437
it's time to go to the Constitution

00:04:43.086 --> 00:04:45.022
and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.830
Originally proposed in 1923,

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:51.986
the Equal Rights Amendment would guarantee
gender equality under the law,

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.417
and much like Title IX on campus,

00:04:54.441 --> 00:04:57.598
that constitutional amendment could
require states to intervene

00:04:57.622 --> 00:04:59.569
and address gender violence

00:04:59.593 --> 00:05:02.523
as a prohibitive form
of sex discrimination.
