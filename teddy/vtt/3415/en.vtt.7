00:03:27.804 --> 00:03:30.149
Title IX has actually evolved over time

00:03:30.173 --> 00:03:34.700
to require educational institutions
to intervene and address gender violence

00:03:34.724 --> 00:03:36.823
when committed by certain parties,

00:03:36.847 --> 00:03:41.239
such as when teachers, students
or campus visitors commit sexual assault

00:03:41.263 --> 00:03:42.566
or harassment.

00:03:43.103 --> 00:03:46.296
So what this means
is that through Title IX,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.512
those who seek access to education
are protected against gender violence

00:03:50.536 --> 00:03:53.361
in a way that otherwise
does not exist under the law.

00:03:53.977 --> 00:03:57.590
It is Title IX that requires
educational institutions

00:03:57.614 --> 00:03:59.937
to take reports
of gender violence seriously,

00:03:59.961 --> 00:04:01.725
or to suffer liability.
