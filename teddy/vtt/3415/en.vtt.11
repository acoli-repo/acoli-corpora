00:05:29.275 --> 00:05:31.556
for survivors across the country

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.334
and as a survivor myself,

00:05:34.358 --> 00:05:36.471
I'm not here to say, "Time's Up."

00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:39.306
I'm here to say, "It's time."

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.799
It's time for accountability
to become the norm after gender violence.

00:05:42.823 --> 00:05:46.070
It's time to pass
the Equal Rights Amendment,

00:05:46.094 --> 00:05:49.849
so that our legal system
can become a system of justice,

00:05:49.873 --> 00:05:53.972
and #MeToo can finally become "no more."

00:05:54.518 --> 00:05:55.669
Thank you.

00:05:55.693 --> 00:05:57.988
