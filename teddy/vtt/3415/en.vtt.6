00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:10.514
under federal Civil Rights statutes,

00:03:10.538 --> 00:03:12.000
such as Title IX.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.762
Title IX is not just about sports.

00:03:14.786 --> 00:03:17.535
Rather, it prohibits all forms
of sex discrimination,

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:20.290
including sexual violence and harassment

00:03:20.314 --> 00:03:23.526

that accept federal funding.

00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:27.780

00:03:27.804 --> 00:03:30.149
Title IX has actually evolved over time
