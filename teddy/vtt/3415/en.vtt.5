00:02:28.593 --> 00:02:31.786
You see, victims are not parties
in a criminal case.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.738
Rather, they are witnesses;

00:02:33.762 --> 00:02:35.473
their bodies, evidence.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.795
The prosecution does not represent
the interests of a victim.

00:02:40.315 --> 00:02:43.700
Rather, the prosecution represents
the interests of the state.

00:02:44.368 --> 00:02:47.837
And the state has the discretion
to dismiss criminal charges,

00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:49.477
enter lax plea deals

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:52.889
and otherwise remove
a victim's voice from the process,

00:02:52.913 --> 00:02:54.249
because again,

00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:59.664
a state theoretically represents
the interests of all citizens collectively

00:02:59.688 --> 00:03:02.510
and not any one citizen individually.
