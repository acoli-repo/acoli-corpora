00:01:59.313 --> 00:02:00.791
as a human right.

00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:03.926
Instead of requiring intervention,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.128
our Constitution leaves discretion --

00:02:06.152 --> 00:02:09.244
discretion that states have used
to discriminate systemically

00:02:09.268 --> 00:02:11.993
to deny countless victims any remedy.

00:02:13.062 --> 00:02:16.234
Unlike what you may have seen
on "Law &amp; Order: SVU,"

00:02:16.258 --> 00:02:18.992
justice is rare for victims
of gender violence.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.398
And even in those rare cases
where law enforcement has chosen to act,

00:02:24.422 --> 00:02:27.788
victims have no rights
during the resulting criminal process.

00:02:28.593 --> 00:02:31.786
You see, victims are not parties
in a criminal case.
