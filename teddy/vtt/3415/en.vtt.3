Not only can the police fail to respond,

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:33.939
but she will be left
without any legal remedy

00:01:33.963 --> 00:01:36.390
if preventable harm occurs as a result.

00:01:37.182 --> 00:01:38.503
How can this be?

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.898
It is because the state, theoretically,

00:01:41.922 --> 00:01:45.280
acts on behalf of
all citizens collectively,

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:48.077
not any one citizen individually.

00:01:48.873 --> 00:01:53.669
The resulting constitutional flaw
directly contradicts international law,

00:01:53.693 --> 00:01:55.962
which requires nation-states to intervene

00:01:55.986 --> 00:01:59.289
and protect citizens against
gender violence by private parties

00:01:59.313 --> 00:02:00.791
as a human right.
