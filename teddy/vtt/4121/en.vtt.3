00:01:29.862 --> 00:01:32.072
and unconscious design,

00:01:32.072 --> 00:01:35.081
we're impacting these invisible worlds.

00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:39.310
This is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon,

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.994
and I worked with a team of architects and biologists

00:01:41.994 --> 00:01:46.168
to sample over 300 rooms in this building.

00:01:46.168 --> 00:01:50.178
We wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building,

00:01:50.178 --> 00:01:53.488
and to do this, we sampled dust.

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:57.396
From the dust, we pulled out bacterial cells,

00:01:57.396 --> 00:02:00.800
broke them open, and compared their gene sequences.
