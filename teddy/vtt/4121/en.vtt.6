If you look inside the restrooms,

00:03:01.045 --> 00:03:04.175
they all have really similar ecosystems,

00:03:04.175 --> 00:03:06.503
and if you were to look inside the classrooms,

00:03:06.503 --> 00:03:09.369
those also have similar ecosystems.

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:11.783
But if you look across these space types,

00:03:11.783 --> 00:03:14.180
you can see that they're fundamentally different

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.335
from one another.

00:03:16.335 --> 00:03:19.328
I like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest.

00:03:19.328 --> 00:03:21.815
I told Tim, "If you could just see the microbes,

00:03:21.815 --> 00:03:25.854
it's kind of like being in Costa Rica. Kind of."

00:03:25.854 --> 00:03:30.377
And I also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland.
