00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:02.111
have really similar biomes.

00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:04.591
And that is exactly what we found.

00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:07.758
If you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another,

00:05:07.758 --> 00:05:09.957
they have very similar ecosystems,

00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:13.096
but if you go to an office

00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:16.144
that is a farther walking distance away,

00:05:16.144 --> 00:05:18.880
the ecosystem is fundamentally different.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.425
And when I see the power that dispersal has

00:05:23.425 --> 00:05:25.705
on these biogeographic patterns,

00:05:25.705 --> 00:05:28.264
it makes me think that it's possible

00:05:28.264 --> 00:05:32.000
to tackle really challenging problems,
