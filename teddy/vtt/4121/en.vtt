Everything is covered in invisible ecosystems

00:00:05.106 --> 00:00:09.594
made of tiny lifeforms: bacteria, viruses and fungi.

00:00:09.594 --> 00:00:13.698
Our desks, our computers, our pencils, our buildings

00:00:13.698 --> 00:00:17.154
all harbor resident microbial landscapes.

00:00:17.154 --> 00:00:19.914
As we design these things, we could be thinking

00:00:19.914 --> 00:00:22.728
about designing these invisible worlds,

00:00:22.728 --> 00:00:24.971
and also thinking about how they interact

00:00:24.971 --> 00:00:27.727
with our personal ecosystems.

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:31.370
Our bodies are home to trillions of microbes,
