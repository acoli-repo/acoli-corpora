00:06:56.354 --> 00:07:00.281
What we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant

00:07:00.281 --> 00:07:03.340
until Saturday, when we opened the vents up again.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.922
When you walked into those rooms,

00:07:04.922 --> 00:07:06.897
they smelled really bad,

00:07:06.897 --> 00:07:09.999
and our data suggests that it had something to do with

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:13.066
leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup

00:07:13.066 --> 00:07:15.745
from people the day before.

00:07:15.745 --> 00:07:17.917
Contrast this to rooms

00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:22.198
that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy

00:07:22.198 --> 00:07:25.978
where air came in from the outside through louvers.

00:07:25.978 --> 00:07:30.775
In these rooms, the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well,
