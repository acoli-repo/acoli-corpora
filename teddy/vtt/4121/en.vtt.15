00:07:25.978 --> 00:07:30.775
In these rooms, the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well,

00:07:30.775 --> 00:07:32.910
and when Charlie saw this, he got really excited.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.021
He felt like he had made a good choice

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:36.755
with the design process

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:39.150
because it was both energy efficient

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:44.439
and it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape.

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:47.481
The examples that I just gave you are about architecture,

00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:49.994
but they're relevant to the design of anything.

00:07:49.994 --> 00:07:54.164
Imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want

00:07:54.164 --> 00:07:55.582
in a plane

00:07:55.582 --> 00:07:58.515
or on a phone.

00:07:58.515 --> 00:08:00.969
There's a new microbe, I just discovered it.
