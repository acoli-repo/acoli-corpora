00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:31.370
Our bodies are home to trillions of microbes,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.730
and these creatures define who we are.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.608
The microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods.

00:00:37.608 --> 00:00:41.066
The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system.

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:44.075
The microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath,

00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:45.547
or not,

00:00:45.547 --> 00:00:48.526
and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems

00:00:48.526 --> 00:00:51.594
interact with ecosystems on everything we touch.

00:00:51.594 --> 00:00:53.186
So, for example, when you touch a pencil,

00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:56.018
microbial exchange happens.

00:00:56.018 --> 00:01:00.914
If we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings,
