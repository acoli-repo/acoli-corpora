00:03:25.854 --> 00:03:30.377
And I also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland.

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:34.589
This perspective is a really powerful one for designers,

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:38.016
because you can bring on principles of ecology,

00:03:38.016 --> 00:03:40.928
and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal,

00:03:40.928 --> 00:03:43.655
the way organisms move around.

00:03:43.655 --> 00:03:47.839
We know that microbes are dispersed around by people

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:48.910
and by air.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.747
So the very first thing we wanted to do in this building

00:03:51.747 --> 00:03:53.600
was look at the air system.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.832
Mechanical engineers design air handling units

00:03:56.832 --> 00:03:59.024
to make sure that people are comfortable,

00:03:59.024 --> 00:04:01.577
that the air flow and temperature is just right.
