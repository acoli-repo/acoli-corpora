00:03:59.024 --> 00:04:01.577
that the air flow and temperature is just right.

00:04:01.577 --> 00:04:05.121
They do this using principles of physics and chemistry,

00:04:05.121 --> 00:04:09.495
but they could also be using biology.

00:04:09.495 --> 00:04:11.607
If you look at the microbes

00:04:11.607 --> 00:04:14.657
in one of the air handling units in this building,

00:04:14.657 --> 00:04:18.648
you'll see that they're all very similar to one another.

00:04:18.648 --> 00:04:22.183
And if you compare this to the microbes

00:04:22.183 --> 00:04:24.327
in a different air handling unit,

00:04:24.327 --> 00:04:27.039
you'll see that they're fundamentally different.

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.590
The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago,
