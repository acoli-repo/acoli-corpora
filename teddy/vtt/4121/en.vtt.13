00:06:27.235 --> 00:06:30.794
air that we sampled outside of the building.

00:06:30.794 --> 00:06:34.961
What you're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:38.937
in the outdoor air, and how they vary over time.

00:06:38.937 --> 00:06:41.925
Next I'm going to show you what happened

00:06:41.925 --> 00:06:45.574
when we experimentally manipulated classrooms.

00:06:45.574 --> 00:06:47.189
We blocked them off at night

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:49.455
so that they got no ventilation.

00:06:49.455 --> 00:06:51.632
A lot of buildings are operated this way,

00:06:51.632 --> 00:06:53.383
probably where you work,

00:06:53.383 --> 00:06:56.354
and companies do this to save money on their energy bill.

00:06:56.354 --> 00:07:00.281
What we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant
