If we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings,

00:01:00.914 --> 00:01:03.537
this opens a path to influencing

00:01:03.537 --> 00:01:06.928
our health in unprecedented ways.

00:01:06.928 --> 00:01:09.392
I get asked all of the time from people,

00:01:09.392 --> 00:01:13.462
"Is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems?"

00:01:13.462 --> 00:01:16.010
And I believe the answer is yes.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.935
I think we're doing it right now,

00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:21.043
but we're doing it unconsciously.

00:01:21.043 --> 00:01:23.008
I'm going to share data with you

00:01:23.008 --> 00:01:26.736
from one aspect of my research focused on architecture

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:29.862
that demonstrates how, through both conscious

00:01:29.862 --> 00:01:32.072
and unconscious design,
