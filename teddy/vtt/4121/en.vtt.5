00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.480
that I've been working on in partnership with Autodesk.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.952
The way that you look at this data is,

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:36.530
first, look around the outside of the circle.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.552
You'll see broad bacterial groups,

00:02:39.552 --> 00:02:42.392
and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe,

00:02:42.392 --> 00:02:45.408
it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group.

00:02:45.408 --> 00:02:47.904
So at 12 o'clock, you'll see that offices have a lot of

00:02:47.904 --> 00:02:50.465
alphaproteobacteria, and at one o'clock

00:02:50.465 --> 00:02:54.660
you'll see that bacilli are relatively rare.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.023
Let's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building.

00:02:59.023 --> 00:03:01.045
If you look inside the restrooms,
