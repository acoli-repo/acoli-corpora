00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.590
The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago,

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.447
and what that means is that mechanical engineers

00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:36.123
are like eco-engineers, and they have the ability

00:04:36.123 --> 00:04:41.707
to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to.

00:04:41.707 --> 00:04:45.815
Another facet of how microbes get around is by people,

00:04:45.815 --> 00:04:48.982
and designers often cluster rooms together

00:04:48.982 --> 00:04:51.037
to facilitate interactions among people,

00:04:51.037 --> 00:04:54.509
or the sharing of ideas, like in labs and in offices.

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.183
Given that microbes travel around with people,

00:04:57.183 --> 00:04:59.856
you might expect to see rooms that are close together

00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:02.111
have really similar biomes.
