There's a new microbe, I just discovered it.

00:08:00.969 --> 00:08:03.849
It's called BLIS, and it's been shown

00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:06.033
to both ward off pathogens

00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:08.178
and give you good breath.

00:08:08.178 --> 00:08:14.197
Wouldn't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones?

00:08:14.197 --> 00:08:16.567
A conscious approach to design,

00:08:16.567 --> 00:08:19.448
I'm calling it bioinformed design,

00:08:19.448 --> 00:08:20.934
and I think it's possible.

00:08:20.934 --> 00:08:22.372
Thank you.

00:08:22.372 --> 00:08:26.125
