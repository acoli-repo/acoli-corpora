00:01:57.396 --> 00:02:00.800
broke them open, and compared their gene sequences.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.527
This means that people in my group

00:02:02.527 --> 00:02:05.840
were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.360
This is a picture of Tim, who,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.814
right when I snapped this picture, reminded me,

00:02:10.814 --> 00:02:13.384
he said, "Jessica, the last lab group I worked in

00:02:13.384 --> 00:02:16.355
I was doing fieldwork in the Costa Rican rainforest,

00:02:16.355 --> 00:02:20.112
and things have changed dramatically for me."

00:02:20.112 --> 00:02:23.864
So I'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices,

00:02:23.864 --> 00:02:26.940
and we're going to look at the data through a visualization tool

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.480
that I've been working on in partnership with Autodesk.
