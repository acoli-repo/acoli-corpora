00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.830
I have spent my entire life

00:00:04.863 --> 00:00:09.163
either at the schoolhouse,
on the way to the schoolhouse,

00:00:09.197 --> 00:00:11.797
or talking about what happens
in the schoolhouse.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:12.930
(Laughter)

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.230
Both my parents were educators,

00:00:15.263 --> 00:00:18.463
my maternal grandparents were educators,

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:21.597
and for the past 40 years,
I've done the same thing.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.697
And so, needless to say, over those years

00:00:24.697 --> 00:00:28.197
I've had a chance
to look at education reform

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.030
from a lot of perspectives.
