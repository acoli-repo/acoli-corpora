00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:00.148
Without them,
plants would lose a pollinator.

00:02:00.172 --> 00:02:01.408
But some scientists say

00:02:01.432 --> 00:02:03.993
that mosquitos aren't
actually all that important.

00:02:04.017 --> 00:02:05.734
If we got rid of them, they argue,

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:07.901
another species would simply
take their place

00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:11.053
and we'd probably have far
fewer deaths from malaria.

00:02:11.077 --> 00:02:13.893
The problem is that nobody
knows what would happen

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:15.656
if we killed off all the mosquitos.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.498
Something better might take their spot

00:02:17.522 --> 00:02:20.494
or perhaps something even worse.

00:02:20.518 --> 00:02:23.402
The question is,
are we willing to take that risk?

00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:25.092
