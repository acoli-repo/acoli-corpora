00:00:59.531 --> 00:01:02.019
This is what causes the itchy,
red bumps, by the way.

00:01:02.043 --> 00:01:04.093
Then the bug will use
its serrated mandibles

00:01:04.117 --> 00:01:05.907
to carve a little hole in your skin,

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:08.226
allowing it to probe around
with its proboscis,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.663
searching for a blood vessel.

00:01:09.687 --> 00:01:11.830
When it hits one,
the lucky parasite can suck

00:01:11.854 --> 00:01:13.765
two to three times its weight in blood.

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:15.933
Turns out we don't really
like that too much.

00:01:15.957 --> 00:01:17.785
In fact, humans hate mosquitos so much

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:19.864
that we spend billions
of dollars worldwide

00:01:19.888 --> 00:01:21.276
to keep them away from us --

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.444
from citronella candles

00:01:22.468 --> 00:01:25.148
to bug sprays to heavy-duty
agricultural pesticides.

00:01:25.172 --> 00:01:27.347
But it's not just
that mosquitos are annoying,

00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:28.695
they're also deadly.

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.726
Mosquitos can transmit everything
from malaria to yellow fever
