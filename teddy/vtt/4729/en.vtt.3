Mosquitos can transmit everything
from malaria to yellow fever

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.661
to West Nile virus to dengue.

00:01:33.685 --> 00:01:35.280
Over a million people worldwide

00:01:35.304 --> 00:01:37.708
die every year
from mosquito-borne diseases,

00:01:37.732 --> 00:01:39.240
and that's just people.

00:01:39.264 --> 00:01:40.494
Horses, dogs, cats,

00:01:40.518 --> 00:01:42.992
they can all get diseases
from mosquitoes too.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.684
So, if these bugs are so dastardly,
why don't we just get rid of them?

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:48.851
We are humans after all,

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.161
and we're pretty good
at getting rid of species.

00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:52.986
Well, it's not quite so simple.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.312
Getting rid of the mosquito
removes a food source

00:01:55.336 --> 00:01:57.851
for lots of organisms,
like frogs and fish and birds.

00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:00.148
Without them,
plants would lose a pollinator.
