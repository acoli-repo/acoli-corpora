00:00:27.468 --> 00:00:30.436
And mosquito-borne diseases
kill millions of people every year.

00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:33.567
The scourge
that is the mosquito isn't new.

00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:36.723
Mosquitoes have been around
for over a hundred million years

00:00:36.747 --> 00:00:39.649
and over that time have coevolved
with all sorts of species,

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:41.076
including our own.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.210
There are actually thousands
of species of mosquitos in the world,

00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:46.274
but they all share one insidious quality:

00:00:46.298 --> 00:00:47.445
they suck blood,

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.779
and they're really, really
good at sucking blood.

00:00:50.803 --> 00:00:52.116
Here's how they do it.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.950
After landing, a mosquito will slather

00:00:53.974 --> 00:00:57.183
some saliva onto the victim's skin,
which works like an antiseptic,

00:00:57.207 --> 00:00:59.507
numbing the spot so we don't
notice their attack.

00:00:59.531 --> 00:01:02.019
This is what causes the itchy,
red bumps, by the way.
