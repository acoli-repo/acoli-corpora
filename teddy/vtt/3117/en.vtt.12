is whether they can maintain ties
during the parent's incarceration,

00:06:00.666 --> 00:06:05.009
but prisoners' phone calls home
can cost 20 to 30 times more

00:06:05.033 --> 00:06:06.886
than regular phone calls,

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.117

keep in touch through letters.

Anissa Christmas: Dear big brother,

00:06:15.612 --> 00:06:17.443
I'm making that big 16 this year, LOL.

00:06:17.934 --> 00:06:19.593
Guess I'm not a baby anymore.

00:06:19.617 --> 00:06:21.226
You still taking me to prom?

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.499
I really miss you.

00:06:22.523 --> 00:06:24.735
You're the only guy
that kept it real with me.

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:28.102
I wish you were here so I can vent to you.

00:06:28.695 --> 00:06:31.286
So much has happened since
the last time I seen you.
