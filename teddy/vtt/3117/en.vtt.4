was convicted of unrelated
corruption charges.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.765
When this district attorney
of 30 years stepped down,

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.717
the eyewitnesses
from McKinley's case came forward

00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:12.200
and said that they had been pressured
into testifying by the district attorneys,

00:02:12.224 --> 00:02:15.105
pressure which included
the threat of jail time.

00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:18.392
Despite this, McKinley is still in prison.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.981
(Recording) SP: Before this happened,

00:02:21.005 --> 00:02:22.461
I never would've thought it.

00:02:22.485 --> 00:02:26.115
And well, I guess it's hard
for me to imagine

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.695
that these things is going on, you know,

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.972
until this happened to my son.
