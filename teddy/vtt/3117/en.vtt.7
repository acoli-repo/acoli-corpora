00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:31.587
My brother missed my birthday dinner

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:34.588
because that day, actually,
he went to jail.

00:03:35.306 --> 00:03:38.146
My brother missed his own birthday dinner

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.629
because he was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:43.749
(Recording) EA: So all these times
when he ended up going to jail,

00:03:43.773 --> 00:03:46.297
were charges pressed
or did he just get taken to jail?

00:03:46.321 --> 00:03:47.872
KW: The charges would be pressed

00:03:47.896 --> 00:03:50.922
and it would have a bond posted,

00:03:50.946 --> 00:03:52.913
then the charges will get dropped ...

00:03:52.937 --> 00:03:54.391
because there was no evidence.

00:03:55.248 --> 00:03:58.202
EA: I met Kortney Williams
when I went to her college classroom

00:03:58.226 --> 00:03:59.717
to talk about "Unprisoned."

00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:03.136
She ended up interviewing her aunt,
