So much has happened since
the last time I seen you.

00:06:32.847 --> 00:06:34.909
(Voice breaking up) I have some good news.

00:06:34.933 --> 00:06:36.766
I won first place in the science fair.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:37.981
I'm a geek.

00:06:38.005 --> 00:06:40.271
We're going to regionals,
can't you believe it?

00:06:40.295 --> 00:06:42.470
High school is going by super fast.

00:06:42.893 --> 00:06:44.071
In less than two years,

00:06:44.095 --> 00:06:46.709
I hope you'll be able to see me
walk across the stage.

00:06:47.413 --> 00:06:50.318
I thought to write to you
because I know it's boring in there.

00:06:50.342 --> 00:06:52.054
I want to put a smile on your face.

00:06:53.799 --> 00:06:56.077
Anissa wrote these letters to her brother

00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:58.323
when she was a sophomore in high school.

00:06:58.347 --> 00:07:01.278
She keeps the letters he writes to her
tucked into the frame
