Prosecutors decide
whether or not to take legal action

00:12:00.072 --> 00:12:02.101
against the people police arrest

00:12:02.125 --> 00:12:05.122
and they decide what charges to file,

00:12:05.146 --> 00:12:10.899
directly impacting how much time
a defendant potentially faces behind bars.

00:12:11.706 --> 00:12:15.593
One check we do have
on prosecutors is defense.

00:12:15.943 --> 00:12:17.635
Imagine Lady Liberty:

00:12:17.659 --> 00:12:20.080
the blindfolded woman holding the scale

00:12:20.104 --> 00:12:23.284
meant to symbolize the balance
in our judicial system.

00:12:23.854 --> 00:12:27.066
Unfortunately, that scale is tipped.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.616
The majority of defendants in our country

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.022
are represented by
government-appointed attorneys.
