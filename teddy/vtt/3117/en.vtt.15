00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.073
I've been doing this for a quite a while,
and it still catches your breath.

00:07:30.097 --> 00:07:32.635
You're like, "There are so many
people of color here,"

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:37.629
and yet I know that the city is not
made up of 90 percent African Americans,

00:07:37.653 --> 00:07:41.149
so why is it that 90 percent
of the people who are in orange

00:07:41.173 --> 00:07:42.324
are African American?

00:07:42.348 --> 00:07:45.907
(Recording) EA: Public defender Danny
Engelberg isn't the only one noticing

00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:48.122
how many black people
are in municipal court --

00:07:48.146 --> 00:07:49.298
or in any court.

00:07:49.322 --> 00:07:50.500
It's hard to miss.

00:07:50.524 --> 00:07:52.795
Who's sitting in court
waiting to see the judge?

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:54.020
What do they look like?

00:07:54.044 --> 00:07:56.513
(Recording) Man: Mostly
African-Americans, like me.

00:07:56.537 --> 00:07:58.792
Man: It's mostly, I could say,
85 percent black.

00:07:58.816 --> 00:08:02.215
That's all you see in the orange,
in the box back there, who locked up.
