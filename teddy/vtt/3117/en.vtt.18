the police to look at you,

00:09:05.206 --> 00:09:07.025

00:09:08.372 --> 00:09:10.421
EA: Why would they think
you're threatening?

00:09:10.445 --> 00:09:11.843

00:09:20.058 --> 00:09:22.588

that about me.

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:25.598
EA: For folks who look like me,

00:09:25.622 --> 00:09:29.925
the easiest and most comfortable
thing to do is to not pay attention --

00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:33.591
to assume our criminal
legal system is working.
