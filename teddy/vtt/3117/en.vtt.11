00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:32.356
Over five million of today's children
will see a parent incarcerated

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.322
at some point in their childhoods.

00:05:34.798 --> 00:05:39.321
But this number disproportionately
affects African American children.

00:05:40.252 --> 00:05:42.943
By the time they reach the age of 14,

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:46.740
one in four black children
will see their dad go off to prison.

00:05:47.198 --> 00:05:50.592
That's compared to a rate
of one in 30 for white children.

00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:56.269
One key factor determining the future
success of both inmates and their children

00:05:56.293 --> 00:06:00.642
is whether they can maintain ties
during the parent's incarceration,
