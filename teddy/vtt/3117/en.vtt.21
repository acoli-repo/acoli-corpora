00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.412
we've seen what happens.

00:10:31.436 --> 00:10:34.627
And so it is our responsibility as Jews

00:10:34.651 --> 00:10:38.214
and as members of this community

00:10:38.238 --> 00:10:41.429
to educate our community --

00:10:41.453 --> 00:10:44.358
at least our congregation --

00:10:44.382 --> 00:10:46.342
to the extent that we're able.

00:10:47.477 --> 00:10:50.739
EA: I've been using
the pronouns "us" and "we"

00:10:50.763 --> 00:10:53.759
because this is our criminal legal system

00:10:53.783 --> 00:10:55.132
and our children.

00:10:55.583 --> 00:10:57.752
We elect the district attorneys,

00:10:57.776 --> 00:11:01.820
the judges and the legislators
who operate these systems
