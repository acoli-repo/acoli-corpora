Most of you are probably like me --

00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:33.352
lucky.

00:00:33.376 --> 00:00:37.537
The closest we get to crime and punishment
is likely what we see on TV.

00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:39.433
While making "Unprisoned,"

00:00:39.457 --> 00:00:41.759
I met a woman who used to be like us --

00:00:41.783 --> 00:00:42.933
Sheila Phipps.

00:00:43.572 --> 00:00:46.104
(Recording) Sheila Phipps:
Before my son went to jail,

00:00:46.128 --> 00:00:48.108
I used to see people be on television,

00:00:48.132 --> 00:00:51.921
fighting, saying, "Oh, this person
didn't do it and this person is innocent."

00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:54.659
And you know, you snub them
or you dismiss them,

00:00:54.683 --> 00:00:56.703
and like, "Yeah, whatever."

00:00:56.727 --> 00:00:57.878
Don't get me wrong,

00:00:57.902 --> 00:01:00.406
there's a lot of people
who deserve to be in prison.
