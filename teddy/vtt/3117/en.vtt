00:00:00.869 --> 00:00:02.954
I have never been arrested,

00:00:02.978 --> 00:00:04.841
never spent a night in jail,

00:00:04.865 --> 00:00:08.686
never had a loved one
thrown into the back of a squad car

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.366
or behind bars,

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.827
or be at the mercy of a scary,
confusing system

00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:17.901
that at best sees them with indifference,

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:19.758
and at worst as monstrous.

00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:24.229
The United States of America locks up
more people than any other nation

00:00:24.253 --> 00:00:25.660
on the planet,

00:00:25.684 --> 00:00:28.591
and Louisiana is our biggest incarcerator.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.177
Most of you are probably like me --
