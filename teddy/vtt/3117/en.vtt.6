00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:01.013
And that's not even counting
the roughly half a million people

00:03:01.037 --> 00:03:03.269
who have been convicted of nothing --

00:03:03.293 --> 00:03:05.166
those presumed innocent,

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.023
but who are too poor to bail out of jail

00:03:08.047 --> 00:03:11.906
and therefore sit behind bars
for weeks upon months,

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.099
waiting for their case to come to trial --

00:03:14.123 --> 00:03:15.804
or much more likely,

00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:18.184
waiting to take a plea just to get out.

00:03:18.736 --> 00:03:21.859
All of those people
have family on the outside.

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:26.518
(Recording) Kortney Williams: My brother
missed my high school graduation

00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:27.793
because the night before,

00:03:27.817 --> 00:03:29.318
he went to jail.

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:31.587
My brother missed my birthday dinner
