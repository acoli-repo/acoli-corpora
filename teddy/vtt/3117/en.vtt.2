there's a lot of people
who deserve to be in prison.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.250
There's a lot of criminals out here.

00:01:02.274 --> 00:01:05.473
But there are a lot of innocent
people that's in jail.

00:01:06.436 --> 00:01:09.703
EA: Sheila's son, McKinley,
is one of those innocent people.

00:01:09.727 --> 00:01:14.587
He served 17 years of a 30-year sentence
on a manslaughter charge.

00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:16.410
He had no previous convictions,

00:01:16.434 --> 00:01:19.012
there was no forensic
evidence in the case.

00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:23.147
He was convicted solely
on the basis of eyewitness testimony,

00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:25.330
and decades of research have shown

00:01:25.354 --> 00:01:28.226
that eyewitness testimony
isn't as reliable

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.150
as we once believed it to be.
