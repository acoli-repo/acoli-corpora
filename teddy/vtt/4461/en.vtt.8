He's jailing journalists
and opposition members,

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:05.101
but he declared national day of prayer

00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:08.434
so that people could pray
for God to fix the country.

00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:11.101
And I'm like, shouldn't he
be fixing the country?

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:12.684
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:14.768
We want God to fix it.

00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:17.351
Do you see what I have to deal with?

00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:18.643
I'm telling you,

00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:21.809
thunder is getting ready
to hit these politicians some day.

00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:24.393
We are better than this.

00:04:24.417 --> 00:04:28.309
I want our leaders
to start taking responsibility

00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:31.809
and stop putting everything on God.
