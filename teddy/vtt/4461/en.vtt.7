But sadly, a lot of African talent
is flying straight out of Africa

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:32.643
to other continents.

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:33.934
For example,

00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.268
this Nigerian doctor
operated on an unborn baby

00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:38.559
in Texas.

00:03:38.583 --> 00:03:40.226
Also, this Nigerian doctor

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.809
discovered the neurological effects
of concussion on athletes.

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:47.559
And many countries have African athletes

00:03:47.583 --> 00:03:50.601
winning the gold medal for them.

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:52.059
The interesting thing is,

00:03:52.083 --> 00:03:54.559
we're waiting for God to fix Africa.

00:03:54.583 --> 00:03:57.536
Like, for real, it's not a joke,
we are, we're waiting for God.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.768
I mean, just look
at the president of Burundi.

00:03:59.792 --> 00:04:02.184
He's jailing journalists
and opposition members,
