I'm talking about your colleagues, yes.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.226
I do this because Africa
has everything in it to be great.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.684
You know, I grew up believing

00:01:08.708 --> 00:01:11.809
that Africa as a continent is a giant.

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:14.351
We've got skills, intellectuals,

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:18.059
natural resources
more than any other continent.

00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:21.893
Africa supplies 31 percent
of the world's gold,

00:01:21.917 --> 00:01:23.809
manganese and uranium,

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:26.976
57 percent of the world's diamonds

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.184
and 13 percent of the world's oil.

00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:32.184
We have no reason to depend on aid
