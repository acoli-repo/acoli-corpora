00:00:00.708 --> 00:00:02.018
What's up, people?

00:00:02.042 --> 00:00:04.893
First of all, I cannot believe
I'm on TED Talk.

00:00:04.917 --> 00:00:06.768
This is a big deal.

00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:08.059
Because right now,

everybody in my village is watching this.

00:00:10.083 --> 00:00:12.976

or a satirist,

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:22.934
anything you want me to be, really.

00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.393
I'm every woman, it's all in me.

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:29.476
I host a YouTube show called
"Keeping It Real with Adeola."
