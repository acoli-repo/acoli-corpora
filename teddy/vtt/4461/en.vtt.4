00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:00.601
because more than anything else,

00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:04.268
African leaders love to be respected.

00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:06.268
So I give it to them in doses.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:07.559
On my show,

00:02:07.583 --> 00:02:09.351
I kneel for them -- ha! --

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:12.143
I call them my uncles, my aunties,

00:02:12.167 --> 00:02:13.726
my fathers in the lord,

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.268
and then --

00:02:15.292 --> 00:02:18.684
I insult them for insulting
our intelligence.

00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:20.768
And it's because we are tired

00:02:20.792 --> 00:02:24.184
of the hypocrisy and false promises.

00:02:24.208 --> 00:02:25.601
For example,

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:29.393
the Nigerian president
vowed to end medical tourism

00:02:29.417 --> 00:02:32.101
by fixing our dilapidated hospitals
