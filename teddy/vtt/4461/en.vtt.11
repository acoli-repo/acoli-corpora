00:05:27.208 --> 00:05:31.268
so we know that it has to be
the Ghanian Jollof rice,

00:05:31.292 --> 00:05:32.559
which he ate,

00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:34.601
that gave him the inspiration to design.

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:36.553
Ah, maybe it's the Nigerian Jollof rice,

00:05:36.577 --> 00:05:38.069
because Nigerian one is better.

00:05:38.094 --> 00:05:40.863
Anyway, but that is what gave him
the inspiration to become

00:05:40.888 --> 00:05:43.101
the great man that he is today.

00:05:43.125 --> 00:05:44.684
And while I have your attention,

00:05:44.708 --> 00:05:46.143
I have one more thing to say,

00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:47.434
so please move closer.

00:05:47.458 --> 00:05:49.809
OK, that's good,
don't get too close, that's good.

00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:51.518
I don't like the way some of you

00:05:51.542 --> 00:05:53.351
portray Africa.

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:54.976
Not all of you, just some of you.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.268
You especially.

00:05:56.292 --> 00:05:59.101
First of all, it's not a country,
it's a continent.

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:01.434
I do not know Paul from Uganda,
