To me, it looks like these were things
devised in a medieval torture chamber,

00:11:01.449 --> 00:11:03.231
but it's our modern surgical joinery.

00:11:03.255 --> 00:11:08.463
So I'd love it if we could replace
systems like these with adhesives.

00:11:08.487 --> 00:11:11.265
We're working on this,
but this is not easy.

00:11:11.289 --> 00:11:14.344
So think about what you would need
for adhesives in these cases.

00:11:14.368 --> 00:11:17.615
So first of all, you would need
an adhesive that is going to set

00:11:17.639 --> 00:11:19.196
in a wet environment.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.611
And if you look at the silly
little picture there,

00:11:21.635 --> 00:11:26.165
it's just to illustrate that our bodies
are about 60 percent water,

00:11:26.189 --> 00:11:27.485
so it's a wet environment.

00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:31.692
It's also to illustrate that this is why
I am a scientist and not an artist.
