00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:00.904
So they're all hunkered down there.

00:02:00.928 --> 00:02:03.794
Then, also, there's a safety
in numbers thing,

00:02:03.818 --> 00:02:07.446
because it also helps you
keep away the predators,

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.284
because if, say, a seagull
wants to pick you up and eat you,

00:02:10.308 --> 00:02:13.434
it's more difficult for the seagull
if they're all stuck together.

00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:16.760
And then another thing is it also helps
with reproductive efficiency.

00:02:16.784 --> 00:02:19.930
So you can imagine
that when Mr. and Mrs. Barnacle decide,

00:02:19.954 --> 00:02:22.340
"OK, it's time to have
little baby barnacles" --

00:02:22.364 --> 00:02:24.461
I won't tell you
how they do that just yet --

00:02:24.485 --> 00:02:27.370
but when they decide it's time to do that,

00:02:27.394 --> 00:02:30.298
it's a lot easier and their reproductive
efficiency is higher
