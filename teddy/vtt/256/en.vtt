00:00:01.306 --> 00:00:04.131
So I'd like you to join me
on a field trip,

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:06.965
and I want to go to the beach,
and take you all to the beach

00:00:06.989 --> 00:00:09.068
and so enjoy the sea air
and the salt spray.

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:11.077
And let's go down to the water's edge,

00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:14.442
and you're going to notice is
we're getting knocked around by the waves,

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:16.489
and it's really difficult
to stay in place.

00:00:16.513 --> 00:00:18.672
But now, look down,

00:00:18.696 --> 00:00:20.117
and what you're going to see

00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:23.173
is that the rocks are covered
by all sorts of sea creatures

00:00:23.197 --> 00:00:25.861
that are just staying
there in place, no problem.

00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:28.006
And it turns out
that if you want to survive

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.793
in this really demanding environment,

00:00:29.817 --> 00:00:34.578
your very existence is dependent
upon your ability to make glue, actually.
