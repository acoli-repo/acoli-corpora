00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.465
So they're really quite influential.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.077
If you've been to any rocky beach
pretty much anywhere in the world,

00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:37.756
you're probably familiar
with what barnacles look like.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.931
What these animals do --

00:01:38.955 --> 00:01:41.677
and there's many others,
these are just three of them --

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:42.851
is they make adhesives,

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:45.264
they stick to each other,
they stick to the rocks

00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:47.432
and they build communities,
and by doing this,

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:49.679
there's a lot of survival
advantages they get.

00:01:49.703 --> 00:01:55.370
So one of them is that just any individual
is subjected to less of the turbulence

00:01:55.394 --> 00:01:59.212
and all the damaging features
that can happen from that environment.

00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:00.904
So they're all hunkered down there.
