00:02:27.394 --> 00:02:30.298
it's a lot easier and their reproductive
efficiency is higher

00:02:30.322 --> 00:02:32.724
if they're all living close together.

00:02:32.748 --> 00:02:37.703
So we want to understand
how they do this, how do they stick,

00:02:37.727 --> 00:02:39.815
and I can't really tell you
all the details,

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.460
because it's something
we're still trying to figure out,

00:02:42.484 --> 00:02:44.228
but let me give you a little flavor

00:02:44.252 --> 00:02:46.485
of some of the things
that we're trying to do.

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:49.985
This is a picture of one of the aquarium
systems we have in our lab,

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:53.502
and everything in the image
is part of the system,

00:02:53.526 --> 00:02:55.221
and so what we do is we keep --

00:02:55.245 --> 00:02:59.103
and you can see in the glass tank there
in the bottom, there's a bunch of mussels,

00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:01.636
we have the water chilled,
we have the lights cycled,
