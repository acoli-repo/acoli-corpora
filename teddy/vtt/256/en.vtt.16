00:07:57.566 --> 00:08:01.262
And you want to let it set up
for a while, give it a chance,

00:08:01.286 --> 00:08:03.559
so we'll just put a weight
on it, nothing fancy.

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:06.782
This is a tube with lead shot
in it, nothing fancy.

00:08:06.806 --> 00:08:08.575
And then you let it sit for a while.

00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:11.371
So this has never seen air.
It's completely underwater.

00:08:11.395 --> 00:08:12.553
And you pick it up.

00:08:12.577 --> 00:08:14.362
I never know what's going to happen.

00:08:14.386 --> 00:08:16.012
I'm always very anxious here.

00:08:16.036 --> 00:08:17.186
Pick it up ...

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.307
and it's stuck.

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:20.680
To me, this is really cool.

00:08:20.704 --> 00:08:24.479
So we can actually get
very strong underwater adhesion.

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:27.464
Possibly, it's the strongest
or at least one of the strongest

00:08:27.488 --> 00:08:29.551
underwater adhesives
that's ever been seen.

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:33.010
It's even stronger than the materials
that the animals produce,
