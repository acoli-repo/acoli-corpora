00:00:59.713 --> 00:01:02.364
and they build these huge,
extensive reef systems.

00:01:02.388 --> 00:01:05.168
They can be kilometers long,
they can be meters deep,

00:01:05.192 --> 00:01:08.573
and arguably, they're the most
dominant influence

00:01:08.597 --> 00:01:11.637
on how healthy any coastal
marine ecosystem is going to be,

00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:14.661
because what they do
is they're filtering the water constantly,

00:01:14.685 --> 00:01:16.582
they're holding sand and dirt in place.

00:01:16.606 --> 00:01:19.559
Actually, other species live
inside of these reefs.

00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:22.638
And then, if you think about
what happens when a storm comes in,

00:01:22.662 --> 00:01:26.838
if the storm surge
first has to hit miles of these reefs,

00:01:26.862 --> 00:01:28.964
the coast behind it
is going to be protected.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.465
So they're really quite influential.
