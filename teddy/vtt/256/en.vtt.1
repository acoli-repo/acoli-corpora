your very existence is dependent
upon your ability to make glue, actually.

00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:38.023
So let me introduce you
to some of the heroes of our story,

00:00:38.047 --> 00:00:39.198
just a few of them.

00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:40.674
So these are mussels,

00:00:40.698 --> 00:00:43.039
and you'll notice
they're covering the rocks.

00:00:43.063 --> 00:00:44.968
They've made adhesives,

00:00:44.992 --> 00:00:46.958
and they're sticking down on the rocks,

00:00:46.982 --> 00:00:49.317
and they're also sticking
to each other, actually.

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.534
So they're hunkered down
together as a group.

00:00:51.558 --> 00:00:54.185
This is a close-up photograph
of an oyster reef,

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:56.617
and oysters, they're amazing.

00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:59.689
What they do is they cement to each other,

00:00:59.713 --> 00:01:02.364
and they build these huge,
extensive reef systems.
