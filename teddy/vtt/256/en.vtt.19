00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.914
For the most part,
they end up in landfills.

00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:34.326
And there's a lot
of precious materials in there

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.691
we'd love to be able to get out
and recycle them.

00:09:36.715 --> 00:09:37.866
We can't do it so easily

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.135
because they're all stuck
together permanently.

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:43.810
So here's one approach we're taking
to try and solve some of these problems,

00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:48.721
and what we've done here
is we've taken another long molecule

00:09:48.745 --> 00:09:50.500
that we can actually get from corn,

00:09:50.524 --> 00:09:51.999
and then into that molecule,

00:09:52.023 --> 00:09:54.816
we've put some of the adhesion
chemistry from the mussels.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.514
So because we've got the corn
and we've got the mussels,

00:09:57.538 --> 00:09:59.761
we call this our surf-and-turf polymer.

00:09:59.785 --> 00:10:01.824
And it sticks. It sticks really well.
