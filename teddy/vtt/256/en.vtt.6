00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:01.636
we have the water chilled,
we have the lights cycled,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.614
we actually have turbulence in the system

00:03:03.638 --> 00:03:05.843
because the animals make
more adhesives for us

00:03:05.867 --> 00:03:07.240
when the water is turbulent.

00:03:07.264 --> 00:03:10.685
So we induce them to make the adhesive,
we collect it, we study it.

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.868
They're here in Indiana.

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:15.463
As far as they know,
they're in Maine in February,

00:03:15.487 --> 00:03:18.173
and they seem to be pretty happy,
as far as we can tell.

00:03:18.796 --> 00:03:20.797
And then we also work with oysters,

00:03:20.821 --> 00:03:25.480
and up top, it's a photo
of a small reef in South Carolina,

00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:29.005
and what we're most interested in
is seeing how they attach to each other,

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:30.180
how they connect.
