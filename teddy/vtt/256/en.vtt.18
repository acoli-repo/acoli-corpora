00:08:57.476 --> 00:09:00.030
So the worst offender here is plywood.

00:09:00.054 --> 00:09:03.974
Plywood, or a lot of furniture,
or wood laminate in floors --

00:09:03.998 --> 00:09:08.485
a main component of the adhesives
here is formaldehyde,

00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:10.510
and it's maybe a compound you've heard of.

00:09:10.534 --> 00:09:13.411
It's a gas, and it's also a carcinogen,

00:09:13.435 --> 00:09:16.976
and so we're constructing
a lot of structures from these adhesives,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.335
and we're also breathing
a lot of this carcinogen.

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:21.213
So not good, obviously. Right?

00:09:21.237 --> 00:09:24.281
The other issue is that these adhesives
are all permanent.

00:09:24.305 --> 00:09:27.626
And so what do you do with your shoes
or your car or even your laptop

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.826
at the end of life,
when you're done using it?

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.914
For the most part,
they end up in landfills.
