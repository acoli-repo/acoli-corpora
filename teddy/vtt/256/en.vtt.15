00:07:28.232 --> 00:07:32.127
and we actually have some materials now
that are stronger than superglue.

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:33.580
So to me, that's really cool.

00:07:33.604 --> 00:07:36.541
That's a good day in the lab.
It's stronger than superglue.

00:07:36.565 --> 00:07:38.722
And here's something else that we can do.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.247
So this is a tank of seawater,

00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:45.073
and then, in that syringe
is one of our adhesive formulations,

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:48.271
and what we're doing is
we're dispensing it completely underwater,

00:07:48.295 --> 00:07:49.692
on a piece of metal.

00:07:49.716 --> 00:07:52.285
And then, we want to make
an adhesive bond, or joint,

00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:54.597
and so we take another piece of metal

00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:57.542
and we put it on there
and just position it.

00:07:57.566 --> 00:08:01.262
And you want to let it set up
for a while, give it a chance,
