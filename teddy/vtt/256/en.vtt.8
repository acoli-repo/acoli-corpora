00:03:57.344 --> 00:04:00.979
And so we're using all sorts
of fancy biology and chemistry tools

00:04:01.003 --> 00:04:02.994
to understand what's going on in there,

00:04:03.018 --> 00:04:05.547
and what we're finding
is the structures are different

00:04:05.571 --> 00:04:09.232
and the chemistry is actually different,
and it's quite interesting.

00:04:10.764 --> 00:04:12.136
And then this picture --

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.145
I guess let me step back
before I tell you what this is.

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:20.229
So do you know the cartoon
"The Magic School Bus"?

00:04:20.253 --> 00:04:23.578
Or if you're a little bit older,
"Fantastic Voyage," right?

00:04:23.602 --> 00:04:25.738
And you remember,
they had these characters

00:04:25.762 --> 00:04:28.492
that they would shrink down
to these microscopic levels,

00:04:28.516 --> 00:04:30.270
and then they would sort of swirl in
