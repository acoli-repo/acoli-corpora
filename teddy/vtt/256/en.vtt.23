It's also to illustrate that this is why
I am a scientist and not an artist.

00:11:31.716 --> 00:11:34.510
I did not miss my calling at all.

00:11:34.534 --> 00:11:38.107
So then the other requirements
you need for a good biomedical adhesive:

00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:40.696
it needs to bond strongly, of course,

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.453
and it needs to not be toxic.

00:11:42.477 --> 00:11:44.801
You don't want to hurt the patients.

00:11:44.825 --> 00:11:48.286
And getting any two of those requirements
in a material is pretty easy.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:51.471
It's been done many times.
But getting all three hasn't been done.

00:11:51.495 --> 00:11:52.646
It's very hard.

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.274
And if you start talking to surgeons,
they get picky --

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:59.735
"Oh, actually I want the adhesive to set
on the same time frame as the surgery."

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:02.103
Or, "Oh, I want the adhesive to degrade
