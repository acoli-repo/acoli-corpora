It's even stronger than the materials
that the animals produce,

00:08:33.034 --> 00:08:35.470
so for us, it's pretty exciting.
It's pretty cool.

00:08:35.494 --> 00:08:37.819
So what do we want to do
with these things?

00:08:37.843 --> 00:08:41.177
Well, here are some products
that you're probably really familiar with.

00:08:41.201 --> 00:08:46.251
So think about your cell phone,
your laptop, plywood in most structures,

00:08:46.275 --> 00:08:49.684
the interior of your car, shoes,
phone books, things like this.

00:08:49.708 --> 00:08:51.942
They're all held together with adhesives,

00:08:51.966 --> 00:08:54.299
and there's two main problems
with the adhesives

00:08:54.323 --> 00:08:55.609
used in these materials.

00:08:55.633 --> 00:08:57.452
The first one is that they're toxic.

00:08:57.476 --> 00:09:00.030
So the worst offender here is plywood.
