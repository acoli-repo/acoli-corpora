00:12:58.725 --> 00:13:00.302
So think about cars and planes.

00:13:00.326 --> 00:13:01.755
The lighter you can make them,

00:13:01.779 --> 00:13:03.890
the more fuel-efficient
they're going to be.

00:13:03.914 --> 00:13:06.934
And so if we can get away from rivets
and get away from welding

00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:08.483
and put more adhesives in there,

00:13:08.507 --> 00:13:09.887
then we might be better off

00:13:09.911 --> 00:13:12.016
with our future generation
of transportation.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:16.697
So for us, this all
comes back to the beach.

00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:20.144
So we look around and we wonder,
"How do these sea creatures stick?

00:13:20.168 --> 00:13:22.027
And what can we do with the technology?"

00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:26.516
And I would argue that we have
really a lot of things we can still learn

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:27.945
from biology and from nature.

00:13:27.969 --> 00:13:31.886
So what I would like to encourage
you all to do in the future
