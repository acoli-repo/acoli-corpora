00:06:59.096 --> 00:07:02.439
but then putting that adhesion chemistry
into these large molecules.

00:07:02.463 --> 00:07:05.560
And we've developed many different
adhesive systems in doing this,

00:07:05.584 --> 00:07:08.285
and when you make
a new adhesive that looks pretty good,

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:09.460
what do you do?

00:07:09.484 --> 00:07:12.451
You start running around the lab,
just sticking stuff together.

00:07:12.475 --> 00:07:15.716
We took a tiny bit of a glue
and glued together two pieces of metal

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.715
and we wanted to hang something from it,

00:07:17.739 --> 00:07:21.350
so we used a pot of live mussels
and thought we were very clever.

00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:22.381
(Laughs)

00:07:22.405 --> 00:07:25.749
We're obviously much more
quantitative about this most often,

00:07:25.773 --> 00:07:28.208
and so we benchmark
against commercial adhesives,

00:07:28.232 --> 00:07:32.127
and we actually have some materials now
that are stronger than superglue.
