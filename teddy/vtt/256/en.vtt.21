00:10:28.688 --> 00:10:30.691
So sutures, staples, screws:

00:10:30.715 --> 00:10:34.336
this is how we put you back together
if you've had some surgery or an injury.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.306
It's just awful. It hurts.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:41.481
In the case of the sutures,
look at how much you're making

00:10:41.505 --> 00:10:44.410
concentrated, mechanical stresses
as you pull things together.

00:10:44.434 --> 00:10:46.195
You're making sites for infection.

00:10:46.846 --> 00:10:49.236
Poke holes in healthy tissue.
It's not so good.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.498
Or if you need a plate
to hold together your bones,

00:10:52.522 --> 00:10:54.913
look at how much healthy bone
you have to drill out

00:10:54.937 --> 00:10:56.487
just to hold the plate in place.

00:10:56.511 --> 00:10:57.662
So this is awful.

00:10:57.686 --> 00:11:01.425
To me, it looks like these were things
devised in a medieval torture chamber,
