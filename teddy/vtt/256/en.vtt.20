00:09:59.785 --> 00:10:01.824
And it sticks. It sticks really well.

00:10:01.848 --> 00:10:03.118
It's very strong.

00:10:03.142 --> 00:10:05.063
It's also bio-based. That's nice.

00:10:05.087 --> 00:10:07.912
But maybe more importantly, here,
it's also degradable,

00:10:07.936 --> 00:10:11.008
and we can degrade it
under very mild conditions, with water.

00:10:11.032 --> 00:10:13.144
And so what we can do
is we can set things up

00:10:13.168 --> 00:10:15.913
and we can bond them
strongly when we want,

00:10:15.937 --> 00:10:18.045
but then we can also take them apart.

00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:19.785
It's something we're thinking about.

00:10:19.809 --> 00:10:23.263
And here is a place
where a lot of us want to be.

00:10:23.287 --> 00:10:26.999
Well, actually, in this specific case,
this is a place we do not want to be,

00:10:27.023 --> 00:10:28.664
but we'd like to replace this.

00:10:28.688 --> 00:10:30.691
So sutures, staples, screws:
