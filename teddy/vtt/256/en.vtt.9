00:04:28.516 --> 00:04:30.270
and then they would sort of swirl in

00:04:30.294 --> 00:04:33.318
and swim around and fly around
all these biological structures?

00:04:33.342 --> 00:04:37.116
I think of this as like that,
except for it's real, in this case.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.925
And so what we did is we have
two oysters that are stuck together,

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.131
and this area used to be
completely filled in with the cement,

00:04:45.155 --> 00:04:49.109
and what we're finding is that the cement
has lots of different components in there,

00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:52.156
but broadly speaking,
there are hard, non-sticky parts

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.753
and there are soft, sticky parts,

00:04:53.777 --> 00:04:57.005
and what we did is we removed
the non-sticky parts selectively

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:00.939
to see what's left for what's actually
attaching the animals,
