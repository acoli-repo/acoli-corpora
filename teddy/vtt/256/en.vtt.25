00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:31.102
because we haven't,

00:12:31.126 --> 00:12:33.435
but it's certainly
in our sights for the future.

00:12:33.459 --> 00:12:37.785
So that's one place that we'd like
to see things go farther down the road.

00:12:37.809 --> 00:12:41.571
And there are a lot of other places, too,
you can imagine we might be better off

00:12:41.595 --> 00:12:43.585
if we could get more adhesives in there.

00:12:43.609 --> 00:12:44.760
Even cosmetics.

00:12:44.784 --> 00:12:49.759
So if you think about people putting on
fake nails or eyelash extensions,

00:12:49.783 --> 00:12:51.378
what do they use?

00:12:51.402 --> 00:12:53.601
They use very toxic adhesives right now.

00:12:53.625 --> 00:12:55.331
So it's just ripe for replacement.

00:12:55.355 --> 00:12:56.928
That's something we'd like to do.

00:12:56.952 --> 00:12:58.701
And then there are other places too.

00:12:58.725 --> 00:13:00.302
So think about cars and planes.
