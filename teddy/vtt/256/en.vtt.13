00:06:29.808 --> 00:06:33.981
So on the top is an image
of one of the types of molecules

00:06:34.005 --> 00:06:36.180
that the animals are using
to make their glue,

00:06:36.204 --> 00:06:39.751
and what they are is they're very long
molecules, they're called proteins,

00:06:39.775 --> 00:06:43.006
and these proteins happen to have
some fairly unique parts in them

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.866
that bring about the adhesive properties.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.891
What we want to do is take
those little parts of that chemistry,

00:06:48.915 --> 00:06:52.081
and we want to put it
into other long molecules that we can get

00:06:52.105 --> 00:06:54.534
but things that we can make
on a really large scale,

00:06:54.558 --> 00:06:56.811
so you might know them
as plastics or polymers,

00:06:56.835 --> 00:06:59.072
and so we're sort of
simplifying what they do,

00:06:59.096 --> 00:07:02.439
but then putting that adhesion chemistry
into these large molecules.
