00:05:29.113 --> 00:05:31.193
So imagine you're at home

00:05:31.217 --> 00:05:34.939
and you break your favorite figurine
or a mug or something like that?

00:05:34.963 --> 00:05:36.675
You want to put it back together.

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:37.920
So where do you go?

00:05:37.944 --> 00:05:40.149
You go to my favorite place in town,

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:43.021
which is the glue aisle
of the hardware store.

00:05:43.045 --> 00:05:45.125
I know where you spend your nights,

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:47.894
because you're all hip,
cool people, because you're here,

00:05:47.918 --> 00:05:50.052
and you're going to the bars
and concerts --

00:05:50.076 --> 00:05:51.838
this is where I hang out every night.

00:05:51.862 --> 00:05:53.602
So anyways, so what I want you to do

00:05:53.626 --> 00:05:56.603
is get one of every adhesive
that's on the shelf,

00:05:56.627 --> 00:05:57.778
bring it home,

00:05:57.802 --> 00:06:00.586
but before you try
to put things back together,
