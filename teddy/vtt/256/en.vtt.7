00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:30.180
how they connect.

00:03:30.204 --> 00:03:32.307
And so what you can see
in the bottom image

00:03:32.331 --> 00:03:34.965
is there's two oysters
that are cementing to each other.

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.800
And we want to know what's in between,

00:03:36.824 --> 00:03:39.352
and so a lot of times,
we'll cut them and look down,

00:03:39.376 --> 00:03:41.645
and in the next series
of images we have here,

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.289
you can see, on the bottom,
we'll have two shells,

00:03:44.313 --> 00:03:46.948
the shell of one animal
and the shell of another animal,

00:03:46.972 --> 00:03:48.376
and the cement's in between.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.439
And if you look at the image on the right,

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:51.614
what you can maybe see

00:03:51.638 --> 00:03:55.114
is that there's structure
in the shell of each animal,

00:03:55.138 --> 00:03:57.320
but then, the cement
actually looks different.

00:03:57.344 --> 00:04:00.979
And so we're using all sorts
of fancy biology and chemistry tools
