00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:02.487
America's public energy conversation

00:00:02.487 --> 00:00:04.710
boils down to this question:

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.090
Would you rather die of A) oil wars,

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.700
or B) climate change,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.100
or C) nuclear holocaust,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.400
or D) all of the above?

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.200
Oh, I missed one: or E) none of the above?

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.315
That's the one we're not normally offered.

00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:22.454
What if we could make energy do our work

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:24.900
without working our undoing?

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.000
Could we have fuel without fear?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.408
Could we reinvent fire?

00:00:29.408 --> 00:00:31.038
You see, fire made us human;
