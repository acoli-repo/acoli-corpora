00:00:01.247 --> 00:00:03.207
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:06.502
Iâ€™m a writer, journalist

00:00:06.544 --> 00:00:07.795
and a socialist.

00:00:08.463 --> 00:00:10.131
I also used to be broke.

00:00:10.757 --> 00:00:12.258
I did, for a long time.

00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:13.551
Being a student,

00:00:13.593 --> 00:00:17.138
trying to make a name for myself
in the media industry

00:00:17.138 --> 00:00:18.848
and starting a media organization.

00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:22.727
I had to move 15 times in 15 years

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.813
because the rent in London
just kept on going up.

00:00:26.898 --> 00:00:31.736
Now, this taught me
an important lesson, firsthand.
