00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Yeah, so a couple of years ago I was turning 60,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and I don't like being 60.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
(Laughter)

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I started grappling

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
with this existential angst

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
of what little I had done with my life.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It wasn't the resume

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
of breaking this record here,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
it was more like, who had I become?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
How had I spent my valuable time?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
How could this have gone by

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
like lightning?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And I couldn't forgive myself
