00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Humans in the developed world

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
spend more than 90 percent of their lives indoors,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
where they breathe in and come into contact

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
with trillions of life forms invisible to the naked eye:

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
microorganisms.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Buildings are complex ecosystems

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that are an important source

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
of microbes that are good for us,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and some that are bad for us.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What determines the types and distributions

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
of microbes indoors?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Buildings are colonized by airborne microbes

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that enter through windows
