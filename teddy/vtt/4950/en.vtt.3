00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:31.875
this is why we should care about designing
a more enlightened way of working.

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:36.351
KK: We see a company
as a vehicle to design life with

00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:38.226
as opposed to something to conform to.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.518
JB: WearWorks is really
thinking holistically

00:01:40.542 --> 00:01:42.351
about navigating their tensions.

00:01:42.375 --> 00:01:46.101
For example, when it comes to a tension
like making a living and making a life,

00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:49.559
what kinds of cultural practices
and policies need to be in place

00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:52.393
to support a strategy
like flexible or remote work?

00:01:52.417 --> 00:01:55.226
KK: At WearWorks, we have this policy
called WhereverWorks,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.559
and the basic idea is
that we don't really care where people are

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:01.059
as long as the work gets done.
