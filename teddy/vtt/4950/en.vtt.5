00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:31.643
and on November 5, 2017,

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:34.434
Simon ran the first 15 miles
of the New York City Marathon

00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:36.643
without any sight assistance.

00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:38.768
Working with the blind
and visually impaired

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:40.893
was a wonderful challenge.

00:02:40.917 --> 00:02:43.476
It's a different feeling
when you go to work every day

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.143
and the thing that you do

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:49.726
actually helped the needle of humanity,
in some way, move forward.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.059
JB: WearWorks embodies

00:02:51.083 --> 00:02:54.809
what an enlightened way of working means
for people out in the world today.

00:02:54.833 --> 00:02:57.167
