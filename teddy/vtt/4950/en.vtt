Keith Kirkland: We believe
in making the world a better place,

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.809
and we're trying
to do that through design,

00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:08.518
but the world for us
starts with our company.

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:11.268
(Music)

00:00:11.292 --> 00:00:12.851
Our first product, Wayband,

00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:16.809
is a wearable haptic navigation device
for the blind and visually impaired.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:20.184
We had gotten an article published
and it had made its way to this guy,

00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:21.500
Simon Wheatcroft.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.976
He reached out to us and he was like,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.434
"If you can have this technology
ready by November,

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:30.558
I'll run the New York City
Marathon with it."
