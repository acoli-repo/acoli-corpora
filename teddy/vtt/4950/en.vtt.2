00:00:57.417 --> 00:01:01.351
What we found is that everyone has
a set of tensions in their work and life,

00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:03.684
things like making a living
and making a life,

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:08.226
or fulfilling the organization's needs
and the needs of the individual.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.018
We navigate those tensions
using our own unique strategies,

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:16.601
for example, working remotely,
learning new skills, or self care.

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:18.684
Navigating these tensions is critical,

00:01:18.708 --> 00:01:21.434
because a lot is at stake for us
when we show up to work,

00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:23.434
like our sense of purpose

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:26.143
or our connection
to our families and communities.

00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:28.184
And for me, in this organization,

00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:31.875
this is why we should care about designing
a more enlightened way of working.
