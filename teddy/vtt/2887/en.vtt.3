00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.896
that perhaps the most simple way
into a culture and into an age

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.896
is to ask: What do people worship?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.416
People have worshipped
so many different things --

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.320
the sun, the stars, the storm.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.240
Some people worship many gods,
some one, some none.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.920
In the 19th and 20th centuries,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.896
people worshipped the nation,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.376
the Aryan race, the communist state.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.400
What do we worship?

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.376
I think future anthropologists

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.480
will take a look at the books we read

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.416
on self-help, self-realization,
