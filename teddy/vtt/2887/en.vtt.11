I think we need to do that

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.456
in order to realize
that we can disagree strongly

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.776
and yet still stay friends.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.896
It's in those face-to-face encounters

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.920
that we discover
that the people not like us

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.400
are just people, like us.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.840
And actually, every time

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.936
we hold out the hand of friendship

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.976
to somebody not like us,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.960
whose class or creed
or color are different from ours,
