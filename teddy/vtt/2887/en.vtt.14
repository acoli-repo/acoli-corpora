(Laughter)

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.776
Why the difference?
I'll tell you why the difference.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.096
Because America was from the outset
a nation of wave after wave of immigrants,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.296
so it had to create an identity

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.656
which it did by telling a story

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.336
which you learned at school,
you read on memorials

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.216
and you heard repeated
in presidential inaugural addresses.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.296
Britain until recently
wasn't a nation of immigrants,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.776
so it could take identity for granted.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.720
The trouble is now

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.536
that two things have happened
which shouldn't have happened together.
