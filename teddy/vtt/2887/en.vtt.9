I found out her name was Elaine.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.056
We met. We talked.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.496
We married.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.856
And 47 years, three children
and eight grandchildren later,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.416
I can safely say

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.376
it was the best decision
I ever took in my life,

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.016
because it's the people not like us

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.240
that make us grow.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.720
And that is why I think

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.120
we have to do just that.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.136
The trouble with Google filters,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.096
Facebook friends

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.856
and reading the news by narrowcasting
rather than broadcasting
