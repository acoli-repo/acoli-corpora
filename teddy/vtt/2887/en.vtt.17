00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.040
what ideals by which we live.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.256
And if that happens,

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.696
we will become strong enough

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.376
to welcome the stranger and say,

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.496
"Come and share our lives,

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.000
share our stories,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.320
share our aspirations and dreams."

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.776
That is the us of identity.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.120
And finally, the us of responsibility.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.096
Do you know something?

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.736
My favorite phrase in all of politics,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.240
very American phrase,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.840
is: "We the people."
