00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.960
whose class or creed
or color are different from ours,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.736
we heal

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.376
one of the fractures

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.176
of our wounded world.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.600
That is the us of relationship.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.560
Second is the us of identity.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.480
Let me give you a thought experiment.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.936
Have you been to Washington?
Have you seen the memorials?

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.656
Absolutely fascinating.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.296
There's the Lincoln Memorial:

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.736
Gettysburg Address on one side,
Second Inaugural on the other.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.496
You go to the Jefferson Memorial,

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.456
screeds of text.
