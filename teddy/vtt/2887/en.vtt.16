00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:04.896
I tell you, Jews have been scattered
and dispersed and exiled for 2,000 years.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.616
We never lost our identity.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.736
Why? Because at least once a year,

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.496
on the festival of Passover,

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.456
we told our story
and we taught it to our children

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.736
and we ate the unleavened
bread of affliction

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.176
and tasted the bitter herbs of slavery.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.256
So we never lost our identity.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.976
I think collectively

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.856
we've got to get back
to telling our story,

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.896
who we are, where we came from,

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.040
what ideals by which we live.
