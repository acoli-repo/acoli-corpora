WEBVTT

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.840
is: "We the people."

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.336
Why "we the people?"

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.560
Because it says that we all
share collective responsibility

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.160
for our collective future.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.680
And that's how things
really are and should be.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.256
Have you noticed how magical thinking

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.200
has taken over our politics?

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:28.656
So we say, all you've got to do
is elect this strong leader

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.880
and he or she will solve
all our problems for us.
