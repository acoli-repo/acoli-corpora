00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.416
So I think the simplest way
of safeguarding the future "you"

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.496
is to strengthen the future "us"

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.776
in three dimensions:

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.816
the us of relationship,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.280
the us of identity

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.856
and the us of responsibility.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.456
So let me first
take the us of relationship.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.000
And here, forgive me if I get personal.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.880
Once upon a time,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.256
a very long time ago,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.936
I was a 20-year-old undergraduate

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.616
studying philosophy.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.496
I was into Nietzsche and Schopenhauer
and Sartre and Camus.
