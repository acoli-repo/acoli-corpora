00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.416
on self-help, self-realization,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.640
self-esteem.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.216
They'll look at the way
we talk about morality

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.416
as being true to oneself,

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.856
the way we talk about politics

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.656
as a matter of individual rights,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.016
and they'll look at this wonderful
new religious ritual we have created.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.240
You know the one?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.480
Called the "selfie."

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.056
And I think they'll conclude
that what we worship in our time

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.840
is the self, the me, the I.
