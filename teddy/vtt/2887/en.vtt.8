00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.496
I was into Nietzsche and Schopenhauer
and Sartre and Camus.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.896
I was full of ontological uncertainty

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.456
and existential angst.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.256
It was terrific.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.056
(Laughter)

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.296
I was self-obsessed
and thoroughly unpleasant to know,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.000
until one day I saw

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.055
across the courtyard

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.456
a girl

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.056
who was everything that I wasn't.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.096
She radiated sunshine.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.240
She emanated joy.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.576
I found out her name was Elaine.
