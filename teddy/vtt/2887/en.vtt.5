00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.840
is the self, the me, the I.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.880
And this is great.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.320
It's liberating.
It's empowering. It's wonderful.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.176
But don't forget that biologically,
we're social animals.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.816
We've spent most
of our evolutionary history

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.080
in small groups.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.416
We need those face-to-face interactions

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.840
where we learn
the choreography of altruism

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.936
and where we create those spiritual goods

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.360
like friendship and trust
and loyalty and love
