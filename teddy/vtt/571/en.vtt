It's been about a decade
since the last financial crisis,

00:00:04.776 --> 00:00:07.102
yet this industry has never been bigger.

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:11.265
Legislation that was meant
to better regulate its largest players

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.850
has hurt its smaller ones,

00:00:12.874 --> 00:00:17.945
resulting in most of the industry's assets
to be controlled by the top one percent.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.144
They've become too big to fail.

00:00:21.386 --> 00:00:23.589
I'm not referring to big banks,

00:00:23.613 --> 00:00:26.107
but the world of Big Agriculture.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.966
As a public health practitioner

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.698
who has worked with
small-scale farmers in Rwanda
