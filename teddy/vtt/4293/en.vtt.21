But the miracle that happened --

00:10:30.851 --> 00:10:32.757
I'm going to call it Hotmail for short.

00:10:33.168 --> 00:10:35.591
You may not think of Hotmail
as being miraculous,

00:10:35.615 --> 00:10:37.052
but for me it was miraculous,

00:10:37.076 --> 00:10:40.688
because I noticed, just as I
was wrestling with this problem --

00:10:40.712 --> 00:10:44.218
I was working in sub-Saharan
Africa, mostly, at the time --

00:10:44.242 --> 00:10:46.807
I noticed that every sub-Saharan
African health worker

00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:49.775
that I was working with
had a Hotmail account.

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:54.317
And it struck me, "Wait a minute --

00:10:54.341 --> 00:10:58.579
I know the Hotmail people surely didn't
fly to the Ministry of Health in Kenya

00:10:58.603 --> 00:11:00.679
to train people in how to use Hotmail.
