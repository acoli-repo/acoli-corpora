Hard for us to imagine, but in 1995,

00:06:32.568 --> 00:06:35.683
this was the ultimate elite mobile device.

00:06:36.286 --> 00:06:38.842
It wasn't an iPhone.
It wasn't a Galaxy phone.

00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:40.230
It was a PalmPilot.

00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:43.782
And when I saw the PalmPilot
for the first time, I thought,

00:06:43.806 --> 00:06:46.203
"Why can't we put the forms
on these PalmPilots?

00:06:46.758 --> 00:06:49.378
And go out into the field
just carrying one PalmPilot,

00:06:49.402 --> 00:06:53.167
which can hold the capacity
of tens of thousands of paper forms?

00:06:53.191 --> 00:06:54.618
Why don't we try to do that?

00:06:54.642 --> 00:06:55.905
Because if we can do that,

00:06:55.929 --> 00:06:59.738
if we can actually just collect
the data electronically, digitally,

00:06:59.762 --> 00:07:01.419
from the very beginning,
