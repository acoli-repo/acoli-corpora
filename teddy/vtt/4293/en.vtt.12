00:05:58.952 --> 00:06:02.369
little data, old data, no data.

00:06:03.924 --> 00:06:05.377
So back in 1995,

00:06:05.401 --> 00:06:08.641
I began to think about ways
in which we could improve this process.

00:06:08.665 --> 00:06:11.333
Now 1995 -- obviously,
that was quite a long time ago.

00:06:11.357 --> 00:06:14.335
It kind of frightens me to think
of how long ago that was.

00:06:14.359 --> 00:06:17.097
The top movie of the year
was "Die Hard with a Vengeance."

00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:19.938
As you can see, Bruce Willis
had a lot more hair back then.

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:22.627
I was working in the Centers
for Disease Control

00:06:22.651 --> 00:06:24.830
and I had a lot more
hair back then as well.

00:06:25.505 --> 00:06:28.449
But to me, the most significant
thing that I saw in 1995

00:06:28.473 --> 00:06:29.691
was this.
