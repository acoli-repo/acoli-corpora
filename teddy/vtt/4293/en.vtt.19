if I actually had the time
or it fit my schedule

00:09:31.896 --> 00:09:33.245
and I wasn't on vacation.

00:09:33.594 --> 00:09:35.555
The point is that anything,

00:09:35.579 --> 00:09:37.942
any system that depends
on a single human being

00:09:37.966 --> 00:09:39.869
or two or three or five human beings --

00:09:39.893 --> 00:09:41.546
it just doesn't scale.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.769
And this is a problem for which
we need to scale this technology,

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:46.363
and we need to scale it now.

00:09:46.387 --> 00:09:49.141
And so I began to think of ways
in which I could basically

00:09:49.165 --> 00:09:51.753
take myself out of the picture.

00:09:54.071 --> 00:09:55.715
And, you know, I was thinking,

00:09:55.739 --> 00:09:57.843
"How could I take myself
out of the picture?"

00:09:57.867 --> 00:09:59.486
for quite some time.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.986
I'd been trained that the way
you distribute technology
