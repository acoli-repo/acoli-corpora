00:11:29.319 --> 00:11:32.256
requires that something be so simple
we can use it ourselves,

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.574
with little or no training.

00:11:33.598 --> 00:11:36.193
You just have to hear about it
and go to the website.

00:11:36.217 --> 00:11:40.413
And so I thought, what would happen
if we built software

00:11:40.437 --> 00:11:42.501
to do what I'd been consulting in?

00:11:42.525 --> 00:11:46.597
Instead of training people
how to put forms onto mobile devices,

00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:49.922
let's create software that lets them
do it themselves with no training

00:11:49.946 --> 00:11:51.382
and without me being involved.

00:11:51.406 --> 00:11:52.890
And that's exactly what we did.

00:11:52.914 --> 00:11:58.135
So we created software called Magpi,
which has an online form creator.

00:11:58.159 --> 00:11:59.411
No one has to speak to me,

00:11:59.435 --> 00:12:02.236
you just have to hear about it
and go to the website.
