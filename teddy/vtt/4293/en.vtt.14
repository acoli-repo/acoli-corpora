00:06:59.762 --> 00:07:01.419
from the very beginning,

00:07:01.443 --> 00:07:04.719
we can just put a shortcut right
through that whole process

00:07:04.743 --> 00:07:09.735
of typing, of having somebody type
that stuff into the computer.

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.599
We can skip straight to the analysis

00:07:11.623 --> 00:07:14.762
and then straight to the use
of the data to actually save lives."

00:07:14.786 --> 00:07:17.373
So that's what I began to do.

00:07:17.397 --> 00:07:21.746
Working at CDC, I began to travel
to different programs around the world

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:25.912
and to train them in using
PalmPilots to do data collection,

00:07:25.936 --> 00:07:27.314
instead of using paper.

00:07:27.338 --> 00:07:29.226
And it actually worked great.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.302
It worked exactly as well
as anybody would have predicted.
