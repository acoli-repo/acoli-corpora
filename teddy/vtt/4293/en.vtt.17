There are all these different things
for us to get the data that we need to do.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:34.754
And I realized if I kept up
the way that I was doing,

00:08:34.778 --> 00:08:37.998
I was basically hardly
going to make any impact

00:08:38.022 --> 00:08:39.375
by the end of my career.

00:08:39.756 --> 00:08:41.624
And so I began to rack my brain,

00:08:41.648 --> 00:08:44.592

00:08:44.616 --> 00:08:45.898
How was I training folks,

00:08:45.922 --> 00:08:49.096
and what were the bottlenecks
and what were the obstacles

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.815
to doing it faster

00:08:54.699 --> 00:08:57.870
I identified the main obstacle.

00:08:58.475 --> 00:09:00.396
And the main obstacle, it turned out --
