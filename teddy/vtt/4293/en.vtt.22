00:10:58.603 --> 00:11:00.679
to train people in how to use Hotmail.

00:11:01.382 --> 00:11:05.630
So these guys are distributing technology,
getting software capacity out there,

00:11:05.654 --> 00:11:07.982
but they're not actually
flying around the world.

00:11:08.006 --> 00:11:09.578
I need to think about this more."

They don't require consultants.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.295
Because the business model

00:11:29.319 --> 00:11:32.256
requires that something be so simple
we can use it ourselves,
