00:12:29.213 --> 00:12:31.086
Now we knew when we built this system,

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.665
the whole point of it,
just like with the PalmPilots,

00:12:33.689 --> 00:12:36.488
was that you'd be able to collect the data

00:12:36.512 --> 00:12:39.110
and immediately upload
the data and get your data set.

00:12:39.134 --> 00:12:42.119
But what we found, of course,
since it's already on a computer,

00:12:42.143 --> 00:12:44.754
we can deliver instant maps
and analysis and graphing.

00:12:44.778 --> 00:12:46.849
We can take a process that took two years

00:12:46.873 --> 00:12:49.881
and compress that
down to the space of five minutes.

00:12:50.222 --> 00:12:52.377
Unbelievable improvements in efficiency.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.448
Cloud based, no training,
no consultants, no me.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.791
And I told you that in the first few years

00:12:59.815 --> 00:13:01.884
of trying to do this
the old-fashioned way,
