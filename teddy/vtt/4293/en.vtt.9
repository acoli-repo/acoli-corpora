00:04:28.063 --> 00:04:30.522
I actually was that unfortunate
person sometimes.

00:04:30.546 --> 00:04:33.561
I can tell you, I often wasn't
really paying attention.

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:35.852
I probably made a lot
of mistakes when I did it

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:38.496
that no one ever discovered,
so data quality goes down.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.540
But eventually that data, hopefully,
gets typed into a computer,

00:04:41.564 --> 00:04:43.295
and someone can begin to analyze it,

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.191
and once they have
an analysis and a report,

00:04:46.215 --> 00:04:49.239
hopefully, then you can take
the results of that data collection

00:04:49.263 --> 00:04:51.230
and use it to vaccinate children better.

00:04:51.254 --> 00:04:56.795
Because if there's anything worse
in the field of global public health --

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:59.801
I don't know what's worse
than allowing children on this planet

00:04:59.825 --> 00:05:01.941
to die of vaccine-preventable diseases --
