but the light is better here."

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.374
(Laughter)

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:37.410
There's a concept that people talk
about nowadays called "big data."

00:00:37.434 --> 00:00:40.077
And what they're talking
about is all of the information

00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:42.252
that we're generating
through our interaction

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:43.579
with and over the Internet,

00:00:43.603 --> 00:00:45.363
everything from Facebook and Twitter

00:00:45.387 --> 00:00:49.020
to music downloads, movies,
streaming, all this kind of stuff,

00:00:49.044 --> 00:00:50.506
the live streaming of TED.

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:53.603
And the folks who work
with big data, for them,

00:00:53.627 --> 00:00:55.631
they talk about that their biggest problem

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:57.402
is we have so much information.

00:00:57.426 --> 00:01:00.803
The biggest problem is: how do we
organize all that information?
