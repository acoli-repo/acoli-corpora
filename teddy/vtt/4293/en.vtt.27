00:13:27.609 --> 00:13:30.822
they have a program
where semi-literate midwives,

00:13:30.846 --> 00:13:33.249
using $10 mobile phones,

00:13:33.273 --> 00:13:36.574
send a text message
using our software, once a week,

00:13:36.598 --> 00:13:39.074
with the number of births
and the number of deaths,

00:13:39.098 --> 00:13:42.670
which gives IRC something that no one
in global health has ever had:

00:13:42.694 --> 00:13:46.216
a near-real-time system
of counting babies,

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.874
of knowing how many kids are born,

00:13:47.898 --> 00:13:50.540
of knowing how many children
there are in Sierra Leone,

00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:52.787
which is the country
where this is happening,

00:13:52.811 --> 00:13:54.564
and knowing how many children die.

00:13:55.394 --> 00:13:56.967
Physicians for Human Rights --

00:13:56.991 --> 00:13:59.583
this is moving a little bit
outside the health field --

00:13:59.607 --> 00:14:04.390
they're basically training people
to do rape exams in Congo,
