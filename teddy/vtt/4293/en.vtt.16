00:07:58.693 --> 00:08:01.836
But the problem is, 20 or 30 programs,

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.810
like, training 20 or 30 programs
to use this technology,

00:08:04.834 --> 00:08:07.000
that is a tiny drop in the bucket.

00:08:07.024 --> 00:08:10.964
The demand for this, the need
for data to run better programs

00:08:10.988 --> 00:08:13.846
just within health -- not to mention
all of the other fields

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.866
in developing countries -- is enormous.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.876
There are millions and millions
and millions of programs,

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.468
millions of clinics
that need to track drugs,

00:08:22.492 --> 00:08:23.896
millions of vaccine programs.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.181
There are schools
that need to track attendance.

00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:30.111
There are all these different things
for us to get the data that we need to do.
