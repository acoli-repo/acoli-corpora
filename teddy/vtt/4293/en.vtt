00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:02.578
There's an old joke about a cop

00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:04.959
who's walking his beat
in the middle of the night,

00:00:04.983 --> 00:00:07.086
and he comes across a guy
under a street lamp

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.801
who's looking at the ground
and moving from side to side,

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:11.602
and the cop asks him what he's doing.

00:00:11.626 --> 00:00:13.560
The guys says he's looking for his keys.

00:00:13.584 --> 00:00:15.023
So the cop takes his time

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:17.317
and looks over and kind of
makes a little matrix

00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:19.546
and looks for about two, three minutes.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.721
No keys.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:23.117
The cop says, "Are you sure?

00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:25.450
Hey buddy, are you sure
you lost your keys here?"

00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:27.506
And the guy says,
"No, actually I lost them

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.256
down at the other end of the street,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.725
but the light is better here."
