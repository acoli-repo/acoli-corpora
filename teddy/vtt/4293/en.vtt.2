The biggest problem is: how do we
organize all that information?

00:01:01.272 --> 00:01:03.432
I can tell you that,
working in global health,

00:01:03.456 --> 00:01:05.740
that is not our biggest problem.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:09.416
Because for us, even though
the light is better on the Internet,

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:14.355
the data that would help us solve
the problems we're trying to solve

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:16.528
is not actually present on the Internet.

00:01:16.552 --> 00:01:17.997
So we don't know, for example,

00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:21.312
how many people right now
are being affected by disasters

00:01:21.336 --> 00:01:23.305
or by conflict situations.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.048
We don't know for, really,
basically, any of the clinics

00:01:27.072 --> 00:01:28.222
in the developing world,

00:01:28.246 --> 00:01:30.701
which ones have medicines
and which ones don't.
