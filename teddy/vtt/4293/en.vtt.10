00:04:59.825 --> 00:05:01.941
to die of vaccine-preventable diseases --

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:05.377
diseases for which
the vaccine costs a dollar.

00:05:05.835 --> 00:05:09.187
And millions of children die
of these diseases every year.

00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:12.185
And the fact is, millions
is a gross estimate,

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:15.423
because we don't really know
how many kids die each year of this.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.229
What makes it even more frustrating
is that the data-entry part,

00:05:19.253 --> 00:05:21.443
the part that I used to do
as a grad student,

00:05:21.467 --> 00:05:22.925
can take sometimes six months.

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.401
Sometimes it can take two years
to type that information into a computer,

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:28.535
And sometimes, actually not infrequently,

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:30.387
it actually never happens.
