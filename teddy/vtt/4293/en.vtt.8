00:03:59.812 --> 00:04:02.487
which is something like a county
in the United States.

00:04:02.511 --> 00:04:05.186
You can imagine that,
for the entire country of Zambia,

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.503
answering just that single question ...

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:09.945
looks something like this.

00:04:11.072 --> 00:04:13.112
Truck after truck after truck,

00:04:13.136 --> 00:04:16.049
filled with stack after stack
after stack of data.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.642
And what makes it even worse
is that's just the beginning.

00:04:19.666 --> 00:04:21.760
Because once you've collected
all that data,

00:04:21.784 --> 00:04:24.324
of course, someone --
some unfortunate person --

00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:26.563
is going to have to type that
into a computer.

00:04:26.587 --> 00:04:28.039
When I was a graduate student,

00:04:28.063 --> 00:04:30.522
I actually was that unfortunate
person sometimes.
