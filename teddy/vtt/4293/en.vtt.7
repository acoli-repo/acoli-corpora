00:03:28.092 --> 00:03:31.326
all these different paper forms
for many different topics,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.666
they all have a single, common endpoint,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.309
and the common endpoint
looks something like this.

00:03:36.333 --> 00:03:39.666
And what we're looking
at here is a truckful of data.

00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:45.126
This is the data from a single
vaccination coverage survey

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.341
in a single district
in the country of Zambia

00:03:47.365 --> 00:03:49.655
from a few years ago,
that I participated in.

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:52.026
The only thing anyone
was trying to find out

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.303
is what percentage of Zambian
children are vaccinated,

00:03:55.327 --> 00:03:58.581
and this is the data,
collected on paper over weeks,

00:03:58.605 --> 00:03:59.788
from a single district,

00:03:59.812 --> 00:04:02.487
which is something like a county
in the United States.
