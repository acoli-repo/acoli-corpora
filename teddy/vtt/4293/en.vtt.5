00:02:28.067 --> 00:02:31.246
in the hand of a Ministry of Health
nurse in Indonesia,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.510
who is tramping out across the countryside

00:02:33.534 --> 00:02:37.185
in Indonesia on, I'm sure,
a very hot and humid day,

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.891
and she is going to be knocking
on thousands of doors

00:02:39.915 --> 00:02:41.994
over a period of weeks or months,

00:02:42.018 --> 00:02:43.615
knocking on the doors and saying,

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.517
"Excuse me, we'd like to ask
you some questions.

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:49.746
Do you have any children?
Were your children vaccinated?"

00:02:50.223 --> 00:02:52.358
Because the only way
we can actually find out

00:02:52.382 --> 00:02:55.317
how many children were vaccinated
in the country of Indonesia,

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:56.898
what percentage were vaccinated,

00:02:56.922 --> 00:03:01.050
is actually not on the Internet,
but by going out and knocking on doors,
