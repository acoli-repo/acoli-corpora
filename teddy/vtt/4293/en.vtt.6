WEBVTT

00:02:56.922 --> 00:03:01.050
is actually not on the Internet,
but by going out and knocking on doors,

00:03:01.074 --> 00:03:03.288
sometimes tens of thousands of doors.

00:03:03.312 --> 00:03:07.310
Sometimes it takes months to even years
to do something like this.

00:03:07.334 --> 00:03:09.451
You know, a census of Indonesia

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:11.569
would probably take
two years to accomplish.

00:03:11.593 --> 00:03:13.665
And the problem, of course,
with all of this

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.586
is that, with all those paper forms --

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.729
and I'm telling you, we have
paper forms for every possible thing:

00:03:18.753 --> 00:03:20.817
We have paper forms
for vaccination surveys.

00:03:20.841 --> 00:03:24.002
We have paper forms to track
people who come into clinics.

00:03:24.026 --> 00:03:28.068
We have paper forms to track
drug supplies, blood supplies --

00:03:28.092 --> 00:03:31.326
all these different paper forms
for many different topics,
