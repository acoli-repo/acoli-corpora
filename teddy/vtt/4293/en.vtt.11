00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:30.387
it actually never happens.

00:05:30.411 --> 00:05:32.887
Now try and wrap your head
around that for a second.

00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:35.086
You just had teams of hundreds of people.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.013
They went out into the field
to answer a particular question.

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:40.433
You probably spent hundreds
of thousands of dollars

00:05:40.457 --> 00:05:43.493
on fuel and photocopying and per diem.

00:05:44.072 --> 00:05:46.116
And then for some reason, momentum is lost

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.533
or there's no money left,

00:05:47.557 --> 00:05:49.894
and all of that comes to nothing,

00:05:49.918 --> 00:05:52.641
because no one actually types it
into the computer at all.

00:05:52.665 --> 00:05:53.841
The process just stops.

00:05:53.865 --> 00:05:55.789
Happens all the time.

00:05:55.813 --> 00:05:58.928
This is what we base
our decisions on in global health:

00:05:58.952 --> 00:06:02.369
little data, old data, no data.
