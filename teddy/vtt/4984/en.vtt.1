00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:31.260
This is the story of sickle-cell disease.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.060
Sickle-cell disease affects the 
red blood cells,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.060
which transport oxygen from the lungs 
to all the tissues in the body.

00:00:38.063 --> 00:00:39.733
To perform this vital task,

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:44.633
red blood cells are filled with hemoglobin
proteins to carry oxygen molecules.

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:46.911
These proteins float independently

00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:50.671
inside the red blood cell’s pliable, 
doughnut-like shape,

00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:52.301
keeping the cells flexible enough

00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:55.641
to accommodate even the 
tiniest of blood vessels.

00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:57.245
But in sickle cell disease,

00:00:57.245 --> 00:01:01.385
a single genetic mutation alters
the structure of hemoglobin.
