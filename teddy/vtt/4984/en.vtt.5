00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.240
is that it originally evolved
as a beneficial adaptation.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.240
Researchers have been able to trace
the origins of the sickle cell mutation

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.803
to regions historically ravaged 
by a tropical disease called malaria.

00:02:39.803 --> 00:02:42.791
Spread by a parasite found 
in local mosquitoes,

00:02:42.791 --> 00:02:46.201
malaria uses red blood cells as incubators

00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:49.381
to spread quickly and lethally 
through the bloodstream.

00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:54.351
However, the same structural changes
that turn red blood cells into roadblocks

00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:57.407
also make them more resistant to malaria.

00:02:57.407 --> 00:03:01.627
And if a child inherits a copy of the
mutation from only one parent,
