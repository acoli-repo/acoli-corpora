00:02:57.407 --> 00:03:01.627
And if a child inherits a copy of the
mutation from only one parent,

00:03:01.627 --> 00:03:04.218
there will be just enough abnormal 
hemoglobin

00:03:04.218 --> 00:03:07.398
to make life difficult for the 
malaria parasite,

00:03:07.398 --> 00:03:11.308
while most of their red blood cells retain
their normal shape and function.

00:03:11.308 --> 00:03:13.418
In regions rife with this parasite,

00:03:13.418 --> 00:03:17.638
sickle cell mutation offered a serious 
evolutionary advantage.

00:03:17.638 --> 00:03:19.527
But as the adaptation flourished,

00:03:19.527 --> 00:03:23.217
it became clear that inheriting the 
mutation from both parents

00:03:23.217 --> 00:03:25.757
resulted in sickle-cell anemia.

00:03:25.757 --> 00:03:28.157
Today, most people with 
sickle-cell disease

00:03:28.157 --> 00:03:32.587
can trace their ancestry to a country
where malaria is endemic.
