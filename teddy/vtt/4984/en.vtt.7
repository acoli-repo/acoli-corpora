00:03:28.157 --> 00:03:32.587
can trace their ancestry to a country
where malaria is endemic.

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:36.275
And this mutation still plays a key role
in Africa,

00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:40.715
where more than 90% of malaria 
infections occur worldwide.

00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:43.722
Fortunately, as this “adaptation” thrives,

00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:47.082
our treatment for sickle cell continues 
to improve.

00:03:47.082 --> 00:03:50.442
For years, hydroxyurea was the only 
medication available

00:03:50.442 --> 00:03:52.292
to reduce the amount of sickling,

00:03:52.292 --> 00:03:55.752
blunting symptoms and 
increasing life expectancy.

00:03:55.752 --> 00:03:59.002
Bone marrow transplantations 
offer a curative measure,

00:03:59.002 --> 00:04:03.002
but these procedures are 
complicated and often inaccessible.
