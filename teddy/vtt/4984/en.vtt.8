00:03:59.002 --> 00:04:03.002
but these procedures are 
complicated and often inaccessible.

00:04:03.002 --> 00:04:06.722
But promising new medications 
are intervening in novel ways,

00:04:06.722 --> 00:04:10.432
like keeping oxygen bonded to 
hemoglobin to prevent sickling,

00:04:10.432 --> 00:04:13.592
or reducing the stickiness 
of sickled cells.

00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:15.452
And the ability to edit DNA

00:04:15.452 --> 00:04:20.922
has raised the possibility of enabling 
stem cells to produce normal hemoglobin.

00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:22.575
As these tools become available

00:04:22.575 --> 00:04:26.575
in the areas most affected by malaria
and sickle cell disease,

00:04:26.575 --> 00:04:28.365
we can improve the quality of life

00:04:28.365 --> 00:04:32.365
for more patients with this 
adverse adaptation.
