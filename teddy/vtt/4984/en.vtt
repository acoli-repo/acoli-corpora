What shape are your cells?

00:00:09.493 --> 00:00:12.223
Squishy cylinders? Jagged zig-zags?

00:00:12.223 --> 00:00:15.863
You probably donâ€™t think much about
the bodies of these building blocks,

00:00:15.863 --> 00:00:20.593
but at the microscopic level, small 
changes can have huge consequences.

00:00:20.593 --> 00:00:23.963
And while some adaptations change 
these shapes for the better,

00:00:23.963 --> 00:00:28.233
others can spark a cascade of 
debilitating complications.

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:31.260
This is the story of sickle-cell disease.
