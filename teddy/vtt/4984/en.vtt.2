00:00:57.245 --> 00:01:01.385
a single genetic mutation alters
the structure of hemoglobin.

00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:03.915
After releasing oxygen to tissues,

00:01:03.915 --> 00:01:08.145
these mutated proteins lock 
together into rigid rows.

00:01:08.145 --> 00:01:13.878
Rods of hemoglobin cause the cell 
to deform into a long, pointed sickle.

00:01:13.878 --> 00:01:16.950
These red blood cells are 
harder and stickier,

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.880
and no longer flow smoothly through 
blood vessels.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.540
Sickled cells snag and pile up–

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.180
sometimes blocking the vessel completely.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.620
This keeps oxygen from reaching
a variety of cells,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.770
causing the wide range of symptoms
