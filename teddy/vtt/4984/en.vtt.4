00:01:56.908 --> 00:02:01.268
A clog near the eye can cause vision 
problems and retinal detachment.

00:02:01.268 --> 00:02:03.629
And if the obstructed vessels 
supply the brain

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:06.399
the patient could even 
suffer a stroke.

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.009
Worse still, sickled red blood cells 
also don’t survive very long—

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.338
just 10 or 20 days, versus a 
healthy cell’s 4 months.

00:02:15.338 --> 00:02:16.553
This short lifespan

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:20.913
means that patients live with a constantly
depleted supply of red blood cells;

00:02:20.913 --> 00:02:23.850
a condition called sickle-cell anemia.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.360
Perhaps what’s most surprising 
about this malignant mutation

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.240
is that it originally evolved
as a beneficial adaptation.
