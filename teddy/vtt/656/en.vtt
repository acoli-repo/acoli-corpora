It's April of 2007,

00:00:03.455 --> 00:00:06.512
and Jon Corzine,
the Governor of New Jersey,

00:00:06.536 --> 00:00:09.156
is in this horrific car accident.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.831
He's in the right front
passenger seat of this SUV

00:00:11.855 --> 00:00:14.280
when it crashes on
the Garden State Parkway.

00:00:14.304 --> 00:00:16.589
He's transported
to a New Jersey trauma center

00:00:16.613 --> 00:00:19.463
with multiple broken bones
and multiple lacerations.

00:00:19.821 --> 00:00:22.622
He needs immediate surgery,
seven units of blood,

00:00:22.646 --> 00:00:24.872
a mechanical ventilator
to help him breathe

00:00:24.896 --> 00:00:27.316
and several more operations along the way.

00:00:27.792 --> 00:00:29.437
It's amazing he survived.

00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:31.630
But perhaps even more amazing,
