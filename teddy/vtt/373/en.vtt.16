00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
My challenge to the rest of the world

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
is please, start using

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
positive Middle Eastern images in your stories.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
For inspiration, go to one of our festivals,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
go online, drop us a line.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Let's change the narrative together

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and let's start righting writing wrongs.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I'd like to end, before going back to the Middle East,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
with a quote from one of the greatest Sheikhs

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
to put quill to parchment.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
As my father likes to call him, "Asheikh Azubare;"

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
as my mother would say, "Shakespeare."

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
(Laughter)

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
"And now we go in content

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to liberty and not to banishment."
