00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Now, in three short years, we've come a long way

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
with stand-up comedy shows happening even in Saudi Arabia.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
These comics are now going to the New York festival.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And the Lebanese, brilliant Lebanese,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Nemr Abou Nassar, we featured in our first tour,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
has just been performing in L.A.'s legendary comedy clubs.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
So clearly, from the inside, we are doing our best to change our image,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and it's exploding.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
(Laughter)

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
So, as for the outsiders looking in,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
watch the CNN report on the second Amman Comedy Festival.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
The reporter did a great job, and I thank her,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
but somebody forgot to send the positive PR email
