WEBVTT

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is the stand-up comedy circuit,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
where they just happen to say that you kill when you do well

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and you bomb when you do badly.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
An unfortunate connection for us maybe,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but it reminds me

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that we'd like to thank one man for, over the past decade,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
working tirelessly

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to support comedians all around the world,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
specifically comedians

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
with a Middle Eastern background.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
(Applause)

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Like my good friends, Dean and Maysoon, at the bottom of the screen,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
who, two years after 9/11,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
started a festival to change the way

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Middle Easterners are perceived in the world.
