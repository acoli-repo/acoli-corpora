This talk is about righting writing wrongs.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
No, the sound's not faulty -- righting writing wrongs.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The Middle East is huge,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and with all our problems, one thing's for sure: we love to laugh.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We need to take our responsibilities seriously,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but not ourselves.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Don't get me wrong: it's not like we don't have comedy in the Middle East.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I grew up at a time when iconic actors

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
from Kuwait, Syria, Egypt

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
used laughter to unite the region,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
just as football can.
