00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
towards success.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Now, as with any new idea, it wasn't easy.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I had four phases to this plan.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
First, we'd need to buy content from the West and air it.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Then I'd bring my friends, and we'd show local amateurs how it's done.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We would film that and air it,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and then I could work with the local amateurs and write new comedy.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I excitedly presented this to the big boss,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and his reaction was, "Um, I don't get it."

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So I retreated back to my cave

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and continued to support and produce comedy

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and let my friends use my couch

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
as a regional operations hub.
