00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I happened to find

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
a funny guy to present it in Arabic,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
who is originally Korean,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
a perfect fit for the Axis of Evil.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
This is all true.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Now, while preparing for the tour,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I used the three Bs of stand-up don'ts

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
as I call them in the Middle East:

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
blue content, keep it clean; beliefs, not religion;

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and the third B, bolitics.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Stay away from bolitics in the Middle East.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Oh course, you might think, what's left

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
without bolitics, sex and religion, how can you make people laugh?
