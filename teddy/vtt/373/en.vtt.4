00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
My job was to connect the brand with a Middle Eastern audience.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Now, the American head of programming

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
wanted new local Arabic comedy.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
In a thick Arabic accent, my brain went,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
"Berfect."

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
(Laughter)

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now, I had friends in the U.S.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
who had started a successful new tribe.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And I had every intention of taking this tribe

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
from being outliers in the Middle East

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and pushing them over the tipping point

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
towards success.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Now, as with any new idea, it wasn't easy.
