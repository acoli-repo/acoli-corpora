WEBVTT

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
as a regional operations hub.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Now, fast forward two years, to early 2007.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
The earth rotated, as did our management,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
(Laughter)

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and as if by divine intervention,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
things came together

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
to help this revolution take shape.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Here's how the dots connected.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
First, the Axis guys recorded a Comedy Central special

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
that aired in the States,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and it was getting great hits on YouTube.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Our new French CEO

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
believed in the power of positive PR ...

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
(Laughter)
