00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
We're not all angry fanatics

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
who want to kill the infidel.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
We have a positive story to tell

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and image to sell.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
In fact, one thing's for sure, in my experience,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
we love to laugh like hell.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
(Laughter)

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Here are three questions that I like to use

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
to test the truthiness of our representation

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
in any media story.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
One: Is the Middle East

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
being shown in a current time

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and correct context?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
(Laughter)
