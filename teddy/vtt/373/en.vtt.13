The reporter did a great job, and I thank her,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
but somebody forgot to send the positive PR email

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
to the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
For example, when Dean talks,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
the ticker says, "U.S.: Suspect gave 'actionable intel."

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Well, if you're used to listening to comedians,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
then I'm not surprised.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Sadly, this leads me to another three Bs

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
that represents how the media in the West

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
talks about us as bombers, billionaires

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and belly dancers.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Enough.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
We're not all angry fanatics
