My favorite topic is

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000

The master of shortcuts -- it's, of course, nature.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But I will demonstrate

rid of difficulties and go to the point,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to find an answer

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
probably much quicker than Arthur did. So,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000

the logic. All of you, if you hold your hand like this,
