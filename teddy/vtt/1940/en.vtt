00:00:00.713 --> 00:00:03.159
When we think of games,
there's all kinds of things.

00:00:03.183 --> 00:00:06.568
Maybe you're ticked off, or maybe,
you're looking forward to a new game.

00:00:06.592 --> 00:00:08.450
You've been up too late playing a game.

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:09.937
All these things happen to me.

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:11.396
But when we think about games,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.590
a lot of times we think
about stuff like this:

00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:16.645
first-person shooters, or the big,
what we would call AAA games,

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:18.543
or maybe you're a Facebook game player.

00:00:18.567 --> 00:00:20.442
This is one my partner and I worked on.

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:23.769
Maybe you play Facebook games,
and that's what we're making right now.

00:00:23.793 --> 00:00:25.295
This is a lighter form of game.

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:27.922
Maybe you think about
the tragically boring board games

00:00:27.946 --> 00:00:30.188
that hold us hostage
in Thanksgiving situations.
