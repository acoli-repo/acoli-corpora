00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:12.249
Ethanol: this molecule, made of little 
more than a few carbon atoms,

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.089
is responsible for drunkenness.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.750
Often simply referred to as alcohol,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.120
ethanol is the active ingredient 
in alcoholic beverages.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.840
Its simplicity helps it 
sneak across membranes

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.160
and nestle into a many different nooks,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.369
producing a wide range of effects 
compared to other, clunkier molecules.
