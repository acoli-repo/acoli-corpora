00:00:00.627 --> 00:00:02.239
I was born in Den Bosch,

00:00:02.263 --> 00:00:05.600
where the painter Hieronymus Bosch
named himself after.

00:00:05.624 --> 00:00:08.047
And I've always been very fond
of this painter

00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:10.556
who lived and worked in the 15th century.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.276
And what is interesting about him
in relation to morality

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.355
is that he lived at a time
where religion's influence was waning,

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.196
and he was sort of wondering, I think,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.810
what would happen with society
if there was no religion

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:22.294
or if there was less religion.

00:00:22.318 --> 00:00:25.772
And so he painted this famous painting,
"The Garden of Earthly Delights,"

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:29.655
which some have interpreted
as being humanity before the Fall,

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.917
or being humanity without any Fall at all.
