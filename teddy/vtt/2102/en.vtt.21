00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:30.732
Do we know, do we understand, who killed bin Ladenism?

00:10:30.732 --> 00:10:34.095
Who ended the global jihad?

00:10:34.095 --> 00:10:37.466
There lie the answers to the solution to local jihad.

00:10:37.466 --> 00:10:41.744
Who killed bin Ladenism? Let's start with bin Laden himself.

00:10:41.744 --> 00:10:44.135
He probably thought 9/11 was his greatest achievement.

00:10:44.135 --> 00:10:48.287
In reality, it was the beginning of the end for him.

00:10:48.287 --> 00:10:51.159
He killed 3,000 innocent people, and that filled

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:55.343
the Muslim world with horror and revulsion,

00:10:55.343 --> 00:10:58.536
and what that meant was that his idea of jihad

00:10:58.536 --> 00:11:00.115
could never become mainstream.
