Local jihad, if you ignore it, becomes global jihad again.

00:10:02.024 --> 00:10:05.631
The good news is that it doesn't have to be.

00:10:05.631 --> 00:10:07.804
We know how to fight it now.

00:10:07.804 --> 00:10:10.575
We have the tools. We have the knowhow,

00:10:10.575 --> 00:10:12.162
and we can take the lessons we've learned

00:10:12.162 --> 00:10:16.063
from the fight against global jihad, the victory against global jihad,

00:10:16.063 --> 00:10:19.543
and apply those to local jihad.

00:10:19.543 --> 00:10:24.335
What are those lessons? We know who killed bin Laden:

00:10:24.335 --> 00:10:26.270
SEAL Team Six.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:30.732
Do we know, do we understand, who killed bin Ladenism?
