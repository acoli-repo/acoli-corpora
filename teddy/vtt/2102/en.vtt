00:00:00.891 --> 00:00:04.105
I'm going to talk about the power of a word:

00:00:04.105 --> 00:00:07.161
jihad.

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:11.517
To the vast majority of practicing Muslims,

00:00:11.517 --> 00:00:15.541
jihad is an internal struggle for the faith.

00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:20.227
It is a struggle within, a struggle against vice, sin,

00:00:20.227 --> 00:00:22.517
temptation, lust, greed.

00:00:22.517 --> 00:00:26.146
It is a struggle to try and live a life

00:00:26.146 --> 00:00:32.844
that is set by the moral codes written in the Koran.
