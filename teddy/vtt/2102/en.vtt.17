00:08:27.074 --> 00:08:30.161
But that doesn't mean

00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:32.488
that we can relax.

00:08:32.488 --> 00:08:34.739
I was in Yemen recently, where -- it's the home

00:08:34.739 --> 00:08:38.050
of the last al Qaeda franchise

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:42.162
that still aspires to attack America, attack the West.

00:08:42.162 --> 00:08:44.385
It's old school al Qaeda.

00:08:44.385 --> 00:08:45.572
You may remember these guys.

00:08:45.572 --> 00:08:48.253
They are the ones who tried to send the underwear bomber here,

00:08:48.253 --> 00:08:51.202
and they were using the Internet to try and instigate

00:08:51.202 --> 00:08:54.042
violence among American Muslims.

00:08:54.042 --> 00:08:55.382
But they have been distracted recently.

00:08:55.382 --> 00:08:58.089
Last year, they took control over a portion of southern Yemen,

00:08:58.089 --> 00:09:00.846
and ran it, Taliban-style.
