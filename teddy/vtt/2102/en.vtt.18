00:08:58.089 --> 00:09:00.846
and ran it, Taliban-style.

00:09:00.846 --> 00:09:03.645
And then the Yemeni military got its act together,

00:09:03.645 --> 00:09:06.962
and ordinary people rose up against these guys

00:09:06.962 --> 00:09:10.248
and drove them out, and since then, most of their activities,

00:09:10.248 --> 00:09:14.449
most of their attacks have been directed at Yemenis.

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:18.490
So I think we've come to a point now where we can say

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.986
that, just like all politics, all jihad is local.

00:09:21.986 --> 00:09:26.458
But that's still not reason for us to disengage,

00:09:26.458 --> 00:09:30.203
because we've seen that movie before, in Afghanistan.
