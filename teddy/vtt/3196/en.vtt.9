00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:30.873
When it comes to specific support
for music locally

00:04:30.897 --> 00:04:34.575
and a broad understanding
of a music brand nationally,

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.233
you've got to have the receipts.

00:04:37.178 --> 00:04:40.114
Next, we'll need
to identify our challenges.

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.296
Now, it's important to know
that, for the most part,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.630
this won't be just
the opposite of step one.

00:04:46.098 --> 00:04:47.361
We won't gain a whole lot

00:04:47.385 --> 00:04:50.193
by simply thinking
about what's missing from our map.

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:53.849
Instead, we need to approach this
more holistically.

00:04:54.531 --> 00:04:56.762
There are lots of music venues on our map.

00:04:56.786 --> 00:04:57.937
Awesome.

00:04:57.961 --> 00:04:59.890
But are they struggling?

00:04:59.914 --> 00:05:01.789
Do we have a venue ladder,
