00:08:58.656 --> 00:09:01.592
Talk about and celebrate
what your city has.

00:09:02.765 --> 00:09:04.772
And three, you can use your vote.

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:09.066
Seek out leadership that doesn't
just pay lip service to your city's music,

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.683
but recognizes its power

00:09:10.707 --> 00:09:13.270
and is prepared to put a strategy in place

00:09:13.294 --> 00:09:16.001
to elevate it, grow it
and build collaboration.

00:09:17.697 --> 00:09:21.196
There really is no telling
what city could be defined

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.603
by a certain scene or a certain song
in the next decade,

00:09:25.627 --> 00:09:28.739
but as much as we absolutely
cannot predict that,

00:09:28.763 --> 00:09:31.019
what we absolutely can predict
