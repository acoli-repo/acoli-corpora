00:03:28.536 --> 00:03:33.281
And no, we can't predict
the next egg that will hatch,

00:03:33.305 --> 00:03:35.877
but we can create a city
that acts like an incubator.

00:03:36.652 --> 00:03:39.788
To do that, first,
we've got to know what we've got.

00:03:39.812 --> 00:03:42.980
That means identifying
and quantifying our assets.

00:03:43.004 --> 00:03:45.075
We need to know them backward and forward,

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.415
from who and what and where they are
to what their impact is on the economy.

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.570
Let's count our recording studios
and our record labels,

00:03:52.594 --> 00:03:55.698
our historic landmarks
and our hard-core punk clubs.

00:03:55.722 --> 00:03:59.794
We should count monthly free jazz nights
and weekly folk jams,

00:03:59.818 --> 00:04:03.241
music schools, artist development,
instrument shops,
