00:01:29.745 --> 00:01:32.125
and fans to discover that music,

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.116
those zeitgeist songs
don't have to be handed down to us

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.782
from some conference room
full of songwriters

00:01:38.806 --> 00:01:40.226
in a corporate high-rise.

00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:44.067
But also, and more importantly,

00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:47.298
we can't decide that it's just
something that happens,

00:01:47.322 --> 00:01:51.754
because music is about
so much more than hits,

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:54.770
those big, iconic moments
that change everything.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.373
It's more than just entertainment.

00:01:57.944 --> 00:01:59.649
For so many of us,

00:01:59.673 --> 00:02:02.966
music is truly a way to navigate life.
