00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.455
is that those cities weren't doing
anything in particular

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:32.360
to make those moments happen.

00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:36.051
There's no formula for capturing
lightning in a bottle.

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:39.140
A formula didn't give us grunge music

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:41.761
or introduce Tupac to Dr. Dre,

00:00:41.785 --> 00:00:45.825
and there's definitely no blueprint
for how to open your record business

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:47.366
in a South Memphis neighborhood

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.096
that, turns out,
is home to Booker T. Jones,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.722
William Bell and Albert King.

00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:56.017
So this is just something
that happens, then, right?

00:00:56.636 --> 00:00:58.953
When the stars perfectly align,

00:00:58.977 --> 00:01:01.437
great music just happens.
