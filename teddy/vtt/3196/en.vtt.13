00:06:26.904 --> 00:06:31.648
We need elected officials
who recognize the power of music

00:06:31.672 --> 00:06:33.863
and elevate the voices of creatives,

00:06:33.887 --> 00:06:36.363
and they're ready to put
a strategy in place.

00:06:36.387 --> 00:06:39.500
In music cities,
from Berlin to Paris to Bogotá,

00:06:39.524 --> 00:06:41.213
music advisory councils

00:06:41.237 --> 00:06:44.835
ensure that musicians
have a seat at the table.

00:06:44.859 --> 00:06:46.162
They're volunteer councils,

00:06:46.186 --> 00:06:48.670
and they work directly
with a designated advocate

00:06:48.694 --> 00:06:52.064
inside of city hall
or even the chamber of commerce.

00:06:52.627 --> 00:06:57.103
The strongest strategies will build music
community supports like this one inward

00:06:57.127 --> 00:06:59.071
while also exporting music outward.

00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:01.149
They go hand in hand.
