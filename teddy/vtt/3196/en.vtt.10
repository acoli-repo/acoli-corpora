00:04:59.914 --> 00:05:01.789
Do we have a venue ladder,

00:05:01.813 --> 00:05:06.527
which just means, can an artist
starting out at a coffee house open mic

00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:08.797
see a clear path for how they'll grow

00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:12.317
from that 25-seat room
to a hundred-seat room and so on?

00:05:12.817 --> 00:05:16.126
Or are we expecting them to go
from a coffeehouse to a coliseum?

00:05:17.658 --> 00:05:20.562
Maybe our challenges lie
in city infrastructure:

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:22.665
public transportation, affordable housing.

00:05:23.586 --> 00:05:25.157
Maybe, like in London,

00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:30.061
where the number of music venues
went from 400 in 2010
