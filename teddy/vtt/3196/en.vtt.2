00:00:58.977 --> 00:01:01.437
great music just happens.

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.993
And in the meantime,
New York and Nashville

00:01:04.017 --> 00:01:06.588
can churn out the hits
that come through our radios,

00:01:06.612 --> 00:01:07.843
define our generations

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:10.296
and soundtrack our weddings
and our funerals

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.565
and everything in between.

00:01:13.057 --> 00:01:14.454
Well, I don't know about you,

00:01:14.478 --> 00:01:17.842
but the very idea of that
is just deadly boring to me.

00:01:18.697 --> 00:01:24.204
There are musicians all around you,
making powerful, important music,

00:01:24.228 --> 00:01:27.741
and thanks to the internet
and its limitless possibilities

00:01:27.765 --> 00:01:29.721
for creators to create music

00:01:29.745 --> 00:01:32.125
and fans to discover that music,
