00:03:59.818 --> 00:04:03.241
music schools, artist development,
instrument shops,

00:04:03.265 --> 00:04:05.375
every lathe and every luthier,

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:09.034
music museums open year round

00:04:09.058 --> 00:04:12.272
and music festivals
open just one weekend a year.

00:04:13.222 --> 00:04:16.602
Now, ideally through this process,
we'll create an actual asset map,

00:04:16.626 --> 00:04:18.422
dropping a pin for each one,

00:04:18.446 --> 00:04:21.257
allowing us to see exactly what we've got

00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:23.931
and where organic momentum
is already happening.

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:27.587
Because it's not enough
to paint in broad strokes here.

00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:30.873
When it comes to specific support
for music locally
