00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:30.061
where the number of music venues
went from 400 in 2010

00:05:30.085 --> 00:05:32.499
to 100 in 2015,

00:05:32.523 --> 00:05:35.459
we need to think about
protections against gentrification.

00:05:36.244 --> 00:05:38.732
The mayor of London,
in December of last year,

00:05:38.756 --> 00:05:42.188
actually added something called
the "Agent of Change" principle

00:05:42.212 --> 00:05:44.195
to the city's comprehensive plan.

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.443
And the name says it all.

00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:48.590
If a real-estate developer
wants to build condos

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:50.867
next to an existing music venue,

00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:53.175
the developer is the agent of change.

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:56.287
They have to take the necessary steps
for noise mitigation.

00:05:57.096 --> 00:05:59.120
Next, and this is a very big one,

00:05:59.144 --> 00:06:01.866
we need leadership,
and we need a strategy.
