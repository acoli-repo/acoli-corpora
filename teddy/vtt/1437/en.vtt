My name is Jonathan Zittrain,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and in my recent work I've been a bit of a pessimist.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So I thought this morning I would try to be the optimist,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and give reason to hope

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
for the future of the Internet

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
by drawing upon its present.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now, it may seem like there is less hope today than there was before.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
People are less kind. There is less trust around.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I don't know. As a simple example,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we could run a test here.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
How many people have ever hitchhiked?
