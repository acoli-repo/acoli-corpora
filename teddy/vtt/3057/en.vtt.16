You are ready to lead.

00:08:01.931 --> 00:08:04.977
So I've got a suggestion for you then:

00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:06.151
lead ...

00:08:06.638 --> 00:08:07.907
now.

00:08:07.931 --> 00:08:09.606
Step out,

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:10.836
step up.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:15.985
You know, we ask America's best

00:08:16.009 --> 00:08:19.065
to die on literal hills

00:08:19.089 --> 00:08:21.609
in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:08:22.003 --> 00:08:28.131
Is it too much to ask you
to die a figurative death

00:08:28.155 --> 00:08:30.920
on a political hill in Washington, DC?
