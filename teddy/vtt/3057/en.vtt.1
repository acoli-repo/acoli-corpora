It says you're a member of Congress,

00:00:31.493 --> 00:00:33.709
that you represent
the people of your state.

00:00:35.052 --> 00:00:40.337
Now, imagine you're a conservative
member of Congress.

00:00:41.346 --> 00:00:43.553
For some of you here
in Boston, Massachusetts,

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:46.158
that's going to take
a powerful imagination, all right?

00:00:46.182 --> 00:00:47.238
(Laughter)

00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:50.032
But imagine with me

00:00:50.056 --> 00:00:53.194
that you're a conservative
member of Congress.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.422
You grew up on Milton Friedman.

00:00:56.093 --> 00:00:57.875
You love his free markets,

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.155
free enterprise and free trade.
