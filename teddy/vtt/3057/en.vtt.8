00:03:57.677 --> 00:04:01.293
You are a conservative member of Congress.

00:04:03.115 --> 00:04:06.077
With John Adams,

00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:07.495
you fear the mob.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.434
Because you know, as he knew,

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.459
that a mob is not able to protect liberty,

00:04:12.483 --> 00:04:13.782
not even its own.

00:04:14.195 --> 00:04:18.458
And you're amazed at the wisdom
that he and other framers had

00:04:18.482 --> 00:04:23.035
in establishing a slow,
deliberative governing process --

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:26.427
an inherently conservative
governing process.

00:04:26.955 --> 00:04:28.428
It would serve a country.

00:04:28.452 --> 00:04:32.511
It would grow far greater
than they could ever imagine.
