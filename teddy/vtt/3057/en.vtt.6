00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.092
a silent and slow-moving Sputnik moment.

00:03:02.228 --> 00:03:05.142
One that calls for
the greatness of your nation

00:03:05.166 --> 00:03:08.441
as much as the original Sputnik moment.

00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:11.822
You are a conservative member of Congress.

00:03:13.101 --> 00:03:16.923
You high-five the memory of Jack Kemp,

00:03:16.947 --> 00:03:19.014
and believe with him

00:03:19.038 --> 00:03:22.828
that the test of conservatism
is that it works for everyone,

00:03:22.852 --> 00:03:24.468
regardless of skin color.

00:03:25.424 --> 00:03:27.885
You're appalled by the alt-right.

00:03:29.094 --> 00:03:35.136
You want them to have nothing to do
with your brand, your party, your legacy.
