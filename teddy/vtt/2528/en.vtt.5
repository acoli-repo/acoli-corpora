00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.336
Because every day when my daughter
plays when she dresses up,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.840
she's learning stuff

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.376
through a process that,
in my own line of work,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.976
as a professor of media studies,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.936
we refer to as public pedagogy.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.176
That is, it is how societies
are taught ideologies.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.936
It's how you learned what it meant
to be a man or a woman,

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.536
what it meant to behave
yourself in public,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.296
what it meant to be a patriot
and have good manners.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.176
It's all the constituent social relations
that make us up as a people.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.216
It's, in short, how we learn
what we know about other people
