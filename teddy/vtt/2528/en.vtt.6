00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.216
It's, in short, how we learn
what we know about other people

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.016
and about the world.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.496
But we live in a 100-percent
media-saturated society.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.016
What that means is that every single
aspect of your human existence

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.416
outside of your basic bodily functions

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.896
is in some way touched by media.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.376
From the car that you drive
to the food that you eat

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.776
to the clothes that you wear

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.816
to the way you construct
your relationships

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.936
to the very language
you use to formulate thought --

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.216
all of that is in some way mediated.
