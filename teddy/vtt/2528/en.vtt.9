the Walt Disney Company, News Corp,
Viacom and the CBS Corporation.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.456
These six companies produce
nine out of every 10 movies you watch,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.936
nine out of every 10 television shows,
nine out of every 10 songs,

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.736
nine out of every 10 books.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.656
So my question to you is,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.376
if six companies control
90 percent of American media,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.480
how much influence do you think they have
over what you're allowed to see every day?

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.256
Because in media studies,

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.536
we spend a lot of time saying
that media can't tell us what to think,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.816
and they can't; they're terrible at that.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.216
But that's not their job.
