00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.016
What that basically is saying is,
those traits that define you,

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.256
they're not really yours,

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.960
they're just on loan to you
for a little while from boys.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.856
But do you know how much grief
she's going to take in her life

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.600
for having a little tomboy in her?

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.296
Zero. None.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.696
People will think it's cute.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.336
They'll call her feisty,
because in our society,

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.776
adding so-called male traits to girls

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.976
is seen as an upgrade, seen as a bonus.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.376
I'm not raising a little boy, like Mike.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.336
Mike is a little boy in Florida.
He's 11 years old,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.496
and the thing that he loves
most in the world
