00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.336
But when I talk about my daughter,
the word I find myself saying most

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.560
is "athlete."

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.600
My kid's athletic.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.776
She is strong and fast

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.976
and has great balance
and good body control.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.376
She is a three-time,
back-to-back-to-back state champion

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.056
in Shaolin Kempo.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.776
At nine years old, she is already
halfway to a black belt.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.576
My daughter is athletic.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.776
Now, when a man who is six feet two
and 265 pounds stands in front of you

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.536
and says his daughter is athletic,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.776
you might think
that's a reflection of him.
