00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.416
primarily because we are not
the worst parents who ever lived.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.216
But she knows there's someone
called the Mother of Dragons,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.336
and she calls herself that
and she loves it.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.056
She's a huge comic book fan.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.136
Right now, her favorite
character is Groot.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.376
She loves Groot.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.200
She adores The Incredible Hulk.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.256
But my daughter really at heart,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.296
her thing is Star Wars.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.720
My kid is a Jedi.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.336
Although some days she's also a Sith,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.576
which is a choice that I can respect.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.696
(Laughter)

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.376
But here's the question
that I have to ask.
