you might think
that's a reflection of him.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.016
It is not.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.496
(Laughter)

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.896
My wife in high school
was a two-time all-state soccer player

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.216
and a two-time all-state
volleyball player,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.256
and I played "Dungeons and Dragons."

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.376
And that is why,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.336
although my daughter is an athlete,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.536
she's also a huge nerd, which I love.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.176
She walks around our house
in a cloak of flames

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.840
that she made herself.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.376
She sits on the Iron Throne --

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.176
(Laughter)

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.536
even though she has never
seen "Game of Thrones,"

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.416
primarily because we are not
the worst parents who ever lived.
