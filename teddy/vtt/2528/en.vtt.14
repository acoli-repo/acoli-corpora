00:06:59.728 --> 00:07:03.136
And we shouldn't be surprised
because we found out that was their policy

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.136
when they bought Marvel in 2009

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.056
for the sum of 4.5 billion dollars.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.496
Because when you make a lot of money
selling princesses to girls,

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.896
you also kind of want
to make money from boys.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.376
And so what better to sell boys
than superheroes?

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.376
So now Disney had access
to Captain America and to Thor,

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.736
The Incredible Hulk,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.536
and they had access even

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.296
to a group of superheroes
no one had ever even heard of.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.456
That's how good Marvel was
at selling superheroes.
