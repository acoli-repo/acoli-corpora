00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.456
That's how good Marvel was
at selling superheroes.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.896
Last year, they released a film
called "Guardians of the Galaxy."

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.816
It's a film that absolutely
should not work.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.920
Nobody knew who they were
except for comic book nerds like me.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.976
One of the characters is a talking tree.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.456
One of the characters
is an anthropomorphic raccoon.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.936
It should not work.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.136
And they made a killing
off of "Guardians of the Galaxy."

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.696
This character here in the middle,
her name is Gamora.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.576
She's played by Zoe Saldana,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.256
and she is strong and smart and fast
and fights like a ninja,

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.416
and she is played
by a beautiful black woman,
