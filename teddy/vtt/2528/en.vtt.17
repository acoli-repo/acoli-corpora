00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.456
And as a matter of fact,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.696
if I went to the store, as I did,

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.216
and looked at the display,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.056
you would find a small picture
of Gamora right here,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.816
but if you look at any
of the actual merchandise on that shelf,

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.416
Gamora is not on any of it.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.096
Now, I could have taken to Twitter
with the hashtag #WheresGamora,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.296
like millions of fans did
across the world,

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.416
but the truth was
I wasn't even really that surprised,

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.376
because I was there
when Disney had released "The Avengers."

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.736
And just this year, we got
a new Avengers movie, the "Age of Ultron,"
