And when I was putting this together,
people said to me,

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.856
"Well, that's never going to happen."
And I said, "Oh really?"

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.816
Because just this year, Target announced

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.480
that they were going to stop

replaced by Luke.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.976
So let's don't pat ourselves

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.496
Just this week also,
