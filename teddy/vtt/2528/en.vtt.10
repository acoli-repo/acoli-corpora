00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.216
But that's not their job.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.176
Media don't tell us what to think.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.976
Media tell us what to think about.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.856
They control the conversation,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.616
and in controlling the conversation,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.656
they don't have to get you
to think what they want you to think.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.256
They'll just get you thinking about
the things they want you to think about,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.176
and more importantly, not thinking about
things they don't want you to think about.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.136
They control the conversation.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.776
How does this work in practice?

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.776
Let's just take one of those companies.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.016
We'll do an easy one.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.576
Let's talk about the Walt Disney
Company for a second.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.496
The reason why I always pick
the Walt Disney Company is this.
