00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.496
How big of a problem?

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.736
Well think about this:

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.496
in 1983, 90 percent of American media
were owned by 50 companies.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.816
In any market, 50 companies
doing something is a lot of companies.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.696
It's a lot of different worldviews.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.456
In 2015, that number has shrunk to six,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.815
six companies.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.616
They are NBCUniversal Comcast,
AOL Time Warner,

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.456
the Walt Disney Company, News Corp,
Viacom and the CBS Corporation.
