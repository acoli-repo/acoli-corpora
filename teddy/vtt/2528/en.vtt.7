00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.216
all of that is in some way mediated.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.256
So the answer in our society

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.566
to how do we learn what we know
about other people and about the world

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.070
is largely through media.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.016
Well, there's a wrinkle in that,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.816
in that our society,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.136
media don't simply exist as information
distribution technologies and devices.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.016
They also exist as corporate entities.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.856
And when the distribution of information
is tied to financial gain,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.080
there's a problem.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.496
How big of a problem?
