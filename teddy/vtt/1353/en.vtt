The Value of Nothing: Out of Nothing Comes Something.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I got a B+. (Laughter)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What I'm going to talk about: nothing out of something, and how we create.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And I'm gonna try and do that within

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and to follow the TED commandments:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that is, actually, something that creates

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a near-death experience,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but near-death is good for creativity.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
(Laughter) OK.
