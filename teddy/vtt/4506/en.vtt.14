to wear a helmet
when they're riding their bike,

00:07:01.711 --> 00:07:02.975
died in committee.

00:07:04.422 --> 00:07:06.179
It died, in large part,

00:07:06.203 --> 00:07:09.133
because it lacked constituent buy-in;

00:07:09.157 --> 00:07:11.270
it lacked stakeholder traction.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.076
Now, I'm not here to tell you

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.001
what kind of legislation
you should or shouldn't support,

00:07:16.025 --> 00:07:19.099
but I am going to tell you
that, if it matters to you,

00:07:19.123 --> 00:07:22.037
your legislators need to know that.

00:07:22.644 --> 00:07:24.467
Speak up also with coaching staff.

00:07:24.491 --> 00:07:27.468
Ask about what kind
of protective equipment is available.

00:07:27.492 --> 00:07:29.541
What's the budget
for protective equipment?

00:07:29.565 --> 00:07:31.115
How old it is?
