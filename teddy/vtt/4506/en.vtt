00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.976
So, a funny thing happened

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.476
on my way to becoming a brilliant,
world-class neuropsychologist:

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:09.251
I had a baby.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:11.260
And that's not to say

00:00:11.284 --> 00:00:15.222
I ever went on to become a brilliant,
world-class neuropsychologist.

00:00:15.246 --> 00:00:16.721
Sorry, TED.

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:21.374
But I did go on to be a reasonably astute,

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:23.276
arguably world-class worrier.

00:00:24.532 --> 00:00:27.076
One of my girlfriends
in graduate school, Marie,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.845
said, "Kim, I figured it out.

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.676
It's not that you're more neurotic
than everyone else;
