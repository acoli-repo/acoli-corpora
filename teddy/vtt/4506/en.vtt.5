00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:33.373
(Music)

00:02:33.397 --> 00:02:34.806
What would you say?

00:02:35.604 --> 00:02:36.983
How many Gs?

00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:40.363
Close.

00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:42.212
Seventy-two?

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.902
Would it be crazy to know:

00:02:44.926 --> 00:02:47.220
103 Gs?

00:02:47.628 --> 00:02:49.370
The average concussive impact

00:02:49.394 --> 00:02:51.360
is 95 Gs.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.043
Now, when the kid
on the right doesn't get up,

00:02:56.067 --> 00:02:57.676
we know they've had a concussion.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.325
But how about the kid on the left,

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.843
or the athlete that leaves
the field of play?
