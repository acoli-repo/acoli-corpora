00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.318
an inch of water.

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.463
And then, finally, all suited up

00:01:04.487 --> 00:01:06.835
for the 90-minute drive
to Copper Mountain.

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:10.820
So you can get kind of a feel for this.

00:01:11.255 --> 00:01:14.699
So my baby, Vander,
is eight years old now.

00:01:14.723 --> 00:01:19.340
And, despite being cursed
with my athletic inability,

00:01:19.364 --> 00:01:20.937
he plays soccer.

00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:22.938
He's interested in playing football.

00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:25.223
He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle.

00:01:25.247 --> 00:01:27.446
So why would I worry?

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.447
Because this is what I do.
This is what I teach.
