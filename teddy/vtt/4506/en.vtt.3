Because this is what I do.
This is what I teach.

00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:32.543
It's what I study. It's what I treat.

00:01:32.567 --> 00:01:35.567
And I know that kids
get concussed every year.

00:01:36.683 --> 00:01:40.081
In fact, more than four million people
sustain a concussion every year,

00:01:40.105 --> 00:01:42.676
and these data are just
among kids under 14

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.962
who were seen in emergency rooms.

00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:47.676
And so when kids sustain a concussion,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.676
we talk about them getting dinged
or getting their bell rung,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.376
but what is it that
we're really talking about?

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.986
Let's take a look.

00:01:55.854 --> 00:01:57.979
[Concussive Force]

00:01:59.053 --> 00:02:02.598
"Starsky and Hutch"? Arguably, yes.
