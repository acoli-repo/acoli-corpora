My little boy's right there,
and he's like, "She's not kidding.

00:06:00.045 --> 00:06:01.448
She's totally not kidding."

00:06:02.214 --> 00:06:04.782
So in all seriousness:

00:06:04.806 --> 00:06:06.453
Should my kid play football?

00:06:06.477 --> 00:06:08.264
Should your kid play football?

00:06:08.288 --> 00:06:09.454
I don't know.

00:06:09.478 --> 00:06:12.985
But I do know there are
three things you can do.

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.851
The first: study up.

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:19.604
You have to be familiar with the issues
we're talking about today.

00:06:19.628 --> 00:06:22.194
There are some great resources out there.

00:06:22.218 --> 00:06:24.512
The CDC has a program, HEADS UP.

00:06:24.536 --> 00:06:26.170
It's at CDC.gov.

00:06:26.194 --> 00:06:29.582
HEADS UP is specific
to concussion in kids.

00:06:29.606 --> 00:06:32.856
The second is a resource
I'm personally really proud of.
