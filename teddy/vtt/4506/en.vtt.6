or the athlete that leaves
the field of play?

How do we know

00:03:07.695 --> 00:03:11.255
that legislation that would require
they be pulled from play,

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:13.358
cleared for return to play,

00:03:13.382 --> 00:03:14.556
applies to them?

00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:17.027

It requires only a change
in consciousness,

00:03:22.485 --> 00:03:25.097
and that can be any one
or a number of symptoms,

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:28.279
including feeling foggy, feeling dizzy,

00:03:28.303 --> 00:03:29.978
hearing a ringing in your ear,
