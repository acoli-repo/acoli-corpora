00:01:59.134 --> 00:02:01.587
that are still using wood
and dung and charcoal

00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:03.196
as their main source of energy,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.671
and they need modern fuels.

00:02:04.695 --> 00:02:06.644
But there's something else going on,

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:10.723
which is that one of those clean energy
sources in particular

00:02:10.747 --> 00:02:14.155
has actually been on the decline
in absolute terms,

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:15.680
not just relatively.

00:02:15.704 --> 00:02:16.918
And that's nuclear.

00:02:16.942 --> 00:02:20.591
You can see its generation
has declined seven percent

00:02:20.615 --> 00:02:22.452
over the last 10 years.

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:25.084
Now, solar and wind have been
making huge strides,

00:02:25.108 --> 00:02:28.016
so you hear a lot of talk
about how it doesn't really matter,

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.778
because solar and wind
is going to make up the difference.
