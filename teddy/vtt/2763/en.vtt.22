00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.003
one of the most respected
journals in the world --

00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:03.546
nuclear is the safest way
to make reliable power.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.351
Everybody's scared of the accidents.

00:11:05.375 --> 00:11:07.669
So you go look at the accident data --

00:11:07.693 --> 00:11:09.188
Fukushima, Chernobyl --

00:11:09.212 --> 00:11:11.915
the World Health Organization
finds the same thing:

00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:15.914
the vast majority of harm
is caused by people panicking,

00:11:15.938 --> 00:11:18.258
and they're panicking
because they're afraid.

00:11:18.282 --> 00:11:19.507
In other words,

00:11:19.531 --> 00:11:23.064
the harm that's caused
isn't actually caused by the machines

00:11:23.088 --> 00:11:24.469
or the radiation.

00:11:24.493 --> 00:11:26.222
It's caused by our fears.

00:11:26.573 --> 00:11:28.018
And what about the waste?

00:11:28.042 --> 00:11:29.634
Everyone worries about the waste.

00:11:29.658 --> 00:11:31.841
Well, the interesting
thing about the waste
