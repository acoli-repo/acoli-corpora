00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:02.687
almost as much clean energy
electricity that we get from solar.

00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:05.732
And it's not unique to us.

00:03:06.113 --> 00:03:09.184
People think of California
as a clean energy and climate leader,

00:03:09.208 --> 00:03:11.216
but when we looked at the data,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.741
what we found is that, in fact,

00:03:12.765 --> 00:03:15.968
California reduced emissions more slowly
than the national average,

00:03:15.992 --> 00:03:17.835
between 2000 and 2015.

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:19.594
What about Germany?

00:03:19.618 --> 00:03:21.651
They're doing a lot of clean energy.

00:03:21.675 --> 00:03:23.406
But when you look at the data,

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.708
German emissions have actually
been going up since 2009,

00:03:26.732 --> 00:03:29.307
and there's really not anybody
who's going to tell you

00:03:29.331 --> 00:03:32.639
that they're going to meet
their climate commitments in 2020.
