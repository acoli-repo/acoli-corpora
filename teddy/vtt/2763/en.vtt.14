00:06:59.904 --> 00:07:01.580
And I had in my mind

00:07:01.604 --> 00:07:03.916
that the Chinese would be able
to do with nuclear

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.987
what they did with so many other things --

00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:09.940
start to crank out small nuclear
reactors on assembly lines,

00:07:09.964 --> 00:07:14.352
ship them up like iPhones or MacBooks
and send them around the world.

00:07:14.376 --> 00:07:16.359
I would get one at home in Berkeley.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.081
But what I found was somewhat different.

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:22.009
The presentations were all
very exciting and very promising;

00:07:22.033 --> 00:07:24.519
they have multiple reactors
that they're working on.

00:07:24.543 --> 00:07:27.848
The time came for the thorium reactor,
and a bunch of us were excited.

00:07:27.872 --> 00:07:31.271
They went through the whole presentation,
they got to the timeline,
