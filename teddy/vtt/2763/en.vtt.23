00:11:29.658 --> 00:11:31.841
Well, the interesting
thing about the waste

00:11:31.865 --> 00:11:33.284
is how little of it there is.

00:11:33.308 --> 00:11:34.685
This is just from one plant.

00:11:34.709 --> 00:11:38.086
If you take all the nuclear waste
we've ever made in the United States,

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.309
put it on a football field, stacked it up,

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:42.556
it would only reach 20 feet high.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.854
And people say it's poisoning
people or doing something --

00:11:45.878 --> 00:11:48.777
it's not, it's just sitting
there, it's just being monitored.

00:11:48.801 --> 00:11:50.188
There's not very much of it.

00:11:50.212 --> 00:11:54.035
By contrast, the waste that we don't
control from energy production --

00:11:54.059 --> 00:11:57.183
we call it "pollution," and it kills
seven million people a year,

00:11:57.207 --> 00:12:00.036
and it's threatening very serious
levels of global warming.
