00:03:57.651 --> 00:04:00.907
you lose about 20 to 40
percent of the power.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.063
That's why when, in California,

00:04:04.087 --> 00:04:06.801
we try to deal with all the solar
we've brought online --

00:04:06.825 --> 00:04:09.589
we now get about 10 percent
of electricity from solar --

00:04:09.613 --> 00:04:12.255
when the sun goes down,
and people come home from work

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.769
and turn on their air conditioners
and their TV sets,

00:04:14.793 --> 00:04:16.691
and every other appliance in the house,

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:19.176
we need a lot of natural gas backup.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.365
So what we've been doing

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.303
is stuffing a lot of natural gas
into the side of a mountain.

00:04:23.616 --> 00:04:25.865
And that worked pretty well for a while,

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.880
but then late last year,
it sprung a leak.

00:04:28.904 --> 00:04:30.744
This is Aliso Canyon.
