And what they found

00:06:01.086 --> 00:06:04.878
is that nuclear is actually one
of the least popular forms of energy.

00:06:04.902 --> 00:06:07.332
Even oil is more popular than nuclear.

00:06:07.356 --> 00:06:10.522
And while nuclear kind of
edges out coal, the thing is,

00:06:10.546 --> 00:06:14.363
people don't really fear coal
in the same way they fear nuclear,

00:06:14.387 --> 00:06:16.804
which really operates on our unconscious.

00:06:16.828 --> 00:06:18.463
So what is it that we fear?

There's the safety
of the plants themselves --

00:06:22.325 --> 00:06:25.130

to melt down and cause damage;

00:06:25.154 --> 00:06:26.499
there's the waste from them;

00:06:26.523 --> 00:06:29.030
and there's the association with weapons.

00:06:29.562 --> 00:06:30.998
And I think, understandably,
