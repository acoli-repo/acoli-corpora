Bill Gates is in China
working with engineers,

00:00:30.943 --> 00:00:33.740
there's 40 different companies
that are working together

00:00:33.764 --> 00:00:37.089
to try to race to build the first
reactor that runs on waste,

00:00:37.113 --> 00:00:38.350
that can't melt down

00:00:38.374 --> 00:00:39.692
and is cheaper than coal.

00:00:40.492 --> 00:00:42.797
And so you might start to ask:

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.227
Is this whole global warming problem

00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:48.201
going to be a lot easier to solve
than anybody imagined?

00:00:48.504 --> 00:00:50.455
That was the question we wanted to know,

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.721
so my colleagues and I decided
to take a deep dive into the data.

00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:55.772
We were a little skeptical of some parts

00:00:55.796 --> 00:00:57.803
of the clean energy revolution story,

00:00:57.827 --> 00:01:00.587
but what we found really surprised us.
