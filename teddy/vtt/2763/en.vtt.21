00:10:28.992 --> 00:10:33.164
So it's understandable that engineers
would look for a technical fix

00:10:33.188 --> 00:10:35.142
to the fears that people have of nuclear.

00:10:35.166 --> 00:10:37.942
But when you consider
that these are big challenges to do,

00:10:37.966 --> 00:10:40.251
that they're going to take
a long time to solve,

00:10:40.275 --> 00:10:42.021
there's this other issue, which is:

00:10:42.045 --> 00:10:45.352
Are those technical fixes
really going to solve people's fears?

00:10:45.828 --> 00:10:47.386
Let's take safety.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.895
You know, despite what people think,

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:53.052
it's hard to figure out how
to make nuclear power much safer.

00:10:53.076 --> 00:10:55.394
I mean, every medical
journal that looks at it --

00:10:55.418 --> 00:10:58.526
this is the most recent study
from the British journal, "Lancet,"

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.003
one of the most respected
journals in the world --
