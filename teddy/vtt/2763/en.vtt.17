00:08:29.913 --> 00:08:31.510
So what about the other reactors?

00:08:31.534 --> 00:08:34.986
There's a reactor that's coming online
now, they're starting to sell it.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.796
It's a high-temperature gas reactor.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.083
It can't melt down.

00:08:38.845 --> 00:08:41.580
But it's really big and bulky,
that's part of the safety,

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:43.892
and nobody thinks
it's going to ever get cheaper

00:08:43.916 --> 00:08:45.856
than the reactors that we have.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.956
The ones that use waste as fuel
are really cool ideas, but the truth is,

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.028
we don't actually know how to do that yet.

00:08:52.052 --> 00:08:54.647
There's some risk that you'll
actually make more waste,

00:08:54.671 --> 00:08:57.465
and most people think
that if you're including

00:08:57.489 --> 00:08:59.571
that waste part of the process,

00:08:59.595 --> 00:09:02.562
it's just going to make the whole
machine a lot more expensive,
