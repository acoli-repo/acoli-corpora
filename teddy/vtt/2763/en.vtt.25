how to get rid large numbers
of nuclear weapons

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.990
is by using the plutonium in the warheads

00:12:40.428 --> 00:12:43.090
then we're going to need

and he said, "You know, Michael,
I appreciate your interest

00:12:56.923 --> 00:12:59.630
in all the different nuclear
supply technologies,

00:12:59.654 --> 00:13:02.576
but there's this more basic issue,
