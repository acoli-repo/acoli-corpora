00:09:28.527 --> 00:09:30.813
they're not talking
about building new reactors.

00:09:30.837 --> 00:09:33.125
We're actually talking
about taking reactors down

00:09:33.149 --> 00:09:34.815
before their lifetimes are over.

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:37.627
Germany's actually pressuring
its neighbors to do that.

00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:39.458
I mentioned the United States --

00:09:39.482 --> 00:09:43.825
we could lose half of our reactors
over the next 15 years,

00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:46.666
which would wipe out 40 percent
of the emissions reductions

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.034
we're supposed to get
under the Clean Power Plan.

00:09:49.058 --> 00:09:52.125
Of course, in Japan, they took
all their nuclear plants offline,

00:09:52.149 --> 00:09:54.502
replaced them with coal,
natural gas, oil burning,

00:09:54.526 --> 00:09:58.088
and they're only expected to bring
online about a third to two-thirds.

00:09:58.112 --> 00:10:00.657
So when we went through the numbers,
