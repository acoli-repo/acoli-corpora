00:08:59.595 --> 00:09:02.562
it's just going to make the whole
machine a lot more expensive,

00:09:02.586 --> 00:09:04.918
it's just adding another complicated step.

00:09:05.765 --> 00:09:07.059
The truth is,

00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:10.845
there's real questions about how much
of that we're going to do.

00:09:10.869 --> 00:09:13.755
I mean, we went to India and asked
about the nuclear program.

00:09:13.779 --> 00:09:16.177
The government said
before the Paris climate talks

00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:19.257
that they were going to do something
like 30 new nuclear plants.

00:09:19.281 --> 00:09:21.352
But when we got there
and interviewed people

00:09:21.376 --> 00:09:23.457
and even looked at the internal documents,

00:09:23.481 --> 00:09:25.933
they're now saying
they're going to do about five.

00:09:25.957 --> 00:09:28.503
And in most of the world,
especially the rich world,

00:09:28.527 --> 00:09:30.813
they're not talking
about building new reactors.
