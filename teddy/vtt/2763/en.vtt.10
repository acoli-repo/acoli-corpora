00:04:56.806 --> 00:05:00.339
We don't have backup;
we don't have all the natural gas.

00:05:00.363 --> 00:05:02.895
And that's just the start of it.

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.808
Say we want to get
to 100 gigawatts by 2022.

00:05:05.832 --> 00:05:07.784
But last year we did just five,

00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:09.846
and the year before that, we did five."

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.746
So, let's just take
a closer look at nuclear.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.993
The United Nations Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change

00:05:16.017 --> 00:05:18.988
has looked at the carbon content
of all these different fuels,

00:05:19.012 --> 00:05:22.945
and nuclear comes out really low --
it's actually lower even than solar.

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:26.864
And nuclear obviously
provides a lot of power --

00:05:26.888 --> 00:05:29.441
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:33.399
During a year, a single plant can provide
power 92 percent of the time.
