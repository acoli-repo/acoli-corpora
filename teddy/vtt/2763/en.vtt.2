00:00:57.827 --> 00:01:00.587
but what we found really surprised us.

00:01:00.611 --> 00:01:04.521
The first thing is that clean
energy has been increasing.

00:01:04.545 --> 00:01:08.666
This is electricity from clean energy
sources over the last 20 years.

00:01:09.023 --> 00:01:12.741
But when you look at
the percentage of global electricity

00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:14.104
from clean energy sources,

00:01:14.128 --> 00:01:18.694
it's actually been in decline
from 36 percent to 31 percent.

00:01:18.718 --> 00:01:20.900
And if you care about climate change,

00:01:20.924 --> 00:01:23.070
you've got to go in the opposite direction

00:01:23.094 --> 00:01:26.644
to 100 percent of our electricity
from clean energy sources,

00:01:26.668 --> 00:01:28.266
as quickly as possible.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.447
Now, you might wonder,

00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:33.340
"Come on, how much could five percentage
points of global electricity be?"
