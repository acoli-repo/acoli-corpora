00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:33.340
"Come on, how much could five percentage
points of global electricity be?"

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:35.131
Well, it turns out to be quite a bit.

00:01:35.155 --> 00:01:38.298
It's the equivalent of 60 nuclear plants

00:01:38.322 --> 00:01:41.933
the size of Diablo Canyon,
California's last nuclear plant,

00:01:41.957 --> 00:01:45.626
or 900 solar farms the size of Topaz,

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.179
which is one of the biggest
solar farms in the world,

00:01:48.203 --> 00:01:50.829
and certainly our biggest in California.

00:01:51.587 --> 00:01:54.831
A big part of this is simply
that fossil fuels are increasing

00:01:54.855 --> 00:01:56.108
faster than clean energy.

00:01:56.132 --> 00:01:57.371
And that's understandable.

00:01:57.395 --> 00:01:59.110
There's just a lot of poor countries

00:01:59.134 --> 00:02:01.587
that are still using wood
and dung and charcoal
