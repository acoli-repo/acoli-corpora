00:11:57.207 --> 00:12:00.036
and it's threatening very serious
levels of global warming.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:04.012
And the truth is that even if we get
good at using that waste as fuel,

00:12:04.036 --> 00:12:06.311
there's always going to be
some fuel left over.

00:12:06.335 --> 00:12:10.206
That means there's always going to be
people that think it's a big problem

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.534
for reasons that maybe don't have
as much to do with the actual waste

00:12:13.558 --> 00:12:14.827
as we think.

00:12:14.851 --> 00:12:16.596
Well, what about the weapons?

00:12:17.052 --> 00:12:20.345
Maybe the most surprising thing
is that we can't find any examples

00:12:20.369 --> 00:12:22.322
of countries that have nuclear power

00:12:22.346 --> 00:12:24.774
and then, "Oh!" decide to go get a weapon.

00:12:24.798 --> 00:12:26.500
In fact, it works the opposite.

00:12:26.524 --> 00:12:28.690
What we find is the only way we know

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:31.166
how to get rid large numbers
of nuclear weapons
