00:07:57.594 --> 00:08:00.374
"I'm not sure what you've heard
about our thorium program,

00:08:00.398 --> 00:08:02.313
but we don't have a third of our budget,

00:08:02.337 --> 00:08:05.449
and your department of energy
hasn't been particularly forthcoming

00:08:05.473 --> 00:08:08.954
with all that data you guys
have on testing reactors."

00:08:09.382 --> 00:08:11.740
And I said, "Well, I've got an idea.

00:08:11.764 --> 00:08:15.360
You know how you've got 10 years
where you're demonstrating that reactor?

00:08:15.384 --> 00:08:16.956
Let's just skip that part,

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.330
and let's just go right
to commercializing it.

00:08:19.354 --> 00:08:21.000
That will save money and time."

00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:23.971
And the engineer just
looked at me and said,

00:08:23.995 --> 00:08:25.621
"Let me ask you a question:

00:08:25.645 --> 00:08:29.163
Would you buy a car that had never
been demonstrated before?"

00:08:29.913 --> 00:08:31.510
So what about the other reactors?
