00:04:28.904 --> 00:04:30.744
This is Aliso Canyon.

00:04:30.768 --> 00:04:33.782
So much methane gas was released,

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:36.992
it was the equivalent of putting
half a million cars on the road.

00:04:37.016 --> 00:04:40.913
It basically blew through all
of our climate commitments for the year.

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:43.005
Well, what about India?

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:46.280
Sometimes you have to go places
to really get the right data,

00:04:46.304 --> 00:04:48.285
so we traveled to India a few months ago.

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:51.440
We met with all the top officials --
solar, nuclear, the rest --

00:04:51.464 --> 00:04:53.005
and what they told us is,

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:55.083
"We're actually having
more serious problems

00:04:55.107 --> 00:04:56.782
than both Germany and California.

00:04:56.806 --> 00:05:00.339
We don't have backup;
we don't have all the natural gas.
