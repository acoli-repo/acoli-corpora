00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.778
because solar and wind
is going to make up the difference.

00:02:30.802 --> 00:02:32.658
But the data says something different.

00:02:32.682 --> 00:02:35.727
When you combine all the electricity
from solar and wind,

00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:40.550
you see it actually barely makes up
half of the decline from nuclear.

00:02:41.758 --> 00:02:44.076
Let's take a closer look
in the United States.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.891
Over the last couple of years --
really 2013, 2014 --

00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:51.384
we prematurely retired
four nuclear power plants.

00:02:51.408 --> 00:02:54.207
They were almost entirely
replaced with fossil fuels,

00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:57.737
and so the consequence
was that we wiped out

00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:02.687
almost as much clean energy
electricity that we get from solar.
