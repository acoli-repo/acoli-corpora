00:03:29.331 --> 00:03:32.639
that they're going to meet
their climate commitments in 2020.

00:03:33.137 --> 00:03:34.889
The reason isn't hard to understand.

00:03:34.913 --> 00:03:38.216
Solar and wind provide power
about 10 to 20 percent of the time,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.288
which means that when
the sun's not shining,

00:03:40.312 --> 00:03:41.664
the wind's not blowing,

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:43.839
you still need power for your hospitals,

00:03:43.863 --> 00:03:46.593
your homes, your cities, your factories.

00:03:46.617 --> 00:03:50.521
And while batteries have made
some really cool improvements lately,

00:03:50.545 --> 00:03:53.253
the truth is, they're just never
going to be as efficient

00:03:53.277 --> 00:03:54.476
as the electrical grid.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.627
Every time you put electricity
into a battery and take it out,

00:03:57.651 --> 00:04:00.907
you lose about 20 to 40
percent of the power.
