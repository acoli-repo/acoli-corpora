00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and radioactive nuclei

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
is straightforward.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
No life without tectonic activity,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
without volcanic activity.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And we know very well that geothermal energy

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
is mostly produced by decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
How to measure, if we have planets

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
where the amount of those elements is small,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
so those planets are tectonically dead,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
there cannot be life.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
If there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium,
