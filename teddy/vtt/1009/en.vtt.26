00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
So it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
"Well, somebody must be doing this, somehow."

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And with the known physics etc,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
it's something actually which has been pointed out

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
by Frank Drake,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
many years ago, and Shklovsky.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
If you see, in the spectrum of a planet host star,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
if you see strange chemical elements,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
it can be a signal from a civilization

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
which is there and they want to signal about it.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
They want to actually signal their presence

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
through these spectral lines,
