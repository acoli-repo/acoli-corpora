00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
where we can detect sound waves

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
in the atmospheres of stars.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
This is the sound of an Alpha Cen.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
We can detect sound waves

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
in the atmospheres of sun-like stars.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Those waves have frequencies

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
in infrasound domain, the sound actually nobody knows, domain.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Coming back to the most important question,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
"Is there anybody out there?"

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
This is closely related

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
to tectonic and volcanic activity of planets.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Connection between life

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and radioactive nuclei
