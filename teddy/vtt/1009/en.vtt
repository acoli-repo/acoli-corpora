00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I have a very difficult task.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm a spectroscopist.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I have to talk about astronomy without showing you

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
any single image of nebulae or galaxies, etc.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because my job is spectroscopy.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I never deal with images.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But I'll try to convince you

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that spectroscopy is actually something which can

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
change this world.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Spectroscopy can probably answer the question,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"Is there anybody out there?"

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Are we alone? SETI.
