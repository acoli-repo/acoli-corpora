00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
If there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
probably, again, there would be no life.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Because can you imagine everything boiling?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
It's too much energy on a planet.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Now, we have been measuring abundance

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
of thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
It's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
We are actually trying to measure this profile

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and to detect thorium.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
It's very tough. It's very tough.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And you have to, first you have to convince yourself.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Then you have to convince your colleagues.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And then you have to convince the whole world
