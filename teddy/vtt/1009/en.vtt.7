WEBVTT

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Which is used actually to identify chemical elements

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
in a cool matter,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Now, what we can do with the spectra?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We can actually study line-of-sight velocities

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
of cosmic objects.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And we can also study chemical composition

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and physical parameters of stars,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
galaxies, nebulae.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
A star is the most simple object.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
In the core, we have thermonuclear reactions going on,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
creating chemical elements.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And we have a cool atmosphere.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It's cool for me.
