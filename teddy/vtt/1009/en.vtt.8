00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And we have a cool atmosphere.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It's cool for me.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Cool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
My colleagues in infra-red astronomy

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
call minus 200 Kelvin is cool for them.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
But you know, everything is relative.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So for me 5,000 degrees is pretty cool.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
(Laughter)

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
This is the spectrum of the Sun --

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
24,000 spectral lines,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and about 15 percent of these lines is not yet identified.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It is amazing. So we are in the 21st century,
