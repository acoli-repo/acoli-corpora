00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And then you have to convince the whole world

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
that you have actually detected something like this

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
host star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
It's really difficult.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
But if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
you have to do this job.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
in those systems.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
The one way to discover about aliens

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
If you receive something interesting,
