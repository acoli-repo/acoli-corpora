I spent about eight months working on these profiles.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Because I've noticed

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
a very small symmetry

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
in the profile of one of the planet host stars.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And I thought, well maybe there is Lithium-6 in this star,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
which is an indication that this star

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
has swallowed a planet.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Because apparently you can't have this fragile isotope

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
of Lithium-6 in the atmospheres of sun-like stars.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But you have it in planets and asteroids.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids,
