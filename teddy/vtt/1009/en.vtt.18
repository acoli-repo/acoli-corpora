00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And we need nine centimeters per second

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
to detect an Earth-like planet.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
This can be done with the future spectrographs.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I, myself, I'm actually involved in the team

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
which is developing a CODEX,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
high resolution, future generation spectrograph

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
for the 42 meter E-ELT telescope.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And this is going to be an instrument

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
to detect Earth-like planets

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
around sun-like stars.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
It is an amazing tool called astroseismology

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
where we can detect sound waves
