00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Are we alone? SETI.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It's not very fun to do spectroscopy.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
One of my colleagues in Bulgaria,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Nevena Markova, spent about 20 years

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
studying these profiles.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And she published 42 articles

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
just dedicated to the subject.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Can you imagine? Day and night, thinking,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
observing, the same star for 20 years

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is incredible.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But we are crazy. We do these things.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
(Laughter)

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And I'm not that far.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I spent about eight months working on these profiles.
