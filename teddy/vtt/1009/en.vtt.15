00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
It's one of the mysteries we still have, super flares.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And there are six or seven similar cases

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
reported in the literature.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Now to go ahead with this,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
It's very complicated. I don't really want you to

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
try to understand what is here.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
(Laughter)

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
But it's to show you how complicated is the whole story

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
of the production of chemical elements.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
You have two channels --

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
the massive stars and low-mass stars --

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And doing this for 14 billion years,
