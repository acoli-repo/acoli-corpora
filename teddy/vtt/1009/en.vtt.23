00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
If you receive something interesting,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
well that's what SETI does actually,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
what SETI has been doing for many years.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
I think the most promising way

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
is to go for biomarkers.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
You can see the spectrum of the Earth, this Earthshine spectrum,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and that is a very clear signal.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
The slope which is coming, which we call a Red Edge,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
is a detection of vegetated area.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
It's amazing that we can detect vegetation

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
from a spectrum.
