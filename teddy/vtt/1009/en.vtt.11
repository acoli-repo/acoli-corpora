supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
It can be an indication.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
The other day, my colleague from Berkeley,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Gibor Basri, emailed me

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
a very interesting spectrum,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
asking me, "Can you have a look at this?"

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And I couldn't sleep, next two weeks,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
when I saw the huge amount of oxygen

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and other elements in the spectrum of the stars.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It was incredible. The only conclusion we could make from this
