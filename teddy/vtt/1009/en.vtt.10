00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And now this is a work in progress.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
We have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
which belongs to osmium.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
It's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
explosions of supernovae.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
It's the only place where you can produce, actually, osmium.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Just comparing the composition of osmium

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
in one of the planet host stars,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
we want to understand why there is so much

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
of this element.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Perhaps we even think that maybe

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars.
