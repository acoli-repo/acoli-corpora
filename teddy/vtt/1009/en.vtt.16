00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And doing this for 14 billion years,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
we end up with this picture,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
which is a very important graph,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
showing relative abundances of chemical elements

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
in sun-like stars

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and in the interstellar medium.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So which means that it's really impossible

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
to find an object where you find about 10 times more sulfur than silicon,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
five times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And if you find one, I will say that

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
this is something related to SETI,
