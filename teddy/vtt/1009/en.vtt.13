00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It's amazing that you can go so far

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
simply studying the chemical composition of stars.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
is an alien. It comes from a different galaxy.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
There is interaction of galaxies. We know this.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And sometimes they just capture stars.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
You've heard about solar flares.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
We were very surprised to discover

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
a super flare,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
a flare which is thousands of millions of times
