So if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
you will have this Lithium-6 isotope

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
in the spectrum of the star.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So I invested more than eight months

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
just studying the profile of this star.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And actually it's amazing,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
because I got phone calls from many reporters asking,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
"Have you actually seen the planet going into a star?"

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Because they thought that if you are having a telescope,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
you are an astronomer so what you are doing

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
is actually looking in a telescope.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And you might have seen the planet going into a star.
