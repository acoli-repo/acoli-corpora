00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and study a chemical composition of planets

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
far, far, far from solar system.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
We have to detect oxygen or ozone

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
to make sure that we have all necessary conditions

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
to have life.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Cosmic miracles are something

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
which can be related to SETI.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Now imagine an object, amazing object,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
or something which we cannot explain

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
when we just stand up and say,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
"Look, we give up. Physics doesn't work."

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
So it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
"Well, somebody must be doing this, somehow."
