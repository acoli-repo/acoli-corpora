00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that it's basically splitting a white light

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
into colors.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And if you have a liquid hot mass,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
A hot gas is producing emission lines only,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
no continuum.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And if you place a cool gas in front of a

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
hot source,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
you will see certain patterns

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
which we call absorption lines.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Which is used actually to identify chemical elements

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
in a cool matter,
