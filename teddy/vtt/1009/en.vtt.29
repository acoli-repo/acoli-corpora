00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I think it will not come from UFOs.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
It will not come from radio signals.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I think it will come from a spectrum like this.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
It is the spectrum of a planet like Earth,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
showing a presence of nitrogen dioxide,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
as a clear signal of life,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and oxygen and ozone.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
If, one day, and I think it will be

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
within 15 years from now, or 20 years.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
If we discover a spectrum like this

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
we can be sure that there is life on that planet.
