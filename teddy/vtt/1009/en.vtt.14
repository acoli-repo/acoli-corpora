00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
a super flare,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
a flare which is thousands of millions of times

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
more powerful than those we see in the Sun.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
In one of the binary stars in our galaxy

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
called FH Leo,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
we discovered the super flare.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And later we went to study the spectral stars

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
to see is there anything strange with these objects.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And we found that everything is normal.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
These stars are normal like the Sun. Age, everything was normal.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So this is a mystery.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
It's one of the mysteries we still have, super flares.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And there are six or seven similar cases
