00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
(Laughter)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Because they actually said that

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
you can get any color you like

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
in a spectrum.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And all you need is time and money

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
to make your spectrograph.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
This is the number one high resolution,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
most precise spectrograph on this planet, called HARPS,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
which is actually used to detect

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
extrasolar planets and sound waves

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
in the atmospheres of stars.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
How we get spectra?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I'm sure most of you know from school physics

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that it's basically splitting a white light
