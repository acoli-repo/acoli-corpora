00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It was incredible. The only conclusion we could make from this

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
in this system, which polluted the atmosphere

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
of this star.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And later a black hole was formed

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
in a binary system,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
which is still there with a mass of about

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
five solar masses.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
This was considered as first evidence that actually black holes

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
come from supernovae explosions.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
My colleagues, comparing composition of chemical elements

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
in different galactic stars,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy.
