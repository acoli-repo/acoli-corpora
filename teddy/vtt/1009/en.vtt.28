00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Now we are reviewing the spectra of about

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
300 stars with extrasolar planets.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And we are doing this job since 2000

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and it's a very heavy project.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
We have been working very hard.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And we have some interesting cases,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
candidates, so on, things which we can't really explain.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And I hope in the near future

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
we can confirm this.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
So the main question: "Are we alone?"

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I think it will not come from UFOs.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
It will not come from radio signals.
