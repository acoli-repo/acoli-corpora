It is amazing. So we are in the 21st century,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and we still cannot properly understand

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
the spectrum of the sun.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Sometimes we have to deal with

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
just one tiny, weak spectral line

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
For instance, you see the spectral line of the gold

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And we use this weak feature

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
to measure the composition

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
of gold in the atmosphere of the Sun.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And now this is a work in progress.
