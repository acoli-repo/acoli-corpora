00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:11.726
The full scope of a nuclear detonation 
is almost unimaginable.

00:00:11.726 --> 00:00:16.726
Hopefully, no one will ever experience 
another of these catastrophic incidents.

00:00:16.726 --> 00:00:20.621
But there is a scientifically supported 
plan of action

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:22.931
that could save hundreds 
of thousands of lives

00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:25.911
in the area surrounding 
a nuclear explosion.

00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:27.411
So what is this plan,

00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:30.241
and what exactly would it protect us from?
