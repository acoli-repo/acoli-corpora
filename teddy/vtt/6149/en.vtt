Last summer, I was hiking
through the Austrian mountains.

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:10.559
And there, on top, I saw
this beautiful, stone, remote hut,

00:00:10.583 --> 00:00:12.768
and it had solar panels on it.

00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:16.601
And every time I see solar panels,
I get very enthusiastic.

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:20.601
It's this technology that takes sunlight,
which is free and available,

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:22.500
and turns that into electricity.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:27.643
So this hut, in the middle of nowhere,
on a beautiful location,

00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:28.917
was self-sufficient.
