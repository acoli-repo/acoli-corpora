00:00:00.435 --> 00:00:02.418
All right. So, like all good stories,

00:00:02.418 --> 00:00:04.352
this starts a long, long time ago

00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:06.501
when there was basically nothing.

00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:08.901
So here is a complete picture of the universe

00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:12.353
about 14-odd billion years ago.

00:00:12.353 --> 00:00:15.437
All energy is concentrated into a single point of energy.

00:00:15.437 --> 00:00:17.021
For some reason it explodes,

00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:19.137
and you begin to get these things.

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:22.003
So you're now about 14 billion years into this.

00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:23.899
And these things expand and expand and expand

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:25.598
into these giant galaxies,

00:00:25.598 --> 00:00:26.917
and you get trillions of them.

00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:29.065
And within these galaxies

00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:31.184
you get these enormous dust clouds.
