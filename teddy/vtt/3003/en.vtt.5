00:02:32.293 --> 00:02:35.583
And suddenly, I realized
that even in the 21st century,

00:02:35.607 --> 00:02:38.102
every woman still has a story.

00:02:40.796 --> 00:02:42.376
Like Joyce,

00:02:43.125 --> 00:02:44.647
a flight attendant supervisor

00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:46.578
whose boss, in meetings every day,

00:02:46.602 --> 00:02:49.739
would tell her about the porn
that he'd watched the night before

00:02:49.763 --> 00:02:51.640
while drawing penises on his notepad.

00:02:51.664 --> 00:02:52.840
She went to complain.

00:02:52.864 --> 00:02:54.689
She was called "crazy" and fired.

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.635
Like Joanne, Wall Street banker.

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.234
Her male colleagues would call her
that vile c-word every day.
