00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.918
Ninety-eight percent of United States
corporations right now

00:09:32.942 --> 00:09:35.065
have sexual harassment training policies.

00:09:35.089 --> 00:09:38.418
Seventy percent have prevention programs.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.079
But still, overwhelmingly,

00:09:41.103 --> 00:09:44.349
bystanders and witnesses
don't come forward.

00:09:45.225 --> 00:09:46.377
In 2016,

00:09:46.401 --> 00:09:50.335
the Harvard Business Review
called it the "bystander effect."

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.686
And yet -- remember 9/11.

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:57.780
Millions of times we've heard,

00:09:57.804 --> 00:09:59.208
"If you see something,

00:09:59.232 --> 00:10:00.620
say something."
