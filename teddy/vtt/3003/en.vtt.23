00:11:29.428 --> 00:11:30.580
to change the laws.

00:11:30.604 --> 00:11:32.420
And here's what I tell the Senators:

00:11:32.444 --> 00:11:34.440
sexual harassment is apolitical.

00:11:34.464 --> 00:11:36.043
Before somebody harasses you,

00:11:36.067 --> 00:11:39.801
they don't ask you if you're
a Republican or Democrat first.

00:11:39.825 --> 00:11:41.119
They just do it.

00:11:41.143 --> 00:11:43.585
And this is why we should all care.

00:11:44.385 --> 00:11:45.535
Number three:

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.090
be fierce.

00:11:47.666 --> 00:11:50.269
It starts when we stand tall,

00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:52.255
and we build that self-confidence.

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:54.077
And we stand up and we speak up,

00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:56.479
and we tell the world what happened to us.

00:11:57.932 --> 00:11:59.933
I know it's scary,

00:11:59.957 --> 00:12:01.737
but let's do it for our kids.
