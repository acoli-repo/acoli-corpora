00:12:28.201 --> 00:12:30.462
and I was so anxious
about what they would face.

00:12:30.486 --> 00:12:32.699
My daughter came home
from school and she said,

00:12:32.723 --> 00:12:36.101
"Mommy, so many people asked me
what happened to you over the summer."

00:12:36.125 --> 00:12:37.746
Then she looked at me in the eyes

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:39.267
and she said, "And mommy,

00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:40.817
I was so proud

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:44.354
to say that you were my mom."

00:12:46.749 --> 00:12:48.009
And two weeks later,

00:12:48.033 --> 00:12:51.987
when she finally found the courage
to stand up to two kids

00:12:52.011 --> 00:12:54.059
who had been making her life miserable,

00:12:54.083 --> 00:12:55.698
she came home to me and she said,

00:12:55.722 --> 00:12:59.170
"Mommy, I found the courage to do it

00:12:59.917 --> 00:13:02.489
because I saw you do it."
