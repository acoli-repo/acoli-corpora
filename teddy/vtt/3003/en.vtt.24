00:11:59.957 --> 00:12:01.737
but let's do it for our kids.

00:12:02.102 --> 00:12:04.956
Let's stop this for the next generations.

00:12:06.777 --> 00:12:09.498
I know that I did it for my children.

00:12:10.835 --> 00:12:13.045
They were paramount in my decision-making

00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:15.277
about whether or not I would come forward.

00:12:15.623 --> 00:12:16.917
My beautiful children,

00:12:16.941 --> 00:12:18.704
my 12-year-old son, Christian,

00:12:18.728 --> 00:12:20.894
my 14-year-old daughter, Kaia.

00:12:20.918 --> 00:12:22.985
And boy, did I underestimate them.

00:12:24.164 --> 00:12:25.740
The first day of school last year

00:12:25.764 --> 00:12:28.177
happened to be the day
my resolution was announced,

00:12:28.201 --> 00:12:30.462
and I was so anxious
about what they would face.
