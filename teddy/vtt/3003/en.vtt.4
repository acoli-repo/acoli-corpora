00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:01.330
I jumped off a cliff all by myself.

00:02:02.685 --> 00:02:04.945
It was the scariest moment of my life;

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.995
an excruciating choice to make.

00:02:09.015 --> 00:02:11.873
I fell into an abyss all alone,

00:02:12.688 --> 00:02:14.749
not knowing what would be below.

00:02:16.373 --> 00:02:19.798
But then, something miraculous
started to happen.

00:02:19.822 --> 00:02:22.022
Thousands of women
started reaching out to me

00:02:22.046 --> 00:02:25.427
to share their own stories
of pain and agony and shame.

00:02:26.132 --> 00:02:28.387
They told me that I became their voice --

00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:29.942
they were voiceless.
