Her male colleagues would call her
that vile c-word every day.

00:03:01.258 --> 00:03:02.419
She complained --

00:03:02.443 --> 00:03:03.784
labeled a troublemaker,

00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:06.539
never to do another
Wall Street deal again.

00:03:07.438 --> 00:03:10.048
Like Elizabeth, an army officer.

00:03:10.831 --> 00:03:14.311
Her male subordinates would wave
one-dollar bills in her face,

00:03:14.335 --> 00:03:16.063
and say, "Dance for me!"

00:03:16.456 --> 00:03:18.415
And when she went to complain to a major,

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.983
he said, "What? Only one dollar?

00:03:21.007 --> 00:03:23.139
You're worth at least five or ten!"

00:03:26.392 --> 00:03:27.965
