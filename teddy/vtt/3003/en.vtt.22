Here's what it is.

00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:03.833
Forced arbitration takes away
your Seventh Amendment right

00:11:03.857 --> 00:11:05.278
to an open jury process.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.000
It's secret.

00:11:08.105 --> 00:11:10.400
You don't get the same
witnesses or depositions.

00:11:10.424 --> 00:11:13.269
In many cases, the company
picks the arbitrator for you.

00:11:13.855 --> 00:11:16.331
There are no appeals,

00:11:16.355 --> 00:11:19.157
and only 20 percent of the time
does the employee win.

00:11:19.927 --> 00:11:21.559
But again, it's secret,

00:11:21.583 --> 00:11:24.529
so nobody ever knows what happened to you.

00:11:25.732 --> 00:11:27.748
This is why I've been
working so diligently

00:11:27.772 --> 00:11:29.404
on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC

00:11:29.428 --> 00:11:30.580
to change the laws.
