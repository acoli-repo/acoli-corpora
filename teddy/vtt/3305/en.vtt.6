00:02:59.042 --> 00:03:01.184
that when women are educated,

00:03:01.208 --> 00:03:02.559
when they're employed

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:04.893
and they earn incomes,

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:07.625
they will be equal, empowered and free.

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:10.059
They're not.

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:11.351
Why?

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:15.018
From my research, I identify seven habits

00:03:15.042 --> 00:03:16.601
that delete women,

00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:18.809
that make women disappear,

00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:21.434
but these habits persist

00:03:21.458 --> 00:03:23.851
because they're so familiar to us

00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:25.958
and we've made them good and moral.

00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:30.375
Why would you change or drop
anything that's good and moral?
