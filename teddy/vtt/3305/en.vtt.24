00:11:58.375 --> 00:12:01.643
sounded not like me
but like my mother's generation.

00:12:01.667 --> 00:12:04.768
So then I went to another college
and another college.

00:12:04.792 --> 00:12:06.476
The thing that was striking to me

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.934
is that each woman felt she was alone,

00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:13.351
that she hides her fear
and hides her behavior,

00:12:13.375 --> 00:12:15.375
because she thinks it's a personal fault.

00:12:16.125 --> 00:12:19.059
It's not a personal fault, it's training,

00:12:19.083 --> 00:12:21.393
and I think that's the biggest revelation

00:12:21.417 --> 00:12:24.851
is that, if we stop pretending,

00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:26.601
then the world changes.

00:12:26.625 --> 00:12:29.309
SRK: Do you girls all agree
with what Deepa is saying?

00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:32.184
