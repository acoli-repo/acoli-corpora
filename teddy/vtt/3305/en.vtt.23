00:11:37.292 --> 00:11:41.268
because I had no plans to do a study
and no plans to write a book.

00:11:41.292 --> 00:11:45.101
I'd written 17 books before,
and I thought, "I'm done,"

00:11:45.125 --> 00:11:47.268

00:11:47.292 --> 00:11:52.393

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.351

to them to be a woman and man

00:11:58.375 --> 00:12:01.643
sounded not like me
but like my mother's generation.
