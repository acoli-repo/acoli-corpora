00:06:57.945 --> 00:07:00.339
They felt like they already
met their fitness goals

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:02.472
and they weren't going
to do anything else.

00:07:02.472 --> 00:07:04.091
These people were not motivated.

00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:06.233
Other people, though, 
based on our feedback,

00:07:06.233 --> 00:07:08.518
told us they were highly 
motivated to exercise.

00:07:08.518 --> 00:07:11.230
They had a strong goal
to make it to the finish line.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.227
But again, before we had them
walk to the finish line,

00:07:14.227 --> 00:07:16.197
we had them estimate the distance.

00:07:16.197 --> 00:07:17.945
How far away was the finish line?

00:07:17.945 --> 00:07:20.307
And again, like the previous study,

00:07:20.307 --> 00:07:22.141
we found that waist-to-hip ratio

00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:24.101
predicted perceptions of distance.

00:07:24.101 --> 00:07:28.733
Unfit individuals saw
the distance as farther,

00:07:28.733 --> 00:07:30.703
saw the finish line as farther away,
