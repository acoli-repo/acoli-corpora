00:02:29.388 --> 00:02:30.985
one at a time,

00:02:30.985 --> 00:02:33.884
so people did not realize
that what we were changing

00:02:33.884 --> 00:02:35.737
from one photograph to the next

00:02:35.737 --> 00:02:37.793
was whether we had artificially lightened

00:02:37.793 --> 00:02:40.341
or darkened his skin tone.

00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:41.901
So how is that possible?

00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:44.736
How could it be that
when I look at a person,

00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:46.457
an object, or an event,

00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:48.432
I see something very different

00:02:48.432 --> 00:02:50.261
than somebody else does?

00:02:50.261 --> 00:02:52.551
Well, the reasons are many,

00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:54.802
but one reason requires that we understand

00:02:54.802 --> 00:02:57.355
a little bit more about how our eyes work.

00:02:57.355 --> 00:02:59.364
So vision scientists know

00:02:59.364 --> 00:03:00.847
that the amount of information
