00:03:28.116 --> 00:03:30.364
and make sense of what it is that we see,

00:03:30.364 --> 00:03:33.749
and it's our mind that
helps us fill in that gap.

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:37.318
As a result, perception
is a subjective experience,

00:03:37.318 --> 00:03:38.777
and that's how we end up seeing

00:03:38.777 --> 00:03:41.005
through our own mind's eye.

00:03:41.005 --> 00:03:42.818
So, I'm a social psychologist,

and it's questions like these

00:03:44.335 --> 00:03:46.048
that really intrigue me.

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.196
when people do not see eye to eye.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:51.893
Why is it that somebody might

00:03:51.893 --> 00:03:54.505
literally see the glass as half full,

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:55.985
and somebody literally sees it

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:57.456
as half empty?

00:03:57.456 --> 00:04:00.577
What is it about what one person
is thinking and feeling
