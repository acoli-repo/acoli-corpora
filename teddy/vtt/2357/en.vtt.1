00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:30.943
Okay. What did you see?

00:00:30.943 --> 00:00:33.207
Well, we actually surveyed

00:00:33.207 --> 00:00:35.514
over 120 individuals,

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:37.464
and the results were mixed.

00:00:37.464 --> 00:00:39.731
People did not agree

00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:42.621
on what emotion they saw on his face.

00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:44.426
Maybe you saw discomfort.

00:00:44.426 --> 00:00:46.415
That was the most frequent response

00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:47.670
that we received.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.759
But if you asked the person on your left,

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:52.500
they might have said regret or skepticism,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.429
and if you asked somebody on your right,

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.323
they might have said
something entirely different,

00:00:57.323 --> 00:01:00.143
like hope or empathy.
