00:08:28.201 --> 00:08:30.683
and based on what we read,
we came up with a strategy

00:08:30.683 --> 00:08:34.061
that we called, "Keep 
your eyes on the prize."

00:08:34.061 --> 00:08:35.872
So this is not the slogan

00:08:35.872 --> 00:08:37.757
from an inspirational poster.

00:08:37.757 --> 00:08:40.005
It's an actual directive

00:08:40.005 --> 00:08:42.927
for how to look around your environment.

00:08:42.927 --> 00:08:45.219
People that we trained in this strategy,

00:08:45.219 --> 00:08:49.093
we told them to focus
their attention on the finish line,

00:08:49.093 --> 00:08:50.929
to avoid looking around,

00:08:50.929 --> 00:08:52.270
to imagine a spotlight

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.883
was shining on that goal,

00:08:53.893 --> 00:08:56.372
and that everything around it was blurry

00:08:56.372 --> 00:08:58.178
and perhaps difficult to see.

00:08:58.178 --> 00:09:00.349
We thought that this strategy
