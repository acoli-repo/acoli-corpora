00:00:00.673 --> 00:00:03.055
Vision is the most important

00:00:03.055 --> 00:00:05.643
and prioritized sense that we have.

00:00:05.643 --> 00:00:07.327
We are constantly looking

00:00:07.327 --> 00:00:09.101
at the world around us,

00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:11.298
and quickly we identify and make sense

00:00:11.298 --> 00:00:13.633
of what it is that we see.

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:15.552
Let's just start with an example

00:00:15.552 --> 00:00:16.825
of that very fact.

00:00:16.825 --> 00:00:18.835
I'm going to show you
a photograph of a person,

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:20.638
just for a second or two,

00:00:20.638 --> 00:00:22.533
and I'd like for you to identify

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.672
what emotion is on his face.

00:00:24.672 --> 00:00:25.900
Ready?

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.612
Here you go. Go with your gut reaction.

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:30.943
Okay. What did you see?
