00:05:58.302 --> 00:06:00.932
People who were out of shape and unfit

00:06:00.932 --> 00:06:03.030
actually saw the distance
to the finish line

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.193
as significantly greater

00:06:04.193 --> 00:06:06.084
than people who were in better shape.

00:06:06.084 --> 00:06:08.125
People's states of their own body

00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:11.361
changed how they
perceived the environment.

00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:13.477
But so too can our mind.

00:06:13.477 --> 00:06:15.386
In fact, our bodies and our minds

00:06:15.386 --> 00:06:17.363
work in tandem

00:06:17.363 --> 00:06:19.971
to change how we see the world around us.

00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:22.066
That led us to think that maybe people

00:06:22.066 --> 00:06:23.344
with strong motivations

00:06:23.344 --> 00:06:25.164
and strong goals to exercise

00:06:25.164 --> 00:06:28.336
might actually see
the finish line as closer

00:06:28.336 --> 00:06:32.036
than people who have weaker motivations.
