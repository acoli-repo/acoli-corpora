00:00:57.323 --> 00:01:00.143
like hope or empathy.

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:01.702
So we are all looking

00:01:01.702 --> 00:01:04.804
at the very same face again.

00:01:04.804 --> 00:01:06.232
We might see something

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.615
entirely different,

00:01:08.615 --> 00:01:11.679
because perception is subjective.

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:13.847
What we think we see

00:01:13.847 --> 00:01:15.289
is actually filtered

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.693
through our own mind's eye.

00:01:17.693 --> 00:01:19.946
Of course, there are many other examples

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:22.361
of how we see the world
through own mind's eye.

00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:24.143
I'm going to give you just a few.

00:01:24.143 --> 00:01:26.803
So dieters, for instance,

00:01:26.803 --> 00:01:28.821
see apples as larger

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:31.841
than people who are not counting calories.
