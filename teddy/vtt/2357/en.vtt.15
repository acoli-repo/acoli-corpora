00:07:28.733 --> 00:07:30.703
saw the finish line as farther away,

00:07:30.703 --> 00:07:32.650
than people who were in better shape.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.659
Importantly, though, this only happened

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:36.593
for people who were not motivated

00:07:36.593 --> 00:07:38.212
to exercise.

00:07:38.212 --> 00:07:39.802
On the other hand,

00:07:39.802 --> 00:07:42.846
people who were highly
motivated to exercise

00:07:42.846 --> 00:07:45.043
saw the distance as short.

00:07:45.043 --> 00:07:47.370
Even the most out of shape individuals

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:48.928
saw the finish line

00:07:48.928 --> 00:07:50.432
as just as close,

00:07:50.432 --> 00:07:52.267
if not slightly closer,

00:07:52.267 --> 00:07:54.923
than people who were in better shape.

00:07:54.923 --> 00:07:56.882
So our bodies can change

00:07:56.882 --> 00:07:59.120
how far away that finish line looks,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.039
but people who had committed
to a manageable goal
