00:11:59.267 --> 00:12:00.693
than the car in the front.

00:12:00.693 --> 00:12:02.299
However, in reality,

00:12:02.299 --> 00:12:04.678
these cars are the same size,

00:12:04.678 --> 00:12:07.573
but that's not how we see it.

00:12:07.573 --> 00:12:09.697
So does this mean that

00:12:09.697 --> 00:12:11.411
our eyes have gone haywire

00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:13.981
and that our brains are a mess?

00:12:13.981 --> 00:12:16.553
No, it doesn't mean that at all.

00:12:16.553 --> 00:12:18.574
It's just how our eyes work.

00:12:18.574 --> 00:12:21.263
We might see the world in a different way,

00:12:21.263 --> 00:12:23.035
and sometimes that might not

00:12:23.035 --> 00:12:25.101
line up with reality,

00:12:25.101 --> 00:12:27.226
but it doesn't mean
that one of us is right

00:12:27.226 --> 00:12:29.321
and one of us is wrong.

00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:31.457
We all see the world
through our mind's eye,
