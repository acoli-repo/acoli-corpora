00:08:58.178 --> 00:09:00.349
We thought that this strategy

00:09:00.349 --> 00:09:02.842
would help make the exercise look easier.

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:04.461
We compared this group

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:06.119
to a baseline group.

00:09:06.119 --> 00:09:07.324
To this group we said,

00:09:07.324 --> 00:09:08.911
just look around the environment

00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:10.160
as you naturally would.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.720
You will notice the finish line,

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.423
but you might also notice

00:09:13.423 --> 00:09:15.292
the garbage can off to the right,

00:09:15.292 --> 00:09:17.578
or the people and the 
lamp post off to the left.

00:09:17.578 --> 00:09:20.263
We thought that people
who used this strategy

00:09:20.263 --> 00:09:22.365
would see the distance as farther.

00:09:22.365 --> 00:09:24.812
So what did we find?

00:09:24.812 --> 00:09:26.785
When we had them estimate the distance,

00:09:26.785 --> 00:09:28.533
was this strategy successful

00:09:28.533 --> 00:09:31.033
for changing their perceptual experience?
