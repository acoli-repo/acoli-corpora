00:06:28.336 --> 00:06:32.036
than people who have weaker motivations.

00:06:32.036 --> 00:06:34.378
So to test whether motivations

00:06:34.378 --> 00:06:37.730
affect our perceptual
experiences in this way,

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.653
we conducted a second study.

00:06:39.653 --> 00:06:42.334
Again, we gathered objective measurements

00:06:42.334 --> 00:06:44.338
of people's physical fitness,

00:06:44.338 --> 00:06:46.396
measuring the circumference of their waist

00:06:46.396 --> 00:06:48.164
and the circumference of their hips,

00:06:48.164 --> 00:06:51.529
and we had them do a 
few other tests of fitness.

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:54.072
Based on feedback that we gave them,

00:06:54.072 --> 00:06:55.637
some of our participants told us

00:06:55.637 --> 00:06:57.945
they're not motivated
to exercise any more.

00:06:57.945 --> 00:07:00.339
They felt like they already
met their fitness goals
