WEBVTT

00:04:27.459 --> 00:04:30.565
For instance, we set
the best of intentions

00:04:30.565 --> 00:04:33.262
to exercise after the holidays,

00:04:33.262 --> 00:04:35.860
but actually, the majority of Americans

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.902
find that their New Year's resolutions

00:04:37.902 --> 00:04:40.958
are broken by Valentine's Day.

00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:42.460
We talk to ourselves

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.154
in very encouraging ways,

00:04:44.154 --> 00:04:45.987
telling ourselves this is our year

00:04:45.987 --> 00:04:47.688
to get back into shape,

00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:49.530
but that is not enough to bring us back

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.265
to our ideal weight.

00:04:51.265 --> 00:04:53.101
So why?

00:04:53.101 --> 00:04:55.184
Of course, there is no simple answer,

00:04:55.184 --> 00:04:57.947
but one reason, I argue,

00:04:57.947 --> 00:04:59.873
is that our mind's eye

00:04:59.873 --> 00:05:01.474
might work against us.
