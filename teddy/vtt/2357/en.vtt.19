00:09:28.533 --> 00:09:31.033
for changing their perceptual experience?

00:09:31.033 --> 00:09:32.231
Yes.

00:09:32.231 --> 00:09:34.436
People who kept their eyes on the prize

00:09:34.436 --> 00:09:37.485
saw the finish line as 30 percent closer

00:09:37.485 --> 00:09:39.096
than people who looked around

00:09:39.096 --> 00:09:40.376
as they naturally would.

00:09:40.376 --> 00:09:41.684
We thought this was great.

00:09:41.684 --> 00:09:43.566
We were really excited because it meant

00:09:43.566 --> 00:09:45.046
that this strategy helped make

00:09:45.046 --> 00:09:46.938
the exercise look easier,

00:09:46.938 --> 00:09:48.872
but the big question was,

00:09:48.872 --> 00:09:50.709
could this help make exercise

00:09:50.709 --> 00:09:52.100
actually better?

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.765
Could it improve the quality

00:09:53.765 --> 00:09:55.646
of exercise as well?


00:09:55.646 --> 00:09:57.909
So next, we told our participants,

00:09:57.909 --> 00:09:59.804
you are going to walk to the finish line

00:09:59.804 --> 00:10:02.031
while wearing extra weight.
