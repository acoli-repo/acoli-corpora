WEBVTT

00:02:59.364 --> 00:03:00.847
that the amount of information

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.718
that we can see

00:03:02.718 --> 00:03:04.557
at any given point in time,

00:03:04.557 --> 00:03:07.254
what we can focus on,
is actually relatively small.

00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:09.983
What we can see with great sharpness

00:03:09.983 --> 00:03:12.160
and clarity and accuracy

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.147
is the equivalent

00:03:14.147 --> 00:03:16.323
of the surface area of our thumb

00:03:16.323 --> 00:03:18.618
on our outstretched arm.

00:03:18.618 --> 00:03:20.757
Everything else around that is blurry,

00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:23.198
rendering much of what is presented

00:03:23.198 --> 00:03:25.842
to our eyes as ambiguous.

00:03:25.842 --> 00:03:28.116
But we have to clarify

00:03:28.116 --> 00:03:30.364
and make sense of what it is that we see,
