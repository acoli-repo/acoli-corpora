00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.039
but people who had committed
to a manageable goal

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:05.148
that they could accomplish
in the near future

00:08:05.148 --> 00:08:07.342
and who believed that they were capable

00:08:07.342 --> 00:08:08.938
of meeting that goal

00:08:08.938 --> 00:08:12.354
actually saw the exercise as easier.

00:08:12.354 --> 00:08:14.264
That led us to wonder,

00:08:14.264 --> 00:08:16.681
is there a strategy that we could use

00:08:16.681 --> 00:08:19.071
and teach people that would help

00:08:19.071 --> 00:08:21.340
change their perceptions of the distance,

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.821
help them make exercise look easier?

00:08:23.821 --> 00:08:26.455
So we turned to
the vision science literature

00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:28.201
to figure out what should we do,

00:08:28.201 --> 00:08:30.683
and based on what we read,
we came up with a strategy
