00:12:29.321 --> 00:12:31.457
We all see the world
through our mind's eye,

00:12:31.457 --> 00:12:34.308
but we can teach ourselves
to see it differently.

00:12:34.308 --> 00:12:36.132
So I can think of days

00:12:36.132 --> 00:12:38.166
that have gone horribly wrong for me.

00:12:38.166 --> 00:12:40.562
I'm fed up, I'm grumpy, I'm tired,

00:12:40.562 --> 00:12:42.102
and I'm so behind,

00:12:42.102 --> 00:12:44.508
and there's a big black cloud

00:12:44.508 --> 00:12:45.991
hanging over my head,

00:12:45.991 --> 00:12:47.425
and on days like these,

00:12:47.425 --> 00:12:49.300
it looks like everyone around me

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.434
is down in the dumps too.

00:12:51.434 --> 00:12:53.167
My colleague at work looks annoyed

00:12:53.167 --> 00:12:55.877
when I ask for an extension on a deadline,

00:12:55.877 --> 00:12:57.855
and my friend looks frustrated

00:12:57.855 --> 00:13:00.554
when I show up late for lunch
because a meeting ran long,
