As a roboticist,
I get asked a lot of questions.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.993
"When we will they start
serving me breakfast?"

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.725
So I thought the future of robotics
would be looking more like us.

00:00:16.114 --> 00:00:17.788
I thought they would look like me,

00:00:17.812 --> 00:00:21.559
so I built eyes
that would simulate my eyes.

00:00:22.813 --> 00:00:27.869
I built fingers that are dextrous
enough to serve me ...

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:29.083
baseballs.
