00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.538
I'm a physician trained in infectious diseases,

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:07.932
and following my training,

00:00:07.932 --> 00:00:10.854
I moved to Somalia

00:00:10.854 --> 00:00:12.898
from San Francisco.

00:00:12.898 --> 00:00:14.513
And my goodbye greeting

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:16.366
from the chief of infectious diseases

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.462
at San Francisco General was,

00:00:18.462 --> 00:00:22.145
"Gary, this is the biggest mistake you'll ever make."

00:00:22.145 --> 00:00:26.193
But I landed in a refugee situation

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:30.266
that had a million refugees in 40 camps,
