00:00:01.372 --> 00:00:03.583
Imagine two universes.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.336
In one of these universes,

00:00:07.378 --> 00:00:12.633
life flourishes on nearly
every planet you can encounter.

00:00:14.177 --> 00:00:18.806
Floating in the atmosphere,
swimming in the seas,

00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:20.558
lounging on the beaches.

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:25.646
Life in every body form and size
you can imagine.

00:00:27.023 --> 00:00:33.446
Now imagine the other universe
where life is nowhere to be found.
