A few years ago,

00:00:02.563 --> 00:00:05.797
a student came up to me
after the second day of my class

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.897
on parenting and child development.

00:00:08.563 --> 00:00:12.130
She hesitated for a second
and then she confessed,

00:00:12.163 --> 00:00:14.863
"I'm really interested in this material,

00:00:14.897 --> 00:00:18.063
but I was hoping your class
would help me to become a better parent

00:00:18.063 --> 00:00:19.597
if I have kids someday."

00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:21.763
She was disappointed.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.930
We were going to talk
about how parents do not have control

00:00:26.963 --> 00:00:29.297
in shaping who their children become.

00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:33.597
She jumped to the conclusion
that my class wouldn't help her.
