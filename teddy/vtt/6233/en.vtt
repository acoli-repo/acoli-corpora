At various points over the past 20 years,

00:00:03.974 --> 00:00:07.745
I've studied two fundamental
human experiences

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:10.031
that have taught me
an awful lot about emotion

00:00:10.055 --> 00:00:13.951
and that may hold the keys
to a revolution in psychiatry.

00:00:13.975 --> 00:00:16.026
The first is how we experience music.

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:19.256
The second is how we experience
psychedelic drugs

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.985
such as LSD and magic mushrooms,

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:23.241
or psilocybin,

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:25.578
which is the active component
in magic mushrooms.

00:00:26.086 --> 00:00:29.835
You may be wondering what these two things
have in common outside of Woodstock.

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.685
After all, music is not
a physical substance.
