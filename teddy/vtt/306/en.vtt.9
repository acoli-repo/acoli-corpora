How did Hippomenes beat her?

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.416
Well, he had all these wonderful little golden apples,

00:04:35.416 --> 00:04:38.034
and she'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple.

00:04:38.034 --> 00:04:40.038
She'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple.

00:04:40.038 --> 00:04:44.284
She kept getting distracted. He eventually won the race.

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:47.514
Just remember the purpose as all these little golden apples

come and reach you and you want to post about them

00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:53.922
or tweet about them or send a late-night message.

00:04:53.922 --> 00:04:57.170

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.717
Nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with Narcissus.
