00:00:58.631 --> 00:01:01.391
all these things you deal with every day

00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:03.751
turn out to be electronic tattoos?

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:05.373
And what if they provide as much information

00:01:05.373 --> 00:01:10.350
about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would?

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.536
What's ended up happening over the past few decades

00:01:12.536 --> 00:01:15.642
is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:18.321
or as a great celebrity

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:21.042
is now being applied to you every day by all these people

00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:24.029
who are Tweeting, blogging, following you,

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:28.349
watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself.

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:32.763
And electronic tattoos also shout.
