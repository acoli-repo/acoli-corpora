Nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with Narcissus.

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:03.013
(Laughter)

00:05:03.013 --> 00:05:05.581
But as you're thinking about Narcissus,

00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:09.661
just don't fall in love with your own reflection.

00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:11.452
Last lesson, from a Latin American:

00:05:11.452 --> 00:05:14.213
This is the great poet Jorge Luis Borges.

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:15.402
When he was threatened by the thugs

00:05:15.402 --> 00:05:18.035
of the Argentine military junta,

00:05:18.035 --> 00:05:20.288
he came back and said, "Oh, come on,

00:05:20.288 --> 00:05:23.733
how else can you threaten, other than with death?"

00:05:23.733 --> 00:05:26.853
The interesting thing, the original thing,

00:05:26.853 --> 00:05:30.045
would be to threaten somebody with immortality.
