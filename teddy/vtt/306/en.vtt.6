00:02:58.736 --> 00:03:00.314
because these tattoos will live

00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:03.091
far longer than our bodies will.

00:03:03.091 --> 00:03:04.982
And if that's true, then what we want to do

00:03:04.982 --> 00:03:08.391
is we want to go through four lessons from the Greeks

00:03:08.391 --> 00:03:11.700
and one lesson from a Latin American.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.523
Why the Greeks?

00:03:13.523 --> 00:03:15.380
Well, the Greeks thought about what happens

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.338
when gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time.

00:03:20.338 --> 00:03:23.018
So lesson number one: Sisyphus.

00:03:23.018 --> 00:03:26.044
Remember? He did a horrible thing, condemned for all time

00:03:26.044 --> 00:03:28.427
to roll this rock up, it would roll back down,

00:03:28.427 --> 00:03:30.400
roll back up, roll back down.
