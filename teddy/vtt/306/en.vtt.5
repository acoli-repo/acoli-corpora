00:02:29.942 --> 00:02:32.069
they figure out you really like to wear black dresses,

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.505
so maybe the person in the store comes up and says,

00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:36.805
"Hey, we've got five black dresses

00:02:36.805 --> 00:02:40.038
that would just look great on you."

00:02:40.038 --> 00:02:42.158
So what if Andy was wrong?

00:02:42.158 --> 00:02:43.428
Here's Andy's theory.

00:02:43.428 --> 00:02:45.272
[In the future, everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes.]

00:02:45.272 --> 00:02:46.378
What if we flip this?

00:02:46.378 --> 00:02:51.059
What if you're only going to be anonymous for 15 minutes? (Laughter)

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.075
Well, then, because of electronic tattoos,

00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:58.736
maybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality,

00:02:58.736 --> 00:03:00.314
because these tattoos will live
