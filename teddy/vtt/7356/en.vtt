Changing people's financial
behavior is difficult,

00:00:02.912 --> 00:00:04.288
but it is possible.

00:00:04.663 --> 00:00:07.038
[Your Money and Your Mind
with Wendy De La Rosa]

00:00:08.288 --> 00:00:11.913
One company that was looking to reduce
energy consumption in San Diego

00:00:11.954 --> 00:00:13.746
tried to change people's behaviors

00:00:13.788 --> 00:00:16.829
by using signs with one key sentence.

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.204
What exactly was that sentence?

00:00:19.246 --> 00:00:22.746
Well, it turns out that signs
about protecting the environment

00:00:22.788 --> 00:00:24.954
or looking out for future generations

00:00:24.954 --> 00:00:28.121
or signs that focus on
the amount of money that people will save

00:00:28.163 --> 00:00:31.829
were not effective in reducing
consumers' energy consumption.
