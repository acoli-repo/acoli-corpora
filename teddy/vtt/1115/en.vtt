00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So, I am indeed going to talk about

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the spaces men create for themselves,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but first I want to tell you why I'm here.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm here for two reasons. These two guys

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
are my two sons Ford and Wren.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
When Ford was about three years old,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we shared a very small room together,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in a very small space.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
My office was on one half of the bedroom,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and his bedroom was on the other half.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And you can imagine, if you're a writer,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that things would get really crowded around deadlines.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So when Wren was on the way,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I realized I needed to find a space of my own.
