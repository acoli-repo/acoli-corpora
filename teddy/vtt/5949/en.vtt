What’s as big as a polar bear, 
swallows its prey whole,

00:00:10.913 --> 00:00:13.913
and swims at 40 miles an hour?

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:16.579
It’s not a shark or a killer whale.

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.663
It’s the Atlantic bluefin tuna.

00:00:19.663 --> 00:00:23.538
The largest and longest-lived
of the 15 tuna species,

00:00:23.538 --> 00:00:27.079
the Atlantic bluefin has a unique set
of adaptations

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.788
that make it one of the most dominant 
predators in the ocean.
