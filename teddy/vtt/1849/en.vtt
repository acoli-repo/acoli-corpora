In 1962, Buckminster Fuller

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
presented the particularly audacious proposal for the Geoscope.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It was a 200-foot diameter geodesic sphere

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to be suspended over the East River in New York City, in full view of the United Nations.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It was a big idea, for sure, and it was one that he felt could truly inform

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and deeply affect the decision making of this body

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
through animations of global data, trends

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and other information regarding the globe, on this sphere.
