00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.136
And I had an MRI the next week,
and it looked like that.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.456
Essentially, the meniscus of cartilage
that is between bone

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.896
had been completely torn
and the bone itself had been shattered.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.376
Now, if you're looking at me
and feeling sorry,

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.216
let me tell you a few facts.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.416
If I was to take an MRI
of every person in this audience,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.496
60 percent of you would show signs

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.296
of bone degeneration
and cartilage degeneration like this.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.096
85 percent of all women by the age of 70

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.376
would show moderate to severe
cartilage degeneration.
