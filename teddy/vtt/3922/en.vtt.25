00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.216
so that you can recreate
or regenerate degenerating cartilage?

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.621
And perhaps more interesting,
and more importantly,

00:12:36.645 --> 00:12:40.096
the question is, can you apply this model
more globally outside medicine?

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.176
What's at stake, as I said before,
is not killing something,

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.640
but growing something.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.096
And it raises a series of, I think,
some of the most interesting questions

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.640
about how we think
about medicine in the future.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.920
Could your medicine
be a cell and not a pill?

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.216
How would we grow these cells?
