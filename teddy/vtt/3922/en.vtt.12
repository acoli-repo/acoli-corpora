00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.976
But you can have anti-carcinogenic
environments too.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.696
There are attempts to create milieus,

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.482
change the hormonal milieu
for breast cancer, for instance.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.856
We're trying to change the metabolic
milieu for other forms of cancer.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.296
Or take another disease, like depression.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.976
Again, working upwards,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.016
since the 1960s and 1970s,
we've tried, again, desperately

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.216
to turn off molecules
that operate between nerve cells --

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.416
serotonin, dopamine --

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.256
and tried to cure depression that way,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.720
and that's worked,
but then that reached the limit.
