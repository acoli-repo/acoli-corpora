These self-regulating,
semi-autonomous units

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.696
give rise to self-regulating,
semi-autonomous units called organs,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.720
and these organs coalesce
to form things called humans,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.816
and these organisms
ultimately live in environments,

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.440
which are partly self-regulating
and partly semi-autonomous.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.736
What's nice about this scheme,
this hierarchical scheme

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.456
building upwards rather than downwards,

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.856
is that it allows us
to think about illness as well

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.214
in a somewhat different way.
