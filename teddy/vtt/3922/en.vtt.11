00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.056
But let me give you an example
of a profoundly carcinogenic environment.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.280
It's called a prison.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.296
You take loneliness, you take depression,
you take confinement,

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.520
and you add to that,

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.960
rolled up in a little
white sheet of paper,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.776
one of the most potent neurostimulants
that we know, called nicotine,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.736
and you add to that one of the most potent
addictive substances that you know,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.556
and you have
a pro-carcinogenic environment.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.976
But you can have anti-carcinogenic
environments too.
