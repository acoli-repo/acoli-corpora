You have a pneumonia,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.856
you take penicillin,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.416
you kill the microbe

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.576
and you cure the disease.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.536
So seductive was this idea,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.736
so potent the metaphor of lock and key

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.296
and killing something,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.336
that it really swept through biology.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.480
It was a transformation like no other.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.336
And we've really spent the last 100 years

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.816
trying to replicate that model
over and over again

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.079
in noninfectious diseases,
