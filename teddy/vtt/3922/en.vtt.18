00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.416

And then about seven years ago,
we had a research student from Australia.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.205
The nice thing about Australians

00:09:13.205 --> 00:09:16.521

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.656
In other words, he had two hypotheses.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.496
Number one, there is such a thing
as a skeletal stem cell --
