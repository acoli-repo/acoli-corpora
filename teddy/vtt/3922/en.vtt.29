00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.856
Now, antibiotics created
such a perceptual shift

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.696
in our way of thinking about medicine
that it really colored, distorted,

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.640
very successfully, the way we've thought
about medicine for the last hundred years.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.816
But we need new models
to think about medicine in the future.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:46.320
That's what's at stake.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.816
You know, there's
a popular trope out there

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.816
that the reason we haven't had
the transformative impact

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.816
on the treatment of illness

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.696
is because we don't have
powerful-enough drugs,

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.080
and that's partly true.
