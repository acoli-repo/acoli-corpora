00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.216
as a vast global telephone network

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.120
with interacting nodes
and interacting pieces,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.776
then all of our medicinal chemistry

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.056
is operating on one tiny corner

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.776
at the edge, the outer edge,
of that network.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.616
It's like all of our
pharmaceutical chemistry

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.416
is a pole operator in Wichita, Kansas

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.400
who is tinkering with about
10 or 15 telephone lines.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.040
So what do we do about this idea?

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.520
What if we reorganized this approach?
