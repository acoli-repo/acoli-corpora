00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.736
but eventually you run
to the ceiling of that approach.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.256
And it's only in the last 10 years or so

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.416
that we've begun to think
about using the immune system,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.536
remembering that in fact the cancer cell
doesn't grow in a vacuum.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.616
It actually grows in a human organism.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.936
And could you use the organismal capacity,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.103
the fact that human beings
have an immune system, to attack cancer?

00:05:17.127 --> 00:05:21.327
In fact, it's led to the some of the most
spectacular new medicines in cancer.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.814
And finally there's the level
of the environment, isn't there?

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.136
You know, we don't think of cancer
as altering the environment.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.056
But let me give you an example
of a profoundly carcinogenic environment.
