00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.214
in a somewhat different way.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.520
Take a disease like cancer.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.416
Since the 1950s,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.967
we've tried rather desperately to apply
this lock and key model to cancer.

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.880
We've tried to kill cells

00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:50.252
using a variety of chemotherapies 
or targeted therapies,

00:04:50.276 --> 00:04:52.696
and as most of us know, that's worked.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.578
It's worked for diseases like leukemia.

00:04:54.602 --> 00:04:56.976
It's worked for some forms
of breast cancer,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.736
but eventually you run
to the ceiling of that approach.
