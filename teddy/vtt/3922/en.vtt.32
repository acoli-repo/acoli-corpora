00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.696
We've thought about
personalization of medicine

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.256
very much in terms of genomics.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.856
That's because the gene
is such a dominant metaphor,

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.856
again, to use that same word,
in medicine today,

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.616
that we think the genome will drive
the personalization of medicine.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.736
But of course the genome
is just the bottom

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.576
of a long chain of being, as it were.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.416
That chain of being, really the first
organized unit of that, is the cell.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.416
So, if we are really going to deliver
in medicine in this way,

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.256
we have to think of personalizing
cellular therapies,

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.456
and then personalizing
organ or organismal therapies,
