Can you lock out the signals
that elicit depression?

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.000
Again, moving upwards along this
hierarchical chain of organization.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.456
What's really at stake perhaps here

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.736
is not the medicine itself but a metaphor.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.816
Rather than killing something,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.536
in the case of the great
chronic degenerative diseases --

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.056
kidney failure, diabetes,
hypertension, osteoarthritis --

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.652
maybe what we really need to do is change
the metaphor to growing something.

00:07:26.676 --> 00:07:28.616
And that's the key, perhaps,

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.136
to reframing our thinking about medicine.
