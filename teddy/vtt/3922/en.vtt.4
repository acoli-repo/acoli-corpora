00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.079
in noninfectious diseases,

00:02:00.103 --> 00:02:04.223
in chronic diseases like diabetes
and hypertension and heart disease.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.759
And it's worked,
but it's only worked partly.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.776
Let me show you.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.696
You know, if you take the entire universe

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.216
of all chemical reactions
in the human body,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.536
every chemical reaction
that your body is capable of,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.576
most people think that that number
is on the order of a million.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.896
Let's call it a million.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.616
And now you ask the question,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.296
what number or fraction of reactions

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.136
can actually be targeted
