00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.136
These cells are fascinating.
They have four properties.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.936
Number one is that they live
where they're expected to live.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.336
They live just underneath
the surface of the bone,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.896
underneath cartilage.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.540
You know, in biology,
it's location, location, location.

00:10:40.564 --> 00:10:44.816
And they move into the appropriate areas
and form bone and cartilage.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.096
That's one.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.656
Here's an interesting property.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.336
You can take them out
of the vertebrate skeleton,

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.936
you can culture them
in petri dishes in the laboratory,

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.936
and they are dying to form cartilage.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.682
Remember how we couldn't
form cartilage for love or money?

00:10:57.706 --> 00:10:59.625
These cells are dying to form cartilage.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.655
They form their own furls
of cartilage around themselves.
