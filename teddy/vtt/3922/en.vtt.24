00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.656
because we were now thinking
about bone stem cells,

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.120
we were thinking about arthritis
in terms of a cellular disease.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.126
And then the next question was,
are there organs?

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.389
Can you build this
as an organ outside the body?

00:12:10.413 --> 00:12:14.256
Can you implant cartilage
into areas of trauma?

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.256
And perhaps most interestingly,

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.656
can you ascend right up
and create environments?

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.736
You know, we know
that exercise remodels bone,

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.176
but come on, none of us
is going to exercise.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.376
So could you imagine ways of passively
loading and unloading bone

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.216
so that you can recreate
or regenerate degenerating cartilage?
