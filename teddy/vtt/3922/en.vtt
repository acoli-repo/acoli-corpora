00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.936
I want to talk to you
about the future of medicine.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.056
But before I do that, I want to talk
a little bit about the past.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.696
Now, throughout much
of the recent history of medicine,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.536
we've thought about illness and treatment

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.936
in terms of a profoundly simple model.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.656
In fact, the model is so simple

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.736
that you could summarize it in six words:

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.840
have disease, take pill, kill something.
