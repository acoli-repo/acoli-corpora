00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.176
So let me end with some thoughts
about model building.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.296
That's what we do as scientists.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.616
You know, when an architect
builds a model,

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.936
he or she is trying to show you
a world in miniature.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.856
But when a scientist is building a model,

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.404
he or she is trying to show you
the world in metaphor.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.456
He or she is trying to create
a new way of seeing.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.600
The former is a scale shift.
The latter is a perceptual shift.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.856
Now, antibiotics created
such a perceptual shift
