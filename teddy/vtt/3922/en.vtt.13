00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.720
and that's worked,
but then that reached the limit.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.620
And we now know that what you
really probably need to do

00:06:35.644 --> 00:06:38.616
is to change the physiology
of the organ, the brain,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.776
rewire it, remodel it,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.376
and that, of course,
we know study upon study has shown

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.115
that talk therapy does exactly that,

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.395
and study upon study
has shown that talk therapy

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:50.536
combined with medicines, pills,

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.989
really is much more effective
than either one alone.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.416
Can we imagine a more immersive
environment that will change depression?

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.496
Can you lock out the signals
that elicit depression?
