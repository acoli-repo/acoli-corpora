00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.136
to reframing our thinking about medicine.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.616
Now, this idea of changing,

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.976
of creating a perceptual
shift, as it were,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.296
came home to me to roost in a very
personal manner about 10 years ago.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.096
About 10 years ago --
I've been a runner most of my life --

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.096
I went for a run, a Saturday morning run,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.776
I came back and woke up
and I basically couldn't move.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.816
My right knee was swollen up,

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.360
and you could hear that ominous crunch
of bone against bone.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.136
And one of the perks of being a physician
is that you get to order your own MRIs.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.136
And I had an MRI the next week,
and it looked like that.
