00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.960
and now we began
to look for skeletal stem cells.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.056
And to cut again a long story short,

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.000
about five years ago,
we found these cells.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.296
They live inside the skeleton.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.216
Here's a schematic and then
a real photograph of one of them.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.176
The white stuff is bone,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.216
and these red columns that you see
and the yellow cells

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.496
are cells that have arisen
from one single skeletal stem cell --

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.816
columns of cartilage, columns of bone
coming out of a single cell.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.136
These cells are fascinating.
They have four properties.
