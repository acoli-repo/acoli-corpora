What if we reorganized this approach?

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.456
In fact, it turns out
that the natural world

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.536
gives us a sense of how one
might think about illness

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.216
in a radically different way,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.960
rather than disease, medicine, target.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.456
In fact, the natural world
is organized hierarchically upwards,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.336
not downwards, but upwards,

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.600
and we begin with a self-regulating,
semi-autonomous unit called a cell.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.856
These self-regulating,
semi-autonomous units
