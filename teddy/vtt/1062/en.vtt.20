00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
because all I had to work with was a bicep and a tricep.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So for the simple little things like picking something up,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I would have to bend my elbow,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and then I would have to cocontract

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
to get it to change modes.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
When I did that,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I had to use my bicep

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
to get the hand to close,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
use my tricep to get it to open,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
cocontract again

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
to get the elbow to work again.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
TK: So it was a little slow?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
AK: A little slow, and it was just hard to work.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
You had to concentrate a whole lot.
