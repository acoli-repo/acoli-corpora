00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
You had to concentrate a whole lot.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
TK: Okay, so I think about nine months later

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
that you had the targeted reinnervation surgery,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
took six more months to have all the reinnervation.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Then we fit her with a prosthesis.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And how did that work for you?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
AK: It works good.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
I was able to use my elbow

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and my hand simultaneously.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I could work them just by my thoughts.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So I didn't have to do any of the cocontracting and all that.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
TK: A little faster?
