WEBVTT

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And after about three months,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
the nerves grew in a little bit and we could get a twitch.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And after six months, the nerves grew in well,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and you could see strong contractions.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And this is what it looks like.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
This is what happens when Jesse thinks

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
open and close his hand,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
or bend or straighten your elbow.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
You can see the movements on his chest,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and those little hash marks

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
are where we put our antennae, or electrodes.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And I challenge anybody in the room

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
to make their chest go like this.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
His brain is thinking about his arm.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
He has not learned how to do this with the chest.
