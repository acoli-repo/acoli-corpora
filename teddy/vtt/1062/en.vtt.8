00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
When you lose your arm, that nervous system still works.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Those nerves can put out command signals.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And if I tap the nerve ending

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
on a World War II vet,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
he'll still feel his missing hand.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So you might say,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
let's go to the brain

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and put something in the brain to record signals,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
or in the end of the peripheral nerve and record them there.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And these are very exciting research areas,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
but it's really, really hard.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
You have to put in

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
hundreds of microscopic wires

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
to record from little tiny individual neurons -- ordinary fibers
