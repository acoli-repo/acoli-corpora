00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Imagine, with somebody who's lost their whole arm,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
we still have four major nerves

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
that go down your arm.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And we take the nerve away from your chest muscle

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and let these nerves grow into it.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Now you think, "Close hand," and a little section of your chest contracts.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
You think, "Bend elbow,"

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
a different section contracts.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And we can use electrodes or antennae

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
to pick that up and tell the arm to move.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
That's the idea.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So this is the first man that we tried it on.
