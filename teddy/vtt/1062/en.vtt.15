00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
you can see that he's much faster

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and much smoother as he moves these little blocks.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And we're only able to use three of the signals at this time.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Then we had one of those little surprises in science.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So we're all motivated to get motor commands

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
to drive robotic arms.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And after a few months,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
you touch Jesse on his chest,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and he felt his missing hand.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
His hand sensation grew into his chest again

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
probably because we had also taken away a lot of fat,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
so the skin was right down to the muscle

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and deinnervated, if you would, his skin.
