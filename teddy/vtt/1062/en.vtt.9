WEBVTT

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
to record from little tiny individual neurons -- ordinary fibers

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that put out tiny signals

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
that are microvolts.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And it's just too hard

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
to use now and for my patients today.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So we developed a different approach.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
We're using a biological amplifier

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
to amplify these nerve signals -- muscles.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Muscles will amplify the nerve signals

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
about a thousand-fold,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
so that we can record them from on top of the skin,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
like you saw earlier.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation.
