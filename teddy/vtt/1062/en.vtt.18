You see him with his original device

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
on the left there after eight months of use,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and on the right, it is two months.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
He's about four or five times as fast

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
with this simple little performance metric.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
All right.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So one of the best parts of my job

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
is working with really great patients

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
who are also our research collaborators.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And we're fortunate today

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
to have Amanda Kitts come and join us.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Please welcome Amanda Kitts.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000
