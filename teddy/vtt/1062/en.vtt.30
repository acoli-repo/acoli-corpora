00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I had the key grip, I had a chuck grip,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
I had a power grasp

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
and I had a fine pinch.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
But my favorite one was just when the hand was open,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
because I work with kids,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and so all the time you're clapping and singing,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
so I was able to do that again, which was really good.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
TK: That hand's not so good for clapping.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
AK: Can't clap with this one.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
TK: All right. So that's exciting

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
on where we may go with the better mechatronics,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
if we make them good enough

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
to put out on the market and use in a field trial.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I want you to watch closely.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
