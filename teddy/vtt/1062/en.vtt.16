00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
so the skin was right down to the muscle

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and deinnervated, if you would, his skin.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So you touch Jesse here, he feels his thumb;

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
you touch it here, he feels his pinky.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
He feels light touch

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
down to one gram of force.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
He feels hot, cold, sharp, dull,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
all in his missing hand,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
or both his hand and his chest,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
but he can attend to either.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So this is really exciting for us,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
because now we have a portal,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
a portal, or a way to potentially give back sensation,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
so that he might feel what he touches

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
with his prosthetic hand.
