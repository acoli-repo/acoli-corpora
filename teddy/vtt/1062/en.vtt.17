00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
with his prosthetic hand.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Imagine sensors in the hand

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
coming up and pressing on this new hand skin.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So it was very exciting.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
We've also gone on

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
with what was initially our primary population

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
of people with above-the-elbow amputations.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And here we deinnervate, or cut the nerve away,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
just from little segments of muscle

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and leave others alone

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
that give us our up-down signals

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and two others that will give us a hand open and close signal.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
This was one of our first patients, Chris.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
You see him with his original device

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
