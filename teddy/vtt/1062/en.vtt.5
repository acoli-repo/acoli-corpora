00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So it's intuitive, and it works pretty well.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Well how about with higher levels of amputation?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Now you've lost your arm above the elbow.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
You're missing not only these muscles,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
but your hand and your elbow too.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
What do you do?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Well our patients have to use

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
very code-y systems

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
of using just their arm muscles

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
to operate robotic limbs.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
We have robotic limbs.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
There are several available on the market, and here you see a few.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
They contain just a hand that will open and close,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
a wrist rotator and an elbow.
