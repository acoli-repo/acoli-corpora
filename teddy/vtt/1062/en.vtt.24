00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So we did some experiments

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
where we saturated our poor patients with zillions of electrodes

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and then had them try to do two dozen different tasks --

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
from wiggling a finger to moving a whole arm

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
to reaching for something --

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and recorded this data.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And then we used some algorithms

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
that are a lot like speech recognition algorithms,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
called pattern recognition.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
See.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
(Laughter)

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And here you can see, on Jesse's chest,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
when he just tried to do three different things,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
you can see three different patterns.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
But I can't put in an electrode
