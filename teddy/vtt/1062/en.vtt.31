00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
(Video) Claudia: Oooooh!

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
TK: That's Claudia,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
and that was the first time

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
she got to feel sensation through her prosthetic.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
She had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
that then she rubbed over different surfaces,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
and she could feel different textures

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
of sandpaper, different grits, ribbon cable,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
She said that when she just ran it across the table,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
it felt like her finger was rocking.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
So that's an exciting laboratory experiment

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
on how to give back, potentially, some skin sensation.
