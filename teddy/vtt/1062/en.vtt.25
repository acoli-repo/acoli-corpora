00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
you can see three different patterns.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
But I can't put in an electrode

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and say, "Go there."

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So we collaborated with our colleagues in University of New Brunswick,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
came up with this algorithm control,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
which Amanda can now demonstrate.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
AK: So I have the elbow that goes up and down.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I have the wrist rotation

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
that goes -- and it can go all the way around.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And I have the wrist flexion and extension.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And I also have the hand closed and open.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
TK: Thank you, Amanda.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Now this is a research arm,
