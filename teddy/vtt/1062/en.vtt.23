00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Because we're putting a big fat nerve onto a little piece of muscle.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And it provides intuitive control.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Our functional testing, those little tests,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
all show that they're a lot quicker and a lot easier.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And the most important thing

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
is our patients have appreciated it.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
So that was all very exciting.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
But we want to do better.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
There's a lot of information in those nerve signals,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and we wanted to get more.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
You can move each finger. You can move your thumb, your wrist.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Can we get more out of it?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So we did some experiments
