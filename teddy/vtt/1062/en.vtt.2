00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And we interact with the physical world with our hands.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And when they're missing,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
it's a barrier.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Arm amputation is usually caused by trauma,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
with things like industrial accidents,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
motor vehicle collisions

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
or, very poignantly, war.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
There are also some children who are born without arms,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
called congenital limb deficiency.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Unfortunately, we don't do great

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
with upper-limb prosthetics.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
There are two general types.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
They're called body-powered prostheses,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
which were invented just after the Civil War,
