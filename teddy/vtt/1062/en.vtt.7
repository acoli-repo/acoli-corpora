00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
How do we control them?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Well we need a neural interface,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
a way to connect to our nervous system

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
or our thought processes

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
so that it's intuitive, it's natural,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
like for you and I.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Well the body works by starting a motor command in your brain,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
going down your spinal cord,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
out the nerves and to your periphery.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And your sensation's the exact opposite.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
You touch yourself, there's a stimulus

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that comes up those very same nerves back up to your brain.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
When you lose your arm, that nervous system still works.
