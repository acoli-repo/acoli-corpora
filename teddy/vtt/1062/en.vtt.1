Arm amputation causes a huge disability.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I mean, the functional impairment is clear.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Our hands are amazing instruments.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And when you lose one, far less both,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
it's a lot harder to do the things

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
we physically need to do.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
There's also a huge emotional impact.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And actually, I spend as much of my time in clinic

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
dealing with the emotional adjustment of patients

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
as with the physical disability.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And finally, there's a profound social impact.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We talk with our hands.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We greet with our hands.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And we interact with the physical world with our hands.
