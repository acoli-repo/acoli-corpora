00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
TK: A little faster?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
AK: A little faster. And much more easy, much more natural.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
TK: Okay, this was my goal.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
For 20 years, my goal was to let somebody

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
[be] able to use their elbow and hand in an intuitive way

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
and at the same time.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And we now have over 50 patients around the world who have had this surgery,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
including over a dozen of our wounded warriors

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
in the U.S. armed services.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
The success rate of the nerve transfers is very high.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
It's like 96 percent.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Because we're putting a big fat nerve onto a little piece of muscle.
