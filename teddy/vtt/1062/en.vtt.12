00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
with those three joints,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and he operates little pads in his shoulder

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
that he touches to make the arm go.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And Jesse's a good crane operator,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and he did okay by our standards.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
He also required a revision surgery on his chest.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And that gave us the opportunity

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
to do targeted reinnervation.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So my colleague, Dr. Greg Dumanian, did the surgery.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
First, we cut away the nerve to his own muscle,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
then we took the arm nerves

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and just kind of had them shift down onto his chest

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and closed him up.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And after about three months,
