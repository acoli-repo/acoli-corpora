00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
TK: Thank you, Amanda.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Now this is a research arm,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
but it's made out of commercial components from here down

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and a few that I've borrowed from around the world.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
It's about seven pounds,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
which is probably about what my arm would weigh

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
if I lost it right here.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Obviously, that's heavy for Amanda.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And in fact, it feels even heavier,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
because it's not glued on the same.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
She's carrying all the weight through harnesses.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
So the exciting part isn't so much the mechatronics,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
but the control.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
So we've developed a small microcomputer
