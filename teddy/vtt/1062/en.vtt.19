00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
So Amanda, would you please tell us how you lost your arm?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Amanda Kitts: Sure. In 2006, I had a car accident.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And I was driving home from work,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and a truck was coming the opposite direction,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
came over into my lane,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Todd Kuiken: Okay, so after your amputation, you healed up.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And you've got one of these conventional arms.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Can you tell us how it worked?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
AK: Well, it was a little difficult,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
because all I had to work with was a bicep and a tricep.
