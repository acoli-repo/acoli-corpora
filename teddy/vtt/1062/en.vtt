00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So today, I would like to talk with you

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about bionics,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which is the popular term

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
for the science of replacing part of a living organism

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
with a mechatronic device, or a robot.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It is essentially

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the stuff of life meets machine.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And specifically, I'd like to talk with you

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
about how bionics is evolving

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
for people with arm amputations.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This is our motivation.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Arm amputation causes a huge disability.
