00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
which were invented just after the Civil War,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
refined in World War I and World War II.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Here you see a patent

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
for an arm in 1912.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It's not a lot different

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
than the one you see on my patient.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
They work by harnessing shoulder power.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So when you squish your shoulders, they pull on a bicycle cable.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And that bicycle cable can open or close a hand or a hook

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
or bend an elbow.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And we still use them commonly,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
because they're very robust

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and relatively simple devices.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The state of the art
