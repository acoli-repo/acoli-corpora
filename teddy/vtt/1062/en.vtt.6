00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
a wrist rotator and an elbow.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
There's no other functions.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
If they did, how would we tell them what to do?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
We built our own arm at the Rehab Institute of Chicago

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
where we've added some wrist flexion and shoulder joints

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
to get up to six motors, or six degrees of freedom.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And we've had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that were funded by the U.S. military, using these prototypes,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
that had up to 10 different degrees of freedom

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
including movable hands.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But at the end of the day,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
how do we tell these robotic arms what to do?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
How do we control them?
