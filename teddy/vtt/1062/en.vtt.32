00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
on how to give back, potentially, some skin sensation.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
But here's another video that shows some of our challenges.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
This is Jesse, and he's squeezing a foam toy.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And the harder he squeezes -- you see a little black thing in the middle

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
that's pushing on his skin proportional to how hard he squeezes.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
But look at all the electrodes around it.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
I've got a real estate problem.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
You're supposed to put a bunch of these things on there,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
but our little motor's making all kinds of noise

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
right next to my electrodes.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
So we're really challenged on what we're doing there.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
The future is bright.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
We're excited about where we are and a lot of things we want to do.
