The state of the art

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
is what we call myoelectric prostheses.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
These are motorized devices

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that are controlled

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
by little electrical signals from your muscle.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Every time you contract a muscle,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
it emits a little electricity

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that you can record with antennae or electrodes

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and use that to operate the motorized prosthesis.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
They work pretty well

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
for people who have just lost their hand,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
because your hand muscles are still there.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
You squeeze your hand, these muscles contract.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You open it, these muscles contract.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So it's intuitive, and it works pretty well.
