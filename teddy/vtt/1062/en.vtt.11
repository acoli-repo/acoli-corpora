00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So this is the first man that we tried it on.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
His name is Jesse Sullivan.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
He's just a saint of a man --

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000

they had to be amputated at the shoulder.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000

I'm still using that old technology

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
with a bicycle cable on his right side.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And he picks which joint he wants to move with those chin switches.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
On the left side he's got a modern motorized prosthesis

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
with those three joints,
