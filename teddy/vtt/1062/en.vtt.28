00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
with just this little piece on the back.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I can wear it around.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
If it stops working for some reason, I can retrain it.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Takes about a minute.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
TK: So we're really excited,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
because now we're getting to a clinically practical device.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And that's where our goal is --

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
to have something clinically pragmatic to wear.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
We've also had Amanda able to use

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
some of our more advanced arms that I showed you earlier.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Here's Amanda using an arm made by DEKA Research Corporation.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And I believe Dean Kamen presented it at TED a few years ago.
