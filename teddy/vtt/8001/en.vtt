00:00:00.455 --> 00:00:02.707
We're going on a field trip together.

00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.876
We're going back to middle school,

00:00:04.917 --> 00:00:06.169
to chemistry class.

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:08.379
Do you remember this?

00:00:08.421 --> 00:00:11.132
It was an experiment
we did with salt water,

00:00:11.174 --> 00:00:13.468
a battery and two pencils.

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:14.677
Guess what?

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:18.723
The reaction you witnessed then
is a key to tackling climate change.

00:00:18.723 --> 00:00:22.477
Yes, at 14 years old, we already knew.

00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:28.191
And today, we have the means to replace
fossil fuels with green hydrogen.

00:00:28.983 --> 00:00:30.443
Let's walk through this.
