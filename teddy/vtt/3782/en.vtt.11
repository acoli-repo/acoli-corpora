00:05:29.666 --> 00:05:31.919
No one was allowed up on the top.

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.077
We all paid 6,000 dollars each

00:05:35.077 --> 00:05:37.166
for this part of the trip.

00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:39.395
The first night and day went smoothly,

00:05:39.395 --> 00:05:42.623
but by the second night, 
the weather turned.

00:05:42.623 --> 00:05:47.568
Waves tossed the boat around,
and the timbers groaned.

00:05:47.568 --> 00:05:51.910
People below deck were crying,
praying, recalling their loved ones.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.652
They were screaming.

00:05:53.652 --> 00:05:55.811
It was a terrible moment.

00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:59.758
It was like a scene from doomsday,

00:05:59.758 --> 00:06:04.583
or maybe like one of those scenes
from those Hollywood movies
