00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:33.119
and I got resettled
in Australia in May 2013.

00:09:33.119 --> 00:09:37.298
Not every asylum seeker is lucky like me.

00:09:37.298 --> 00:09:44.588
It is really difficult to live a life
with an uncertain fate, in limbo.

00:09:44.588 --> 00:09:48.419
The issue of asylum seekers in Australia

00:09:48.419 --> 00:09:51.137
has been so extremely politicized

00:09:51.137 --> 00:09:54.271
that it has lost its human face.

00:09:54.271 --> 00:10:00.372
The asylum seekers have been demonized
and then presented to the people.
