They did not allow me to take
any other boat to risk my life.

00:09:00.448 --> 00:09:04.953
I also decided to stay in Indonesia
and process my case through UNHCR,

00:09:04.953 --> 00:09:08.807
but I was really afraid
that I would end up in Indonesia

00:09:08.807 --> 00:09:12.461
for many years doing nothing
and unable to work,

00:09:12.461 --> 00:09:15.706
like every other asylum seeker.

00:09:15.706 --> 00:09:18.930
But it had happened to be
a little bit different with me.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.923
I was lucky.

00:09:23.923 --> 00:09:28.381
My contacts worked to expedite
my case through UNHCR,

00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:33.119
and I got resettled
in Australia in May 2013.
