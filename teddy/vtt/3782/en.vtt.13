00:06:26.618 --> 00:06:32.655
and the water poured in faster
than the motor pumps could take it out.

00:06:32.655 --> 00:06:35.511
We all lost hope.

00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:37.950
We thought, this is the end.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.876
We were watching our deaths,

00:06:39.876 --> 00:06:42.268
and I was documenting it.

00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:44.219
The captain told us

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:46.586
that we are not going to make it,

00:06:46.586 --> 00:06:49.767
we have to turn back the boat.

00:06:49.767 --> 00:06:51.834
We went on the deck

00:06:51.834 --> 00:06:54.366
and turned our torches on and off

00:06:54.366 --> 00:06:59.265
to attract the attention
of any passing boat.

00:06:59.265 --> 00:07:06.649
We kept trying to attract their attention
by waving our life jackets and whistling.
