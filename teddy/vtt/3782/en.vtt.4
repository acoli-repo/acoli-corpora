00:01:59.058 --> 00:02:01.380
I started receiving death threats,

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.118
and I was forced to leave Afghanistan,

00:02:05.118 --> 00:02:07.510
as my parents were.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.202
Along with my family,
I returned back to Quetta.

00:02:11.202 --> 00:02:15.614
The situation in Quetta had changed
dramatically since I left in 2005.

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:18.167
Once a peaceful haven for the Hazaras,

00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:23.601
it had now turned into the most
dangerous city in Pakistan.

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:27.176
Hazaras are confined into two small areas,

00:02:27.176 --> 00:02:32.029
and they are marginalized socially,
educationally, and financially.
