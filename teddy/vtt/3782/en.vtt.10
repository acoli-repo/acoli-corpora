00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:00.898
It made me think,

00:05:00.898 --> 00:05:03.568
am I doing the right thing?

00:05:03.568 --> 00:05:07.515
I concluded I really had
no other choice but to go on.

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:11.370
A few weeks later, we got the call
from the people smuggler

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.060
to alert us that the boat is ready for us
to commence our sea journey.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.940
Taken in the night towards the main vessel

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.588
on a motorboat,

00:05:20.588 --> 00:05:25.603
we boarded an old fishing boat
that was already overloaded.

00:05:25.603 --> 00:05:27.693
There were 93 of us,

00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:29.666
and we were all below deck.

00:05:29.666 --> 00:05:31.919
No one was allowed up on the top.
