00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:02.076
The attacks on the Hazara community
would only get worse,

00:03:02.076 --> 00:03:04.908
so it was not surprising
that many wanted to flee.

00:03:04.908 --> 00:03:09.668
After Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan,

00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:16.332
Australia is home to the fourth largest
population of Hazaras in the world.

00:03:16.332 --> 00:03:19.141
When it came time to leave Pakistan,

00:03:19.141 --> 00:03:21.091
Australia seemed the obvious choice.

00:03:21.091 --> 00:03:23.088
Financially, only one of us could leave,

00:03:23.088 --> 00:03:24.946
and it was decided that I would go,

00:03:24.946 --> 00:03:28.299
in the hope that if I arrived
at my destination safely,

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.291
I could work to get the rest
of my family to join me later.
