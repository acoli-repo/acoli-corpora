00:06:59.265 --> 00:07:06.649
We kept trying to attract their attention
by waving our life jackets and whistling.

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:10.084
Eventually, we made it to a small island.

00:07:10.084 --> 00:07:13.335
Our boat crashing onto the rocks,

00:07:13.335 --> 00:07:15.378
I slipped into the water

00:07:15.378 --> 00:07:19.025
and destroyed my camera,
whatever I had documented.

00:07:19.025 --> 00:07:24.791
But luckily, the memory card survived.

00:07:24.791 --> 00:07:27.206
It was a thick forest.

00:07:27.206 --> 00:07:32.965
We all split up into many groups
as we argued over what to do next.
