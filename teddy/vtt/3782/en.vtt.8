00:03:58.576 --> 00:04:00.689
My journey was much longer,

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:02.943
much more complicated,

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:05.989
and certainly more dangerous,

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.631
traveling to Thailand by air,

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:13.429
and then by road and boat
to Malaysia and into Indonesia,

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:15.844
paying people and smugglers all the way

00:04:15.844 --> 00:04:18.584
and spending a lot of time hiding

00:04:18.584 --> 00:04:22.300
and a lot of time in fear of being caught.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.687
In Indonesia, I joined a group
of seven asylum seekers.

00:04:26.687 --> 00:04:29.241
We all shared a bedroom

00:04:29.241 --> 00:04:33.119
in a town outside of Jakarta called Bogor.
