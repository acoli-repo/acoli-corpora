00:00:59.223 --> 00:01:03.030
I was only 18, and I got a job
working as an interpreter.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.213
After four years,

00:01:05.213 --> 00:01:09.903
I felt it was safe enough
to move to Afghanistan permanently,

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:14.523
and I was working there
as a documentary photographer,

00:01:14.523 --> 00:01:18.769
and I worked on many stories.

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:21.373
One of the most important
stories that I did

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:26.087
was the dancing boys of Afghanistan.

00:01:26.087 --> 00:01:30.591
It is a tragic story about
an appalling tradition.
