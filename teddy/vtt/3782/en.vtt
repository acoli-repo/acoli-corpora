00:00:00.462 --> 00:00:02.552
I am a Hazara,

00:00:02.552 --> 00:00:07.381
and the homeland
of my people is Afghanistan.

00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:10.400
Like hundreds of thousands
of other Hazara kids,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.164
I was born in exile.

00:00:13.164 --> 00:00:17.366
The ongoing persecution
and operation against the Hazaras

00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:21.963
forced my parents to leave Afghanistan.

00:00:21.963 --> 00:00:26.374
This persecution has had a long history
going back to the late 1800s,

00:00:26.374 --> 00:00:29.301
and the rule of King Abdur Rahman.

00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:34.897
He killed 63 percent of 
the Hazara population.
