00:07:58.871 --> 00:08:00.603
the Wus and the Howards.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.760
Standing in their bedroom,

00:08:02.784 --> 00:08:06.768
pretty hard to tell which one is China
and which one is the US, right?

00:08:06.792 --> 00:08:09.083
Both have brown leather sofas,

00:08:09.107 --> 00:08:11.187
and they have similar play structures.

00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:12.967
Most likely both are made in China,

00:08:12.991 --> 00:08:14.824
so, I mean, that's not very strange --

00:08:14.848 --> 00:08:15.959
(Laughter)

00:08:15.983 --> 00:08:17.296
but that is similar.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.079
We can of course go down
to the other end of the street,

00:08:20.103 --> 00:08:21.712
adding Nigeria.

00:08:21.736 --> 00:08:25.665
So let's compare two homes
in China and Nigeria.

00:08:25.689 --> 00:08:27.505
Looking at the family photos,

00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:30.664
they do not look like they have
a lot in common, do they?
