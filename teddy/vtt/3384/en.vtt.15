I think it's obvious
that it's a stupid thing

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:34.811
that usually, when we think
about other countries,

00:07:34.835 --> 00:07:37.363
we think they have
a certain way of doing things.

00:07:37.387 --> 00:07:38.779
But look at these stoves.

00:07:38.803 --> 00:07:40.279
Very different, right,

00:07:40.303 --> 00:07:42.624
because it depends
on what income level you have,

00:07:42.648 --> 00:07:44.509
how you're going to cook your food.

00:07:44.533 --> 00:07:48.567
But the cool thing is when we start
comparing across countries.

00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:51.314
So here we have China and the US.

00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:54.543
See the big overlap between these two.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.847
So we picked the two homes
we have already seen in these countries,

00:07:58.871 --> 00:08:00.603
the Wus and the Howards.
