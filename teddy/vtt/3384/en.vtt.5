00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:31.578
Here, for instance, we have
a family in Zimbabwe,

00:02:31.602 --> 00:02:35.168
one in India, one in Russia,
and one in Mexico, for instance.

00:02:35.192 --> 00:02:37.795
So we can go around and look
at the families this way.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.131
But of course, we can choose
if we want to see some certain countries

00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:42.317
and compare them,

00:02:42.341 --> 00:02:44.623
or regions, or if we want,
to see other things.

00:02:44.647 --> 00:02:46.786
So let's go to the front doors

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.295
and see what they look like.

00:02:48.778 --> 00:02:53.469
Go here, and this is the world
by front doors, ordered by income.

00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:56.412
And we can see the big difference

00:02:56.436 --> 00:03:00.692
from India, Philippines, China,
Ukraine, in these examples, for instance.
