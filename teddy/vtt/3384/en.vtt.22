00:10:59.531 --> 00:11:01.834
we can use photos as data,

00:11:01.858 --> 00:11:03.541
and country stereotypes --

00:11:03.565 --> 00:11:05.669
they simply fall apart.

00:11:06.294 --> 00:11:09.935
So the person staring back at us
from the other side of the world

00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:12.227
actually looks quite a lot like you.

00:11:12.804 --> 00:11:16.522
And that implies both a call to action

00:11:16.546 --> 00:11:18.031
and a reason for hope.

00:11:18.693 --> 00:11:19.860
Thank you.

00:11:19.884 --> 00:11:26.662
