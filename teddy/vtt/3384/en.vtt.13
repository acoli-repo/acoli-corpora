00:06:28.148 --> 00:06:31.005
Here, we have the income
distribution within the US,

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:32.723
most people in the middle.

00:06:32.747 --> 00:06:36.706
We have a family we visited
in the richer end, the Howards.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.477
We can see their home here.

00:06:38.501 --> 00:06:42.000
And we also visited a family
in the poorer end, down here.

00:06:42.024 --> 00:06:45.590
And then what we can do now
is we can do instant comparisons

00:06:45.614 --> 00:06:47.238
of things in their homes.

00:06:47.262 --> 00:06:49.766
Let's look in their cutlery drawer.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.868
So, observe the Hadleys:

00:06:51.892 --> 00:06:55.458
they have all their cutlery
in a green plastic box.

00:06:55.482 --> 00:06:59.411
and they have a few different types
and some of them are plastic,

00:06:59.435 --> 00:07:02.612
while the Howards,
they have this wooden drawer
