00:10:27.366 --> 00:10:31.739
if we would sit in US, Palestine
or Tanzania from this one.

00:10:31.763 --> 00:10:33.542
Vietnam, Kenya:

00:10:33.566 --> 00:10:38.554
wardrobes, lamps,
black dogs, floors, soap,

00:10:38.578 --> 00:10:41.136
laundry, clocks, computers,

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.316
phones, and so on, right?

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.583
So we have a lot of similarities
all over the world,

00:10:46.607 --> 00:10:48.981
and the images we see in the media,

00:10:49.005 --> 00:10:52.978
they show us the world

00:10:53.002 --> 00:10:55.289
But when we look
at the Dollar Street images,

00:10:55.313 --> 00:10:56.702
they do not look like that.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.507
So using Dollar Street,

00:10:59.531 --> 00:11:01.834
we can use photos as data,
