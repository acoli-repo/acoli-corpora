00:08:57.482 --> 00:09:00.087
while, looking at this,
it's quite obvious --

00:09:00.111 --> 00:09:02.365
this is how you do things
on this income level.

00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:06.750
That is what you can see when you go
through the imagery in Dollar Street.

00:09:06.774 --> 00:09:08.958
So going back to the figures,

00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:11.178
the seven billion people of the world,

00:09:11.202 --> 00:09:13.146
now we're going to do a quick recap.

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:17.082
We're going to look at comparisons
of things in the poorest group:

00:09:17.106 --> 00:09:18.425
beds,

00:09:18.449 --> 00:09:19.736
roofs,

00:09:20.569 --> 00:09:21.782
cooking.

00:09:21.806 --> 00:09:24.019
And observe, in all these comparisons,

00:09:24.043 --> 00:09:25.793
their homes are chosen

00:09:25.817 --> 00:09:28.517
so they are in completely
different places of the world.

00:09:28.541 --> 00:09:30.704
But what we see is pretty identical.
