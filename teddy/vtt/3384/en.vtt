WEBVTT

00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:04.222
What images do we see
from the rest of the world?

00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:07.114
We see natural disasters,

00:00:07.138 --> 00:00:09.012
war, terror.

00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:10.370
We see refugees,

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:12.301
and we see horrible diseases.

00:00:12.325 --> 00:00:13.476
Right?

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.143
We see beautiful beaches,

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:16.450
cute animals,

00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:17.816
beautiful nature,

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.794
cultural rites and stuff.

00:00:20.557 --> 00:00:23.880
And then we're supposed to make
the connection in our head

00:00:23.904 --> 00:00:25.657
and create a worldview out of this.

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:27.458
And how is that possible?

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:30.493
I mean, the world seems so strange.
