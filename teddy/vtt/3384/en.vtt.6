00:02:56.436 --> 00:03:00.692
from India, Philippines, China,
Ukraine, in these examples, for instance.

00:03:01.323 --> 00:03:03.208
What if we go into the home?

00:03:03.811 --> 00:03:05.208
We can look at beds.

00:03:07.073 --> 00:03:08.863
This is what beds can look like.

00:03:09.318 --> 00:03:11.428
Doesn't look like the glossy magazines.

00:03:11.452 --> 00:03:14.242
Doesn't look like
the scary images in the media.

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:16.889
So remember that the students in Sweden,

00:03:16.913 --> 00:03:19.623
they thought they were in the middle
of the world income.

00:03:19.647 --> 00:03:21.026
So let's go there.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.329
We zoom in here by filtering
the street to the middle,

00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:28.028
like this,

00:03:28.052 --> 00:03:29.767
and then I ask the students:

00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:31.964
Is this what your bedroom looks like?
