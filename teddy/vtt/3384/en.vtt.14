00:06:59.435 --> 00:07:02.612
while the Howards,
they have this wooden drawer

00:07:02.636 --> 00:07:04.812
with small wooden compartments in it

00:07:04.836 --> 00:07:07.565
and a section for each type of cutlery.

00:07:08.392 --> 00:07:10.265
We can add more families,

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:12.829
and we can see kitchen sinks,

00:07:12.853 --> 00:07:14.855
or maybe living rooms.

00:07:15.416 --> 00:07:17.821
Of course, we can do
the same in other countries.

00:07:17.845 --> 00:07:20.819
So we go to China, we pick three families.

00:07:21.434 --> 00:07:23.121
we look at their houses,

00:07:23.145 --> 00:07:24.981
we can look at their sofas,

00:07:25.005 --> 00:07:26.875
we can look at their stoves.

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:28.759
And when you see these stoves,

00:07:28.783 --> 00:07:31.595
I think it's obvious
that it's a stupid thing
