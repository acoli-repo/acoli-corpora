00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:30.493
I mean, the world seems so strange.

00:00:30.517 --> 00:00:32.113
And I don't think it is.

00:00:32.137 --> 00:00:34.817
I don't think the world
is that strange, actually.

00:00:35.236 --> 00:00:36.724
I've got an idea.

00:00:36.748 --> 00:00:39.391
So, imagine the world as a street,

00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:43.952
where the poorest live on one end
and the richest on the other,

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:46.717
and everyone in the world
lives on this street.

00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:49.017
You live there, I live there,

00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:52.806
and the neighbors we have
are the ones with the same income.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.754
People that live in the same block as me,

00:00:55.778 --> 00:01:00.816
they are from other countries,
other cultures, other religions.
