But the students, when you ask them,

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:31.853
they think they are in the middle.

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:34.829
And how can you understand the world

00:01:34.853 --> 00:01:38.256
when you see all these scary
images from the world,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.637
and you think you live in the middle,
while you're actually atop?

00:01:42.183 --> 00:01:43.406
Not very easy.

00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:45.900
So I sent out photographers

00:01:45.924 --> 00:01:51.080
to 264 homes in 50 countries --
so far, still counting --

00:01:51.104 --> 00:01:55.531
and in each home, the photographers
take the same set of photos.

00:01:55.555 --> 00:01:57.191
They take the bed,

00:01:57.215 --> 00:01:58.412
the stove,

00:01:58.436 --> 00:01:59.679
the toys

00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:02.055
and about 135 other things.
