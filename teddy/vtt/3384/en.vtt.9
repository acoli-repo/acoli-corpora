00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:30.212
So here (Laughter)
we have a lot of toilets.

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:32.583
They look pretty much
as we're used to, right?

00:04:32.607 --> 00:04:36.023
And they are in China, Netherlands,
United States, Nepal and so forth,

00:04:36.047 --> 00:04:37.538
Ukraine, France.

00:04:37.935 --> 00:04:39.740
And they look pretty similar, right?

00:04:39.764 --> 00:04:42.386
But remember, we are in the top.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.711
So what about checking all the toilets?

00:04:47.457 --> 00:04:49.939
Now it looks a bit different, doesn't it?

00:04:49.963 --> 00:04:55.854
So this way we can visually browse
through categories of imagery,

00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:57.523
using photos as data.

00:04:57.908 --> 00:05:01.137
But not everything works as a photo.
