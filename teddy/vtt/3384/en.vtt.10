But not everything works as a photo.

00:05:01.161 --> 00:05:04.397
Sometimes it's easier
to understand what people do,

00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:08.092
so we also do video snippets
of everyday activities,

00:05:08.116 --> 00:05:10.558
such as washing hands, doing laundry,

00:05:10.582 --> 00:05:12.224
brushing teeth, and so on.

00:05:12.248 --> 00:05:15.092
And I'm going to show you
a short snippet of tooth-brushing,

00:05:15.116 --> 00:05:17.024
and we’re going to start at the top.

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:22.409
So we see people brushing their teeth.

00:05:22.996 --> 00:05:25.215
Pretty interesting to see

00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:29.843
the same type of plastic toothbrush
is being used in all these places

00:05:29.867 --> 00:05:31.442
in the same way, right?
