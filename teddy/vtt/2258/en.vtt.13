The letter said,

00:06:31.292 --> 00:06:34.684
"Please do not compare an animal
as wonderful as a pig with politicians.

00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:35.726
(Laughter)

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.351
Pigs are very friendly and noble,

00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:38.851
they can be a great mascot,

00:06:38.875 --> 00:06:40.184
they make good pets

00:06:40.208 --> 00:06:44.018
and they provide sustenance to us
in the form of pork."

00:06:44.042 --> 00:06:45.792

00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.684
I think they were absolutely right.

00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:53.101
I didn't draw any more pigs,

00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:55.184
but I did keep drawing politicians.

00:06:55.208 --> 00:06:56.226
(Laughter)
