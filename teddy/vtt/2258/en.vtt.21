A good cartoon has a lot of power.

00:10:41.125 --> 00:10:43.643
It can generate action and reaction.

00:10:43.667 --> 00:10:47.268
That's why a cartoonist must
exercise their power responsibly,

00:10:47.292 --> 00:10:48.768
showcasing the truth

00:10:48.792 --> 00:10:51.643
and drawing without
the fear of consequences.

00:10:51.667 --> 00:10:56.059
(Speaks Spanish)

00:10:56.083 --> 00:10:57.726
Having an opinion has a cost,

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.768
and in some countries, that cost is high.
