But a cartoon is born
from a space of deep, nuanced thinking.

Creating a good cartoon
involves repeated failures,

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.643
draft after draft.

00:08:17.667 --> 00:08:20.018
And a cartoonist must shed
their own taboos

00:08:20.042 --> 00:08:23.226
to spark a conversation,
rather than a confrontation,

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.893
through their work.
