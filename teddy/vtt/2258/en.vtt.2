Many years have passed since my childhood,

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:11.018
but throughout my formal studies,

00:01:11.042 --> 00:01:13.559
I found myself drawing
in the margins of my notebooks

00:01:13.583 --> 00:01:16.226
instead of paying attention
to my professors.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.018
I studied journalism in college

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:21.643
with the intention of expanding
my communication and writing skills,

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:24.268
but the only thing
that I felt connected to in life

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:25.684
was drawing.
