00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.768
and in some countries, that cost is high.

00:11:00.792 --> 00:11:03.583
(Speaks Spanish)

00:11:17.708 --> 00:11:18.976
In Venezuela,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.976
many young people have been killed
for protesting peacefully.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.351
There are men and women
who are stuck behind bars

00:11:24.375 --> 00:11:26.101
as political prisoners.

00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:27.393
So over the years,

00:11:27.417 --> 00:11:29.371
I've drawn the faces of imprisoned women,

00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:33.059
because I don't want them
to be forgotten by the community.
