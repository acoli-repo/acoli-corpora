I spent many hours drafting
and throwing out papers.

00:10:06.458 --> 00:10:07.893
My editor called me and said

00:10:07.917 --> 00:10:10.143
everything was late
for that day's newspaper

00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:11.934
and asked me when I'd be done.

00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.768
It was in the middle of the night
that the idea came to me.

00:10:14.792 --> 00:10:16.476
And we then published a cartoon

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.643
that represented
a historical moment in time.
