A cartoon travels
on an information highway,

00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:19.393
which seems like it has multiple lanes,

00:07:19.417 --> 00:07:21.393
but in reality, all of these lanes

00:07:21.417 --> 00:07:25.393
lead to a binary response
of either positivity or rage.

00:07:25.417 --> 00:07:27.976
"I like it" or "I don't like it."

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.351
Those are the only responses

00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:32.476
that govern democratic thinking
on the internet.
