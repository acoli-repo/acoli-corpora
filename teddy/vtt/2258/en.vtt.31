A drawing can be a synthesis of a place,

00:15:33.875 --> 00:15:37.018
a universe, a country or a society.

00:15:37.042 --> 00:15:40.226
It can also represent
the inner workings of someone's mind.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:44.309
For me, drawing cartoons
is a form of resistance.

00:15:44.333 --> 00:15:46.833

00:15:57.625 --> 00:16:00.059
A cartoon is like a Rosetta stone.
