and try to eradicate everything
that involves humor

00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:06.833
as a mirror for social
and political issues.

00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:18.351
A cartoon involves a delicate balance
of ideas and drawings

00:04:18.375 --> 00:04:20.434
that reveal a hidden truth.

00:04:20.458 --> 00:04:25.184

00:04:25.208 --> 00:04:28.934
And a good cartoon is one that conveys
a plot of a full-length movie

00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:30.476
in a single frame.
