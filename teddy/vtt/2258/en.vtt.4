I really enjoyed translating political
and cultural current events into drawings.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.500
(Speaks Spanish)

00:02:13.292 --> 00:02:14.643
In the year 2014,

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:18.268
I got fired from my job at the newspaper
over a cartoon that I drew

00:02:18.292 --> 00:02:21.059
alluding to the health care
system in Venezuela.

00:02:21.083 --> 00:02:23.518
I drew a flat line of a heartbeat monitor,

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:25.809
but I intentionally drew
the heartbeat line

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:28.559
in a way that resembled
the signature of Hugo Chavez,

00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:30.518
the former president of Venezuela.
