00:11:59.042 --> 00:12:01.018
where a group of lawyers do pro bono work

00:12:01.042 --> 00:12:03.018
for Venezuelan political prisoners,

00:12:03.042 --> 00:12:05.601
a young woman approached me and she said,

00:12:05.625 --> 00:12:06.976
"I was imprisoned,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.726
and then you drew my face and my story.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.893
It's because of that drawing
that people knew who I was.

00:12:12.917 --> 00:12:15.809
Your cartoon helped me survive
my days in prison.

00:12:15.833 --> 00:12:17.101
Thank you."

00:12:17.125 --> 00:12:20.208
(Speaks Spanish)

00:12:24.125 --> 00:12:26.101
This was a moment that meant a lot to me,

00:12:26.125 --> 00:12:28.059
because I had found a way to collaborate

00:12:28.083 --> 00:12:30.476
with the memories
of my country and its people.
