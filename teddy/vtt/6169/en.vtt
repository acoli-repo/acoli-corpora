00:00:01.013 --> 00:00:03.551
I want to talk about my investigations

00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:08.119
into what technology means in our lives --

00:00:08.143 --> 00:00:11.351
not just our immediate life,
but in the cosmic sense,

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:14.517
in the kind of long history of the world

00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:17.120
and our place in the world.

00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:19.018
What is this stuff?

00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:20.502
What is the significance?

00:00:20.526 --> 00:00:24.434
And so, I want to kind of
go through my little story

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:25.704
of what I found out.

00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:28.015
One of the first things
I started to investigate

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.850
was the history of the name of technology.
