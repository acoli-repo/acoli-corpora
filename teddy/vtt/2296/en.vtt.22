00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
to our eyes, even today.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So what were these ancient --

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I mean, they're ancient, they're foreign,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
but they're at the same time

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
somehow familiar.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
What were these artifacts for?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
The best available answer

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
is that they were literally

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
the earliest known works of art,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
practical tools transformed

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
into captivating aesthetic objects,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
contemplated both for their elegant shape

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and their virtuoso craftsmanship.
