Fred Astaire dancing across the screen.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This brief list includes human beings,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
natural landforms,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
works of art and skilled human actions.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
An account that explains the presence of beauty

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
in everything on this list

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
is not going to be easy.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I can, however, give you at least a taste

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
of what I regard

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
as the most powerful theory of beauty

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
we yet have.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And we get it not from a philosopher of art,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
not from a postmodern art theorist

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
or a bigwig art critic.
