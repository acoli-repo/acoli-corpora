00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Hand axes mark

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
an evolutionary advance in human history --

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
tools fashioned to function

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
as what Darwinians call "fitness signals" --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
that is to say, displays

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
that are performances

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
like the peacock's tail,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
except that, unlike hair and feathers,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
the hand axes are consciously

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
cleverly crafted.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Competently made hand axes

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
indicated desirable personal qualities --

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
intelligence, fine motor control,
