00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
but often in what are to our eyes

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
an arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
or teardrop form.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
These Acheulian hand axes --

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
they're named after St. Acheul in France,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
where finds were made in 19th century --

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
have been unearthed in their thousands,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
scattered across Asia, Europe and Africa,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
almost everywhere Homo erectus

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and Homo ergaster roamed.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Now, the sheer numbers of these hand axes

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
shows that they can't have been made

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
for butchering animals.
