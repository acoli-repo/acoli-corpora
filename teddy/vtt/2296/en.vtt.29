00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and found beauty in the skill needed to make it,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
even before

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
No, it's deep in our minds.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
It's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and rich emotional lives

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
of our most ancient ancestors.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
to the beauty of music, to the night sky,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
will be with us and our descendants

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
for as long as the human race exists.
