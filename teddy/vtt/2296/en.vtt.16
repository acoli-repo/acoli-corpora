00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that extends into the distance,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
almost inviting you to follow it.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
This landscape type is regarded as beautiful,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
even by people in countries

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
that don't have it.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
The ideal savanna landscape

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
is one of the clearest examples

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
where human beings everywhere

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
find beauty

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
in similar visual experience.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
But, someone might argue,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that's natural beauty.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
How about artistic beauty?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Isn't that exhaustively cultural?
