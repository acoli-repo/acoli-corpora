00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
human beings

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
have a permanent innate taste

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
for virtuoso displays in the arts.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
We find beauty

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
in something done well.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
displaying a beautifully cut

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
teardrop-shaped stone,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
don't be so sure

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
it's just your culture telling you

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
that that sparkling jewel is beautiful.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Your distant ancestors loved that shape

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and found beauty in the skill needed to make it,
