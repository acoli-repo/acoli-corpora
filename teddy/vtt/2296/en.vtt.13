00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So evolution's trick

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
is to make them beautiful,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
to have them exert a kind of magnetism

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
the magnetic pull

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
of beautiful landscapes.

People in very different cultures

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
all over the world

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
a landscape that just happens to be similar

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
This landscape shows up today
