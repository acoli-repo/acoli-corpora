Except, of course, what's interesting about this

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
because the Homo erectus

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
that made these objects

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
did not have language.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
It's hard to grasp,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
but it's an incredible fact.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
This object was made

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
by a hominid ancestor,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Homo erectus or Homo ergaster,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
between 50,000 and 100,000 years

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
before language.
