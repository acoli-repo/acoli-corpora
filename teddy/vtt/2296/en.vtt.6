00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
this universality?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
a Darwinian evolutionary history

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
of our artistic and aesthetic tastes.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
We need to reverse-engineer

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
our present artistic tastes and preferences

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and explain how they came

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
to be engraved in our minds

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
by the actions of both our prehistoric,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
largely pleistocene environments,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
where we became fully human,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
but also by the social situations

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
in which we evolved.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
This reverse engineering
