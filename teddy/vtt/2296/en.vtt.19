the so-called Acheulian hand axes.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
The oldest stone tools are choppers

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
They go back about two-and-a-half-million years.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
These crude tools

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
were around for thousands of centuries,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
until around 1.4 million years ago

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
when Homo erectus

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
started shaping

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
single, thin stone blades,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
sometimes rounded ovals,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
but often in what are to our eyes

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
an arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf
