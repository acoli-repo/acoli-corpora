00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
The first of these is natural selection --

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that's random mutation and selective retention --

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
along with our basic anatomy and physiology --

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Natural selection also explains

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
many basic revulsions,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
such as the horrid smell of rotting meat,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
or fears, such as the fear of snakes

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
or standing close to the edge of a cliff.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Natural selection also explains pleasures --

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
sexual pleasure,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
our liking for sweet, fat and proteins,
