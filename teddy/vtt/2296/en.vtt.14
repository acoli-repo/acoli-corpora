00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
This landscape shows up today

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
on calendars, on postcards,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
in the design of golf courses and public parks

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and in gold-framed pictures

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
that hang in living rooms

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
from New York to New Zealand.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
featuring open spaces

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
of low grasses

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
interspersed with copses of trees.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
The trees, by the way, are often preferred

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
if they fork near the ground,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that is to say, if they're trees you could scramble up
