00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Isn't that exhaustively cultural?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
No, I don't think it is.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And once again, I'd like to look back to prehistory

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
to say something about it.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
It is widely assumed

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
that the earliest human artworks

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
are the stupendously skillful cave paintings

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
that we all know from Lascaux

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and Chauvet.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Chauvet caves

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
are about 32,000 years old,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
along with a few small, realistic sculptures

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
of women and animals from the same period.
