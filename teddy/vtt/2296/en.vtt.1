00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in part because the things that we call beautiful

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
are so different.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I mean just think of the sheer variety --

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
a baby's face,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Berlioz's "Harold in Italy,"

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
movies like "The Wizard of Oz"

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
or the plays of Chekhov,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
a central California landscape,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
a Hokusai view of Mt. Fuji,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
"Der Rosenkavalier,"

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
a stunning match-winning goal

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
in a World Cup soccer match,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Van Gogh's "Starry Night,"

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
a Jane Austen novel,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Fred Astaire dancing across the screen.
