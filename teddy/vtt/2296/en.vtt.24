00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
intelligence, fine motor control,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
planning ability,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
conscientiousness

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and sometimes access to rare materials.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Over tens of thousands of generations,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
such skills increased the status

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
of those who displayed them

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and gained a reproductive advantage

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
over the less capable.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
You know, it's an old line,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
but it has been shown to work --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
"Why don't you come up to my cave, so I can show you my hand axes?"

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
(Laughter)

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Except, of course, what's interesting about this
