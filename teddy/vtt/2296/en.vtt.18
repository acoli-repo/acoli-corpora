00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
of women and animals from the same period.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
But artistic and decorative skills

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
are actually much older than that.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Beautiful shell necklaces

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
as well as ochre body paint,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
have been found

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
from around 100,000 years ago.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
are older even than this.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I have in mind

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
the so-called Acheulian hand axes.
