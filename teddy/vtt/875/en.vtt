00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
no one -- not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson --

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
by what we put into it or by what we took out of it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I want to share with you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost --
