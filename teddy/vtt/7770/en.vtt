00:00:01.414 --> 00:00:03.249
Five years ago,

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:05.168
I was on this stage

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:09.088
to talk about the relationships
between humans and machines.

00:00:10.048 --> 00:00:14.719
Today, I'm here to talk only
about the relationships between humans.

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:17.638
I regularly say

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.059
in my lectures on artificial intelligence

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.604
that humans will always have
a monopoly on evil.

00:00:25.646 --> 00:00:27.231
It's not a threat,

00:00:27.273 --> 00:00:30.651
just a reminder that people choose.
