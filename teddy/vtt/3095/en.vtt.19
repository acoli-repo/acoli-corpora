00:09:29.717 --> 00:09:32.043
to understand their racial traumas

00:09:32.067 --> 00:09:36.195
before we bring them together
to problem-solve daily microaggressions.

00:09:37.394 --> 00:09:41.052
Now, racially literate conversations
with our children can be healing,

00:09:41.076 --> 00:09:42.962
but it takes practice.

00:09:42.986 --> 00:09:45.188
And I know some of you
are saying, "Practice?

00:09:45.212 --> 00:09:46.378
Practice?

00:09:46.402 --> 00:09:47.927
We're talking about practice?"

00:09:48.365 --> 00:09:50.117
Yes, we are talking about practice.

00:09:51.126 --> 00:09:52.511
I have two sons.

00:09:53.703 --> 00:09:55.374
My oldest, Bryan, is 26,

00:09:55.398 --> 00:09:57.517
and my youngest, Julian, is 12.

00:09:58.069 --> 00:10:00.818
And we do not have time
to talk about how that happened.
