00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.536
(Laughter)

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.140
She was raised from neighborhoods

00:01:32.164 --> 00:01:34.600
in which there was racial
violence and segregation,

00:01:34.624 --> 00:01:36.704
where she was chased out of neighborhoods,

00:01:36.728 --> 00:01:39.275
and she exacted violence
to chase others out of hers.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.288
When she came to Southern Delaware,

00:01:41.312 --> 00:01:43.539
she thought she had come
to a foreign country.

00:01:44.023 --> 00:01:45.468
She didn't understand anybody,

00:01:46.087 --> 00:01:48.952
particularly the few black and brown folks

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:52.234
who were physically deferential
and verbally deferential

00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:53.636
in the presence of whites.

00:01:54.238 --> 00:01:55.392
Not my mother.

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:57.647
When she wanted to go
somewhere, she walked.

00:01:57.671 --> 00:01:59.396
She didn't care what you thought.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.611
And she pissed a lot of people off
with her cultural style.
