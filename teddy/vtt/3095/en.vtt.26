which his mother confirmed.

00:13:00.908 --> 00:13:03.757
And I felt happy
that he was able to talk about it;

00:13:03.781 --> 00:13:05.388
it felt like he was getting it.

00:13:05.412 --> 00:13:07.753
We moved from the sadness
of Trayvon's parents

00:13:07.777 --> 00:13:10.527
and started talking about
George Zimmerman's parents,

00:13:10.551 --> 00:13:12.551
which, I read in a magazine,

00:13:12.575 --> 00:13:14.823
condoned the stalking of Trayvon.

00:13:14.847 --> 00:13:17.546

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:20.055
It made me feel like he was getting it.

00:13:20.079 --> 00:13:22.227
(Voice-over) JS: What did
they say about him?

00:13:22.251 --> 00:13:25.485
HS: Well, I think they basically
felt that he was justified

00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:27.887
to follow and stalk --

00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:29.082
JS: What the -- ?

00:13:29.106 --> 00:13:31.025
HS: Yeah, I think that's wrong.
