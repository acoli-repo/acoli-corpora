If anybody bothered us
because of the color of our skin,

00:01:04.427 --> 00:01:06.625
he believed that you should pray for them,

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.457
knowing that God
would get them back in the end.

00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:10.654
(Laughter)

00:01:11.256 --> 00:01:14.531
You could say that his racial-coping
approach was spiritual --

00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:16.510
for later on, one day,

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:17.830
like Martin Luther King.

00:01:18.658 --> 00:01:21.097
My mother's coping approach
was a little different.

00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:23.896
She was, uh, you could say,
more relational --

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.140
right now, like, in your face,

00:01:26.164 --> 00:01:27.314
right now.

00:01:27.826 --> 00:01:29.196
More like Malcolm X.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.536
(Laughter)
