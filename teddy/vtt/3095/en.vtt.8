Now, both my parents were Christians.

00:04:02.003 --> 00:04:05.148
The difference is my father prayed
before a racial conflict

00:04:05.172 --> 00:04:06.851
and my mother prayed after.

00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:08.298
(Laughter)

00:04:08.813 --> 00:04:11.818
There is a time, if you use
both of their strategies,

00:04:11.842 --> 00:04:14.516
if you use them in the right time
and the right way.

00:04:15.073 --> 00:04:16.948
But it's never a time --

00:04:16.972 --> 00:04:19.040
there's a time for conciliation,

00:04:19.064 --> 00:04:21.161
there's a time for confrontation,

00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:25.172
but it's never a time to freeze up
like a deer in the headlights,

00:04:25.695 --> 00:04:30.281
and it's never a time to lash out
in heedless, thoughtless anger.
