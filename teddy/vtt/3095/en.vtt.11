00:05:25.764 --> 00:05:30.541
we know that some of the scariest
moments are racial encounters,

00:05:31.302 --> 00:05:34.281
some of the scariest moments
that people will ever face.

00:05:35.266 --> 00:05:39.787

00:05:55.842 --> 00:05:58.397
At worst, we shoot first
and ask no questions.

00:05:59.805 --> 00:06:03.234
Imagine if we could reduce
the intensity of threat
