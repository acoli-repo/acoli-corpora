00:09:58.069 --> 00:10:00.818
And we do not have time
to talk about how that happened.

00:10:00.842 --> 00:10:02.556
(Laughter)

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.743
But,

00:10:04.445 --> 00:10:05.855
when I think of them,

00:10:05.879 --> 00:10:07.214
they are still babies to me,

00:10:07.238 --> 00:10:09.913
and I worry every day
that the world will misjudge them.

00:10:11.887 --> 00:10:14.340
In August of 2013,

00:10:14.966 --> 00:10:17.925
Julian, who was eight at the time,
and I were folding laundry,

00:10:17.949 --> 00:10:20.294
which in and of itself
is such a rare occurrence,

00:10:20.318 --> 00:10:23.544
I should have known something
strange was going to happen.

00:10:23.568 --> 00:10:25.790
On the TV were Trayvon Martin's parents,

00:10:25.814 --> 00:10:27.058
and they were crying

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:30.272
because of the acquittal
of George Zimmerman.
