00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:30.046
to heal the centuries

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.898
of racial discrimination,

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:33.663
dehumanization and illness.

00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:37.116
Both of my parents were African-American.

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:39.921
My father was born in Southern Delaware,

00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:41.408
my mother, North Philadelphia,

00:00:41.432 --> 00:00:45.722
and these two places are as different
from each other as east is from west,

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:48.086
as New York City is
from Montgomery, Alabama.

00:00:49.262 --> 00:00:51.687
My father's way of dealing
with racial conflict

00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:55.454
was to have my brother Bryan,
my sister Christy and I in church

00:00:55.478 --> 00:00:58.338
what seemed like 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

00:00:58.362 --> 00:00:59.512
(Laughter)
