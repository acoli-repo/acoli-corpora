Before we'd get into the supermarket,

00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:33.031
that talk was all we needed.

00:02:33.055 --> 00:02:35.384
Now, how many of you ever got that talk?

00:02:36.194 --> 00:02:38.396
How many of you ever give that talk?

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.871
(Laughter)

00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:42.288
How many of you ever give that talk today?

00:02:43.898 --> 00:02:47.244
My mother didn't give us the talk
because she was worried about money

00:02:47.268 --> 00:02:48.436
or reputation

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.906
or us misbehaving.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.236
We never misbehaved.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.422
We were too scared.

00:02:53.017 --> 00:02:54.677
We were in church 24 hours a day,

00:02:54.701 --> 00:02:55.852
seven days a week.

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:57.215
(Laughter)

00:02:57.682 --> 00:02:59.669
She gave us that talk to remind us

00:02:59.693 --> 00:03:03.898
that some people in the world
would interpret us as misbehaving
