There's an African proverb that goes,

00:00:02.832 --> 00:00:05.486
"The lion's story will never be known

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.950
as long as the hunter
is the one to tell it."

00:00:09.273 --> 00:00:13.511
More than a racial conversation,
we need a racial literacy

00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:16.919
to decode the politics
of racial threat in America.

00:00:18.335 --> 00:00:20.757
Key to this literacy is a forgotten truth,

00:00:21.614 --> 00:00:24.864
that the more we understand

00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:28.435
that our cultural differences
represent the power

00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:30.046
to heal the centuries
