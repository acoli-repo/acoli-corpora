00:13:57.022 --> 00:14:00.004
And in my mind's eye,
I could see somebody chasing Julian,

00:14:00.028 --> 00:14:02.056
and I was chasing them.

00:14:02.528 --> 00:14:04.910
And the only thing
that could come out of my mouth

00:14:04.934 --> 00:14:08.238
was if anybody tries
to bother my child ...

00:14:09.688 --> 00:14:12.804
(Voice-over) HS: If anybody tries
to bother my child ...

00:14:12.828 --> 00:14:13.995
mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:15.415
JS: What will happen?

00:14:15.439 --> 00:14:17.403
HS: Well, they better run.

00:14:18.436 --> 00:14:20.653
JS: Because what?
HS: I'm gonna get 'em.

00:14:20.677 --> 00:14:21.828
JS: See? (Laughs)

00:14:21.852 --> 00:14:23.653
HS: I'm gonna get 'em.
JS: Really?

00:14:23.677 --> 00:14:24.835
HS: Oh, yeah.

00:14:24.859 --> 00:14:27.916
JS: Then they're gonna get you
because they might have weapons.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.088
HS: Well, you know what, I'm gonna
call police, too, like I should.
