00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:30.272
because of the acquittal
of George Zimmerman.

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:32.466
And Julian was glued to the TV.

00:10:34.281 --> 00:10:37.106
He had a thousand questions,
and I was not prepared.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.447
He wanted to know why:

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:43.749
Why would a grown man stalk
and hunt down and kill

00:10:43.773 --> 00:10:45.741
an unarmed 17-year-old boy?

00:10:46.583 --> 00:10:48.147
And I did not know what to say.

00:10:48.171 --> 00:10:50.613
The best thing that could
come out of my mouth was,

00:10:50.637 --> 00:10:53.614
"Julian, sometimes in this world,
there are people

00:10:53.638 --> 00:10:55.648
who look down on black and brown people

00:10:56.985 --> 00:10:59.184
and do not treat them --
and children, too --

00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:00.769
do not treat them as human."
