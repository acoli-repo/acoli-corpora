and it's never a time to lash out

The lesson in this is

00:04:33.175 --> 00:04:34.974
that when it comes to race relations,

00:04:34.998 --> 00:04:37.043

are prevalent in our society today.

00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:58.070
If you look at the neuroscience research

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.424
which says that when
we are racially threatened,
