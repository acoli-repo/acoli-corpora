00:07:26.578 --> 00:07:31.201
Now, we can teach parents and children
how to read, recast and resolve

00:07:31.831 --> 00:07:36.802
using a mindfulness strategy
we call: "Calculate, locate, communicate,

00:07:36.826 --> 00:07:38.086
breathe and exhale."

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.260
Stay with me.

00:07:39.663 --> 00:07:41.108
"Calculate" asks,

00:07:41.132 --> 00:07:42.867
"What feeling am I having right now,

00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:45.985
and how intense is it
on a scale of one to 10?"

00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:50.612
"Locate" asks, "Where
in my body do I feel it?"

00:07:51.209 --> 00:07:52.431
And be specific,

00:07:53.283 --> 00:07:57.442
like the Native American girl at a Chicago
fifth-grade school said to me,

00:07:58.281 --> 00:08:02.187
"I feel angry at a nine
because I'm the only Native American.
