00:08:26.648 --> 00:08:30.382
With the help of my many colleagues
at the Racial Empowerment Collaborative,

00:08:30.406 --> 00:08:32.621
we use in-the-moment stress-reduction

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:35.050
in several research and therapy projects.

00:08:35.881 --> 00:08:40.624
One project is where we use basketball
to help youth manage their emotions

00:08:40.648 --> 00:08:43.013
during 60-second eruptions on the court.

00:08:44.035 --> 00:08:49.149
Another project, with the help
of my colleagues Loretta and John Jemmott,

00:08:49.902 --> 00:08:54.087
we leverage the cultural style
of African-American barbershops,

00:08:54.111 --> 00:08:57.828
where we train black barbers
to be health educators in two areas:

00:08:58.475 --> 00:09:02.504
one, to safely reduce the sexual risk
in their partner relationships;
