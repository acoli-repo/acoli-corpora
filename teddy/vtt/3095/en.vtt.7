00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:34.166
And the worst thing they could do
was to throw our food into the bag.

00:03:34.858 --> 00:03:36.693
And when that happened, it was on.

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:37.789
(Laughter)

00:03:37.813 --> 00:03:40.012
My mother began
to tell them who they were,

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:41.574
who their family was,

00:03:41.598 --> 00:03:43.049
where to go,

00:03:43.073 --> 00:03:44.604
how fast to get there.

00:03:44.628 --> 00:03:45.936
(Laughter)

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.107
If you haven't been cursed out
by my mother, you haven't lived.

00:03:49.131 --> 00:03:50.281
(Laughter)

00:03:50.783 --> 00:03:52.449
The person would be on the floor,

00:03:52.473 --> 00:03:55.567
writhing in utter decay and decomposition,

00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:57.834
whimpering in a pool of racial shame.

00:03:57.858 --> 00:03:59.009
(Laughter)

00:03:59.033 --> 00:04:01.448
Now, both my parents were Christians.
