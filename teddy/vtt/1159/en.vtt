00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So I'm going to tell you a little bit

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about reimagining food.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I've been interested in food for a long time.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I taught myself to cook

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And it's a wonderful thing.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But there's some things that have been going on

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
