00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
coming out of the animal kingdom. And if we were to do that,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
we would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
This is Niles Eldredge. He was the co-developer with Stephen Jay Gould

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
of the theory of punctuated equilibrium.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
But as a sideline, he happens to collect cornets.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
He has one of the world's largest collections -- about 500 of them.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites, or snails,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and to do a morphological analysis,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and try to derive their genealogical history over time.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
This is his chart, which is not quite published yet.
