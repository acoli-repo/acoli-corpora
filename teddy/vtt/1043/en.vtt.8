00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and actually discover all the species on Earth.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
just to see what's on life. And if we did that

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
with our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
we would begin to see some incredible species.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
This is not on another planet. These are things

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that are hidden away on our planet.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
This is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Each one of these organisms that we've described -- that you've seen

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
from Jamie and others, these magnificent things --
