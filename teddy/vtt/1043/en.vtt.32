00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
were compressed. The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
and it was so tight in there, there was no room for any difference at all.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
That's the definition. There was no temperature.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
There was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
what it expanded was the potential for difference.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
So as it expands and as things expand what we have

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
is the potential for differences, diversity, options, choices,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
opportunities, possibilities and freedoms.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Those are all basically the same thing.
