the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Before that, obviously, technology didn't exist. But obviously it did.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
(Laughter)

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So it sums up a lot of what we're talking about.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Danny Hillis actually has an update on that --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
he says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
(Laughter)

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Which also, I think, gets into a little bit of our current idea.
