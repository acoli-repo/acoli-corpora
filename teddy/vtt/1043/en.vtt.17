and hammers become more and more specific over time.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
There's obviously diversity. Huge numbers of things.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
This is all the contents of a Japanese home.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I actually had my daughter -- gave her a tally counter,

I did some research and found out that the King of England, Henry VIII,
