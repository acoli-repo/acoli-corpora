00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
So if you have life hacking --

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
life means hacking, the game of survival --

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
That is what we call an "infinite game."

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
That's the definition of "infinite game." A finite game is play to win,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and an infinite game is played to keep playing.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
The origins of technology was not in 1829,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang,
