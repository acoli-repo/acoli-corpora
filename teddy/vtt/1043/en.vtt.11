00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
These are hacks, and if we looked at the general shape

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
of the approaches to hacking life there are, current consensus,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
six kingdoms. Six different broad approaches: the plants,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
the animals, the fungi, the protests -- the little things -- the bacteria

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and the Archaea bacteria. The Archaeas.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Those are the general approaches to life. That's one way to look at life on Earth today.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
But a more interesting way,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
the current way to take the long view,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution
