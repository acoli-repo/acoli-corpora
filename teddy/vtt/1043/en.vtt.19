00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and not non-technology, or even life.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And thirdly, the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
is at this point a cliche. And I'm happy to say,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
I was partly responsible for that cliche

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
that machines are becoming biological, but that's pretty evident.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So the major trends in technology evolution actually

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
are the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
towards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
towards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise
