So he's saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And I'm applying a similar trick to say,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
what if we looked at the universe in our culture

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
through the eyes of technology? What does technology want?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Obviously, this in an incomplete question,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
just as looking at an organism as only a gene

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
is an incomplete way of looking at it.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
But it's still very, very productive. So I'm attempting to say,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
if we take technology's view of the world, what does it want?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And I think once we ask that question

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
we have to go back, actually, to life. Because obviously,
