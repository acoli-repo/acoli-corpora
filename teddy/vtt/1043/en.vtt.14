00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
have we ever been where we don't find life.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
We find life at the bottom of every long-term,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
long-distance drilling core into the center of rock

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
that we bring up -- and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And wherever life is, it never retreats. It's ubiquitous and it wants to be more.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
More and more of the inert matter of the globe

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
is being touched and animated by life.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
The second thing is is we see diversity. We also see specialization.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
We see the movement from a general-purpose cell

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
to the more specific and specialized.
