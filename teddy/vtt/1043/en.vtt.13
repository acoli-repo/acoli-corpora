00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
They've been around just as long and gone through

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
just the same kind of trial and error to get here.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
But we see that each one of these is actually hacking,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and has a different way of finding out how to do life.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And if we take the long-term trends of life, if we begin to say,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
what does evolution want? There's several things that we see.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
have we ever been where we don't find life.
