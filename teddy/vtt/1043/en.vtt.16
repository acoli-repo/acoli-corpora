they're completely surrounded by other life.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000
They never touch the inner matter. There is more and more co-evolution.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And so the general, long-term trends of evolution

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
are roughly these five: ubiquity, diversity, specialization,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
complexity and socialization. Now, I took that and said,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
OK, what are the long-term trends in technology?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And again, my question is, what does technology want?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And so, remarkably, I discovered

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
that there's also a drift toward specialization.
