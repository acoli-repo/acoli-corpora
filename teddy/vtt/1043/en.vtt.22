This is his chart, which is not quite published yet.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
But the most interesting aspect about this

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.000
those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
that was no longer made. That does not happen in biology.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
When something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
But that does happen in technology. And it turns out

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and you can actually use it to determine
