00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
towards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
because if we map out, say, the evolution of armor,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
That its operations and how it works is so similar

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And so it would be sort of approximately up there,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
coming out of the animal kingdom. And if we were to do that,
