00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
So we've all heard about the Amish giving up cars.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
We've heard about the Japanese giving up guns.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
We've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
took what I could find, the examples in history

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
where there have been prohibitions against technology,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and then I tried to find out when they came back in,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
because they always came back in. And it turns out that the time,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
is decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
but you can't kill it. So this makes sense, because in a certain sense

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
what culture is, is the accumulation of ideas.
