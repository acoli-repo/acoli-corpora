The question that I came up with was this question:

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
what does technology want? And by that, I don't mean,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000

thinking about biological organisms, which we've heard a lot about.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And the trick that Richard Dawkins does, which is to say,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So he's saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And I'm applying a similar trick to say,
