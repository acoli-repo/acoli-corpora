Each one of these organisms that we've described -- that you've seen

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
from Jamie and others, these magnificent things --

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
what they're doing, each one of them,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
is they're hacking the rules of life.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I can't think of a single general principle of biology

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Every single thing that we can think of --

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
because every single one of them is hacking something about it.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
This is a solar-powered sea slug. It's a nudibranch
