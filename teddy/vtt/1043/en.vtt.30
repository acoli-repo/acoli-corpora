00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
So all these steps in evolution are increasing, basically,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
the evolution of evolvability.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
So what's happening over time in life is

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
that the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
are increasing. And the real tricks are ways

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
in which you kind of explore the way of exploring.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And then what we see in the singularity,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
that prophesized by Kurzweil and others --

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
his idea that technology is accelerating evolution.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
It's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
So if you have life hacking --
