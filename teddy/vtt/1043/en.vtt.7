00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
we have to go back, actually, to life. Because obviously,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
if we keep extending the origins of technology far back,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I think we come back to life at some point.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So that's where I want to begin my little exploration, is in life.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And like you heard from the previous speakers,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
we don't really know what life there is on Earth right now.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
We have really no idea.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Craig Venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Brian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and actually discover all the species on Earth.
