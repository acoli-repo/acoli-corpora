00:02:55.784 --> 00:03:00.867
and obviously, we are in the throes
of this crazy global pandemic

00:03:00.891 --> 00:03:02.653
caused by this new coronavirus.

00:03:02.677 --> 00:03:05.611
So you two have been working
together forever,

00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:08.454
and you really came together
pretty aggressively

00:03:08.478 --> 00:03:11.353
with the Ebola crisis back in 2014.

00:03:11.377 --> 00:03:13.573
What does it feel like
from your perspective?

00:03:13.597 --> 00:03:16.964
CH: Pretty much six years
after the Ebola outbreak,

00:03:16.988 --> 00:03:19.076
we're really facing another crisis,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.028
and we still pretty much, like,
we never learned from the previous crisis.

00:03:25.052 --> 00:03:27.413
And that, really, for me,
is heartbreaking.

00:03:27.437 --> 00:03:34.035
PS: I think that this pandemic
has shown us how unprepared we are
