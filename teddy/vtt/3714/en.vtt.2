WEBVTT

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.467
It can be used to test known viruses
on simple paper strips.

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:06.596
It is very inexpensive,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.634
and frontline health workers
can use SHERLOCK

00:01:09.658 --> 00:01:14.227
to detect the most common
or the most threatening viruses

00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:15.641
within an hour.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:17.689
PS: The other tool is CARMEN.

00:01:17.713 --> 00:01:22.045
It requires a lab, but it can test
for hundreds of viruses simultaneously.

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.777
So hospital lab staff
can test patient samples

00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:26.303
for a broad range of viruses

00:01:26.327 --> 00:01:27.841
within a day.

00:01:27.865 --> 00:01:30.556
