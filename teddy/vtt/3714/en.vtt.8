00:03:57.898 --> 00:04:00.715
but I know that the question
that's on everybody's mind is:

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.767
How is that playing into the here and now?

00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:06.050
PS: You know, we describe Sentinel
as a pandemic preemption system,

00:04:06.074 --> 00:04:07.520
and here we are in a pandemic.

00:04:07.544 --> 00:04:10.328
But what's great is that, actually,
the same tools you need

00:04:10.352 --> 00:04:11.506
to preempt a pandemic

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.639
are the ones that you need
to respond to one.

00:04:13.663 --> 00:04:16.728
And so all of the technologies
that we have laid out --

00:04:16.752 --> 00:04:19.377
the point-of-care testing,
the multiplex testing,

00:04:19.401 --> 00:04:22.811
the discovery and tracking
of the virus as it's changing,

00:04:22.835 --> 00:04:26.235
and the overlay of the mobile
applications to dashboard --

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:27.418
are all critical.

00:04:27.442 --> 00:04:29.574
CH: For us, it is a war.

00:04:29.598 --> 00:04:32.939
We are basically committed
for 24 hours' turnaround time
