00:00:27.576 --> 00:00:30.557
Christian and I have been studying
infectious diseases together

00:00:30.581 --> 00:00:32.545
around the world for two decades.

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:34.773
We have been using genome sequencing.

00:00:34.797 --> 00:00:37.734
Reading out the complete
genetic information of a microbe,

00:00:37.758 --> 00:00:42.095
it allows us to identify viruses,
even those we've never seen before,

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:43.520
track them as they spread

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.428
and watch for new mutations.

00:00:45.452 --> 00:00:48.749
And now with the powerful
gene-editing technology CRISPR,

00:00:48.773 --> 00:00:50.943
we can use this genetic information

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:56.093
to rapidly design exquisitely sensitive
diagnostic tests for any microbe.

00:00:56.557 --> 00:00:59.076
CH: One of these tools is called SHERLOCK.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.467
It can be used to test known viruses
on simple paper strips.
