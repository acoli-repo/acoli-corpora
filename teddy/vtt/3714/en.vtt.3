00:01:27.865 --> 00:01:30.556
Our second pillar is Connect.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.016
Connect everyone
and share this information

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.974
across the public health community.

00:01:35.752 --> 00:01:37.093
In most outbreaks,

00:01:37.117 --> 00:01:41.560
hospital staff share case information
through paper, Excel -- if at all.

00:01:42.115 --> 00:01:44.683
This makes tracking an outbreak
through space and time

00:01:44.707 --> 00:01:46.037
and coordinating a response

00:01:46.061 --> 00:01:47.496
extremely difficult.

00:01:47.877 --> 00:01:50.982
So we're developing a cloud-based system
and mobile applications

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:52.985
that connect community health workers,

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.253
clinicians, public health
teams -- everyone --

00:01:56.277 --> 00:01:58.455
and allows them to upload data,

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.215
perform analysis, share insights
