00:04:29.598 --> 00:04:32.939
We are basically committed
for 24 hours' turnaround time

00:04:32.963 --> 00:04:34.908
in order to give results,

00:04:34.932 --> 00:04:39.119
and that requires for us
to work around the clock nonstop.

00:04:39.143 --> 00:04:41.352
So it's a pretty challenging moment.

00:04:41.376 --> 00:04:42.550
We are away from family.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:44.950
At least I have the privilege
to see family today,

00:04:44.974 --> 00:04:47.934
and then I'm sure tomorrow
I'm heading back in the trenches.

00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:51.122
In my lab, we sequenced
the first COVID-19 genome

00:04:51.146 --> 00:04:52.385
on the African continent,

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:54.440
and that really was done within 48 hours.

00:04:54.464 --> 00:04:57.531
This is revolutionary
coming from Africa

00:04:57.555 --> 00:05:01.110
and then making this information
available for the global health community
