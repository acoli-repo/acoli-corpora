Pakistan is also the birthplace
of the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner,

00:01:03.583 --> 00:01:04.942
Malala Yousafzai.

00:01:06.438 --> 00:01:09.021
But that's just one aspect of Pakistan.

00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:14.124
Another aspect is where
the twisted concept of honor

00:01:14.148 --> 00:01:17.040
is linked to women and their bodies;

00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:21.159
where men are allowed to disrespect women

00:01:21.183 --> 00:01:23.000
and even kill them sometimes

00:01:23.024 --> 00:01:25.653
in the name of so-called "family honor";

00:01:26.522 --> 00:01:31.071
where women are left to die
right outside their houses
