And that was the time
when I first asked myself, "Why?

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:13.525
Why are women not allowed
to enjoy the same equal rights

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.525
enshrined in our Constitution?

00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:20.581
While the law states that a woman
has the same equal access

00:03:20.605 --> 00:03:22.034
to the information,

00:03:22.058 --> 00:03:25.837
why is it always men -- brothers,
fathers and husbands --

00:03:25.861 --> 00:03:27.900
who are granting these rights to us,

00:03:27.924 --> 00:03:30.772
effectively making the law irrelevant?"
