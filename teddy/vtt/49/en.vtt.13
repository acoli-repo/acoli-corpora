00:06:29.474 --> 00:06:32.980
And then we got to higher
and higher energies;

00:06:33.004 --> 00:06:37.307
we created circular accelerators
that let us delve into the nucleus

00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:40.851
and then create new elements, even.

00:06:41.717 --> 00:06:46.077
And at that point, we were no longer
just exploring inside the atom.

00:06:46.542 --> 00:06:49.280
We'd actually learned
how to control these particles.

00:06:49.304 --> 00:06:51.926
We'd learned how to interact
with our world

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.513
on a scale that's too small
for humans to see or touch

00:06:56.537 --> 00:06:58.839
or even sense that it's there.
