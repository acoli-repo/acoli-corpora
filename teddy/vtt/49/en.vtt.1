00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:30.329
But the question was:
What were they made of?

00:00:30.858 --> 00:00:34.731
In England, the 19th-century
physicist J.J. Thompson

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:39.022
conducted experiments using
magnets and electricity, like this.

00:00:45.552 --> 00:00:48.218
And he came to an incredible revelation.

00:00:48.956 --> 00:00:52.490
These rays were made
of negatively charged particles

00:00:52.514 --> 00:00:56.506
around 2,000 times lighter
than the hydrogen atom,

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.339
the smallest thing they knew.

00:00:58.673 --> 00:01:02.887
So Thompson had discovered
the first subatomic particle,
