In countries like Australia and the UK,

00:05:31.014 --> 00:05:35.450
around half of all cancer patients
are treated using radiotherapy.

00:05:35.474 --> 00:05:39.489
And so, electron accelerators
are actually standard equipment

00:05:39.513 --> 00:05:40.713
in most hospitals.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.998
Or, a little closer to home:

00:05:44.022 --> 00:05:46.556
if you have a smartphone or a computer --

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.881
and this is TEDx, so you've got
both with you right now, right?

00:05:51.855 --> 00:05:53.915
Well, inside those devices

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.956
are chips that are made
by implanting single ions into silicon,

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.252
in a process called ion implantation.
