00:08:29.219 --> 00:08:32.632
when he pulled back the veil
on the subatomic world.

00:08:33.965 --> 00:08:37.568
And now we need to invest
in curiosity-driven research,

00:08:37.592 --> 00:08:40.537
because we have so many
challenges that we face.

00:08:40.561 --> 00:08:42.472
And we need patience;

00:08:42.496 --> 00:08:46.028
we need to give scientists the time,
the space and the means

00:08:46.052 --> 00:08:48.338
to continue their quest,

00:08:48.362 --> 00:08:50.490
because history tells us

00:08:50.514 --> 00:08:53.672
that if we can remain
curious and open-minded

00:08:53.696 --> 00:08:56.061
about the outcomes of research,

00:08:56.085 --> 00:08:58.998
the more world-changing
our discoveries will be.

00:08:59.397 --> 00:09:00.547
Thank you.
