You guys, I can't even begin to explain
how incredible it is

00:08:00.144 --> 00:08:01.614
that we can do this.

00:08:02.125 --> 00:08:04.125
(Laughter)

00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:07.440
(Applause)

00:08:11.531 --> 00:08:15.592
So I want to encourage you
to invest your time and energy

00:08:15.616 --> 00:08:19.386
in people that do
curiosity-driven research.

00:08:19.777 --> 00:08:22.599
It was Jonathan Swift who once said,

00:08:22.623 --> 00:08:25.783
"Vision is the art
of seeing the invisible."

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.195
And over a century ago,
J.J. Thompson did just that,

00:08:29.219 --> 00:08:32.632
when he pulled back the veil
on the subatomic world.
