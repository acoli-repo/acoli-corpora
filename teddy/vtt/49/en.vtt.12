00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.252
in a process called ion implantation.

00:06:01.617 --> 00:06:04.664
And that uses a particle accelerator.

00:06:06.546 --> 00:06:10.268
Without curiosity-driven research, though,

00:06:10.292 --> 00:06:14.021
none of these things would exist at all.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.485
So, over the years, we really learned
to explore inside the atom.

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:25.672
And to do that, we had to learn
to develop particle accelerators.

00:06:25.696 --> 00:06:29.085
The first ones we developed
let us split the atom.

00:06:29.474 --> 00:06:32.980
And then we got to higher
and higher energies;
