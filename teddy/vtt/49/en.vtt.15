you can take all of that energy
and convert it into new matter,

00:07:30.276 --> 00:07:35.736
new particles which we rip
from the very fabric of the universe.

00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:41.199
Nowadays, there are
about 35,000 accelerators in the world,

00:07:41.223 --> 00:07:42.772
not including televisions.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.990
And inside each one of these
incredible machines,

00:07:47.014 --> 00:07:50.633
there are hundreds of billions
of tiny particles,

00:07:50.657 --> 00:07:54.379
dancing and swirling in systems
that are more complex

00:07:54.403 --> 00:07:56.695
than the formation of galaxies.

00:07:56.719 --> 00:08:00.120
You guys, I can't even begin to explain
how incredible it is
