And what he found
did cause a revolution in science.

00:01:35.704 --> 00:01:40.605
But it also caused a second,
unexpected revolution in technology.

00:01:41.582 --> 00:01:45.915
Today, I'd like to make a case
for curiosity-driven research,

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.375
because without it,

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.895
none of the technologies
I'll talk about today

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:51.585
would have been possible.

00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:56.768
Now, what Thompson found here
has actually changed our view of reality.

00:01:56.792 --> 00:01:59.680
I mean, I think I'm standing on a stage,

00:01:59.704 --> 00:02:01.744
and you think you're sitting in a seat.
