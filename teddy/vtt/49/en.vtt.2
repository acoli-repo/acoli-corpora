00:00:58.673 --> 00:01:02.887
So Thompson had discovered
the first subatomic particle,

00:01:02.911 --> 00:01:04.777
which we now call electrons.

00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:09.394
Now, at the time, this seemed to be
a completely impractical discovery.

00:01:09.418 --> 00:01:12.990
I mean, Thompson didn't think
there were any applications of electrons.

00:01:13.653 --> 00:01:17.926
Around his lab in Cambridge,
he used to like to propose a toast:

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.299
"To the electron.

00:01:19.323 --> 00:01:21.473
May it never be of use to anybody."

00:01:21.497 --> 00:01:23.528
(Laughter)

00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:28.006
He was strongly in favor of doing research
out of sheer curiosity,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.363
to arrive at a deeper
understanding of the world.
