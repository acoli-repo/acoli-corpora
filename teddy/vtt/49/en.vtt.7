00:03:29.245 --> 00:03:32.618
by asking scientists to build
better surgical probes.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.101
Only research done out of sheer curiosity,
with no application in mind,

00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:42.021
could have given us the discovery
of the electron and X-rays.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.061
Now, this tube also threw open the gates
for our understanding of the universe

00:03:48.085 --> 00:03:50.283
and the field of particle physics,

00:03:50.307 --> 00:03:54.860
because it's also the first,
very simple particle accelerator.

00:03:55.785 --> 00:03:59.959
Now, I'm an accelerator physicist,
so I design particle accelerators,

00:03:59.983 --> 00:04:02.493
and I try and understand how beams behave.
