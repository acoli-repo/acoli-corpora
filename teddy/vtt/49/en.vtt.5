in cathode-ray tube televisions.

00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:34.609
But -- I mean, how impoverished
would our lives be

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:38.143
if the only invention that had come
from here was the television?

00:02:38.167 --> 00:02:40.363
(Laughter)

00:02:40.387 --> 00:02:43.069
Thankfully, this tube was just a start,

00:02:43.093 --> 00:02:45.828
because something else happens
when the electrons here

00:02:45.852 --> 00:02:48.188
hit the piece of metal inside the tube.

00:02:48.212 --> 00:02:49.362
Let me show you.

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:53.999
Pop this one back on.

00:02:55.163 --> 00:02:58.194
So as the electrons
screech to a halt inside the metal,

00:02:58.218 --> 00:03:00.393
their energy gets thrown out again
