In 1928, a physicist named Paul Dirac
found something strange in his equations.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:36.343
And he predicted, based purely
on mathematical insight,

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:39.137
that there ought to be
a second kind of matter,

00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:41.339
the opposite to normal matter,

00:04:41.363 --> 00:04:44.830
that literally annihilates
when it comes in contact:

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:46.529
antimatter.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.974
I mean, the idea sounded ridiculous.

00:04:50.427 --> 00:04:52.823
But within four years, they'd found it.

00:04:52.847 --> 00:04:55.133
And nowadays, we use it
every day in hospitals,

00:04:55.157 --> 00:04:59.876
in positron emission tomography,
or PET scans, used for detecting disease.
