00:03:59.983 --> 00:04:02.493
and I try and understand how beams behave.

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:04.953
And my field's a bit unusual,

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:08.649
because it crosses between
curiosity-driven research

00:04:08.673 --> 00:04:11.949
and technology with
real-world applications.

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.689
But it's the combination
of those two things

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:17.920
that gets me really excited
about what I do.

00:04:18.704 --> 00:04:20.435
Now, over the last 100 years,

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.368
there have been far too many examples
for me to list them all.

00:04:23.392 --> 00:04:25.545
But I want to share with you just a few.

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:31.300
In 1928, a physicist named Paul Dirac
found something strange in his equations.
