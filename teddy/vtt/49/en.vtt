In the late 19th century,
scientists were trying to solve a mystery.

00:00:06.254 --> 00:00:09.768
They found that if they had
a vacuum tube like this one

00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:12.419
and applied a high voltage across it,

00:00:12.443 --> 00:00:14.158
something strange happened.

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:27.086
They called them cathode rays.

00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:30.329
But the question was:
What were they made of?
