00:01:59.704 --> 00:02:01.744
and you think you're sitting in a seat.

00:02:01.768 --> 00:02:03.792
But that's just the electrons in your body

00:02:03.816 --> 00:02:06.585
pushing back against
the electrons in the seat,

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.609
opposing the force of gravity.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.990
You're not even really touching the seat.

00:02:12.014 --> 00:02:15.855
You're hovering ever so slightly above it.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.061
But in many ways, our modern society
was actually built on this discovery.

00:02:21.085 --> 00:02:23.585
I mean, these tubes
were the start of electronics.

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.103
And then for many years,

00:02:25.127 --> 00:02:28.839
most of us actually had one of these,
if you remember, in your living room,

00:02:28.863 --> 00:02:30.996
in cathode-ray tube televisions.
