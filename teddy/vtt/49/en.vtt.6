00:02:58.218 --> 00:03:00.393
their energy gets thrown out again

00:03:00.417 --> 00:03:04.063
in a form of high-energy light,
which we call X-rays.

00:03:04.087 --> 00:03:06.697
(Buzzing)

00:03:07.793 --> 00:03:08.943
(Buzzing)

00:03:09.661 --> 00:03:12.887
And within 15 years
of discovering the electron,

00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:17.506
these X-rays were being used
to make images inside the human body,

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.822
helping soldiers' lives
being saved by surgeons,

00:03:21.846 --> 00:03:25.458
who could then find pieces of bullets
and shrapnel inside their bodies.

00:03:26.236 --> 00:03:29.221
But there's no way we could have
come up with that technology

00:03:29.245 --> 00:03:32.618
by asking scientists to build
better surgical probes.
