00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
My topic

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is economic growth in China and India.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And the question I want to explore with you

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is whether or not

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
democracy has helped or has hindered

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
economic growth.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
You may say this is not fair,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
because I'm selecting two countries

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to make a case against democracy.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Actually, exactly the opposite

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is what I'm going to do.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm going to use these two countries

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to make an economic argument for democracy,
