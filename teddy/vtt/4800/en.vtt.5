Facing a decision, ask yourself,
"What concepts are at work?"

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.461
"What assumptions exist?"

00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:38.581
"Is my interpretation of the information
logically sound?"

00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:41.680
For example, in an email that promises
you millions,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.918
you should consider, "What is shaping
my approach to this situation?"

00:02:45.918 --> 00:02:48.211
"Do I assume the sender 
is telling the truth?"

00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:54.193
"Based on the evidence, is it logical 
to assume I'll win any money?"

00:02:54.193 --> 00:02:56.711
Four: consider the implications.

00:02:56.711 --> 00:02:58.609
Imagine it's election time,

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.826
and you've selected a political
candidate based on their promise
