Even if you disagree with 
everything that candidate says,

00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:34.909
exploring the full spectrum of viewpoints

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:40.118
might explain why some policies that don't
seem valid to you appeal to others.

00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:42.866
This will allow you 
to explore alternatives,

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:44.373
evaluate your own choices,

00:03:44.373 --> 00:03:48.997
and ultimately help you make more
informed decisions.

00:03:48.997 --> 00:03:51.716
This five-step process is just one tool,

00:03:51.716 --> 00:03:55.421
and it certainly won't eradicate difficult
decisions from our lives.

00:03:55.421 --> 00:04:00.180
But it can help us increase 
the number of positive choices we make.
