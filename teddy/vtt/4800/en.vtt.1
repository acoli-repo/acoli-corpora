00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:30.127
We're bombarded with so many decisions

00:00:30.127 --> 00:00:33.705
that it's impossible to make 
a perfect choice every time.

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:36.757
But there are many ways 
to improve our chances,

00:00:36.757 --> 00:00:40.581
and one particularly effective technique
is critical thinking.

00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:42.511
This is a way of approaching a question

00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:45.512
that allows us to carefully 
deconstruct a situation,

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:48.916
reveal its hidden issues,
such as bias and manipulation,

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:51.374
and make the best decision.

00:00:51.374 --> 00:00:56.192
If the critical part sounds negative
that's because in a way it is.

00:00:56.192 --> 00:00:58.812
Rather than choosing an answer 
because it feels right,

00:00:58.812 --> 00:01:00.961
a person who uses critical thinking
