Well, first let's examine 
how HIV infects people

00:00:31.555 --> 00:00:33.672
and progresses into AIDS.

00:00:33.672 --> 00:00:36.830
HIV spreads through 
exchanges of bodily fluids.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.293
Unprotected sex and contaminated needles
are the leading cause of transmission.

00:00:41.293 --> 00:00:45.853
It, fortunately, cannot spread
through air, water, or casual contact.

00:00:45.853 --> 00:00:49.614
Individuals of any age,
sexual orientation, gender and race

00:00:49.614 --> 00:00:52.088
can contract HIV.

00:00:52.088 --> 00:00:57.096
Once inside the body, HIV infects cells
that are part of the immune system.

00:00:57.096 --> 00:00:59.445
It particularly targets helper T cells,

00:00:59.445 --> 00:01:03.555
which help defend the body against 
bacterial and fungal infections.
