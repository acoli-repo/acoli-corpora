00:00:59.445 --> 00:01:03.555
which help defend the body against 
bacterial and fungal infections.

00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:05.670
HIV is a retrovirus,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.008
which means it can write its genetic code
into the genome of infected cells,

00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:13.483
co-opting them into making 
more copies of itself.

00:01:13.483 --> 00:01:15.789
During the first stage of HIV infection,

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:18.167
the virus replicates 
within helper T cells,

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:20.971
destroying many of them in the process.

00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:24.372
During this stage, patients often 
experience flu-like symptoms,

00:01:24.372 --> 00:01:27.203
but are typically 
not yet in mortal danger.

00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:30.837
However, for a period ranging 
from a few months to several years,
