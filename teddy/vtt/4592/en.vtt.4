00:01:59.868 --> 00:02:02.089
With antiretroviral therapy,

00:02:02.089 --> 00:02:06.490
most HIV-positive people can expect
to live long and healthy lives,

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.157
and are much less likely to infect others.

00:02:09.157 --> 00:02:11.600
However, there are two major catches.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.881
One is that HIV-positive patients 
must keep taking their drugs

00:02:15.881 --> 00:02:17.509
for the rest of their lives.

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:20.762
Without them, the virus can make 
a deadly comeback.

00:02:20.762 --> 00:02:22.944
So, how do these drugs work?

00:02:22.944 --> 00:02:26.894
The most commonly prescribed ones
prevent the viral genome from being copied

00:02:26.894 --> 00:02:30.335
and incorporated into a host cell's DNA.
