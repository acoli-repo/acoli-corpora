one of those T cells could activate
and start spreading the virus again.

00:03:02.618 --> 00:03:06.606
The other major catch is that not everyone
in the world has access to the therapies

00:03:06.606 --> 00:03:08.690
that could save their lives.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.730
In Sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts
for over 70% of HIV patients worldwide,

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.870
antiretrovirals reached only about one
in three HIV-positive patients in 2012.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.464
There is no easy answer to this problem.

00:03:22.464 --> 00:03:25.355
A mix of political, economic 
and cultural barriers

00:03:25.355 --> 00:03:28.894
makes effective prevention 
and treatment difficult.

00:03:28.894 --> 00:03:34.549
And even in the U.S., HIV still claims
more than 10,000 lives per year.
