00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:30.837
However, for a period ranging 
from a few months to several years,

00:01:30.837 --> 00:01:34.269
during which time the patient may look
and feel completely healthy,

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:37.891
the virus continues to replicate
and destroy T cells.

00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:39.826
When T cell counts drop too low,

00:01:39.826 --> 00:01:43.236
patients are in serious danger
of contracting deadly infections

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:46.674
that healthy immune systems
can normally handle.

00:01:46.674 --> 00:01:50.467
This stage of HIV infection
is known as AIDS.

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:53.297
The good news is there are drugs
that are highly effective

00:01:53.297 --> 00:01:55.036
at managing levels of HIV

00:01:55.036 --> 00:01:57.620
and preventing T cell counts 
from getting low enough

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.868
for the disease to progress to AIDS.

00:01:59.868 --> 00:02:02.089
With antiretroviral therapy,
