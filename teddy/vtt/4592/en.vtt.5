00:02:26.894 --> 00:02:30.335
and incorporated into a host cell's DNA.

00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:33.323
Other drugs prevent the virus
from maturing or assembling,

00:02:33.323 --> 00:02:37.985
causing HIV to be unable 
to infect new cells in the body.

00:02:37.985 --> 00:02:41.192
But HIV hides out somewhere
our current drugs cannot reach it:

00:02:41.192 --> 00:02:44.022
inside the DNA of healthy T cells.

00:02:44.022 --> 00:02:47.746
Most T cells die shortly after 
being infected with HIV.

00:02:47.746 --> 00:02:49.192
But in a tiny percentage,

00:02:49.192 --> 00:02:52.630
the instructions for building more HIV
viruses lies dormant,

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.363
sometimes for years.

00:02:54.363 --> 00:02:58.477
So even if we could wipe out every
HIV virus from an infected person's body,

00:02:58.477 --> 00:03:02.618
one of those T cells could activate
and start spreading the virus again.
