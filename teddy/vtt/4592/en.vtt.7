00:03:28.894 --> 00:03:34.549
And even in the U.S., HIV still claims
more than 10,000 lives per year.

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.628
However, there is ample cause for hope.

00:03:37.628 --> 00:03:41.169
Researchers may be closer than ever
to developing a true cure.

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.637
One research approach involves

00:03:42.637 --> 00:03:47.963
using a drug to activate all cells 
harboring the HIV genetic information.

00:03:47.963 --> 00:03:52.088
This would both destroy those cells
and flush the virus out into the open,

00:03:52.088 --> 00:03:54.328
where our current drugs are effective.

00:03:54.328 --> 00:03:56.515
Another is looking to use genetic tools

00:03:56.515 --> 00:04:01.301
to cut the HIV DNA 
out of cells genomes altogether.
