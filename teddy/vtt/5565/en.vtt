00:00:06.821 --> 00:00:10.809
Imagine you're on a game show,
and you can choose between two prizes:

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.438
a diamond

00:00:12.438 --> 00:00:14.378
or a bottle of water.

00:00:14.378 --> 00:00:15.679
It's an easy choice.

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.028
The diamonds are clearly more valuable.

00:00:18.028 --> 00:00:20.523
Now imagine being given 
the same choice again,

00:00:20.523 --> 00:00:22.780
only this time, you're not on a game show,

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.660
but dehydrated in the desert 
after wandering for days.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.320
Do you choose differently?

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.830
Why? Aren't diamonds still more valuable?
