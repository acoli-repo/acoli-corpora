However, to other people,

00:10:00.375 --> 00:10:03.559
the idea of consent
is so strongly tied to sex,

00:10:03.583 --> 00:10:06.101
and sex is often considered
a taboo subject,

00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:08.601
that it made them very uncomfortable.

00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:10.726
But my students are third-graders,

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.393
so we're not talking about sex in class.

00:10:13.417 --> 00:10:15.184
Rather, I wanted them to understand

00:10:15.208 --> 00:10:17.559
that everybody has different
physical boundaries

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:19.476
that make them feel comfortable.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.143
And the social and emotional
intelligence it takes

00:10:22.167 --> 00:10:25.059
to read somebody's words
and tone and body language

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:27.518
are skills that often need
to be explicitly taught,

00:10:27.542 --> 00:10:30.851
the same way we teach things
like reading and math.
