00:06:58.375 --> 00:07:03.809
between what is fair --
people getting what they need.

00:07:03.833 --> 00:07:07.101
We identified a lot
of these things in class together.

00:07:07.125 --> 00:07:10.309
And the difference
between fair and equal --

00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:12.559
when everybody gets the same thing,

00:07:12.583 --> 00:07:14.583
especially goody bags at birthday parties.

00:07:15.792 --> 00:07:18.809
Now, first-graders can also
understand the difference

00:07:18.833 --> 00:07:22.018
between a punishment and a consequence.

00:07:22.042 --> 00:07:24.476
And all of these things
are foundational concepts

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.351
that anyone needs to understand

00:07:26.375 --> 00:07:27.768
before having a conversation

00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:30.851
about mass incarceration
in the United States.
