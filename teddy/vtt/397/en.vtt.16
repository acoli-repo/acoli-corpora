I also know that teaching
about these things in schools

00:08:00.458 --> 00:08:03.393
can feel like navigating a minefield.

00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:06.476
For example, what happens

aren't on board with having

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.518
But to these people, I can say:

00:08:11.542 --> 00:08:15.684

For example, I had a student come in
and whisper to me,

00:08:24.833 --> 00:08:28.726
but I don't know what it means
and I'm too embarrassed to admit it."

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.851
I had a student come in over a weekend
and come up to me and say,
