00:06:29.583 --> 00:06:33.333
we actually do them such a disservice.

00:06:34.083 --> 00:06:38.268
Now, I also know
that these types of conversations

00:06:38.292 --> 00:06:41.143
can seem really, really intimidating
with our students,

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:43.101
especially with young learners.

00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:45.809
But I have taught
first through fifth grades,

00:06:45.833 --> 00:06:47.684
and I can tell you, for example,

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:50.309
that I'm not going to walk
into a first-grade classroom

00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:53.768
and start talking about things
like mass incarceration.

00:06:53.792 --> 00:06:58.351
But even a six-year-old first-grader
can understand the difference

00:06:58.375 --> 00:07:03.809
between what is fair --
people getting what they need.
