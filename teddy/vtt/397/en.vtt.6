00:02:57.917 --> 00:03:01.601
And as I watched the conversation
really marinate with my students,

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:07.351
I began to wonder how many of my students
have assumptions just like Abby.

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:10.684
And what happens when those assumptions
go unnoticed and unaddressed,

00:03:10.708 --> 00:03:12.042
as they so often do?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.518
But first, I think it's important
to take a step back

00:03:15.542 --> 00:03:17.667
and even consider
what makes a topic taboo.

00:03:18.457 --> 00:03:20.934
I don't remember receiving
an official list of things

00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:22.684
you're not supposed to talk about.

00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:26.226
But I do remember hearing,
over and over, growing up:

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.559
there are two things you do not talk about
at family get-togethers.

00:03:29.583 --> 00:03:33.708
And those two things
are religion and politics.
