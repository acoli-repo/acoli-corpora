00:00:00.792 --> 00:00:02.351
So, a few years ago,

00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:06.018
I was beginning a new unit on race
with my fourth-graders.

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:08.226
And whenever we start a new unit,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.934
I like to begin by having all the students
list everything they know about it,

00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:14.643
and then we also list questions we have.

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:19.101
And I had the type of moment
that every teacher has nightmares about.

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.976
One of my students
had just asked the question,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.268
"Why are some people racist?"

00:00:24.292 --> 00:00:27.101
And another student, let's call her Abby,

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:29.893
had just raised her hand and volunteered:

00:00:29.917 --> 00:00:34.417
"Maybe some people don't like black people
because their skin is the color of poop."
