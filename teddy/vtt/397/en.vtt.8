while other people fear being PC-shamed

00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:03.601
or that their ignorance will show
as soon as they open their mouths.

00:04:03.625 --> 00:04:07.518
But I believe that the first step
towards holding conversations

00:04:07.542 --> 00:04:08.809
about things like equity

00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:10.976
is to begin by building a common language.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.393
And that actually starts
with destigmatizing topics

00:04:13.417 --> 00:04:15.976
that are typically deemed taboo.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.434
Now, conversations
around race, for example,

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:21.434
have their own specific language

00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:23.768
and students need
to be fluent in this language

00:04:23.792 --> 00:04:26.684
in order to have these conversations.

00:04:26.708 --> 00:04:29.476
Now, schools are often the only place

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.809
where students can feel
free and comfortable
