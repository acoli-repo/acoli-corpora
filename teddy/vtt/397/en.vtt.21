00:10:27.542 --> 00:10:30.851
the same way we teach things
like reading and math.

00:10:30.875 --> 00:10:35.101
And this lesson is not reserved
for students of one single demographic.

00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:37.316
Things like questioning
and making observations

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.601
and critical thinking

00:10:38.625 --> 00:10:41.143
are things that any student
of any race or ethnicity

00:10:41.167 --> 00:10:46.292
or background or language or income
or zip code should be learning in schools.

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.518
Also, deliberate avoidance
of these conversations

00:10:51.542 --> 00:10:53.893
speaks volumes to our students

00:10:53.917 --> 00:10:58.601
because kids notice when their teachers,
when their textbooks

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:03.184
leave out the voices and experiences
of people like women or people of color.
