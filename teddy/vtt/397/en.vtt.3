Consider your fight-or-flight instincts.

00:01:30.042 --> 00:01:35.768
I could fight by raising my voice
and reprimanding her for her words.

00:01:35.792 --> 00:01:38.393
Or flight -- just change the subject

00:01:38.417 --> 00:01:40.684
and quickly start reaching
for another subject,

00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:43.833
like anything to get my students' minds
off the word "poop."

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:49.643
However, as we know, the right thing to do
is often not the easy thing to do.

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:52.559
And as much as I wanted
this moment to be over,

00:01:52.583 --> 00:01:56.851
and that I knew both of these options
would help me escape the situation,

00:01:56.875 --> 00:02:01.083
I knew that this was far too important
of a teachable moment to miss.
