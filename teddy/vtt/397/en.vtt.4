I knew that this was far too important
of a teachable moment to miss.

00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:05.268
So after standing there
for what felt like an eternity,

00:02:05.292 --> 00:02:10.268
I unfroze and I turned
to face my class, and I said,

00:02:10.292 --> 00:02:13.167
"Actually, Abby makes a point."

00:02:14.042 --> 00:02:17.226
And my students kind of
looked at each other, all confused.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.976
And I continued,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.351
"One reason why racism exists

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:25.143
is because people with light skin
have looked at people with dark skin

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:27.309
and said that their skin was ugly.

00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:32.143
And even use this reason
as an excuse to dehumanize them.
