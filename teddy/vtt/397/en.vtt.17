I had a student come in over a weekend
and come up to me and say,

00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:35.433
"You know, I just watched
this movie about Australia,

00:08:35.457 --> 00:08:38.042
and it made me wonder
if they have racism there, too."

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.393
And I always want my students to be
comfortable having these conversations

00:08:43.417 --> 00:08:47.101
because when they're comfortable
talking about it and asking questions,

00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:50.434
they also build comfort in bringing in
their own lives and experiences

00:08:50.458 --> 00:08:53.226
in how they relate to these big topics.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.643
Also, some teachers might be
kind of nervous

00:08:56.667 --> 00:08:59.309
if a student brings up a topic
or asks a question

00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:01.601
and they don't know the answer to it.
