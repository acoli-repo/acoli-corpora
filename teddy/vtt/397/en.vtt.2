00:00:56.958 --> 00:01:00.851
because they think
Abby has said something wildly funny,

00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:04.476
and the other half are yelling at her
for saying something offensive.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.393
And then you have Abby,
sitting there completely bewildered

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:10.851
because, in her mind, she doesn't
understand the weight of what she said

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:13.684
and why everybody is reacting this way.

00:01:13.708 --> 00:01:15.351
And then you have me, the teacher,

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:18.559
standing there in the corner,
like, about to have a panic attack.

00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:20.018
So as a classroom teacher,

00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:23.518
I have to make split-second
decisions all the time.

00:01:23.542 --> 00:01:25.958
And I knew I needed to react, but how?

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:30.018
Consider your fight-or-flight instincts.
