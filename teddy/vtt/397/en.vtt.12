00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:01.934
And this is a sample survey
from one of my kids,

00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.726
and as you can see,
there's some humor in here.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.768
For under the question, "What is race?"

00:06:06.792 --> 00:06:09.559
she has written, "When two or more
cars, people and animals

00:06:09.583 --> 00:06:13.059
run to see who is fastest and who wins."

00:06:13.083 --> 00:06:16.768
However, if you look
at her question, "What is racism?"

00:06:16.792 --> 00:06:20.559
it says, "When somebody says or calls
someone dark-skinned a mean name."

00:06:20.583 --> 00:06:24.226
So, she's young, but she's showing
that she's beginning to understand.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.518
And when we act

00:06:25.542 --> 00:06:29.559
like our students aren't capable
of having these conversations,

00:06:29.583 --> 00:06:33.333
we actually do them such a disservice.
