00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, about three years ago I was in London,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I represent a group of people,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We have about 120 million dollars, and we want to do it well.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We want to be in the forefront fields,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and we want to do it differently.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We want to get out of this thing

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
where the young people have all the ideas, and the old people have all the power

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and decide what science gets done.
