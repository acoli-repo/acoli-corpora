I'll start with my favorite muse, Emily Dickinson,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
who said that wonder is not knowledge, neither is it ignorance.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's something which is suspended

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
between what we believe we can be,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and a tradition we may have forgotten.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And I think, when I listen to these incredible people here,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I've been so inspired -- so many incredible ideas, so many visions.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And yet, when I look at the environment outside,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
you see how resistant architecture is to change.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You see how resistant it is to those very ideas.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We can think them out. We can create incredible things.
