00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.292
And this is in contrast
to currents methods of fabric production,

00:02:33.316 --> 00:02:35.808
where a plant is grown,

00:02:35.832 --> 00:02:38.927
just the cotton part is harvested,

00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:40.736
processed into a yarn,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.529
woven into a fabric

00:02:42.553 --> 00:02:45.307
and then potentially shipped across oceans

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.482
before being cut and sewn into a garment.

00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:51.125
All of that can take months.

00:02:52.016 --> 00:02:55.112
So these prototypes indicated a field

00:02:55.136 --> 00:02:58.548
offering significant
resource efficiencies.

00:02:58.572 --> 00:03:02.537
From reducing the water,
energy and chemistry needed
