00:02:58.572 --> 00:03:02.537
From reducing the water,
energy and chemistry needed

00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:04.925
in the production of a material,

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:08.339
through to generating zero waste,

00:03:08.363 --> 00:03:11.926
we grew fabrics to finished form --

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.803
if you like, "biological
additive manufacture."

00:03:17.307 --> 00:03:19.974
Through biofabrication,

00:03:19.998 --> 00:03:24.299
I had replaced many
intensive man-made steps

00:03:24.323 --> 00:03:26.738
with one biological step.

00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:30.155
And as I engaged with this living system,
