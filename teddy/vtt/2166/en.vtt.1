00:00:28.323 --> 00:00:30.662
and designing with life.

00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.149
Fifteen years ago,

00:00:33.173 --> 00:00:36.379
I completely changed
both what I worked with

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:37.569
and how I worked

00:00:37.593 --> 00:00:41.061
after a revelatory collaboration
with a biologist.

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:46.664
Our project gave me
a different perspective on life,

00:00:46.688 --> 00:00:49.811
introducing a whole new
world of possibility

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:52.958
around how we can design and make things.

00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:57.378
I discovered a radical
manufacturing proposition:

00:00:58.323 --> 00:00:59.679
biofabrication.
