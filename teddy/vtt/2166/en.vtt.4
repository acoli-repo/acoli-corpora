Using a certain species of bacteria
in a nutrient-rich liquid,

00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:07.982
we fermented threads of cellulose

00:02:08.006 --> 00:02:12.188
that self-organized
into a sheet of fabric.

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.474
I dried the fabric I had grown

00:02:15.498 --> 00:02:21.110
and cut and sewed it
into a range of garments, shoes and bags.

00:02:21.134 --> 00:02:24.373
In other words,
in one lab we grew materials

00:02:24.397 --> 00:02:26.761
and turned them into a range of products

00:02:26.785 --> 00:02:28.745
in a matter of days.

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.292
And this is in contrast
to currents methods of fabric production,
