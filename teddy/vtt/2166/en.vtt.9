00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:32.831
fill it with a waste crop
like corn stalks or hemp,

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:34.450
add water,

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:38.553
wait a few days for the mycelium
to grow throughout,

00:04:38.577 --> 00:04:40.029
remove the mold,

00:04:40.053 --> 00:04:43.327
and you're left with a grown 3-D form.

00:04:44.601 --> 00:04:48.268
Incredibly, we can grow
all kinds of structures

00:04:48.292 --> 00:04:50.688
using living organisms,

00:04:50.712 --> 00:04:54.920
from foams that can replace
plastics in footwear,

00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:57.833
to leather-like materials without animals.

00:04:57.857 --> 00:05:01.730
Furniture, flooring -- all
are currently being prototyped.
