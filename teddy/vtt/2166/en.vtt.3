Bacteria, algae, fungi, yeast:

00:01:33.528 --> 00:01:38.710
our latest design tools
include those of biotechnology.

00:01:39.212 --> 00:01:41.887
My own journey in biofabrication

00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:44.644
started with a project
called "Biocouture."

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:49.857
The provocation was that instead
of growing a plant, like cotton,

00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:52.174
in a field over several months,

00:01:52.198 --> 00:01:58.481
we could use microbes to grow
a similar cellulose material in a lab

00:01:58.505 --> 00:01:59.934
in a few days.

00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:04.577

in a nutrient-rich liquid,
