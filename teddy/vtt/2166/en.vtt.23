00:11:29.379 --> 00:11:31.251
or that of our planet.

00:11:31.879 --> 00:11:33.879
If materials can't be recycled

00:11:33.903 --> 00:11:36.442
or naturally composted at home,

00:11:36.466 --> 00:11:37.974
we should reject them.

00:11:37.998 --> 00:11:42.537
I'm committed to making
this future a reality

00:11:42.561 --> 00:11:46.203
by shining a light on all the amazing work

00:11:46.227 --> 00:11:47.759
being done today

00:11:47.783 --> 00:11:50.791
and by facilitating more interactions

00:11:50.815 --> 00:11:55.255
between designers, scientists,
investors and brands.

00:11:55.581 --> 00:11:58.747
Because we need a material revolution,

00:11:58.771 --> 00:12:00.397
and we need it now.
