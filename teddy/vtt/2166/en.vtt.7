And as I engaged with this living system,

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:32.446
it transformed my design thinking.

00:03:32.973 --> 00:03:37.234
Here was biology,
with no intervention from me

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:41.615
other than designing initial
conditions for growth,

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.660
efficiently producing a useful,
sustainable material.

00:03:46.996 --> 00:03:53.782
So now I can't help but see all materials
through the lens of biofabrication.

00:03:53.806 --> 00:03:59.300
In fact, there's a growing
global community of innovators

00:03:59.324 --> 00:04:02.887
rethinking materials with biology.
