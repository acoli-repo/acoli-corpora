00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:02.649
towards cultivating life,

00:09:02.673 --> 00:09:06.400
we'd turn the negative image
of the urban jungle

00:09:06.424 --> 00:09:11.940
into one that literally embodies
a thriving, living ecosystem.

00:09:12.734 --> 00:09:18.656
By actively encouraging surface
interactions with healthy microbes,

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.688
we could improve passive climate control,

00:09:21.712 --> 00:09:23.545
stormwater management

00:09:23.569 --> 00:09:25.704
and even reduce CO2 emissions

00:09:25.728 --> 00:09:29.743
by lowering the energy
used to heat or cool our buildings.
