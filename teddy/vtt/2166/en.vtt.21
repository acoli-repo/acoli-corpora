multinational chemical
and biotech companies.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:40.061
In the last century,
we expected material innovation

00:10:40.085 --> 00:10:44.593
to come from the likes
of DuPont, Dow, BASF.

00:10:45.173 --> 00:10:51.180
But this 21st-century material revolution
is being led by start-ups

00:10:51.204 --> 00:10:54.347
with small teams and limited capital.

00:10:54.903 --> 00:10:58.617
And by the way, not all their founders
have science degrees.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:03.363
They include artists,
architects and designers.
