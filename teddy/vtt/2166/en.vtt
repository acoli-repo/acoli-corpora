00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:05.229
I started life as a fashion designer,

00:00:05.253 --> 00:00:09.486
working closely with textile designers
and fabric suppliers.

00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:15.323
But today, I can no longer see
or talk to my new collaborators,

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:18.434
because they're in the soil
beneath our feet,

00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:20.846
on the shelves of our supermarkets

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.813
and in the beer I'm going to drink
when I finish this talk.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.299
I'm talking about microbes

00:00:28.323 --> 00:00:30.662
and designing with life.
