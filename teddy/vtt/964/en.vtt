I'm Dr. David Hanson, and I build robots with character.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And by that, I mean

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that I develop robots that are characters,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but also robots that will eventually

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
come to empathize with you.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So we're starting with a variety of technologies

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that have converged into these conversational character robots

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that can see faces, make eye contact with you,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
make a full range of facial expressions, understand speech

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and begin to model how you're feeling

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and who you are, and build a relationship with you.
