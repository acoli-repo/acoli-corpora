00:00:07.246 --> 00:00:09.538
This is a thought experiment.

00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:12.163
Let's say at some point
in the not so distant future,

00:00:12.204 --> 00:00:15.454
you're barreling down the highway
in your self-driving car,

00:00:15.496 --> 00:00:19.663
and you find yourself boxed in
on all sides by other cars.

00:00:19.788 --> 00:00:23.454
Suddenly, a large, heavy object
falls off the truck in front of you.

00:00:23.496 --> 00:00:27.413
Your car can't stop in time
to avoid the collision,

00:00:27.454 --> 00:00:29.413
so it needs to make a decision:

00:00:29.454 --> 00:00:31.663
go straight and hit the object,
