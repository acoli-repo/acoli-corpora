00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:31.016
And there's something pretty mysterious about antimatter:

00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:35.059
there's way less of it out there than there should be.

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.116
Let's start with the most famous physics formula ever:

00:00:38.116 --> 00:00:40.437
E equals m c squared.

00:00:40.437 --> 00:00:43.732
It basically says that mass is concentrated energy,

00:00:43.732 --> 00:00:46.730
and mass and energy are exchangeable,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.143
like two currencies with a huge exchange rate.

00:00:50.143 --> 00:00:51.664
90 trillion Joules of energy

00:00:51.664 --> 00:00:54.121
are equivalent to 1 gram of mass.

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:57.791
But how do I actually transform energy into matter?

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:01.136
The magic word is &lt;i&gt;energy density&lt;/i&gt;.
