00:02:56.573 --> 00:03:00.874
So why don't we use antimatter for energy production?

00:03:00.874 --> 00:03:04.109
Well, antimatter isn't just sitting around,

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.260
ready for us to harvest.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.769
We have to make antimatter

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.349
before we can combust antimatter,

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.851
and it takes a billion times more energy

00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:14.374
to make antimatter

00:03:14.374 --> 00:03:16.611
than you get back.

00:03:16.611 --> 00:03:19.792
But, what if there was some antimatter in outer space

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:21.897
and we could dig it out one day

00:03:21.897 --> 00:03:24.443
from an antiplanet somewhere.

00:03:24.443 --> 00:03:26.901
A few decades ago, many scientists believed

00:03:26.901 --> 00:03:29.159
that this could actually be possible.

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.620
Today, observations have shown
