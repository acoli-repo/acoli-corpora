00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.620
Today, observations have shown

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.038
that there is no significant amount of antimatter

00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:35.375
anywhere in the visible universe,

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:37.426
which is weird because, like we said before,

00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:39.570
there should be just as much antimatter

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.962
as there is matter in the universe.

00:03:41.962 --> 00:03:44.043
Since antiparticles and particles

00:03:44.043 --> 00:03:47.220
should exist in equal numbers,

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.977
this missing antimatter?

00:03:48.977 --> 00:03:51.589
Now that is a real mystery.

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:53.130
To understand what might be happening,

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.509
we must go back to the Big Bang.

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:57.788
In the instant the universe was created,

00:03:57.788 --> 00:04:01.737
a huge amount of energy was transformed into mass,
