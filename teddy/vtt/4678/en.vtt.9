00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:30.374
"Why did all the antimatter disappear

00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:32.713
and only matter was left?"

00:04:32.713 --> 00:04:35.003
It seems that we were somehow lucky

00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:37.385
that a tiny asymmetry exists

00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:39.261
between matter and antimatter.

00:04:39.261 --> 00:04:41.841
Otherwise, there would be no particles at all

00:04:41.841 --> 00:04:43.349
anywhere in the universe

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.438
and also no human beings.

00:04:45.438 --> 00:04:47.616
But what causes this asymmetry?

00:04:47.616 --> 00:04:50.368
Experiments at CERN are trying to find out the reason

00:04:50.368 --> 00:04:52.519
why something exists

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:54.639
and why we don't live in a universe

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.653
filled with radiation only?

00:04:56.653 --> 00:05:00.290
But, so far, we just don't know the answer.
