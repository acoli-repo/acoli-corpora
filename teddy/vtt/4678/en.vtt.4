00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.220
the proton and the antiproton.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.366
Therefore, scientists are convinced

00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:04.969
that a world made of antimatter

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.332
would look, feel, and smell just like our world.

00:02:09.332 --> 00:02:11.137
In this antiworld,

00:02:11.137 --> 00:02:13.418
we may find antiwater,

00:02:13.418 --> 00:02:14.670
antigold,

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.377
and, for example,

00:02:16.377 --> 00:02:17.875
an antimarble.

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:19.882
Now imagine that a marble and an antimarble

00:02:19.882 --> 00:02:21.384
are brought together.

00:02:21.384 --> 00:02:23.400
These two apparently solid objects

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.221
would completely disappear

00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:26.933
into a big flash of energy,

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:29.472
equivalent to an atomic bomb.

00:02:29.472 --> 00:02:31.809
Because combining matter and antimatter
