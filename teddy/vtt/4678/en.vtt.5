00:02:29.472 --> 00:02:31.809
Because combining matter and antimatter

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:33.647
would create so much energy,

00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:35.602
science fiction is full of ideas

00:02:35.602 --> 00:02:38.609
about harnessing the energy stored in antimatter,

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.574
for example, to fuel spaceships like Star Trek.

00:02:41.574 --> 00:02:44.434
After all, the energy content of antimatter

00:02:44.434 --> 00:02:47.577
is a billion times higher than conventional fuel.

00:02:47.577 --> 00:02:49.895
The energy of one gram of antimatter would be enough

00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:53.245
for driving a car 1,000 times around the Earth,

00:02:53.245 --> 00:02:56.573
or to bring the space shuttle into orbit.

00:02:56.573 --> 00:03:00.874
So why don't we use antimatter for energy production?
