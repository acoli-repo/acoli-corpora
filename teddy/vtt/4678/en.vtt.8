00:03:57.788 --> 00:04:01.737
a huge amount of energy was transformed into mass,

00:04:01.737 --> 00:04:03.934
and our initial universe contained

00:04:03.934 --> 00:04:06.563
equal amounts of matter and antimatter.

00:04:06.563 --> 00:04:08.146
But just a second later,

00:04:08.146 --> 00:04:11.022
most matter and all of the antimatter

00:04:11.022 --> 00:04:12.764
had destroyed one another,

00:04:12.764 --> 00:04:15.832
producing an enormous amount of radiation

00:04:15.832 --> 00:04:18.082
that can still be observed today.

00:04:18.082 --> 00:04:20.450
Just about 100 millionths

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.120
of the original amount of matter stuck around

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.786
and no antimatter whatsoever.

00:04:25.786 --> 00:04:27.791
"Now, wait!" you might say,

00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:30.374
"Why did all the antimatter disappear
