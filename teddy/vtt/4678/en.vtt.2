00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:01.136
The magic word is &lt;i&gt;energy density&lt;/i&gt;.

00:01:01.136 --> 00:01:03.503
If you concentrate a huge amount

00:01:03.503 --> 00:01:05.548
of energy in a tiny space,

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:08.879
new particles will come into existence.

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:09.836
If we look closer,

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:13.198
we see that these particles always come in pairs,

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:14.514
like twins.

00:01:14.514 --> 00:01:17.644
That's because particles always have a counterpart,

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:19.115
an antiparticle,

00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:20.898
and these are always produced

00:01:20.898 --> 00:01:24.153
in exactly equal amounts: 50/50.

00:01:24.153 --> 00:01:25.861
This might sound like science fiction,

00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:29.365
but it's the daily life of particle accelerators.

00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:31.784
In the collisions between two protons
