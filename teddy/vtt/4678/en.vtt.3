00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:31.784
In the collisions between two protons

00:01:31.784 --> 00:01:34.035
at CERN's Large Hadron Collider,

00:01:34.035 --> 00:01:36.247
billions of particles and antiparticles

00:01:36.247 --> 00:01:38.249
are produced every second.

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:40.748
Consider, for example, the electron.

00:01:40.748 --> 00:01:44.492
It has a very small mass and negative electric charge.

00:01:44.492 --> 00:01:46.598
It's antiparticle, the positron,

00:01:46.598 --> 00:01:48.383
has exactly the same mass,

00:01:48.383 --> 00:01:51.237
but a positive electric charge.

00:01:51.237 --> 00:01:53.472
But, apart from the opposite charges,

00:01:53.472 --> 00:01:56.857
both particles are identical and perfectly stable.

00:01:56.857 --> 00:01:59.230
And the same is true for their heavy cousins,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.220
the proton and the antiproton.
