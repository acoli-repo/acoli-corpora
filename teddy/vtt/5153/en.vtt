00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:11.865
Antibiotics: behind the scenes, 
they enable much of modern medicine.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:14.485
We use them to cure infectious diseases,

00:00:14.485 --> 00:00:19.607
but also to safely facilitate everything 
from surgery to chemotherapy

00:00:19.607 --> 00:00:21.607
to organ transplants.

00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:23.170
Without antibiotics,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.858
even routine medical procedures 
can lead to life-threatening infections.

00:00:27.858 --> 00:00:30.788
And weâ€™re at risk of losing them.
