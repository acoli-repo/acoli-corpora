00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:05.686
Here's a question we need to rethink together:

00:00:05.686 --> 00:00:08.127
What should be the role of money

00:00:08.127 --> 00:00:11.613
and markets in our societies?

00:00:11.613 --> 00:00:14.107
Today, there are very few things

00:00:14.107 --> 00:00:16.795
that money can't buy.

00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:18.452
If you're sentenced to a jail term

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:20.903
in Santa Barbara, California,

00:00:20.903 --> 00:00:22.255
you should know

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:24.970
that if you don't like the standard accommodations,

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.313
you can buy a prison cell upgrade.

00:00:29.313 --> 00:00:32.159
It's true. For how much, do you think?
