From space, our planet appears
to be more ocean than Earth.

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:15.831
But despite the water covering 71%
of the planet’s surface,

00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:20.962
more than half the world’s population
endures extreme water scarcity

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.676
for at least one month a year.

00:00:23.676 --> 00:00:26.735
And current estimates predict
that by 2040,

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:31.961
up to 20 more countries could be 
experiencing water shortages.
