but of how much of it 
is accessible to us.

00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:05.920
97% of earth’s liquid is saltwater,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.505
too loaded with minerals for humans
to drink or use in agriculture.

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:14.594
Of the remaining 3% of potentially 
usable freshwater,

00:01:14.594 --> 00:01:19.073
more than two-thirds is frozen
in ice caps and glaciers.

00:01:19.073 --> 00:01:23.874
That leaves less than 1% available 
for sustaining all life on Earth,

00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:26.571
spread across our planet
in rivers, lakes,

00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:31.152
underground aquifers, ground ice
and permafrost.
