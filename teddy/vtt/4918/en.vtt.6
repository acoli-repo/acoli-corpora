00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:03.141
accounts for only 3.6% of humanity’s
water consumption.

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:07.432
Another 4.4% goes to the wide 
range of factories

00:03:07.432 --> 00:03:10.295
which make the products we buy each day.

00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:16.100
But the remaining 92% of our water
consumption is all spent on a single industry:

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.670
agriculture.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.696
Our farms drain the equivalent of
3.3 billion

00:03:21.696 --> 00:03:25.800
Olympic-sized swimming pools every year,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.583
all of it swallowed up by 
crops and livestock

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:31.566
to feed Earth’s growing population.
