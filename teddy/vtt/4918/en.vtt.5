00:02:27.943 --> 00:02:31.598
So while it’s true that our planet 
isn’t actually losing water,

00:02:31.598 --> 00:02:36.655
we are depleting the water sources
we rely on at an unsustainable pace.

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:38.232
This might seem surprising –

00:02:38.232 --> 00:02:42.690
after all, on average, people only drink 
about two liters of water a day.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.029
But water plays a hidden role in our daily
lives, and in that same 24 hours,

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:53.172
most people will actually consume
an estimated 3000 liters of water.

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:57.929
In fact, household water – which we use
to drink, cook, and clean –

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:03.141
accounts for only 3.6% of humanity’s
water consumption.
