00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:03.405
to move water across these 
regions is extremely expensive.

00:02:03.405 --> 00:02:08.097
In many of these water-poor areas, as well
as some with greater access to water,

00:02:08.097 --> 00:02:13.013
humanity is guzzling up the local water
supply faster than it can be replenished.

00:02:13.013 --> 00:02:16.570
And when more quickly renewed 
sources can’t meet the demand,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.604
we start pumping it out of our 
finite underground reserves.

00:02:20.604 --> 00:02:27.943
Of Earth’s 37 major underground reservoirs,
21 are on track to be irreversibly emptied.

00:02:27.943 --> 00:02:31.598
So while it’s true that our planet 
isn’t actually losing water,
