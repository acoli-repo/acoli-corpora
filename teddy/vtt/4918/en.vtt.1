00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:31.961
up to 20 more countries could be 
experiencing water shortages.

00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:36.233
Taken together, these bleak statistics
raise a startling question:

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:39.253
are we running out of clean water?

00:00:39.253 --> 00:00:41.512
Well yes, and no.

00:00:41.512 --> 00:00:46.534
At a planetary scale, Earth can’t run out 
of freshwater thanks to the water cycle,

00:00:46.534 --> 00:00:50.409
a system that continuously produces 
and recycles water,

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.994
morphing it from vapour, to liquid, 
to ice as it circulates around the globe.

00:00:55.994 --> 00:00:59.197
So this isn’t really a question of 
how much water there is,

00:00:59.197 --> 00:01:02.615
but of how much of it 
is accessible to us.
