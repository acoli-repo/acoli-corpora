to feed Earth’s growing population.

00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:35.718
Agriculture currently covers 37% 
of Earth’s land area,

00:03:35.718 --> 00:03:39.036
posing the biggest threat to our 
regional water supplies.

00:03:39.036 --> 00:03:41.504
And yet, it’s also a necessity.

00:03:41.504 --> 00:03:47.718
So how do we limit agriculture’s thirst
while still feeding those who rely on it?

00:03:47.718 --> 00:03:51.676
Farmers are already finding ingenious
