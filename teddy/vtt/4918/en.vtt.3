00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:31.152
underground aquifers, ground ice
and permafrost.

00:01:31.152 --> 00:01:35.764
It’s these sources of water that are being
rapidly depleted by humans,

00:01:35.764 --> 00:01:39.097
but slowly replenished 
by rain and snowfall.

00:01:39.097 --> 00:01:43.436
And this limited supply isn’t distributed
evenly around the globe.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:46.875
Diverse climates and geography
provide some regions

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:52.152
with more rainfall and natural water sources,
while other areas have geographic features

00:01:52.152 --> 00:01:55.608
that make transporting water 
much more difficult.

00:01:55.608 --> 00:01:58.695
And supplying the infrastructure 
and energy it would take

00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:03.405
to move water across these 
regions is extremely expensive.
