00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:10.829
In the late 1860s, scientists believed
they were on the verge

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:14.663
of uncovering the brainâ€™s biggest secret.

00:00:14.663 --> 00:00:18.829
They already knew the brain controlled
the body through electrical impulses.

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:22.913
The question was, how did these signals
travel through the body

00:00:22.913 --> 00:00:25.204
without changing or degrading?

00:00:25.204 --> 00:00:28.371
It seemed that perfectly transmitting 
these impulses

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:33.371
would require them to travel uninterrupted
along some kind of tissue.
