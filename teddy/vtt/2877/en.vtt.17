00:08:30.488 --> 00:08:34.673
Seven: publication and temporary
creative successes

00:08:34.697 --> 00:08:36.887
are something you have to recover from.

00:08:37.744 --> 00:08:40.586
They kill as many people as not.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.140
They will hurt, damage and change you

00:08:43.164 --> 00:08:45.278
in ways you cannot imagine.

00:08:45.707 --> 00:08:49.223
The most degraded
and evil people I've ever known

00:08:49.247 --> 00:08:52.356
are male writers who've had
huge best sellers.

00:08:53.093 --> 00:08:57.250
And yet, returning to number one,
that all truth is paradox,

00:08:57.274 --> 00:08:59.699
it's also a miracle
to get your work published,

00:08:59.723 --> 00:09:02.559
to get your stories read and heard.
