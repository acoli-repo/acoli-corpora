00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.802
So I sat down a few days
before my 61st birthday,

00:00:32.826 --> 00:00:37.487
and I decided to compile a list
of everything I know for sure.

00:00:38.017 --> 00:00:41.140
There's so little truth
in the popular culture,

00:00:41.164 --> 00:00:44.120
and it's good to be sure of a few things.

00:00:45.217 --> 00:00:48.138
For instance, I am no longer 47,

00:00:48.845 --> 00:00:51.625
although this is the age I feel,

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.266
and the age I like to think
of myself as being.

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:57.527
My friend Paul used to say in his late 70s

00:00:57.551 --> 00:01:01.134
that he felt like a young man
with something really wrong with him.
