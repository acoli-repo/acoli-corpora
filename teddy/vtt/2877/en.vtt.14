00:06:57.654 --> 00:07:00.164
one day at a time, little by little.

00:07:00.188 --> 00:07:02.414
When my older brother was in fourth grade,

00:07:02.438 --> 00:07:06.412
he had a term paper on birds
due the next day,

00:07:06.436 --> 00:07:08.716
and he hadn't started.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.822
So my dad sat down with him
with an Audubon book,

00:07:12.846 --> 00:07:15.190
paper, pencils and brads --

00:07:15.214 --> 00:07:20.814
for those of you who have gotten
a little less young and remember brads --

00:07:20.838 --> 00:07:23.668
and he said to my brother,

00:07:23.692 --> 00:07:26.302
"Just take it bird by bird, buddy.

00:07:26.326 --> 00:07:28.641
Just read about pelicans

00:07:28.665 --> 00:07:32.521
and then write about pelicans
in your own voice.
