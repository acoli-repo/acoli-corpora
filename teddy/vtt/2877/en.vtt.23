00:11:27.922 --> 00:11:30.447
but it doesn't leave you
where it found you.

00:11:30.471 --> 00:11:33.567
And grace won't look
like Casper the Friendly Ghost,

00:11:33.591 --> 00:11:35.196
regrettably.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.603
But the phone will ring
or the mail will come

00:11:37.627 --> 00:11:39.107
and then against all odds,

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:42.110
you'll get your sense of humor
about yourself back.

00:11:42.571 --> 00:11:45.890
Laughter really is carbonated holiness.

00:11:46.874 --> 00:11:49.566
It helps us breathe again and again

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.723
and gives us back to ourselves,

00:11:51.747 --> 00:11:55.484
and this gives us faith
in life and each other.

00:11:56.495 --> 00:12:00.473
And remember -- grace always bats last.
