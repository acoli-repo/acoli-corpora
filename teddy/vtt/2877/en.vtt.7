00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.773
But it's an inside job,

00:03:31.797 --> 00:03:34.615
and we can't arrange peace
or lasting improvement

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.027
for the people we love most in the world.

00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:39.131
They have to find their own ways,

00:03:39.155 --> 00:03:40.777
their own answers.

00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:44.428
You can't run alongside
your grown children

00:03:44.452 --> 00:03:49.038
with sunscreen and ChapStick
on their hero's journey.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.179
You have to release them.

00:03:51.203 --> 00:03:53.598
It's disrespectful not to.

00:03:55.088 --> 00:03:56.947
And if it's someone else's problem,

00:03:56.971 --> 00:03:59.271
you probably don't have
the answer, anyway.

00:03:59.295 --> 00:04:00.487
(Laughter)
