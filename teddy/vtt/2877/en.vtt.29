00:14:30.686 --> 00:14:34.354
They'll help you cross over
to whatever awaits us.

00:14:34.871 --> 00:14:36.608
As Ram Dass said,

00:14:36.632 --> 00:14:38.492
"When all is said and done,

00:14:38.516 --> 00:14:41.516
we're really just all walking
each other home."

00:14:43.024 --> 00:14:44.612
I think that's it,

00:14:44.636 --> 00:14:46.738
but if I think of anything else,

00:14:46.762 --> 00:14:48.224
I'll let you know.

00:14:48.248 --> 00:14:49.451
Thank you.

00:14:49.475 --> 00:14:51.054
(Applause)

00:14:51.078 --> 00:14:52.354
Thank you.

00:14:52.378 --> 00:14:54.186
(Applause)

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:56.364
I was very surprised to be asked to come,

00:14:56.388 --> 00:14:59.071
because it is not my realm,

00:14:59.095 --> 00:15:01.422
technology or design or entertainment.
