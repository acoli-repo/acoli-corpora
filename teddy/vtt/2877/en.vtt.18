WEBVTT

00:08:59.723 --> 00:09:02.559
to get your stories read and heard.

00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:05.338
Just try to bust yourself
gently of the fantasy

00:09:05.362 --> 00:09:07.816
that publication will heal you,

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.924
that it will fill the Swiss-cheesy
holes inside of you.

00:09:11.948 --> 00:09:13.542
It can't.

00:09:13.566 --> 00:09:14.926
It won't.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:16.655
But writing can.

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:20.277
So can singing in a choir
or a bluegrass band.

00:09:20.301 --> 00:09:23.608
So can painting community
murals or birding

00:09:23.632 --> 00:09:26.800
or fostering old dogs
that no one else will.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.621
Number eight: families.
