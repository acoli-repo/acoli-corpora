00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:31.925
So go outside a lot and look up.

00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:36.452
My pastor said you can trap bees
on the bottom of mason jars without lids

00:12:36.476 --> 00:12:38.189
because they don't look up,

00:12:38.213 --> 00:12:42.613
so they just walk around bitterly
bumping into the glass walls.

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:45.005
Go outside. Look up.

00:12:45.029 --> 00:12:46.396
Secret of life.

00:12:47.477 --> 00:12:49.341
And finally: death.

00:12:50.373 --> 00:12:51.653
Number 12.

00:12:52.646 --> 00:12:54.423
Wow and yikes.

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:59.600
It's so hard to bear when the few people
you cannot live without die.

00:12:59.624 --> 00:13:03.261
You'll never get over these losses,
and no matter what the culture says,
