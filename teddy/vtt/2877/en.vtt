00:00:01.042 --> 00:00:04.520
My seven-year-old grandson
sleeps just down the hall from me,

00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:06.210
and he wakes up a lot of mornings

00:00:06.234 --> 00:00:07.772
and he says,

00:00:07.796 --> 00:00:10.010
"You know, this could be
the best day ever."

00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:12.742
And other times,
in the middle of the night,

00:00:12.766 --> 00:00:15.692
he calls out in a tremulous voice,

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:18.546
"Nana, will you ever get sick and die?"

00:00:19.198 --> 00:00:23.640
I think this pretty much says it for me
and most of the people I know,

00:00:23.664 --> 00:00:26.944
that we're a mixed grill
of happy anticipation

00:00:26.968 --> 00:00:28.187
and dread.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.802
So I sat down a few days
before my 61st birthday,
