00:11:56.495 --> 00:12:00.473
And remember -- grace always bats last.

00:12:01.652 --> 00:12:04.761
Eleven: God just means goodness.

00:12:04.785 --> 00:12:07.226
It's really not all that scary.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:11.700
It means the divine or a loving,
animating intelligence,

00:12:11.724 --> 00:12:15.449
or, as we learned
from the great "Deteriorata,"

00:12:15.473 --> 00:12:17.081
"the cosmic muffin."

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.719
A good name for God is: "Not me."

00:12:21.827 --> 00:12:24.573
Emerson said that
the happiest person on Earth

00:12:24.597 --> 00:12:28.775
is the one who learns from nature
the lessons of worship.

00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:31.925
So go outside a lot and look up.
