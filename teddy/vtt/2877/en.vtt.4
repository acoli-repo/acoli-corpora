00:01:58.214 --> 00:02:04.563
So I hope that my list of things
I'm almost positive about

00:02:04.587 --> 00:02:07.652
might offer some basic
operating instructions

00:02:07.676 --> 00:02:11.323
to anyone who is feeling
really overwhelmed or beleaguered.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.022
Number one:

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:17.707
the first and truest thing
is that all truth is a paradox.

00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:22.046
Life is both a precious,
unfathomably beautiful gift,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.752
and it's impossible here,
on the incarnational side of things.

00:02:26.776 --> 00:02:28.396
It's been a very bad match

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.686
for those of us who were born
extremely sensitive.
