00:05:29.722 --> 00:05:33.133
radical self-care is quantum,

00:05:33.157 --> 00:05:36.773
and it radiates out from you
into the atmosphere

00:05:36.797 --> 00:05:38.442
like a little fresh air.

00:05:38.466 --> 00:05:41.047
It's a huge gift to the world.

00:05:41.071 --> 00:05:45.581
When people respond by saying,
"Well, isn't she full of herself,"

00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:48.571
just smile obliquely like Mona Lisa

00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:51.557
and make both of you a nice cup of tea.

00:05:52.605 --> 00:05:57.288
Being full of affection
for one's goofy, self-centered,

00:05:57.312 --> 00:05:59.805
cranky, annoying self

00:05:59.829 --> 00:06:01.358
is home.
