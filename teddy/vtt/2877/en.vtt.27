Also, the people will make
you laugh out loud

00:13:31.275 --> 00:13:34.341
at the most inconvenient times,

00:13:34.365 --> 00:13:36.439
and that's the great good news.

00:13:36.463 --> 00:13:40.918
But their absence will also be a lifelong
nightmare of homesickness for you.

00:13:40.942 --> 00:13:45.623
Grief and friends, time and tears
will heal you to some extent.

00:13:45.647 --> 00:13:49.898
Tears will bathe and baptize
and hydrate and moisturize you

00:13:49.922 --> 00:13:52.251
and the ground on which you walk.

00:13:52.275 --> 00:13:55.306
Do you know the first thing
that God says to Moses?

00:13:56.028 --> 00:13:58.522
He says, "Take off your shoes."

00:13:59.079 --> 00:14:03.119
Because this is holy ground,
all evidence to the contrary.
