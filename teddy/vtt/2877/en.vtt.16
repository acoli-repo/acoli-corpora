(Laughter)

00:08:02.836 --> 00:08:05.746
(Applause)

00:08:07.145 --> 00:08:10.018
You're going to feel like hell
if you wake up someday

00:08:10.042 --> 00:08:11.803
and you never wrote the stuff

00:08:11.827 --> 00:08:15.288
that is tugging on the sleeves
of your heart:

00:08:15.312 --> 00:08:18.708
your stories, memories,
visions and songs --

00:08:18.732 --> 00:08:20.385
your truth,

00:08:20.409 --> 00:08:22.234
your version of things --

00:08:22.258 --> 00:08:23.743
in your own voice.

00:08:23.767 --> 00:08:26.242
That's really all you have to offer us,

00:08:26.266 --> 00:08:28.720
and that's also why you were born.
