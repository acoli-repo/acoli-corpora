00:06:29.865 --> 00:06:31.230
Number six --

00:06:31.254 --> 00:06:34.758
(Laughter)

00:06:34.782 --> 00:06:36.038
writing.

00:06:36.874 --> 00:06:41.262
Every writer you know writes
really terrible first drafts,

00:06:41.286 --> 00:06:43.439
but they keep their butt in the chair.

00:06:43.463 --> 00:06:45.183
That's the secret of life.

00:06:45.207 --> 00:06:48.407
That's probably the main difference
between you and them.

00:06:48.431 --> 00:06:49.893
They just do it.

00:06:49.917 --> 00:06:52.483
They do it by prearrangement
with themselves.

00:06:52.507 --> 00:06:54.550
They do it as a debt of honor.

00:06:55.336 --> 00:06:57.630
They tell stories that come through them

00:06:57.654 --> 00:07:00.164
one day at a time, little by little.
