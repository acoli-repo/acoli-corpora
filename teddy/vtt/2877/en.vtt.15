00:07:28.665 --> 00:07:32.521
and then write about pelicans
in your own voice.

00:07:32.545 --> 00:07:35.700
And then find out about chickadees,

00:07:35.724 --> 00:07:38.495
and tell us about them in your own voice.

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:40.265
And then geese."

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:44.037
So the two most important things
about writing are: bird by bird

00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:47.167
and really god-awful first drafts.

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:49.634
If you don't know where to start,

00:07:49.658 --> 00:07:52.887
remember that every single thing
that happened to you is yours,

00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:54.427
and you get to tell it.

00:07:54.852 --> 00:07:58.014
If people wanted you to write
more warmly about them,

00:07:58.038 --> 00:07:59.758
they should've behaved better.

00:07:59.782 --> 00:08:02.812
