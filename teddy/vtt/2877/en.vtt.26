You'll never get over these losses,
and no matter what the culture says,

00:13:03.285 --> 00:13:05.152
you're not supposed to.

00:13:05.176 --> 00:13:10.319
We Christians like to think of death
as a major change of address,

00:13:10.343 --> 00:13:14.929
but in any case, the person
will live again fully in your heart

00:13:14.953 --> 00:13:16.945
if you don't seal it off.

00:13:16.969 --> 00:13:19.737
Like Leonard Cohen said,
"There are cracks in everything,

00:13:19.761 --> 00:13:21.614
and that's how the light gets in."

00:13:21.638 --> 00:13:25.216
And that's how we feel
our people again fully alive.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.251
Also, the people will make
you laugh out loud
