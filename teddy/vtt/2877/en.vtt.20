It begins with forgiving yourself,

00:10:00.605 --> 00:10:03.879

When William Blake said that we are here

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.238
to learn to endure the beams of love,

00:10:16.262 --> 00:10:19.595

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:23.313
even as you want to run screaming
for your cute little life.

00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:26.370
But I promise you are up to it.

00:10:26.394 --> 00:10:29.774
You can do it, Cinderella, you can do it,

00:10:29.798 --> 00:10:31.823
and you will be amazed.
