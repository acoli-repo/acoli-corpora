00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.110
In fact, they have about 30% less
muscle mass than other animals their size.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.400
Sloths also use less energy 
to keep themselves warm

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.281
because their body temperature
can fluctuate by about five degrees Celsius,

00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:17.023
less than a cold-blooded reptile,
but more than most mammals.

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:22.131
These physical and behavioral adaptations 
minimize the sloth's energy expenditure,

00:04:22.131 --> 00:04:24.890
or metabolic rate.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.560
Three-toed sloths have the slowest 
metabolism of any mammal.
