00:00:57.434 --> 00:01:01.633
Some ground sloths, like the megalonychid,
were cat-sized,

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:03.824
but many were massive.

00:01:03.824 --> 00:01:07.634
Jefferson's sloth, Megalonyx,
weighed about a ton,

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:10.334
and that was small 
compared to megatherium,

00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:15.157
which could reach six metric tons,
as much as an elephant.

00:01:15.157 --> 00:01:19.174
They ambled through the forests
and savannas using their strong arms

00:01:19.174 --> 00:01:20.525
and sharp claws

00:01:20.525 --> 00:01:23.394
to uproot plants and climb trees,

00:01:23.394 --> 00:01:28.695
grazing on grasses, leaves,
and prehistoric avocados.

00:01:28.695 --> 00:01:34.745
In fact, we might not have avocados
today if not for the giant sloths.
