00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.560
Three-toed sloths have the slowest 
metabolism of any mammal.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.922
The giant panda is second slowest,

00:04:32.922 --> 00:04:35.972
and two-toed sloths come in third.

00:04:35.972 --> 00:04:41.781
Moving slowly has allowed sloths
to thrive in their treetop habitat.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:46.982
But it's also made the sloths themselves
a great habitat for other organisms,

00:04:46.982 --> 00:04:54.243
including algae, which provides a little
extra camouflage, and maybe even a snack.

00:04:54.243 --> 00:04:56.922
Sloths may not be giant anymore,

00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:59.582
but that doesn't make 
them any less remarkable.
