00:02:29.576 --> 00:02:33.927
Animals extract energy from food
and use that energy to move around,

00:02:33.927 --> 00:02:35.588
maintain their body temperature,

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:36.947
keep their organs working,

00:02:36.947 --> 00:02:40.609
and all the other activities necessary
for survival.

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.748
But leaves don't contain much energy,

00:02:43.748 --> 00:02:47.498
and that which they do have
is tough to extract.

00:02:47.498 --> 00:02:51.818
Most herbivores supplement a leafy diet
with higher energy foods

00:02:51.818 --> 00:02:54.439
like fruit and seeds.

00:02:54.439 --> 00:03:01.118
But sloths, especially three-toed sloths,
rely on leaves almost exclusively.
