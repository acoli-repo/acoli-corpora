00:01:28.695 --> 00:01:34.745
In fact, we might not have avocados
today if not for the giant sloths.

00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:38.626
Smaller animals couldn't swallow
the avocado's huge seed,

00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:40.136
but the sloths could,

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:44.555
and they spread avocado trees
far and wide.

00:01:44.555 --> 00:01:47.476
Ground sloths flourished for millions
of years,

00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:51.115
but around 10,000 years ago,
they started disappearing

00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:55.674
along with the Western Hemisphere's
other giant mammals.

00:01:55.674 --> 00:01:58.816
Researchers think that ground sloths
could have been pushed out

00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:01.106
by an oncoming ice age,
