or competition with other species,
maybe humans,

00:02:04.586 --> 00:02:09.405
who arrived in the region around the time
most of the sloths went extinct.

00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:13.577
Some of the smaller sloths did survive
and migrated to the treetops.

00:02:13.577 --> 00:02:18.317
Today, there are six species left
living in the rainforest canopies

00:02:18.317 --> 00:02:21.358
of Central and South America.

00:02:21.358 --> 00:02:24.468
Hanging out in the trees is a good way
to avoid predators,

00:02:24.468 --> 00:02:27.187
and there are plenty of leaves to eat.

00:02:27.187 --> 00:02:29.576
But this diet has its drawbacks.

00:02:29.576 --> 00:02:33.927
Animals extract energy from food
and use that energy to move around,
