00:02:54.439 --> 00:03:01.118
But sloths, especially three-toed sloths,
rely on leaves almost exclusively.

00:03:01.118 --> 00:03:06.427
They've evolved finely tuned strategies
for coping with this restricted diet.

00:03:06.427 --> 00:03:12.628
First, they extract as much energy from
their food as possible.

00:03:12.628 --> 00:03:17.071
Sloths have a multi-chambered stomach
that takes up a third of their body,

00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:18.748
and depending on the species,

00:03:18.748 --> 00:03:25.098
they can spend five to seven days,
or even weeks, processing a meal.

00:03:25.098 --> 00:03:29.457
The other piece of the puzzle
is to use as little energy as possible.

00:03:29.457 --> 00:03:34.450
One way sloths do this is, of course,
by not moving very much.
