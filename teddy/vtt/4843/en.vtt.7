00:03:29.457 --> 00:03:34.450
One way sloths do this is, of course,
by not moving very much.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.959
They spend most of their time eating,
resting, or sleeping.

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.809
They descend from the canopy just once
a week for a bathroom break.

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:46.350
When sloths do move, it's not very fast.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.819
It would take a sloth about five minutes
to cross an average neighborhood street.

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:57.480
This unhurried approach to life means
that sloths don't need very much muscle.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.110
In fact, they have about 30% less
muscle mass than other animals their size.
