00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.680
Every candidate,
I send them those questions.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.456
They don't all answer. Don't get me wrong.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.256
I reckon if you're standing

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.656
to become the next president
of the United States,

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.056
you're probably pretty tied up
most of the time,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.136
so I'm not altogether surprised
that they don't all answer, but many do.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.656
More every time.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.736
And some of them do much more than answer.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.896
Some of them answer in the most
enthusiastic and most exciting way

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.136
you could imagine.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.656
I just want to say a word here
for Saviour Chishimba,

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.096
who was one of the candidates

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.376
in the recent Zambian
presidential election.
