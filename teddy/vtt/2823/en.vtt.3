00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.456
Secretary-General of the United Nations,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.416
the Brexit referendum at the end there.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.216
You select the election
that you're interested in,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.496
and you pick the candidates.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.456
These are the candidates
from the recent presidential election

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.576
in the tiny island nation
of São Tomé and Príncipe,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.976
199,000 inhabitants,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.381
off the coast of West Africa.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.016
And then you can look at the brief summary
of each of those candidates

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.536
which I dearly hope is very neutral,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.376
very informative and very succinct.
