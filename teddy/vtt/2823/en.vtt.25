00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.520
those good for our own people
and those good for everybody else.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.736
Since the US election and since Brexit

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.136
it's become more and more obvious to me

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.776
that those old distinctions
of left wing and right wing

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.096
no longer make sense.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.760
They really don't fit the pattern.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.056
What does seem to matter today

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.696
is very simple,

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.896
whether your view of the world is

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.616
that you take comfort
from looking inwards and backwards,

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:57.360
or whether, like me, you find hope
in looking forwards and outwards.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.736
That's the new politics.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.400
That's the new division that is
splitting the world right down the middle.
