00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.696
And yet, the system is so strange

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.416
because the system hasn't caught up
with this globalized reality.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.656
Only a small number of people
are allowed to vote for those leaders,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.736
even though their impact is gigantic

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.960
and almost universal.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.456
What number was it?

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.016
140 million Americans voted

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.296
for the next president
of the United States,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.255
and yet, as all of us knows,
in a few weeks time,

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.896
somebody is going to hand over
the nuclear launch codes

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.120
to Donald J. Trump.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.536
Now, if that isn't having
a potential impact on all of us,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.760
I don't know what is.
