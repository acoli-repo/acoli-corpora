WEBVTT

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.336
And we covered also the election

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.840
for the next Secretary-General
of the United Nations.

00:07:33.465 --> 00:07:35.656
We've got the ex-prime minister
of New Zealand,

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.776
who would be a wonderful
member of the team.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.296
So I think maybe those people,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.976
the glorious loser's club,
could travel around the world

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.376
wherever there's an election

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.776
and remind people
of the necessity in our modern age

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.416
of thinking a little bit outwards

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.631
and thinking of
the international consequences.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.336
So what comes next for the global vote?

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.136
Well, obviously,

00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.616
the Donald and Hillary show
is a bit of a difficult one to follow,
