00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.776
This is not a change in political systems
or a change in ideology.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.736
This is a change in culture.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.760
We, all of us, have to understand

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.656
that thinking inwards is not the solution
to the world's problems.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.656
We have to learn how to cooperate
and collaborate a great deal more

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.080
and compete just a tiny bit less.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.576
Otherwise things
are going to carry on getting bad

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.800
and they're going to get much worse,
much sooner than we anticipate.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.656
This change will only happen

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.416
if we ordinary people

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.256
tell our politicians
that things have changed.
