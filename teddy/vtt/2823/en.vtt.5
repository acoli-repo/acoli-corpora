In fact, you can't,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.576
because usually what I do
is I release the results

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.136
after the electorate in each
individual country has already voted,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.976
so there's no way that we could
interfere in that process.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.376
But more importantly,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.976
I'm not particularly interested

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.256
in the domestic issues
of individual countries.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.840
That's not what we're voting on.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.616
So what Donald J. Trump or Hillary Clinton
proposed to do for the Americans

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.656
is frankly none of our business.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.696
That's something that only
the Americans can vote on.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.256
No, in the global vote,
you're only considering one aspect of it,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.480
which is what are those leaders
going to do for the rest of us?
