00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.520
and how we can fix it.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.216
What's wrong with the world
I've already hinted at.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.976
Basically, we face
an enormous and growing number

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.176
of gigantic, existential
global challenges:

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.856
climate change, human rights abuses,

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.080
mass migration, terrorism,
economic chaos, weapons proliferation.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.256
All of these problems
which threaten to wipe us out

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.416
are by their very nature
globalized problems.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.840
No individual country has the capability
of tackling them on its own.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.496
And so very obviously
