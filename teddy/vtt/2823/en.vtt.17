00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.096
we've got presidential elections in Iran

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.320
and a dozen others.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.056
It doesn't get less important.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.679
It gets more and more important.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.176
Clearly, the global vote
is not a stand-alone project.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.679
It's not just there on its own.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.016
It has some background.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.056
It's part of a project
which I launched back in 2014,

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.640
which I call the Good Country.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.000
The idea of the Good Country
is basically very simple.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.296
It's my simple diagnosis
of what's wrong with the world

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.520
and how we can fix it.
