00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.400
is never the person who's elected
by the domestic electorate.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.560
That may be partly because
we always seem to go for the woman.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.536
But I think it may also be a sign

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.136
that the domestic electorate
is still thinking very nationally.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.296
They're still thinking very inwardly.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.816
They're still asking themselves:
What's in it for me? ...

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.936
instead of what
they should be asking today,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.720
which is, what's in it for we?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.216
But there you go.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.376
So suggestions, please, not right now,

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.400
but send me an email if you've got an idea

00:06:59.424 --> 00:07:02.700
about what we can do
with this amazing team of glorious losers.
