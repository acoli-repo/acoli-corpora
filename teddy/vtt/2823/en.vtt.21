00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.256
tell our politicians
that things have changed.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.816
We have to tell them
that the culture has changed.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.416
We have to tell them
that they've got a new mandate.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.336
The old mandate
was very simple and very single:

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.536
if you're in a position

And if in order to do
the best thing for your own people,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.216

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.976
That's considered to be a bit macho.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.376
Today, I think everybody
in a position of power and responsibility

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.016
has got a dual mandate,

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.016
which says if you're in a position
of power and responsibility,
