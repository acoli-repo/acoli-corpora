00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.400
That's the new division that is
splitting the world right down the middle.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.696
Now, that may sound judgmental,
but it's not meant to be.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.656
I don't at all misunderstand

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.800
why so many people find their comfort
in looking inwards and backwards.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.056
When times are difficult,
when you're short of money,

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.176
when you're feeling
insecure and vulnerable,

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.696
it's almost a natural
human tendency to turn inwards,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.736
to think of your own needs

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.856
and to discard everybody else's,

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.616
and perhaps to start to imagine
that the past was somehow better

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.040
than the present or the future
could ever be.
