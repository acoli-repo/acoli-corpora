00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.376
in the recent Zambian
presidential election.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.936
His answers to those two questions
were basically an 18-page dissertation

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.616
on his view of Zambia's
potential role in the world

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.656
and in the international community.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.120
I posted it on the website
so anybody could read it.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.240
Now, Saviour won the global vote,

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.840
but he didn't win the Zambian election.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.696
So I found myself wondering,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.656
what am I going to do
with this extraordinary group of people?

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.536
I've got some wonderful people here
who won the global vote.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.256
We always get it wrong, by the way.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.496
The one that we elect

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.400
is never the person who's elected
by the domestic electorate.
