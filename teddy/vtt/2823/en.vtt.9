Similarly, the election
for the referendum on the Brexit vote,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.616
a small number of millions
of British people voted on that,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.336
but the outcome of the vote,
whichever way it went,

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.056
would have had a significant impact

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.496
on the lives of tens, hundreds of millions
of people around the world.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.400
And yet, only a tiny number could vote.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.440
What kind of democracy is that?

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.336
Huge decisions that affect all of us

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.216
being decided by relatively
very small numbers of people.
