00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.616
the Donald and Hillary show
is a bit of a difficult one to follow,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.576
but there are some other
really important elections coming up.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.416
In fact, they seem to be multiplying.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.576
There's something going on,
I'm sure you've noticed, in the world.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.840
And the next row of elections
are all critically important.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.776
In just a few day's time

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.856
we've got the rerun
of the Austrian presidential election,

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.656
with the prospect of Norbert Hofer

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.656
becoming what is commonly described

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.160
as the first far-right head of state
in Europe since the Second World War.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.696
Next year we've got Germany,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.936
we've got France,

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.096
we've got presidential elections in Iran
