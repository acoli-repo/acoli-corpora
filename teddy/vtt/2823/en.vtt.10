00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.216
being decided by relatively
very small numbers of people.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.576
And I don't know about you,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.760
but I don't think
that sounds very democratic.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.136
So I'm trying to clear it up.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.616
But as I say,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.496
we don't ask about domestic questions.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.576
In fact, I only ever ask two questions
of all of the candidates.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.096
I send them the same
two questions every single time.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.536
I say, one,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.696
if you get elected, what are you
going to do for the rest of us,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.136
for the remainder of the seven billion
who live on this planet?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.096
Second question:

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.336
What is your vision
for your country's future in the world?

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.920
What role do you see it playing?
