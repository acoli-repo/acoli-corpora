00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.296
For the first time in history,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.056
it lets anybody, anywhere in the world,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.080
vote in the elections
of other people's countries.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.326
Now, why would you do that?

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.736
What's the point?

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.096
Well, let me show you what it looks like.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.520
You go to a website,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.086
rather a beautiful website,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.656
and then you select an election.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.720
Here's a bunch that we've already covered.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.096
We do about one a month, or thereabouts.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.936
So you can see Bulgaria,
the United States of America,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.456
Secretary-General of the United Nations,
