00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.496
And so very obviously

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.136
we have to cooperate
and we have to collaborate as nations

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.018
if we're going to solve these problems.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.920
It's so obvious, and yet we don't.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.760
We don't do it nearly often enough.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.216
Most of the time,
countries still persist in behaving

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.896
as if they were warring, selfish tribes
battling against each other,

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.656
much as they have done
since the nation-state was invented

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.256
hundreds of years ago.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.416
And this has got to change.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.776
This is not a change in political systems
or a change in ideology.
