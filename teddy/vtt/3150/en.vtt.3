I noticed that they would wear
their dancing skirts

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.216
and shake their waists off,

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.016
singing, clapping, ululating,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.320
while the men filled up
the rhythm section.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.136
A few years later, I came to understand

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.056
what tradition and culture meant,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.256
and what was considered taboo

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.480
or otherwise.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.240
In the majority of African cultures,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.776
women have been forbidden
to play drums and percussion

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.280
for a very long time.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.256
I believe this taboo stems from
the psychological and traditional belief
