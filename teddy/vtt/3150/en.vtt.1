00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.376
laughter,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.936
the wind howling

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.720
and even crickets chirping.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.816
All these sounds crisscrossed
into each other,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.680
and I would hear rhythm in between.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.016
Then I would beat my plate with a spoon
and my chest with my tiny hands

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.080
trying to recreate what I was hearing.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.496
I have been beating the same plates,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.456
shakers, drums, pans
and so much more ever since

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.816
to become a professional drummer

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.040
and percussionist.
