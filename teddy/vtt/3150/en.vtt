00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.576
"Listen.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.800
Do you hear that?"

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.040
my grandmother asked me.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.536
"Listen.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.600
Listen to what the beetle is saying."

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.296
I would spend hours and hours
listening to the little beetle

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.816
rolling a huge ball of dung,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.376
and while at it,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.960
I heard a variety of environmental sounds.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.936
With the keenest of ears,
I would hear family chatter,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.376
laughter,
