Drumming has essentially represented
the strong African heritage,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.896
and its importance can be seen

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.040
in the many aspects
of the African tradition.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.216
Many communities encompass drumming
in their day-to-day activities,

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.176
and still do up to date,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.296
from childbirths to initiation ceremonies,

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.296
welcoming ceremonies,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.240
marriages and even burials.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.016
However, this same drum

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.536
is disappearing very fast
from the music scene,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.536
and the traditional genre
is losing its popularity
