But after I graduated from college

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.256
and got a graduate degree,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.800
I found myself moving
from one less ideal job to another.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.016
Maybe it was the optimism
that I had about America

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.936
that made me take a while to understand

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.216
that things were not going to change.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.136

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.056
was actually just slightly ajar --

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.016
this door of America

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.136
that would open wide
if you had the right name,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.776
the right skin color,
