00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.200
changed the immigration landscape
for decades to come.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.816
My city, New York City,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.216
was reeling and healing,

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.616
and in the midst of it,

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.440
we were in an election cycle.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.896
Two things happened

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.600
as we coped with loss and recovery
in New York City.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.400
Voters elected Michael Bloomberg
mayor of New York City.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.776
We also adopted by ballot referendum

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.800
the Office of Immigrant Affairs
for the City of New York.
