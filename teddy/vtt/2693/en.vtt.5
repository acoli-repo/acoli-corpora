00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.840
In that work, I became and advocate
for South Asians and other immigrants.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.600
I lobbied members of Congress
on policy issues.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.920
I volunteered on election day
to do exit polling.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.800
But I couldn't vote,
and I couldn't run for office.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.816
So in 2000, when it was announced

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.656
that the citizenship application fee
was going to more than double

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.376
from 95 dollars to 225 dollars,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.560
I decided it was time to apply
before I could no longer afford it.
