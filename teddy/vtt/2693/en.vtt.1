00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.296
My revised dream
led me to the work I do today:

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.256
training immigrants
to run for public office

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.440
and leading a movement
for inclusive democracy.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.456
But I don't want you to think
it was a cakewalk,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.760
that America opened its arms wide
and welcomed me.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.840
It's still not doing that.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.256
And I've learned
a few lessons along the way

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.896
that I wanted to share with you,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.896
because I think that together

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.616
we can make American democracy

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.280
better and stronger.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.976
I was born in India,
