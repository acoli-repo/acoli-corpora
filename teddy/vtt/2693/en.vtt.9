00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.800
the Office of Immigrant Affairs
for the City of New York.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.360
Five months after that election,

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.920
the newly elected mayor

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.896
appointed me the first Commissioner
of Immigrant Affairs

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.200
for this newly established office.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.320
I want you to come back to that time.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.800
I was a young immigrant woman from Belize.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.296
I had basically floundered
in various jobs in America

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.856
before I started
a community-based organization

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.080
in a church basement in Queens.
