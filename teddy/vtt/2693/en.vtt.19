there has never been a Latino
on the city council until this year.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:37.496
Three newly elected Latinas
joined the Yakima City Council in 2016.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.216
One of them is Carmen Méndez.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.976
She is a first-generation college student.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.816
She grew up partly in Colima, Mexico,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.256
and partly in Yakima, Washington.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.720
She's a single mother,
a community advocate.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.016
Her voice on the Yakima City Council

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.616
is advocating on behalf
of the Latino community

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.896
and of all Yakima residents.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.496
And she's a role model for her daughter
