00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.016
I joined hundreds of other immigrants

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.176
in a hall in Brooklyn

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.536
where we pledged our loyalty

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.216
to a country that we had
long considered home.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.856
My journey from international student
to American citizen took 16 years,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.200
a short timeline when you compare it
to other immigrant stories.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.176
And soon after I had taken
that formal step

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.136
to becoming an American,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.016
the attacks of September 11, 2001,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.200
changed the immigration landscape
for decades to come.
