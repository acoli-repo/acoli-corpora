00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.976
I was born in India,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.976
the world's largest democracy,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.256
and when I was four,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.096

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.136
And at the age of 17,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.016
I moved to the United States,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.600

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.616
and I thought, why not make a living
doing that as an adult?

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.096
