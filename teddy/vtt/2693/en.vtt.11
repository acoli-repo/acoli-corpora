00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.600
And here are two things I learned
when I became Commissioner.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.056
First, well-meaning New Yorkers

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.216
who were in city government
holding government positions

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.720
had no idea how scared immigrants were

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.920
of law enforcement.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.056
Most of us don't really know
the difference, do we,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.440
between a sheriff
and local police and the FBI.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.896
And most of us,
when we see someone in uniform

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.816
going through our neighborhoods

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.240
feel curiosity, if not concern.
