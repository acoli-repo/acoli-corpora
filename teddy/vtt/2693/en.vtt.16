it doesn't just matter who can vote,
it matters who does vote.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.856
So in 2012, half of the Latino
and Asian-American voters

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.120
did not vote.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.696
And these votes matter
not just in presidential elections.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.800
They matter in local and state elections.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.456
In 2015, Lan Diep,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.800
the eldest son of political
refugees from Vietnam,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.320
ran for a seat
in the San Jose City Council.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.640
He lost that election by 13 votes.
