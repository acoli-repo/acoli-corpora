00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.216
to introduce new issues
into the policy debate

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.136
and to change the face
of the pale, male, stale leadership

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.960
that we have in our country today.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.176
So how do we do that?

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.776
Well, let's talk first about votes.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.456
It will come as no surprise to you

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.240
that the majority of voters
in America are white.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.936
But it might surprise you to know

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.000
that one in three voters
are black, Latino or Asian.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.376
But here's the thing:

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.680
it doesn't just matter who can vote,
it matters who does vote.
