00:01:56.115 --> 00:02:00.617
which is: wind and pollution are driving
marginalized communities to the east.

00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:04.395
The dominant logic of the industrial era

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:06.156
is about disparity.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.687
It's about haves and have-nots,
and that's become part of our culture.

00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:12.141
That's why you know exactly
what I'm talking about

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:15.014
if I tell you someone's
from the "wrong side of the tracks."

00:02:15.038 --> 00:02:19.387
That phrase comes from the direction
that wind would blow dirty train smoke --

00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:21.549
to the east, usually.

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:25.863
I'm not saying every single community
in the east is on the margin,

00:02:25.887 --> 00:02:28.188
or every community
on the margin is in the east,

00:02:28.212 --> 00:02:32.727
but I'm trying to make a bigger point
about disparity by design.
