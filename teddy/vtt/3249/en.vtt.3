00:01:27.948 --> 00:01:30.062
not just in the US,
but all around the world:

00:01:30.086 --> 00:01:33.328
East London; the east side
of Paris is this way;

00:01:33.352 --> 00:01:34.502
East Jerusalem.

00:01:34.998 --> 00:01:37.657
Even down the street from
where we're sitting right now,

00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:40.069
the marginalized community
is East Vancouver.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.339
I'm not the only one to notice this.

00:01:42.363 --> 00:01:44.656
I nerded on this hard, for years.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.060
And I finally found a group
of economic historians in the UK

00:01:48.084 --> 00:01:51.649
who modeled industrial-era
smokestack dispersion.

00:01:51.673 --> 00:01:54.109
And they came to the same
conclusion mathematically

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:56.091
that I'd come to as an anthropologist,

00:01:56.115 --> 00:02:00.617
which is: wind and pollution are driving
marginalized communities to the east.
