00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:31.859
And even if you don't know East Palo Alto,

00:00:31.883 --> 00:00:34.145
you might know the story
of eastside disparity,

00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:38.364
whether it's the separation
of the railroad tracks in East Pittsburgh

00:00:38.388 --> 00:00:41.283
or the Grosse Pointe Gate in East Detroit

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:44.241
or East St. Louis,
East Oakland, East Philly.

00:00:44.903 --> 00:00:49.732
Why is it that communities on the social,
economic and environmental margin

00:00:49.756 --> 00:00:52.327
tend to be on the east sides of places?

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:54.872
Turns out,

00:00:54.896 --> 00:00:56.049
it's the wind.

00:00:57.211 --> 00:00:59.307
If you look at the Earth
from the North Pole,

00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:01.559
you'd see that it rotates
counterclockwise.
