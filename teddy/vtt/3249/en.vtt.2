00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:01.559
you'd see that it rotates
counterclockwise.

00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.143
The impact of this

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:06.292
is that the winds in the northern
and the southern hemispheres

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:09.390
blow in the same direction
as the rotation of the Earth --

00:01:09.414 --> 00:01:10.580
to the east.

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:12.031
A way to think about this is:

00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:14.019

00:01:14.043 --> 00:01:17.224
You've got to seat 10 people,
you've got to keep everyone warm.

00:01:17.248 --> 00:01:21.377
The question is: Who sits with
the smoky wind blowing in their face?

00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:22.819
And the answer is:

00:01:22.843 --> 00:01:24.131
people with less power.

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.924
This campfire dynamic
is what's playing out in cities,

00:01:27.948 --> 00:01:30.062
not just in the US,
but all around the world:
