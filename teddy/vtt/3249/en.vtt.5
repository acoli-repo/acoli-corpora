00:02:28.212 --> 00:02:32.727
but I'm trying to make a bigger point
about disparity by design.

00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:35.964
So if you find yourself
talking about any cardinal direction

00:02:35.988 --> 00:02:38.787
of a freeway, a river, some train tracks,

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.544
you're talking about
an eastside community.

00:02:42.776 --> 00:02:46.020
Now, the wind is obviously
a natural phenomenon.

00:02:46.044 --> 00:02:50.061
But the human design decisions
that we make to separate ourselves

00:02:50.085 --> 00:02:51.235
is not natural.

00:02:52.502 --> 00:02:56.311
Consider the fact that every
eastside community in the United States

00:02:56.335 --> 00:02:59.468
was built during the era
of legal segregation.

00:02:59.974 --> 00:03:03.633
We clearly weren't even trying to design
for the benefit of everyone,
