00:05:59.633 --> 00:06:02.475
But the fundamental question is:
What are we designing for?

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:05.046
More haves and have-nots? More disparity?

00:06:05.963 --> 00:06:07.423
Or parity,

00:06:07.447 --> 00:06:09.044
the choice to come together.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.890
Because the reality is,
this is not the industrial era.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.013
We don't live in the era
of legal segregation.

00:06:20.112 --> 00:06:23.951
So the punchline is,
there is no wrong side of the tracks.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.214
And all I'm saying is,

00:06:26.238 --> 00:06:30.771
we should design our economy
and our communities with that in mind.
