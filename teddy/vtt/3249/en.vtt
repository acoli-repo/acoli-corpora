00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:03.554
I came to talk about first principles

00:00:03.578 --> 00:00:05.738
and communities that I love --

00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:08.164
especially East Palo Alto, California,

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:10.959
which is full of amazing people.

00:00:11.588 --> 00:00:14.595
It's also a community
that's oddly separated

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.905
by the 101 freeway
that runs through Silicon Valley.

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:21.294
On the west side of the freeway
in Palo Alto are the "haves,"

00:00:21.318 --> 00:00:23.443
on just about any dimension
you can think of:

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:25.601
education, income, access to water.

00:00:26.165 --> 00:00:29.417
On the east side of the freeway
are the "have-nots."

00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:31.859
And even if you don't know East Palo Alto,
