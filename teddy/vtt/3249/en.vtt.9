00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:31.783
we have to start with the commitment
to design for the benefit of everyone.

00:04:31.807 --> 00:04:33.783
So, remember the campfire metaphor.

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:37.228
If we want to benefit everyone,
maybe we just sit in a horseshoe,

00:04:37.252 --> 00:04:39.452
so nobody gets the smoke in their face.

00:04:40.116 --> 00:04:42.139
I've got to make a note
to the gentrifiers,

00:04:42.163 --> 00:04:44.290
because the point
of this image is not to say

00:04:44.314 --> 00:04:48.084
you get to roll into eastside communities
and just move people out of the way,

00:04:48.108 --> 00:04:49.298
because you don't.

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:50.678
(Applause)

00:04:50.702 --> 00:04:52.402
But the point is,

00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:55.926
if you start with this first principle
of benefiting everyone,

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.601
then elegant solutions may become
more obvious than you assume.
