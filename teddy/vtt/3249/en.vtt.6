00:02:59.974 --> 00:03:03.633
We clearly weren't even trying to design
for the benefit of everyone,

00:03:03.657 --> 00:03:06.561
so we ended up dealing
with issues like redlining.

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:09.411
This is where the government
literally created maps

00:03:09.435 --> 00:03:11.807
to tell bankers where they shouldn't lend.

00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:13.855
These are some of those actual maps.

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.276
And you'll notice how
the red tends to be clustered

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.566
on the east sides of these cities.

00:03:20.038 --> 00:03:24.186
Those financial design decisions
became a self-fulfilling prophecy:

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.179
no loans turned
into low property tax base

00:03:27.203 --> 00:03:32.149
and that bled into worse schools
and a less well-prepared workforce,
