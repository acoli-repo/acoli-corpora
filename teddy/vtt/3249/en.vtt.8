Collectively, this list of harms

00:04:01.365 --> 00:04:04.805
is the artifact of our more
primitive selves.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.506
I don't think this is how
we'd want to be remembered,

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.561
but this is basically
what we've been doing

00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:12.963
to eastside communities
for the last century.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:16.653
The good news is,
it doesn't have to be this way.

00:04:17.514 --> 00:04:19.832
We got ourselves into
this eastside dilemma

00:04:19.856 --> 00:04:21.034
through bad design,

00:04:21.058 --> 00:04:23.199
and so we can get out of it
with good design.

00:04:23.854 --> 00:04:27.625
And I believe the first principle
of good design is actually really simple:

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:31.783
we have to start with the commitment
to design for the benefit of everyone.
