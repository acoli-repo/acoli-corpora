00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Even though they were imprisoned in this Garden of Eden

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
with figs and everything else.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
He felt like they felt manipulated.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So he got rid of the electricity,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
he got rid of current on the inside

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and kept it on the outside,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
so it would protect them against coyotes and other predators.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Now, what happened?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
They ate, and he showed me on a chart,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
how they ate about 20 percent more feed to feed their livers.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
The landscape is incredible.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I mean, his farm is incredible.
