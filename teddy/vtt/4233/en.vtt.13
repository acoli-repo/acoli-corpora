00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
The fence -- like this conception of fence that we have

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
it's totally backward with him.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The electricity on this fiberglass fence

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
is only on the outside.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
He rewired it. He invented it.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I've never seen it. Have you?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
You fence in animals. You electrify the inside.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
He doesn't.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
He electrifies only the outside.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Why?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Because he said to me that he felt like the geese --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and he proved this actually, not just a conceit, he proved this --

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
the geese felt manipulated when they were imprisoned in their little paddocks.
