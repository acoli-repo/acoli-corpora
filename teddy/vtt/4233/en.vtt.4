So several months ago, a friend of mine sent me this link to this guy,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Eduardo Sousa.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Eduardo is doing what he calls natural foie gras.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Natural foie gras.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
What's natural about foie gras?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
To take advantage of when the temperature drops in the fall,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
geese and ducks gorge on food

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
to prepare for the harsh realities of winter.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And the rest of the year they're free to roam around Eduardo's land
