00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I went to Spain a few months ago

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I had the best foie gras of my life.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The best culinary experience of my life.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Because what I saw, I'm convinced, is the future of cooking.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Ridiculous, right?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Foie gras and the future of cooking.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
There's not a food today that's more maligned than foie gras, right?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I mean, it's crucified.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It was outlawed in Chicago for a while.
