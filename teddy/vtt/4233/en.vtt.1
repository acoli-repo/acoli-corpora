It's pending here in California, and just recently in New York.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It's like if you're a chef and you put it on your menu,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
you risk being attacked.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Really, it happened here in San Francisco to a famous chef.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm not saying that there's not a rationale

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
for being opposed to foie gras.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The reasons usually just boil down to the gavage, which is the force feeding.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Basically you take a goose or a duck

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and you force feed a ton of grain down its throat.
