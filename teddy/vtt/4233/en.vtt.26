00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
It was sweet, it was unctuous.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
It had all the qualities of foie gras,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
but its fat had a lot of integrity and a lot of honesty.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And you could taste herbs, you could taste spices.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And I kept -- I said, you know, I swear to God I tasted star anise.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I was sure of it.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And I'm not like some super taster, you know?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
But I can taste things.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
There's 100 percent star anise in there.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And he says, "No."

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And I ended up like going down the spices,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and finally, it was like, OK, salt and pepper,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
thinking he's salted and peppered his liver.
