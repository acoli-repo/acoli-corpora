00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
is this guy for real? Is he making some of this up?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Is he like, you know -- because he seemed to have an answer for everything,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and it was always nature.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
It was never him.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And I was like, you know, I always get a little, like,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
weirded out by people who deflect everything away from themselves.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Because, really, they want you to look at themselves, right?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
But he deflected everything away from his ingenuity

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
into working with his landscape.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
So it's like, here I am, I'm on the fence about this guy,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
but increasingly, eating up his every word.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And we're sitting there, and I hear [clapping] from a distance, so I look over.
