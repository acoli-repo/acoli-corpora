when Eduardo won the Coup de Coeur,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
the coveted French gastronomic prize.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It's like the Olympics of food products.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
He placed first for his foie gras.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Big, big problem.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
As he said to me, that really pissed the French off.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
(Laughter)

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
He said it sort of gleefully.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
It was all over the papers.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I read about it. It was in Le Monde.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
"Spanish chef accused ... " -- and the French accused him.
