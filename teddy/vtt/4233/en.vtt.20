00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And we're sitting there, and I hear [clapping] from a distance, so I look over.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And he grabs my arm and the translator's,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and ducks us under a bush and says, "Watch this."

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
"Shush," he says again for the 500th time to me.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
"Shush, watch this."

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And this squadron of geese come over.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000
[Clapping]

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And they're getting louder, louder, louder, like really loud, right over us.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And like airport traffic control, as they start to go past us

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
they're called back -- and they're called back and back and back.
