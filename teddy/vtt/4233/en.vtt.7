00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
"Spanish chef accused ... " -- and the French accused him.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
"Spanish chef accused of cheating."

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
They accused him of paying off the judges.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
They implicated actually, the Spanish government, amazingly.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Huh, amazing.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
A huge scandal for a few weeks.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Couldn't find a shred of evidence.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Now, look at the guy.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
He doesn't look like a guy who's paying off French judges

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
for his foie gras.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So that died down, and very soon afterward,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
new controversy.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
He shouldn't win because it's not foie gras.
