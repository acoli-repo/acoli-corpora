And he says, "No, no, no.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
They've come to stay."

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
They've come to stay?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000

Their DNA is to find the conditions that are conducive to life.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
To happiness.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
They find it here.
