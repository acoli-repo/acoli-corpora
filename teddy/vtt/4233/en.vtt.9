00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
That is, until I went to Eduardo's farm in Extremadura,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
50 miles north of Seville, right on the Portugal border.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I saw first-hand a system that is incredibly complex

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and then at the same time, like everything beautiful in nature,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
is utterly simple.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And he said to me, really from the first moment,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
my life's work is to give the geese what they want.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
He repeated that about 50 times in the two days I was with him.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I'm just here to give the geese what they want.
