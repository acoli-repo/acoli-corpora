he answered me directly and he said, "Because chefs don't deserve my foie gras."

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
(Laughter)

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And he was right.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
He was right.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Chefs take foie gras and they make it their own.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
They create a dish

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
With Eduardo it's about the expression of nature.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And as he said, I think fittingly,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
it's a gift from God, with God saying, you've done good work.
