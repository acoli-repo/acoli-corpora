00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I finally got to taste it before I left.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
He took me to his neighborhood restaurant

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and he served me some of his foie gras, confit de foie gras.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
It was incredible.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And the problem with saying that, of course, is that

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
you know, at this point it risks hyperbole really easily.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And I'd like to make a metaphor, but I don't have one really.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I was drinking this guy's Kool-Aid so much,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
he could have served me goose feathers and I would have been like,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
this guy's a genius, you know?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I'm really in love with him at this point.
