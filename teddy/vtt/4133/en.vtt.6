00:02:59.364 --> 00:03:01.524
you can see that the river looked like

00:03:01.524 --> 00:03:03.785
a river of trash.

00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:06.017
Instead, what we proposed is to make

00:03:06.017 --> 00:03:08.375
the plaza entirely pedestrian,

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:11.278
to cover it with recycled leather canopies,

00:03:11.278 --> 00:03:15.030
and to connect it to the banks of the river.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.914
The second site of intervention

00:03:16.914 --> 00:03:19.920
is also an urban void along the river banks,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.267
and it used to be an illegal parking,

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:23.722
and we proposed to transform it

00:03:23.722 --> 00:03:26.797
into the first playground in the medina.

00:03:26.797 --> 00:03:30.525
The playground is constructed using recycled tires
