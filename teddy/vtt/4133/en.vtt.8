00:03:58.874 --> 00:04:02.126
It was for us to take our design ego

00:04:02.126 --> 00:04:03.602
and our sense of authorship

00:04:03.602 --> 00:04:05.736
and put it in the backseat

00:04:05.736 --> 00:04:08.245
and to focus mainly on being activists

00:04:08.245 --> 00:04:10.150
and on trying to coalesce

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.441
all of the agendas of stakeholders

00:04:12.441 --> 00:04:15.264
and focus on the main goals of the project:

00:04:15.264 --> 00:04:17.796
that is, to uncover the river, treat its water,

00:04:17.796 --> 00:04:19.790
and provide public spaces for all.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.282
We were actually very lucky,

00:04:21.282 --> 00:04:23.825
and many of those goals happened

00:04:23.825 --> 00:04:25.418
or are in the process of happening.

00:04:25.418 --> 00:04:27.478
Like, you can see here in the Rcif Plaza.

00:04:27.478 --> 00:04:30.169
This is how it looked like about six years ago.
