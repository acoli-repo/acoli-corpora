I would like to share with you today

00:00:02.306 --> 00:00:04.460
a project that has changed how I approach

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.371
and practice architecture:

00:00:06.371 --> 00:00:09.299
the Fez River Rehabilitation Project.

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.640
My hometown of Fez, Morocco,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.307
boasts one of the largest walled
medieval cities in the world,

00:00:15.307 --> 00:00:18.036
called the medina, nestled in a river valley.

00:00:18.046 --> 00:00:21.634
The entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

00:00:21.634 --> 00:00:25.610
Since the 1950s, as the
population of the medina grew,

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.530
basic urban infrastructure

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.460
such as green open spaces and sewage
