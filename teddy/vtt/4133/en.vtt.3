00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.535
before entering the medina is pretty healthy.

00:01:31.535 --> 00:01:33.830
Then pollution takes its toll,

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.249
mainly due to untreated sewage

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:39.900
and chemical dumping from crafts such as tanning.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.950
At some point, I couldn't bear

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.605
the desecration of the river,

00:01:43.605 --> 00:01:46.335
such an important part of my city,

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:47.986
and I decided to take action,

00:01:47.986 --> 00:01:50.321
especially after I heard that the city

00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:53.415
received a grant to divert sewage water

00:01:53.415 --> 00:01:55.035
and to treat it.

00:01:55.035 --> 00:01:56.992
With clean water, suddenly

00:01:56.992 --> 00:01:59.467
the uncovering of the river became possible,

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:02.347
and with luck and actually a lot of pushing,
