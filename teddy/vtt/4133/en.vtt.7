00:03:26.797 --> 00:03:30.525
The playground is constructed using recycled tires

00:03:30.525 --> 00:03:33.360
and also is coupled with a constructed wetland

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.790
that not only cleans the water of the river

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.381
but also retains it when floods occur.

00:03:39.381 --> 00:03:42.412
As the project progressed and
received several design awards,

00:03:42.412 --> 00:03:44.680
new stakeholders intervened

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.458
and changed the project goals and design.

00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:51.240
The only way for us to be able to bring

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.532
the main goals of the project ahead

00:03:54.532 --> 00:03:56.962
was for us to do something very unusual

00:03:56.962 --> 00:03:58.874
that usually architects don't do.

00:03:58.874 --> 00:04:02.126
It was for us to take our design ego
