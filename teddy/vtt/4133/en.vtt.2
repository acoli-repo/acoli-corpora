00:00:58.072 --> 00:01:01.921
Unfortunately, because of the pollution of the river,

00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:04.357
it has been covered little by little

00:01:04.357 --> 00:01:07.431
by concrete slabs since 1952.

00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:10.859
This process of erasure was coupled

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:12.895
with the destruction of many houses

00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:14.387
along the river banks

00:01:14.387 --> 00:01:16.376
to be able to make machineries

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:21.040
enter the narrow pedestrian network of the medina.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.335
Those urban voids quickly became illegal parking

00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:26.291
or trash yards.

00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:28.260
Actually, the state of the river

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.535
before entering the medina is pretty healthy.
