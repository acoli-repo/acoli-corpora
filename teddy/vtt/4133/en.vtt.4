00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:02.347
and with luck and actually a lot of pushing,

00:02:02.347 --> 00:02:04.563
my partner Takako Tajima and I

00:02:04.563 --> 00:02:08.194
were commissioned by the city to
work with a team of engineers

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:10.302
to uncover the river.

00:02:10.302 --> 00:02:12.257
However, we were sneaky,

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:13.574
and we proposed more:

00:02:13.574 --> 00:02:18.250
to convert riverbanks into pedestrian pathways,

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.210
and then to connect these pathways

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.853
back to the city fabric,

00:02:21.853 --> 00:02:24.406
and finally to convert the urban voids

00:02:24.406 --> 00:02:27.837
along the riverbanks into public spaces

00:02:27.837 --> 00:02:30.187
that are lacking in the Medina of Fez.
