00:04:27.478 --> 00:04:30.169
This is how it looked like about six years ago.

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.251
This is how it looks like today.

00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:33.983
It's still under construction,

00:04:33.983 --> 00:04:35.480
but actually it is heavily used

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.123
by the local population.

00:04:37.123 --> 00:04:39.946
And finally, this is how the Rcif Plaza will look like

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.831
when the project is completed.

00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:45.829
This is the river, covered, used as a trash yard.

00:04:45.829 --> 00:04:47.651
Then after many years of work,

00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:50.385
the river with clean water, uncovered.

00:04:50.385 --> 00:04:52.410
And finally, you can see here the river

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.851
when the project will be completed.

00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:57.292
So for sure, the Fez River Rehabilitation

00:04:57.292 --> 00:04:59.710
will keep on changing and adapting

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.938
to the sociopolitical landscape of the city,
