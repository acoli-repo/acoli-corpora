Largely due to its pronatal policies

00:09:31.934 --> 00:09:34.149
that actually kept women in the workforce.

00:09:34.173 --> 00:09:37.931
I'm talking about subsidized daycare
and paid maternal leave.

00:09:38.614 --> 00:09:41.646
China and Japan, thank God,
are finally wisening up

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.075
and proposing such policies.

00:09:43.099 --> 00:09:44.249
This is great.

00:09:44.797 --> 00:09:47.842
That being said, I know
some of you have listened to me

00:09:47.866 --> 00:09:50.972
and you still think the best investment
we can make in the future

00:09:50.996 --> 00:09:52.451
is not having babies.

00:09:53.025 --> 00:09:54.342
I respect that.

00:09:54.366 --> 00:09:55.858
I get where you're coming from.

00:09:55.882 --> 00:10:00.797
And I know many of you in this audience
want to have babies
