00:07:56.022 --> 00:08:00.918
Let's take the DeLorean to my motherland,
the United States of America,

00:08:00.942 --> 00:08:06.449
where the birth rate
hit its historic low in 2017.

00:08:06.473 --> 00:08:11.338
The United States is the most expensive
country in the world

00:08:11.362 --> 00:08:12.512
to give birth.

00:08:13.196 --> 00:08:14.926
If you do not have insurance,

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:18.339
it will cost you 32,000 dollars
to have a baby,

00:08:18.363 --> 00:08:20.410
if everything goes perfectly.

00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:23.902
That's like buying a brand new
Honda Odyssey minivan, OK?

00:08:24.339 --> 00:08:26.323
So, congratulations, you just had a baby,

00:08:26.347 --> 00:08:29.221
but the baby's economic productivity
is zero, and guess what?

00:08:29.245 --> 00:08:32.600
The United States is the only
industrialized country in the world
