00:09:55.882 --> 00:10:00.797
And I know many of you in this audience
want to have babies

00:10:00.821 --> 00:10:02.971
but you are terrified about the future.

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:05.345
And as a parent, I feel you.

00:10:06.304 --> 00:10:07.870
I'm scared about the future.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.653
I wrote that last line a month ago.

00:10:11.117 --> 00:10:13.887
But it really hit home
three days ago for me,

00:10:13.911 --> 00:10:15.831
while I was at TED.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.320
Three days ago, my wife calls me, crying.

00:10:20.344 --> 00:10:22.011
I pick it up in my hotel room.

00:10:22.035 --> 00:10:24.423
And she said, "I'm calling
from the hospital."

00:10:24.447 --> 00:10:26.466
We had to take my baby daughter Nusayba,

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.434
who was named after a warrior princess,

00:10:28.458 --> 00:10:31.379
to the hospital, because she found
a bump on the stomach.
