As all of us get older, and live longer,

00:03:01.231 --> 00:03:04.037
there's going to be a shrinking
younger population,

00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:06.316
which is going to lead
to rising labor shortages

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.950
in the world's biggest economies.

00:03:07.974 --> 00:03:10.862
I'm talking about United States,
China, Japan, Germany.

00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:13.799
Fewer younger working people
means less tax revenue.

00:03:13.823 --> 00:03:16.537
Less tax revenue
means less money and resources

00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:19.807
to go to safety net programs
that all of us are going to depend upon.

00:03:19.831 --> 00:03:22.291
I'm talking about pensions
and health care.

00:03:22.807 --> 00:03:26.283
It seems every generation
is indeed connected.

00:03:26.855 --> 00:03:29.331
But how the heck did we get here
in the first place?

00:03:29.355 --> 00:03:32.196
Well, in some cases, it was intentional.
