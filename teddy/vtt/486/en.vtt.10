00:04:58.236 --> 00:05:00.942
Now, Japan has introduced two solutions.

00:05:00.966 --> 00:05:02.900
First, a financial incentive.

00:05:03.204 --> 00:05:08.013
Some local governments in Japan
have offered couples money to have babies,

00:05:08.037 --> 00:05:11.371
with the money increasing
with each additional child being born.

00:05:11.395 --> 00:05:15.395
This actually worked for one year in 2014
in this town called Ama.

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.405
It actually raised the birth rate
from about 1.66 kids per woman to 1.8.

00:05:20.867 --> 00:05:23.502
But it did not gain traction across Japan.

00:05:23.526 --> 00:05:27.533
In 2018, a leader of Japan's
ruling party tried a new tack.

00:05:27.855 --> 00:05:29.482
He told young people,

00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:32.106
"You're selfish for not having babies."
