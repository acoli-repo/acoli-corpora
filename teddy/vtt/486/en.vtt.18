I have one, I do not need 10.

00:09:03.161 --> 00:09:05.095
So here's my bold suggestion.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.923
Let's make it easier
for people to have babies.

00:09:10.677 --> 00:09:14.677
It seems in order to invest in our future,
we actually have to invest in the present

00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:17.638
and help those people
who want to become parents.

00:09:17.662 --> 00:09:19.574
Give them affordable health care,

00:09:19.598 --> 00:09:21.440
give them affordable childcare,

00:09:21.464 --> 00:09:23.464
give them paid parental leave.

00:09:24.067 --> 00:09:28.466
Among the EU states in 2017,
France reported the highest birth rates.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.641
Why?

00:09:29.665 --> 00:09:31.910
Largely due to its pronatal policies
