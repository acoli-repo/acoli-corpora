00:06:57.974 --> 00:07:01.045
Among EU countries,
there is a demographic decline.

00:07:01.553 --> 00:07:06.029
So it seems, in Europe, karma
is going to be brown and Muslim.

00:07:06.053 --> 00:07:10.592
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:10.616 --> 00:07:11.766
Just saying.

00:07:12.362 --> 00:07:14.537
The question remains:

00:07:14.561 --> 00:07:16.675
Why aren't people having enough kids?

00:07:17.157 --> 00:07:20.062
Why is the birth rate declining
in these countries?

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:21.935
In some cases,

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:25.665
it's because women
are more literate, more educated.

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:27.982
They have more economic
opportunities -- applaud.

00:07:28.006 --> 00:07:30.511
All good things, all good things, yes.
