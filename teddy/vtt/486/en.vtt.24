00:11:58.942 --> 00:12:03.728
humanity's best, boldest,
most beautiful infinite possibilities.

00:12:04.435 --> 00:12:06.188
And if we in developed countries,

00:12:06.212 --> 00:12:08.815
as a whole, opt out,

00:12:08.839 --> 00:12:11.228
and don't invest in present
and future generations,

00:12:11.252 --> 00:12:13.156
then what the hell's the point?

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.114
What's the point of being
on this absurd journey together?

00:12:17.823 --> 00:12:22.141
And so, for those who can
and who choose to,

00:12:22.165 --> 00:12:26.014
for those who can
and who choose to have kids,

00:12:26.038 --> 00:12:30.643
may you pass on
this beautiful thing called life,
