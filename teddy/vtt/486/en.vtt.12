Now, Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orbán

00:06:01.608 --> 00:06:05.358
has proposed a new solution
to try to incentivize people to have kids.

00:06:05.846 --> 00:06:08.505

if they had more kids.

00:06:27.688 --> 00:06:29.395
But hold on, pump the brakes.

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:33.553

because he wants to limit
