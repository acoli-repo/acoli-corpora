00:02:28.202 --> 00:02:31.513
But just for today, let's examine
the flip side of the coin.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.252
At how not having enough new people

00:02:34.276 --> 00:02:36.847
is going to be a major problem
moving forward.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.196
According to the World
Health Organization,

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.290
we need to average about
2.1 children per woman today

00:02:42.314 --> 00:02:46.053
just so we have enough people
to replace the previous generation.

00:02:46.077 --> 00:02:49.702
A lot of you thought overpopulation
was going to be a problem in 100 years --

00:02:49.726 --> 00:02:51.407
yeah, it might be underpopulation.

00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:52.598
So a question:

00:02:52.622 --> 00:02:55.876
what happens if that number
dips below 2.1?

00:02:56.413 --> 00:02:58.453
There's going to be a domino effect.

00:02:58.477 --> 00:03:01.207
As all of us get older, and live longer,
