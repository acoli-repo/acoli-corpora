00:11:28.225 --> 00:11:32.500
we both concluded that we regret nothing.

00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:37.566
Deciding to have babies
was the best decision we ever made.

00:11:38.601 --> 00:11:42.609
Our babies have brought us so much joy
and they've brought the world so much joy,

00:11:42.633 --> 00:11:45.766
and having kids is a risk,
but life is a risk.

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:48.458
And yes, I hope you've been
paying attention,

00:11:48.482 --> 00:11:50.823
we need to invest in babies
in developed countries

00:11:50.847 --> 00:11:53.156
if we want to help save
our economy and pensions.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.188
But that's not the reason you have babies.

00:11:55.212 --> 00:11:56.990
That's not the main reason.

00:11:57.014 --> 00:11:58.918
Babies have always represented

00:11:58.942 --> 00:12:03.728
humanity's best, boldest,
most beautiful infinite possibilities.
