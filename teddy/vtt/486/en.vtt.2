there's also a lack of resources
to go around for everyone,

00:01:01.538 --> 00:01:02.923
and oh, by the way,

00:01:02.947 --> 00:01:06.958
we have a ginormous carbon footprint
that is destroying this planet.

00:01:07.538 --> 00:01:09.071
I hear you, I hear you.

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:13.262
And yet, despite all this chaos,

00:01:13.286 --> 00:01:15.686
I still think we should have babies.

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:20.278
I believe we can and should
fight for the earth and humanity,

00:01:20.302 --> 00:01:21.579
side by side.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.450
Now, if I could take it
personal for a second,

00:01:24.474 --> 00:01:27.874
I get it, I get why some of you
might be skeptical about having babies.

00:01:28.228 --> 00:01:30.746
Here's a photo of my wife and me
before we had kids.
