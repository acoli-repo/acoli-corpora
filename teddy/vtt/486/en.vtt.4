00:01:59.037 --> 00:02:00.356
(Laughter)

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.442
(Applause)

00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:02.643
For the minivan.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.760
Where there was once hope,
now there is convenient space,

00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:08.850
and good mileage, good mileage.

00:02:09.434 --> 00:02:12.450
Now, I just want to stress

00:02:12.474 --> 00:02:17.125
that I'm completely aware
of the very dire threats

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:19.086
of global warming and climate change.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.228
I just want to acknowledge
that choosing to have babies

00:02:22.252 --> 00:02:25.741
is a deeply, profoundly personal choice.

00:02:25.765 --> 00:02:27.722
And that many who want to are unable.

00:02:28.202 --> 00:02:31.513
But just for today, let's examine
the flip side of the coin.
