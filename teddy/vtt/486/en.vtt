00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:02.059
I'm an exhausted dad.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.365
Currently owned and dominated
by two mini dictators,

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:11.571
who rule my life with an iron fist
while wearing their Huggies diapers.

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:12.595
(Laughter)

00:00:12.976 --> 00:00:15.991
Now probably because I've been
drowning in small people lately,

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:18.976
I've been paying close attention
to a particular headline.

00:00:19.428 --> 00:00:21.942
It seems around the world,
in developed countries,

00:00:21.966 --> 00:00:24.815
people are having fewer babies.

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.272
From North America to Europe
to China to Japan,

00:00:27.296 --> 00:00:31.080
there's actually been
a consistent decline in birth rates.
