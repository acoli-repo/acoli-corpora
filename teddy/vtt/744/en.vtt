00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So, I've known a lot of fish in my life.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I've loved only two.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
That first one,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
it was more like a passionate affair.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It was a beautiful fish:

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
flavorful, textured, meaty,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
a bestseller on the menu.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What a fish.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
(Laughter)

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Even better,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
of sustainability.
