00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I got up this morning at 6:10 a.m.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
after going to sleep at 12:45 a.m.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I was awakened once during the night.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
My heart rate was 61 beats per minute --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
my blood pressure, 127 over 74.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I had zero minutes of exercise yesterday,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
so my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn't calculated.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I had about 600 milligrams of caffeine,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
zero of alcohol.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And my score on the Narcissism Personality Index,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
or the NPI-16,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is a reassuring 0.31.
