00:00:08.954 --> 00:00:13.204
Socrates, one of the founding fathers
of Western philosophical thought,

00:00:13.204 --> 00:00:14.413
was on trial.

00:00:14.496 --> 00:00:18.413
Many Athenians believed 
he was a dangerous enemy of the state,

00:00:18.413 --> 00:00:21.163
accusing the philosopher
of corrupting the youth

00:00:21.163 --> 00:00:23.746
and refusing to recognize their gods.

00:00:23.746 --> 00:00:28.371
However, Socrates wasnâ€™t feared 
for claiming to have all the answers,

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:31.371
but rather, for asking too many questions.
