00:13:58.933 --> 00:14:01.451
and how it's one of these
very strange commodities

00:14:01.475 --> 00:14:04.949
that from afar, whether afar
in distance or afar in time,

00:14:04.973 --> 00:14:06.871
might seem to have great value,

00:14:06.895 --> 00:14:10.085

00:14:10.109 --> 00:14:15.161
And he said, "Yeah, that's why
what you really want is local fame."

00:14:15.185 --> 00:14:17.305
Local fame, I've observed --

00:14:17.329 --> 00:14:20.115

00:14:20.139 --> 00:14:23.990
local fame is incredibly
powerful and desirable.

00:14:24.014 --> 00:14:27.133
It's why, when you go home to your family

00:14:27.157 --> 00:14:29.950
and you've done something
that they approve of,

00:14:29.974 --> 00:14:32.085
that feels incredibly good.
