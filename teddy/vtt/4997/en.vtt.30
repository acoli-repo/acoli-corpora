00:14:59.863 --> 00:15:03.768
that when people have a certain gain,
they like to play it safe and protect it.

00:15:03.792 --> 00:15:05.959
And when people are facing
a guaranteed loss,

00:15:05.983 --> 00:15:08.585
that's when they're willing
to take a chance, right?

00:15:08.609 --> 00:15:12.708
I find that a lot of middle managers
are pretty happy with the status quo.

00:15:12.732 --> 00:15:16.033
And so trying to sell them on
the benefits of a new practice

00:15:16.057 --> 00:15:18.311
or of walking away from an old fad,

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:20.732
they're like, "No, I like things
the way they are."

00:15:20.756 --> 00:15:24.104
Whereas if you can highlight the costs
of sticking with the status quo

00:15:24.128 --> 00:15:27.111
and say, "Here's why
this is a horrible idea,"

00:15:27.135 --> 00:15:29.532
then they either get really
excited about changing,

00:15:29.556 --> 00:15:31.270
or they get extremely defensive.
