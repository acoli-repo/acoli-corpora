The problem is,

00:13:00.315 --> 00:13:04.027
when you talk to people in firms
about incentives,

00:13:04.051 --> 00:13:06.234
they usually hear "financial incentives,"

00:13:06.258 --> 00:13:08.971
whereas in fact, as you well know,

00:13:08.995 --> 00:13:11.868
and as you've shown in your work
all over the place,

00:13:11.892 --> 00:13:13.979
there are all different
kinds of incentives.

00:13:14.003 --> 00:13:16.315
There are social incentives
and moral incentives

00:13:16.339 --> 00:13:18.497
and reputational incentives and so on.

00:13:18.521 --> 00:13:22.388
And I do think that within firms,
if we're talking about firms --

00:13:22.412 --> 00:13:24.926
and again, I've been
around a lot of firms.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.125
I used to have a job a long time ago.

00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:30.828
I did not like having jobs,
which is why I don't have one anymore.
