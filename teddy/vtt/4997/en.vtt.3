00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:32.187
To do that, I got together
with Stephen Dubner.

00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:36.177
You might know Stephen from the popular
"Freakonomics" podcast and book series.

00:01:36.653 --> 00:01:39.661
I wanted to discuss with him --
actually, debate with him --

00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:42.172
the merits of certain fads in work life.

00:01:42.196 --> 00:01:46.045
So we sat down in Boston this spring
during the MIT Sports Analytics Conference

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:47.220
to hash it out.

00:01:47.244 --> 00:01:48.839
(Conference) Hey, Stephen Dubner.

00:01:48.863 --> 00:01:50.037
SD: Hi, Adam Grant.

00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:51.233
AG: Why are you here?

00:01:51.257 --> 00:01:52.510
SD: Why am I here in life?

00:01:52.534 --> 00:01:53.693
AG: Yeah.

00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:55.307
As in, why do you do what you do?

00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:57.942
SD: Oh, I misinterpreted you.

00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:59.990
Hi. By the way, hello, everybody.
