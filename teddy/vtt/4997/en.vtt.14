00:06:58.868 --> 00:07:00.030
AG: It is.

00:07:00.054 --> 00:07:03.553
I've also been kind of toying with
a few other solutions to this problem.

00:07:03.577 --> 00:07:06.252
One of them is to take
the sociometric badges

00:07:06.276 --> 00:07:08.276
that were invented at the MIT Media Lab,

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.639
where you can have
everyone in the room wear them,

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:12.252
and then it displays in real time

00:07:12.276 --> 00:07:14.896
how much talk time
each person is commanding.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.243
And you pretty quickly see,

00:07:16.267 --> 00:07:19.062
"Wow, I'm the idiot
who's dominating the conversation."

00:07:20.005 --> 00:07:21.466
When I have groups brainstorm,

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.505
I don't let people
present their own ideas.

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:24.853
I at least want to decouple

00:07:24.877 --> 00:07:27.649
who generated the idea
and then who's selling it.

00:07:27.673 --> 00:07:30.351
And my hope is then,
if there's a really good presenter,
