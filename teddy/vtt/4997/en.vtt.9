00:04:28.254 --> 00:04:31.236
you have more great ideas
but fewer good ideas,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.100
and you get the opposite
if you're brainstorming in a group.

00:04:34.124 --> 00:04:37.614
But you can get the best of both worlds
with intermittent collaboration.

00:04:37.638 --> 00:04:39.265
And that's kind of obvious, right?

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.985
Like, of course there are times
when we need to be alone

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:43.672
and times we need to be in a team.

00:04:43.696 --> 00:04:46.200
I think the mechanism,
though, is really interesting,

00:04:46.224 --> 00:04:49.439
that if you're in a team that's
brainstorming together all the time,

00:04:49.463 --> 00:04:52.928
the less creative people just copy
the ideas of the most creative people,

00:04:52.952 --> 00:04:54.876
whereas if you let them work separately,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.008
they actually come up
with ideas of their own

00:04:57.032 --> 00:05:00.215
and are able to enhance the creativity
of the most creative people.
