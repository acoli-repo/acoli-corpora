00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.092
But maybe also
a little bit of fad-busting.

00:02:32.512 --> 00:02:35.442
One of these that drives me crazy
is open-plan offices.

00:02:35.744 --> 00:02:37.430
Basic idea is pretty simple, right?

00:02:37.454 --> 00:02:39.710
We want people to have
more creative collisions,

00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:41.270
we want people to interact more.

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:43.361
And then Ethan Bernstein
ran this experiment

00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:45.668
where a company went
from cubicles to open-plan.

00:02:45.692 --> 00:02:49.650
And people had 70 percent fewer
face-to-face interactions afterward,

00:02:49.674 --> 00:02:50.926
and they sent more emails.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.063
And I think this was just them
throwing their hands up and saying,

00:02:54.087 --> 00:02:56.055
"I cannot handle all the overstimulation.

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.582
I need to focus, so let me just
get into a zone here

00:02:58.606 --> 00:03:00.090
and get out of my face."
