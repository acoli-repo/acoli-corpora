I would argue that there can be
a really, really, really big benefit

00:10:31.259 --> 00:10:35.346
in not listening to or caring too much
about what other people think

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.457

Because the minute you start to think,

00:10:39.333 --> 00:10:41.172

And we kind of do live in a world
of a lot of middling stuff, you know?

00:10:56.844 --> 00:10:58.176
AG: (Laughs) That's right.
