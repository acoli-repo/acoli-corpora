00:07:57.904 --> 00:08:00.462
and you ranked them
from favorite to least favorite --

00:08:00.486 --> 00:08:02.646
your favorite idea is not
your most promising.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.793
You're too in love with it
to see the flaws.

00:08:04.817 --> 00:08:06.305
It's your second-favorite idea,

00:08:06.329 --> 00:08:08.499
where you have a little
more distance from it,

00:08:08.523 --> 00:08:11.747
you can see it more objectively,
you recognize what's wrong with it,

00:08:11.771 --> 00:08:14.630
but you also have enough
passion for it to want to fix it.

00:08:14.654 --> 00:08:17.465
I'm getting afraid that people
will start gaming the system

00:08:17.489 --> 00:08:20.603
and say, "So if I just take
my favorite idea and rank it second,

00:08:20.627 --> 00:08:22.156
then I'm good."

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.545
So don't do that.

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:26.609
How do you think about getting better
at that calibration task

00:08:26.633 --> 00:08:29.883
and knowing when the idea you love
is actually not that good?
