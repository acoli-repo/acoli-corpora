00:08:57.877 --> 00:09:00.656
And so, I'd say that for every idea
that we end up doing,

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.695
there were probably 10 to 20

00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:07.416
that got into some stage of thinking about
and were abandoned as being bad.

00:09:07.823 --> 00:09:09.823
But because of my structure in that,

00:09:10.712 --> 00:09:14.006
there is a kind of mechanism
for acceptance or rejection.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.728
And then there's a middle ground,

00:09:15.752 --> 00:09:18.133
like, we'll have an idea,
we'll start producing it,

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:21.056
we'll start interviewing people,
and it's just, like, boring.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.505
So for me, I have
a very selfish set of criteria.

00:09:24.903 --> 00:09:27.506
It needs to be interesting to me,

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:30.343
it needs to be potentially fun for me.
