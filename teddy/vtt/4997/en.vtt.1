If a giant meteor destroyed the Earth,
when the cockroaches died,

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.160
the glitter would still
be floating around.

00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:37.864
In my work life, my biggest pet peeve
is management fads.

00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:41.778
They're the glitter of the working world:
sparkly and ubiquitous,

00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:44.159
but often useless and annoying.

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:48.518
Sometimes they're way out of date,
like the Myers-Briggs personality tool.

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:52.400
Other times they're fresh,
but sorely lacking in evidence,

00:00:52.424 --> 00:00:54.690
like using brain games for hiring.

00:00:55.487 --> 00:00:59.006
But fads don't just bug me
because they're unhelpful.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.963
They can be actively harmful.
