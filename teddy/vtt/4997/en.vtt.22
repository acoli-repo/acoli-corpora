00:10:58.641 --> 00:11:02.506
So I want to get to a couple other fads,

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.330
because one of the things that drives me
crazy as an organizational psychologist

00:11:06.354 --> 00:11:07.559
is walking into a company

00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:10.562
and finding out they still use
something like the Myers-Briggs.

00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:14.838
It's kind of like driving a horse
in the era of cars.

00:11:14.862 --> 00:11:17.771
And like, a horse was really great
circa 1890, right?

00:11:17.795 --> 00:11:19.764
It was the fastest vehicle on the market.

00:11:19.788 --> 00:11:22.050
SD: Except for the poop.
A lot of poop problems.

00:11:22.807 --> 00:11:25.005
AG (Studio): Quick public
service announcement,

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:26.576
and it's not about horse manure.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.744
We're not going deep
on the Myers-Briggs here.

00:11:28.768 --> 00:11:29.991
If you want more on that,
