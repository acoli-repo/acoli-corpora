AG: You just threw
every extrovert under the bus.

00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:01.243
SD: Sorry. Well ...

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.523
The thing that made me --

00:06:03.835 --> 00:06:06.585
The strategy that I thought
was so simple and so brilliant

00:06:06.609 --> 00:06:08.816
is when you have
the quiet person at a meeting,

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.895
or maybe the shy person
or the young person

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:12.291
or less experienced person,

00:06:12.315 --> 00:06:14.327
it's very simple to say, you know,

00:06:14.351 --> 00:06:17.031
if after 15 minutes,
you haven't heard from that person,

00:06:17.055 --> 00:06:18.206
just invite them.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.202
"Harry, I haven't heard from you.
What do you think about it?"

00:06:21.226 --> 00:06:24.453
There are million ways to do it
that doesn't feel like singling out,

00:06:24.477 --> 00:06:27.366
and if they don't want to contribute,
then fine, they don't,

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.842
but to be invited
to do that, I think is --
