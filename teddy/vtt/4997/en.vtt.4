00:02:00.998 --> 00:02:02.577
Why do I do what I do?

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:09.482
So, I'm a writer by training
and by temperament and sentiment.

00:02:09.506 --> 00:02:11.874
So in my experience,

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:15.315
most people who become writers like me

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:19.442
are people who are incapable
of really doing anything useful.

00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:22.545
I can't make anything,
I can't build anything,

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.951
I can't solve any problems,

00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:26.862
and so I just follow around
people who do those things.

00:02:26.886 --> 00:02:29.156
AG: So I want to do some myth-busting.

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.092
But maybe also
a little bit of fad-busting.
