00:03:28.236 --> 00:03:31.051
I mean, to me, there
are number of substrata

00:03:31.075 --> 00:03:33.306
that are interesting
to think about, including:

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.097
well, wait a minute -- me personally,
I hate face-to-face interaction.

00:03:37.577 --> 00:03:40.310
Not that I hate people,
although ... eh, kinda.

00:03:40.334 --> 00:03:41.343
AG: (Laughs)

00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:43.754
SD: I like people individually,
but collectively --

00:03:43.778 --> 00:03:44.801
AG: (Laughs)

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:47.230
SD: In practice, I like people.
In theory, I don't.

00:03:47.254 --> 00:03:49.221
AG: I have so many questions right now.

00:03:49.245 --> 00:03:51.269
SD: But in terms of why it persists,

00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:58.041
I actually do think that if you care
about creating an office environment

00:03:58.065 --> 00:04:02.466
that works the best
for the most people most of the time,
