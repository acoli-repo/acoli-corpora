00:03:58.065 --> 00:04:02.466
that works the best
for the most people most of the time,

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.656
it's not that hard.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.418
And I think a lot of modern
office design is doing it now,

00:04:06.442 --> 00:04:08.585
which is basically
some kind of hybrid model.

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:13.426
I work mostly on my own
about 94 percent of the time.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.880
And then the six percent
I go in with my awesome crew,

00:04:16.904 --> 00:04:18.849
and I kind of love it.

00:04:18.873 --> 00:04:20.024
I mean ... nah.

00:04:20.048 --> 00:04:21.769
AG: (Laughs)

00:04:21.793 --> 00:04:23.164
Yeah, so a couple of things:

00:04:23.188 --> 00:04:26.310
one, I think what you just said
also goes to another Ethan study,

00:04:26.334 --> 00:04:28.230
which is that if you're working solo,

00:04:28.254 --> 00:04:31.236
you have more great ideas
but fewer good ideas,
