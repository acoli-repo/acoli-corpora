00:15:59.815 --> 00:16:03.752
And so I feel like
our mechanisms right now

00:16:03.776 --> 00:16:06.830
for matching a person

00:16:06.854 --> 00:16:11.395
and all their intellectual
and emotional etc components

00:16:11.419 --> 00:16:15.244
to a work life that will be good for them
and that they will good at,

00:16:15.268 --> 00:16:17.622
I feel like we're really bad at that.

00:16:17.646 --> 00:16:19.241
So what are you doing about that?

00:16:19.265 --> 00:16:20.556
AG: Nothing. (Laughs)

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:24.413
SD: No, shouldn't that be like the grail
of you, your people?

00:16:25.368 --> 00:16:27.910
AG: Yeah, although I don't think
the matching question

00:16:27.934 --> 00:16:30.299
is nearly as interesting
as the changing question.
