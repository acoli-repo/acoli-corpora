00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:32.325
that I thought was brilliant -- 
so, so simple in retrospect, is:

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.485
What are the odds that the quiet,

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:39.422
shy, non-bravado-possessing person

00:05:39.446 --> 00:05:45.154
has a worse idea than the noisy,
cocky, well-presenting person?

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.517
And I'd say, probably
the correlation is negative.

00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:50.200
In other words, if you're
the kind of person who's quiet

00:05:50.224 --> 00:05:51.678
and thoughtful and maybe shy,

00:05:51.702 --> 00:05:54.799
you probably spend a lot more time
actually thinking, period.

00:05:54.823 --> 00:05:55.981
Just thinking.

00:05:56.005 --> 00:05:57.720
As opposed to the noisy people.

00:05:57.744 --> 00:06:00.069
AG: You just threw
every extrovert under the bus.
