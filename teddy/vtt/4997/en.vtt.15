00:07:27.673 --> 00:07:30.351
And my hope is then,
if there's a really good presenter,

00:07:30.375 --> 00:07:33.627
every once in a while, a good idea
will randomly land in their hands,

00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:34.867
and they get to pitch it.

00:07:34.891 --> 00:07:36.352
SD: That's a really neat idea.

00:07:36.376 --> 00:07:39.113
AG: We know there's zero
if not negative correlation

00:07:39.137 --> 00:07:42.626
between the quality of your ideas
and the quality of your pitching.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.308
I think there's a puzzle, though, for most
of us who try to do creative work,

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.839
which is: we're pretty bad
at judging our own ideas.

00:07:48.863 --> 00:07:50.839
I have a former student, Justin Berg,

00:07:50.863 --> 00:07:53.261
who just finished some
really interesting research,

00:07:53.285 --> 00:07:55.974
where he shows that
if you were to take all your ideas --

00:07:55.998 --> 00:07:57.880
let's say you have 20 ideas for a book,

00:07:57.904 --> 00:08:00.462
and you ranked them
from favorite to least favorite --
