00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm a neuroscientist, a professor at the University of California.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And over the past 35 years,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I've studied behavior

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
on the basis of everything from genes

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
through neurotransmitters, dopamine, things like that,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
all the way through circuit analysis.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So that's what I normally do.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But then, for some reason,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I got into something else, just recently.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to analyze a bunch of brains

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
of psychopathic killers.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And so this would be the typical talk I would give.
