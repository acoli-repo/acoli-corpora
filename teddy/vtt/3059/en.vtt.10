00:04:58.541 --> 00:05:00.501
The more we talk about things,

00:05:00.525 --> 00:05:03.771
the more we see
that the issues are connected

00:05:03.795 --> 00:05:05.925
because we are connected.

00:05:06.546 --> 00:05:08.257
The world will say to you,

00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:10.032
"We need to end racism."

00:05:10.587 --> 00:05:13.522
Start by healing it in your own family.

00:05:14.168 --> 00:05:15.828
The world will say to you,

00:05:15.852 --> 00:05:18.374
"How do we speak to bias and bigotry?"

00:05:18.933 --> 00:05:23.699
Start by having the first conversation
at your own kitchen table.

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:26.587
The world will say to you,

00:05:27.044 --> 00:05:28.809
"There is so much hate."

00:05:29.568 --> 00:05:31.292
Devote yourself to love.
