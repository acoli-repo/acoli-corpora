00:00:27.537 --> 00:00:32.026
I spend a lot time in my work
talking to people about who we are,

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.516
who we must be

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.618
and what our healing looks like.

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:38.756
So the first time I held him,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.272
I had my pep talk ready.

00:00:40.918 --> 00:00:44.828
You know, I wanted him to know
that the way we find our strength

00:00:44.852 --> 00:00:46.406
is through our challenges.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.080
I wanted him to know
that we can all do something big

00:00:49.104 --> 00:00:50.295
when we start small.

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:53.762
I wanted him to know
that each of us is more resilient

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:55.457
than we could ever imagine.

00:00:56.242 --> 00:00:58.520
So here I am holding little Thelonious.

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:00.932
I look down at him,
