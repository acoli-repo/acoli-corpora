00:08:29.139 --> 00:08:31.968
We spend so much time

00:08:31.992 --> 00:08:34.946
thinking we don't have
the power to change the world.

00:08:35.391 --> 00:08:39.346
We forget that the power to change
someone's life is always in our hands.

00:08:39.994 --> 00:08:44.724
Change-making does not belong
to one group of people;

00:08:44.748 --> 00:08:46.984
it belongs to all of us.

00:08:47.448 --> 00:08:51.558
You don't have to wait
on anyone to tell you

00:08:51.582 --> 00:08:53.208
that you are in this.

00:08:53.695 --> 00:08:54.845
Begin.

00:08:55.375 --> 00:08:59.717
Start by doing what you can
with what you've got,

00:08:59.741 --> 00:09:01.126
where you are
