00:01:58.813 --> 00:02:02.155
Meet someone you do not know,
and get to know them.

00:02:03.242 --> 00:02:04.889
The world will say to you,

00:02:05.474 --> 00:02:07.022
"What are you going to do?"

00:02:07.914 --> 00:02:09.939
Do not be afraid to say,

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:12.726
"I know I can't do everything,

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.958
but I can do something."

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:17.697
Walk into more rooms saying,

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:19.140
"I'm here to help."

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.935
Become intimate with generosity.

00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:25.795
Give what you can give,
and do what you can do.

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.389
Give dollars, give cents, give your time,

00:02:28.413 --> 00:02:29.971
give your love,

00:02:29.995 --> 00:02:31.860
give your heart, give your spirit.
