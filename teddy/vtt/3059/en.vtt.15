She did not say, "I'm not a congressman

00:07:31.923 --> 00:07:33.764

00:07:33.788 --> 00:07:38.213
so how could I possibly participate
in the fight to abolish

00:07:38.237 --> 00:07:40.061
a system as big as slavery?"

00:07:40.493 --> 00:07:44.469
She instead spent 10 years
making 19 trips,

00:07:44.493 --> 00:07:46.370
freeing 300 people,

00:07:46.394 --> 00:07:48.272
one group of people at a time.

00:07:48.922 --> 00:07:51.324

of those 300 people,

00:07:51.348 --> 00:07:54.587
the grandchildren,
the great-grandchildren and beyond.

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:59.069
Our righteous acts create
immeasurable ripples

00:07:59.093 --> 00:08:01.669
in the endless river of justice.
