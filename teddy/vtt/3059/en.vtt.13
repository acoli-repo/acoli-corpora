00:06:29.846 --> 00:06:31.603
The better question might be:

00:06:31.627 --> 00:06:32.923
"How am I showing up?"

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:36.260
I ask the world for peace,

00:06:36.284 --> 00:06:39.441
but do I show up with peace
when I see my family and friends?

00:06:39.977 --> 00:06:42.829
I ask the world to end hatred,

00:06:42.853 --> 00:06:47.088
but do I show up with love
not only for those I know,

00:06:47.112 --> 00:06:48.517
but those I don't know?

00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:53.423
Do I show up with love for those
whose ideas conflict with my own?

00:06:54.074 --> 00:06:56.423
I ask the world to end suffering,

00:06:56.447 --> 00:06:59.920
but do I show up for those
who are suffering on my street corner?
