00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:00.932
I look down at him,

00:01:01.574 --> 00:01:02.893
and it hits me:

00:01:03.944 --> 00:01:05.095
he's a baby.

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.120
(Laughter)

00:01:06.144 --> 00:01:09.081
He's not going to understand
a single word I say to him.

00:01:10.114 --> 00:01:12.810
So instead, I thought
it would probably be a better idea

00:01:12.834 --> 00:01:14.089
if I went home and wrote.

00:01:14.113 --> 00:01:16.569
So, this is for grownups,

00:01:16.593 --> 00:01:19.990
but it's also for Thelonious,

00:01:20.014 --> 00:01:21.636
when he's old enough to read it:

00:01:24.768 --> 00:01:26.811
The world will say to you,

00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:29.042
"Be a better person."
