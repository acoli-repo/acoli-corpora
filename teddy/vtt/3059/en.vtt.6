00:02:59.724 --> 00:03:02.733
that just because someone
disagrees with you,

00:03:02.757 --> 00:03:04.580
it does not make them your enemy.

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:06.859
You may not win an argument,

00:03:06.883 --> 00:03:08.898
you may not change a mind,

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:10.823
but if you choose to,

00:03:10.847 --> 00:03:15.759
you can always achieve
the triumph of radical empathy --

00:03:15.783 --> 00:03:18.016
an understanding of the heart.

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.203
The world will say to you,

00:03:21.965 --> 00:03:23.619
"We need justice."

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:26.104
Investigate.

00:03:26.803 --> 00:03:29.611
Find truth beyond
the stories you are told.
