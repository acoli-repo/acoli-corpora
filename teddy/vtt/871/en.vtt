Thank you. I have two missions here today.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The first is to tell you something about pollen, I hope,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And, secondly, to convince you

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
(Laughter)

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It carries male sex cells

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
from one flower to another.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This gives us genetic diversity,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And it's really rather better not to mate with yourself.
