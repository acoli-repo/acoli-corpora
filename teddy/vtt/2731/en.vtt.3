WEBVTT

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.376
made road maps for infant joy,
shamed nothing but fear,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.656
called ourselves fat and meant, of course,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.896
impeccable.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.856
This year, we were women,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.656
not brides or trinkets,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.176
not an off-brand gender,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.336
not a concession, but women.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.656

Some of us said for the first time
that we were women,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.096
took this oath of solidarity seriously.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.376
Some of us bore children
and some of us did not,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.816
and none of us questioned
whether that made us real

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.616
or appropriate or true.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.776
When she asks you of this year,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.705
your daughter, whether your offspring
or heir to your triumph,
