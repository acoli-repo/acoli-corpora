WEBVTT

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.896
laid our bodies on the concrete
against the outlines of our fallen,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.855
cried, "Of course we mattered,"

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.256
chanted for our disappeared.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.880
The women wept this year.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.656
They did.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.136
In the same year, we were ready.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.256
The year we lost our inhibition
and moved with courageous abandon

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.776
was also the year we stared down barrels,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.136
sang of cranes in skies,
ducked and parried,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.616
caught gold in hijab,
collected death threats,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.976
knew ourselves as patriots,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.216
said, "We're 35 now, time we settled down
and found a running mate,"

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.376
made road maps for infant joy,
shamed nothing but fear,
