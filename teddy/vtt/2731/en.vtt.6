00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.776
Were you fooled by the epithets
of "nasty" or "less than"?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.296
Did you teach with an open heart
or a clenched fist?

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.536
Where were you?

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.416
Tell her the truth. Make it your life.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.416
Confirm it. Say, "Daughter, I stood there

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.656
with the moment
drawn on my face like a dagger,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.016
and flung it back at itself,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.456
slicing space for you."

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.296
Tell her the truth, how you lived
in spite of crooked odds.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.576
Tell her you were brave,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.936
and always, always
in the company of courage,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.256
mostly the days
when you just had yourself.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.256
Tell her she was born as you were,

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.896
as your mothers before,
and the sisters beside them,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.016
in the age of legends, like always.
