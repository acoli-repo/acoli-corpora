00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.705
your daughter, whether your offspring
or heir to your triumph,

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.736
from her comforted side of history
teetering towards woman,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.056
she will wonder and ask voraciously,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.015
though she cannot fathom your sacrifice,

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.816
she will hold your estimation of it holy,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.336
curiously probing, "Where were you?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.376
Did you fight?
Were you fearful or fearsome?

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.256
What colored the walls of your regret?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.936
What did you do for women
in the year it was time?

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.856
This path you made for me,
which bones had to break?

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.136
Did you do enough, and are you OK, momma?

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.376
And are you a hero?"

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.816
She will ask the difficult questions.
