WEBVTT

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.816
She will ask the difficult questions.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.016
She will not care
about the arc of your brow,

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.296
the weight of your clutch.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.976
She will not ask of your mentions.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.376
Your daughter, for whom you have
already carried so much, wants to know

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.896
what you brought, what gift,
what light did you keep from extinction?

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.856
When they came for victims in the night,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.976
did you sleep through it
or were you roused?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.656
What was the cost of staying woke?

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.146
What, in the year we said time's up,
what did you do with your privilege?

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.696
Did you sup on others' squalor?

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.856
Did you look away
or directly into the flame?

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.416
Did you know your skill
or treat it like a liability?

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.776
Were you fooled by the epithets
of "nasty" or "less than"?
