00:00:00.984 --> 00:00:03.256
Tell your daughters of this year,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.376
how we woke needing coffee

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.216
but discovered instead cadavers
strewn about our morning papers,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.040
waterlogged facsimiles
of our sisters, spouses, small children.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.216
Say to your baby of this year
when she asks, as she certainly should,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.816
tell her it was too late coming.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.296
Admit even in the year we leased freedom,
we didn't own it outright.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.136
There were still laws
for every way we used our privates

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.656
while they pawed at the soft folds of us,

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.415
grabbed with no concern for consent,
