Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts
looked at Ramón y Cajal's drawing

00:05:02.579 --> 00:05:03.896
of visual cortex,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.482
which I'm showing here.

00:05:05.506 --> 00:05:09.948
This is the cortex that processes
imagery that comes from the eye.

00:05:10.424 --> 00:05:13.932
And for them, this looked
like a circuit diagram.

00:05:14.353 --> 00:05:18.188
So there are a lot of details
in McCulloch and Pitts's circuit diagram

00:05:18.212 --> 00:05:19.564
that are not quite right.

00:05:19.588 --> 00:05:20.823
But this basic idea

00:05:20.847 --> 00:05:24.839
that visual cortex works like a series
of computational elements

00:05:24.863 --> 00:05:27.609
that pass information
one to the next in a cascade,

00:05:27.633 --> 00:05:29.235
is essentially correct.

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:31.609
Let's talk for a moment
