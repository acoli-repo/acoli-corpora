00:01:57.983 --> 00:02:00.399
The early anatomists who looked at brains

00:02:00.423 --> 00:02:04.230
gave the superficial structures
of this thing all kinds of fanciful names,

00:02:04.254 --> 00:02:06.687
like hippocampus, meaning "little shrimp."

00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:09.475
But of course that sort of thing
doesn't tell us very much

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:11.817
about what's actually going on inside.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.393
The first person who, I think, really
developed some kind of insight

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:18.347
into what was going on in the brain

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:22.291
was the great Spanish neuroanatomist,
Santiago Ramón y Cajal,

00:02:22.315 --> 00:02:23.859
in the 19th century,

00:02:23.883 --> 00:02:27.638
who used microscopy and special stains

00:02:27.662 --> 00:02:31.832
that could selectively fill in
or render in very high contrast
