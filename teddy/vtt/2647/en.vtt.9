00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:30.676
and progress on understanding the brain

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.971
proceeded slowly
over the next few decades.

00:04:33.455 --> 00:04:36.308
But we knew that neurons used electricity,

00:04:36.332 --> 00:04:39.268
and by World War II, our technology
was advanced enough

00:04:39.292 --> 00:04:42.098
to start doing real electrical
experiments on live neurons

00:04:42.122 --> 00:04:44.228
to better understand how they worked.

00:04:44.631 --> 00:04:48.987
This was the very same time
when computers were being invented,

00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:52.111
very much based on the idea
of modeling the brain --

00:04:52.135 --> 00:04:55.220
of "intelligent machinery,"
as Alan Turing called it,

00:04:55.244 --> 00:04:57.235
one of the fathers of computer science.

00:04:57.923 --> 00:05:02.555
Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts
