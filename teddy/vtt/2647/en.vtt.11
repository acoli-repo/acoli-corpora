Let's talk for a moment

00:05:31.633 --> 00:05:35.665
about what a model for processing
visual information would need to do.

00:05:36.228 --> 00:05:38.969
The basic task of perception

00:05:38.993 --> 00:05:43.187
is to take an image like this one and say,

00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:44.387
"That's a bird,"

00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:47.285
which is a very simple thing
for us to do with our brains.

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:50.730
But you should all understand
that for a computer,

00:05:50.754 --> 00:05:53.841
this was pretty much impossible
just a few years ago.

00:05:53.865 --> 00:05:55.781
The classical computing paradigm

00:05:55.805 --> 00:05:58.312
is not one in which
this task is easy to do.

00:05:59.366 --> 00:06:01.918
So what's going on between the pixels,
