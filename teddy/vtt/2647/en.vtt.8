00:03:58.344 --> 00:04:00.618
So we're looking at something
much, much smaller

00:04:00.642 --> 00:04:02.040
than a single strand of hair.

00:04:02.064 --> 00:04:06.095
And from these kinds of serial
electron microscopy slices,

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:11.127
one can start to make reconstructions
in 3D of neurons that look like these.

00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:14.308
So these are sort of in the same
style as Ramón y Cajal.

00:04:14.332 --> 00:04:15.824
Only a few neurons lit up,

00:04:15.848 --> 00:04:18.629
because otherwise we wouldn't
be able to see anything here.

00:04:18.653 --> 00:04:19.965
It would be so crowded,

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.319
so full of structure,

00:04:21.343 --> 00:04:24.067
of wiring all connecting
one neuron to another.

00:04:25.293 --> 00:04:28.097
So Ramón y Cajal was a little bit
ahead of his time,

00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:30.676
and progress on understanding the brain
