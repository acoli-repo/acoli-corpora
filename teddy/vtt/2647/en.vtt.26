00:12:57.588 --> 00:13:02.016
kind of cubist, surreal,
psychedelic picture of me

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.846
from multiple points of view at once.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.604
The reason it looks like
multiple points of view at once

00:13:06.628 --> 00:13:10.315
is because that network is designed
to get rid of the ambiguity

00:13:10.339 --> 00:13:12.815
of a face being in one pose
or another pose,

00:13:12.839 --> 00:13:16.215
being looked at with one kind of lighting,
another kind of lighting.

00:13:16.239 --> 00:13:18.324
So when you do
this sort of reconstruction,

00:13:18.348 --> 00:13:20.652
if you don't use some sort of guide image

00:13:20.676 --> 00:13:21.887
or guide statistics,

00:13:21.911 --> 00:13:25.676
then you'll get a sort of confusion
of different points of view,

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.068
because it's ambiguous.

00:13:27.786 --> 00:13:32.009
This is what happens if Alex uses
his own face as a guide image
