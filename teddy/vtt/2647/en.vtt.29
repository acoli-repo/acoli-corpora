Or, Mike has done some other experiments

00:14:33.169 --> 00:14:37.074
in which he takes that cloud image,

00:14:37.098 --> 00:14:40.605
hallucinates, zooms, hallucinates,
zooms hallucinates, zooms.

00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:41.780
And in this way,

00:14:41.804 --> 00:14:45.479
you can get a sort of fugue state
of the network, I suppose,

00:14:45.503 --> 00:14:49.183
or a sort of free association,

00:14:49.207 --> 00:14:51.434
in which the network
is eating its own tail.

00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:54.879
So every image is now the basis for,

00:14:54.903 --> 00:14:56.324
"What do I think I see next?

00:14:56.348 --> 00:14:59.151
What do I think I see next?
What do I think I see next?"

00:14:59.487 --> 00:15:02.423
I showed this for the first time in public
