00:03:29.463 --> 00:03:34.464
is to image little pieces of brain tissue.

00:03:34.488 --> 00:03:37.814
The entire sample here
is about one cubic millimeter in size,

00:03:37.838 --> 00:03:40.459
and I'm showing you a very,
very small piece of it here.

00:03:40.483 --> 00:03:42.829
That bar on the left is about one micron.

00:03:42.853 --> 00:03:45.262
The structures you see are mitochondria

00:03:45.286 --> 00:03:47.330
that are the size of bacteria.

00:03:47.354 --> 00:03:48.905
And these are consecutive slices

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:52.077
through this very, very
tiny block of tissue.

00:03:52.101 --> 00:03:54.504
Just for comparison's sake,

00:03:54.528 --> 00:03:58.320
the diameter of an average strand
of hair is about 100 microns.

00:03:58.344 --> 00:04:00.618
So we're looking at something
much, much smaller
