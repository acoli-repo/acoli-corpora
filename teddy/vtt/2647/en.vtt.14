00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.285
and bird, the output --

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:04.366
by three variables: x, w and y.

00:07:04.853 --> 00:07:06.664
There are maybe a million or so x's --

00:07:06.688 --> 00:07:08.641
a million pixels in that image.

00:07:08.665 --> 00:07:11.111
There are billions or trillions of w's,

00:07:11.135 --> 00:07:14.556
which represent the weights of all
these synapses in the neural network.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.455
And there's a very small number of y's,

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:18.337
of outputs that that network has.

00:07:18.361 --> 00:07:20.110
"Bird" is only four letters, right?

00:07:21.088 --> 00:07:24.514
So let's pretend that this
is just a simple formula,

00:07:24.538 --> 00:07:26.701
x "x" w = y.

00:07:26.725 --> 00:07:28.761
I'm putting the times in scare quotes

00:07:28.785 --> 00:07:31.065
because what's really
going on there, of course,
