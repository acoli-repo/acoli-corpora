00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.705
a picture of birds.

00:11:32.814 --> 00:11:36.551
So this is a picture of birds
generated entirely by a neural network

00:11:36.575 --> 00:11:38.401
that was trained to recognize birds,

00:11:38.425 --> 00:11:41.963
just by solving for x
rather than solving for y,

00:11:41.987 --> 00:11:43.275
and doing that iteratively.

00:11:43.732 --> 00:11:45.579
Here's another fun example.

00:11:45.603 --> 00:11:49.040
This was a work made
by Mike Tyka in our group,

00:11:49.064 --> 00:11:51.372
which he calls "Animal Parade."

00:11:51.396 --> 00:11:54.272
It reminds me a little bit
of William Kentridge's artworks,

00:11:54.296 --> 00:11:56.785
in which he makes sketches, rubs them out,

00:11:56.809 --> 00:11:58.269
makes sketches, rubs them out,

00:11:58.293 --> 00:11:59.691
and creates a movie this way.

00:11:59.715 --> 00:12:00.866
In this case,
