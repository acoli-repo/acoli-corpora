but identifying the species of bird
with a network of this sort.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.716
So in that picture,

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.542
the x and the w are known,
and the y is the unknown.

00:08:38.566 --> 00:08:41.074
I'm glossing over the very
difficult part, of course,

00:08:41.098 --> 00:08:44.959
which is how on earth
do we figure out the w,

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:47.170
the brain that can do such a thing?

00:08:47.194 --> 00:08:49.028
How would we ever learn such a model?

00:08:49.418 --> 00:08:52.651
So this process of learning,
of solving for w,

00:08:52.675 --> 00:08:55.322
if we were doing this
with the simple equation

00:08:55.346 --> 00:08:57.346
in which we think about these as numbers,

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.057
we know exactly how to do that: 6 = 2 x w,
