00:09:27.747 --> 00:09:30.418
You just say, let's play
a little algebra trick,

00:09:30.442 --> 00:09:33.348
and move the six over
to the right-hand side of the equation.

00:09:33.372 --> 00:09:35.198
Now, we're still using multiplication.

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:39.255
And that zero -- let's think
about it as an error.

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:41.794
In other words, if we've solved
for w the right way,

00:09:41.818 --> 00:09:43.474
then the error will be zero.

00:09:43.498 --> 00:09:45.436
And if we haven't gotten it quite right,

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.209
the error will be greater than zero.

00:09:47.233 --> 00:09:50.599
So now we can just take guesses
to minimize the error,

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:53.310
and that's the sort of thing
computers are very good at.

00:09:53.334 --> 00:09:54.927
So you've taken an initial guess:

00:09:54.951 --> 00:09:56.107
what if w = 0?

00:09:56.131 --> 00:09:57.371
Well, then the error is 6.

00:09:57.395 --> 00:09:58.841
What if w = 1? The error is 4.

00:09:58.865 --> 00:10:01.232
And then the computer can
sort of play Marco Polo,
