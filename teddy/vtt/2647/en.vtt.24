00:11:59.715 --> 00:12:00.866
In this case,

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:04.167
what Mike is doing is varying y
over the space of different animals,

00:12:04.191 --> 00:12:06.573
in a network designed
to recognize and distinguish

00:12:06.597 --> 00:12:08.407
different animals from each other.

00:12:08.431 --> 00:12:12.182
And you get this strange, Escher-like
morph from one animal to another.

00:12:14.221 --> 00:12:18.835
Here he and Alex together
have tried reducing

00:12:18.859 --> 00:12:21.618
the y's to a space of only two dimensions,

00:12:21.642 --> 00:12:25.080
thereby making a map
out of the space of all things

00:12:25.104 --> 00:12:26.823
recognized by this network.

00:12:26.847 --> 00:12:28.870
Doing this kind of synthesis

00:12:28.894 --> 00:12:31.276
or generation of imagery
over that entire surface,
