So over the past year,
our work on machine perception

00:01:01.752 --> 00:01:06.611
has also unexpectedly connected

00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:11.840
I think Michelangelo
had a penetrating insight

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:15.520

This is a famous quote of his:

00:01:18.053 --> 00:01:21.376
"Every block of stone
has a statue inside of it,

00:01:22.036 --> 00:01:25.038
and the job of the sculptor
is to discover it."

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:29.245

is that we create by perceiving,
