00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.682
They're reminiscent, of course, of wires.

00:03:01.706 --> 00:03:05.163
That might have been obvious
to some people in the 19th century;

00:03:05.187 --> 00:03:09.501
the revolutions of wiring and electricity
were just getting underway.

00:03:09.964 --> 00:03:11.142
But in many ways,

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:14.479
these microanatomical drawings
of Ramón y Cajal's, like this one,

00:03:14.503 --> 00:03:16.835
they're still in some ways unsurpassed.

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.713
We're still more than a century later,

00:03:18.737 --> 00:03:21.562
trying to finish the job
that Ramón y Cajal started.

00:03:21.586 --> 00:03:24.720
These are raw data from our collaborators

00:03:24.744 --> 00:03:27.625
at the Max Planck Institute
of Neuroscience.

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:29.439
And what our collaborators have done

00:03:29.463 --> 00:03:34.464
is to image little pieces of brain tissue.
