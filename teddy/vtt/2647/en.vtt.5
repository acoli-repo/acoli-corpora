00:02:27.662 --> 00:02:31.832
that could selectively fill in
or render in very high contrast

00:02:31.856 --> 00:02:33.864
the individual cells in the brain,

00:02:33.888 --> 00:02:37.042
in order to start to understand
their morphologies.

00:02:37.972 --> 00:02:40.863
And these are the kinds of drawings
that he made of neurons

00:02:40.887 --> 00:02:42.096
in the 19th century.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.004
This is from a bird brain.

00:02:44.028 --> 00:02:47.085
And you see this incredible variety
of different sorts of cells,

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.544
even the cellular theory itself
was quite new at this point.

00:02:50.568 --> 00:02:51.846
And these structures,

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.129
these cells that have these arborizations,

00:02:54.153 --> 00:02:56.761
these branches that can go
very, very long distances --

00:02:56.785 --> 00:02:58.401
this was very novel at the time.

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.682
They're reminiscent, of course, of wires.
