00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:31.101
And those feed forward

00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:34.528
into one layer after another layer,
after another layer of neurons,

00:06:34.552 --> 00:06:37.585
all connected by synapses
of different weights.

00:06:37.609 --> 00:06:38.944
The behavior of this network

00:06:38.968 --> 00:06:42.252
is characterized by the strengths
of all of those synapses.

00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:45.564
Those characterize the computational
properties of this network.

00:06:45.588 --> 00:06:47.058
And at the end of the day,

00:06:47.082 --> 00:06:49.529
you have a neuron
or a small group of neurons

00:06:49.553 --> 00:06:51.200
that light up, saying, "bird."

00:06:51.824 --> 00:06:54.956
Now I'm going to represent
those three things --

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.676
the input pixels and the synapses
in the neural network,

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.285
and bird, the output --
