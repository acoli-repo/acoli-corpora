the process by which things
out there in the world --

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:33.489
sounds and images --

00:00:33.513 --> 00:00:35.691
can turn into concepts in the mind.

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:38.752
This is essential for our own brains,

00:00:38.776 --> 00:00:41.240
and it's also pretty useful on a computer.

00:00:41.636 --> 00:00:44.986
The machine perception algorithms,
for example, that our team makes,

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.884
are what enable your pictures
on Google Photos to become searchable,

00:00:48.908 --> 00:00:50.305

00:00:51.594 --> 00:00:55.087
The flip side of perception is creativity:

00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:58.149
turning a concept into something
out there into the world.

00:00:58.173 --> 00:01:01.728
So over the past year,
our work on machine perception
