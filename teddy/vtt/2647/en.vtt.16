00:07:58.723 --> 00:08:02.050
As you can see, that's actually
a relatively straightforward problem.

00:08:02.074 --> 00:08:04.260
You multiply two times three
and you're done.

00:08:04.862 --> 00:08:06.985
I'll show you an artificial neural network

00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:09.305
that we've built recently,
doing exactly that.

00:08:09.634 --> 00:08:12.494
This is running in real time
on a mobile phone,

00:08:12.518 --> 00:08:15.831
and that's, of course,
amazing in its own right,

00:08:15.855 --> 00:08:19.323
that mobile phones can do so many
billions and trillions of operations

00:08:19.347 --> 00:08:20.595
per second.

00:08:20.619 --> 00:08:22.234
What you're looking at is a phone

00:08:22.258 --> 00:08:25.805
looking at one after another
picture of a bird,

00:08:25.829 --> 00:08:28.544
and actually not only saying,
"Yes, it's a bird,"

00:08:28.568 --> 00:08:31.979
but identifying the species of bird
with a network of this sort.
