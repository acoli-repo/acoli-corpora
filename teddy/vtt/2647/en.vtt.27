This is what happens if Alex uses
his own face as a guide image

00:13:32.033 --> 00:13:35.354
during that optimization process
to reconstruct my own face.

00:13:36.284 --> 00:13:38.612
So you can see it's not perfect.

00:13:38.636 --> 00:13:40.510
There's still quite a lot of work to do

00:13:40.534 --> 00:13:42.987
on how we optimize
that optimization process.

00:13:43.011 --> 00:13:45.838
But you start to get something
more like a coherent face,

00:13:45.862 --> 00:13:47.876
rendered using my own face as a guide.

00:13:48.892 --> 00:13:51.393
You don't have to start
with a blank canvas

00:13:51.417 --> 00:13:52.573
or with white noise.

00:13:52.597 --> 00:13:53.901
When you're solving for x,

00:13:53.925 --> 00:13:57.814
you can begin with an x,
that is itself already some other image.

00:13:57.838 --> 00:14:00.394
That's what this little demonstration is.
