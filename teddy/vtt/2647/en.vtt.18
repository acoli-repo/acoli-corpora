00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.057
we know exactly how to do that: 6 = 2 x w,

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:03.393
well, we divide by two and we're done.

00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:06.221
The problem is with this operator.

00:09:06.823 --> 00:09:07.974
So, division --

00:09:07.998 --> 00:09:11.119
we've used division because
it's the inverse to multiplication,

00:09:11.143 --> 00:09:12.583
but as I've just said,

00:09:12.607 --> 00:09:15.056
the multiplication is a bit of a lie here.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.406
This is a very, very complicated,
very non-linear operation;

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.134
it has no inverse.

00:09:20.158 --> 00:09:23.308
So we have to figure out a way
to solve the equation

00:09:23.332 --> 00:09:25.356
without a division operator.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.723
And the way to do that
is fairly straightforward.

00:09:27.747 --> 00:09:30.418
You just say, let's play
a little algebra trick,
