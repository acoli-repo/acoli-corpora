00:05:59.366 --> 00:06:01.918
So what's going on between the pixels,

00:06:01.942 --> 00:06:05.970
between the image of the bird
and the word "bird,"

00:06:05.994 --> 00:06:08.808
is essentially a set of neurons
connected to each other

00:06:08.832 --> 00:06:09.987
in a neural network,

00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:11.234
as I'm diagramming here.

00:06:11.258 --> 00:06:14.530
This neural network could be biological,
inside our visual cortices,

00:06:14.554 --> 00:06:16.716
or, nowadays, we start
to have the capability

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.194
to model such neural networks
on the computer.

00:06:19.834 --> 00:06:22.187
And I'll show you what
that actually looks like.

00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:25.627
So the pixels you can think
about as a first layer of neurons,

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:27.890
and that's, in fact,
how it works in the eye --

00:06:27.914 --> 00:06:29.577
that's the neurons in the retina.

00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:31.101
And those feed forward
