And about a year ago,
Alex Mordvintsev, on our team,

00:11:00.086 --> 00:11:03.636
decided to experiment
with what happens if we try solving for x,

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.697
given a known w and a known y.

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:07.275
In other words,

00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:08.651
you know that it's a bird,

00:11:08.675 --> 00:11:11.978
and you already have your neural network
that you've trained on birds,

00:11:12.002 --> 00:11:14.346
but what is the picture of a bird?

00:11:15.034 --> 00:11:20.058
It turns out that by using exactly
the same error-minimization procedure,

00:11:20.082 --> 00:11:23.512
one can do that with the network
trained to recognize birds,

00:11:23.536 --> 00:11:26.924
and the result turns out to be ...
