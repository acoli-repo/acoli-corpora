00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.924
So, I lead a team at Google
that works on machine intelligence;

00:00:03.948 --> 00:00:08.598
in other words, the engineering discipline
of making computers and devices

00:00:08.622 --> 00:00:11.041
able to do some of the things
that brains do.

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.538
And this makes us
interested in real brains

00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:15.851
and neuroscience as well,

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:20.047
and especially interested
in the things that our brains do

00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:24.113
that are still far superior
to the performance of computers.

00:00:25.209 --> 00:00:28.818
Historically, one of those areas
has been perception,

00:00:28.842 --> 00:00:31.881
the process by which things
