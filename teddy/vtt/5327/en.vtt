In 1901, David Hänig published a paper

00:00:09.912 --> 00:00:13.930
that forever changed 
our understanding of taste.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.727
His research led to what we know 
today as the taste map:

00:00:17.727 --> 00:00:22.278
an illustration that divides the tongue 
into four separate areas.

00:00:22.278 --> 00:00:23.588
According to this map,

00:00:23.588 --> 00:00:27.028
receptors at the tip of our tongues
capture sweetness,

00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:29.700
bitterness 
is detected at the tongue’s base,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.985
and along the sides, receptors capture 
salty and sour sensations.
