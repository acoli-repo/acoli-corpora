of your central nervous system,

00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:42.125
the patients often remain
with a severe handicap.

00:00:43.203 --> 00:00:45.416
And that's probably
the reason why I've chosen

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.103
to be a functional neurosurgeon.

00:00:49.144 --> 00:00:51.052
What is a functional neurosurgeon?

00:00:51.978 --> 00:00:56.338
It's a doctor who is trying to improve
a neurological function

00:00:56.362 --> 00:00:58.679
through different surgical strategies.
