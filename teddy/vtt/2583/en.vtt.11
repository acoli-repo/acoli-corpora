00:05:29.857 --> 00:05:32.095
we got our stem cell culture.

00:05:33.363 --> 00:05:35.997
And we were in front
of a potential new source of cells

00:05:36.021 --> 00:05:37.472
to repair the brain.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:39.561
And we had to prove this.

00:05:39.585 --> 00:05:40.736
So to prove it,

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.608
we decided to design
an experimental paradigm.

00:05:44.632 --> 00:05:47.855
The idea was to biopsy a piece of brain

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:50.578
in a non-eloquent area of the brain,

00:05:50.602 --> 00:05:52.313
and then to culture the cells

00:05:52.337 --> 00:05:55.124
exactly the way Jean-François
did it in his lab.

00:05:55.148 --> 00:05:58.043
And then label them, to put color in them

00:05:58.067 --> 00:06:00.740
in order to be able
to track them in the brain.
