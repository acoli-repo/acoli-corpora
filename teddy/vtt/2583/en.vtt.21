if you project yourself out in time,

00:10:30.736 --> 00:10:34.434
how many years before
somebody gets into a hospital

00:10:34.458 --> 00:10:36.631
and this therapy is available?

00:10:37.555 --> 00:10:39.690
JB: So, it's very difficult to say.

00:10:39.714 --> 00:10:43.648
It depends, first,
on the approval of the trial.

00:10:43.672 --> 00:10:46.775
Will the regulation allow us
to do it soon?

00:10:46.799 --> 00:10:49.613
And then, you have to perform
this kind of study

00:10:49.637 --> 00:10:52.437
in a small group of patients.

00:10:52.461 --> 00:10:55.386
So it takes, already, a long time
to select the patients,

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.316
do the treatment

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:01.069
and evaluate if it's useful
to do this kind of treatment.
