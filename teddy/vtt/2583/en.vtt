00:00:00.896 --> 00:00:02.579
So I'm a neurosurgeon.

00:00:03.746 --> 00:00:05.649
And like most of my colleagues,

00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:09.329
I have to deal, every day,
with human tragedies.

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.354
I realize how your life can change
from one second to the other

00:00:15.378 --> 00:00:19.423
after a major stroke
or after a car accident.

00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:23.783
And what is very frustrating
for us neurosurgeons

00:00:23.807 --> 00:00:28.427
is to realize that unlike
other organs of the body,

00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:31.930
the brain has very little
ability for self-repair.
