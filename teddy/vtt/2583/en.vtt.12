00:05:58.067 --> 00:06:00.740
in order to be able
to track them in the brain.

00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:03.424
And the last step was to re-implant them

00:06:03.448 --> 00:06:05.231
in the same individual.

00:06:05.255 --> 00:06:06.406
We call these

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.231
autologous grafts -- autografts.

00:06:09.602 --> 00:06:12.045
So the first question we had,

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:17.310
"What will happen if we re-implant
these cells in a normal brain,

00:06:17.334 --> 00:06:20.192
and what will happen
if we re-implant the same cells

00:06:20.216 --> 00:06:21.439
in a lesioned brain?"

00:06:21.463 --> 00:06:24.852
Thanks to the help
of professor Eric Rouiller,

00:06:24.876 --> 00:06:26.542
we worked with monkeys.

00:06:27.414 --> 00:06:29.854
So in the first-case scenario,

00:06:29.878 --> 00:06:33.383
we re-implanted the cells
in the normal brain
