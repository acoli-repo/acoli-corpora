00:03:28.453 --> 00:03:34.096
with large green cells
surrounding small, immature cells.

00:03:35.168 --> 00:03:38.422
And you may remember from biology class

00:03:38.446 --> 00:03:41.957
that stem cells are immature cells,

00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:45.860
able to turn into any type
of cell of the body.

00:03:47.423 --> 00:03:52.051
The adult brain has stem cells,
but they're very rare

00:03:52.075 --> 00:03:56.454
and they're located
in deep and small niches

00:03:56.478 --> 00:03:58.495
in the depths of the brain.

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.221
So it was surprising to get
this kind of stem cell culture
