00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:33.953
(Applause)

00:09:33.977 --> 00:09:37.279
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is amazing,

00:09:37.303 --> 00:09:41.054
and I'm sure that right now, there are
several dozen people in the audience,

00:09:41.078 --> 00:09:42.284
possibly even a majority,

00:09:42.308 --> 00:09:45.056
who are thinking, "I know
somebody who can use this."

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.340
I do, in any case.

00:09:47.364 --> 00:09:49.660
And of course the question is,

00:09:49.684 --> 00:09:51.762
what are the biggest obstacles

00:09:51.786 --> 00:09:54.577
before you can go
into human clinical trials?

00:09:55.665 --> 00:10:01.171
Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest
obstacles are regulations. (Laughs)
