00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.006
So you need to find the right nutrients,

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.799
the warmth, the humidity

00:03:03.823 --> 00:03:07.059
and all the nice environments
to make them thrive.

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:09.894
So that's exactly what we had
to do with these cells.

00:03:10.425 --> 00:03:12.291
And after many attempts,

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.726
Jean-François did it.

00:03:15.372 --> 00:03:18.569
And that's what he saw
under his microscope.

00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:22.039
And that was, for us, a major surprise.

00:03:22.412 --> 00:03:23.563
Why?

00:03:23.587 --> 00:03:28.429
Because this looks exactly the same
as a stem cell culture,

00:03:28.453 --> 00:03:34.096
with large green cells
surrounding small, immature cells.
