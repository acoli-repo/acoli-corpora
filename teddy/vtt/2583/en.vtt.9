00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:30.456
they even died.

00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:34.973
So we were in front of a strange
new cell population

00:04:34.997 --> 00:04:38.091
that looked like stem cells
but behaved differently.

00:04:39.052 --> 00:04:43.496
And it took us a long time
to understand where they came from.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.065
They come from these cells.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.993
These blue and red cells are called
doublecortin-positive cells.

00:04:52.195 --> 00:04:54.747
All of you have them in your brain.

00:04:55.353 --> 00:04:59.253
They represent four percent
of your cortical brain cells.

00:04:59.857 --> 00:05:03.929
They have a very important role
during the development stage.
