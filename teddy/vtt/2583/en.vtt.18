00:08:57.321 --> 00:09:01.027
Since that time, we've understood
much more about these cells.

00:09:01.575 --> 00:09:03.971
We know that we can cryopreserve them,

00:09:03.995 --> 00:09:05.857
we can use them later on.

00:09:06.214 --> 00:09:10.104
We know that we can apply them
in other neuropathological models,

00:09:10.128 --> 00:09:12.097
like Parkinson's disease, for example.

00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:15.278
But our dream is still
to implant them in humans.

00:09:16.469 --> 00:09:20.219
And I really hope that I'll be able
to show you soon

00:09:21.605 --> 00:09:26.599
that the human brain is giving us
the tools to repair itself.

00:09:26.623 --> 00:09:27.943
Thank you.

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:33.953
