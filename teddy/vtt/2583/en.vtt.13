00:06:29.878 --> 00:06:33.383
we re-implanted the cells
in the normal brain

00:06:33.407 --> 00:06:38.442
and what we saw is that they completely
disappeared after a few weeks,

00:06:38.466 --> 00:06:41.420
as if they were taken from the brain,

00:06:41.444 --> 00:06:42.955
they go back home,

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:44.535
the space is already busy,

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:46.789
they are not needed there,
so they disappear.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.758
In the second-case scenario,

00:06:49.782 --> 00:06:51.013
we performed the lesion,

00:06:51.037 --> 00:06:54.177
we re-implanted exactly the same cells,

00:06:54.201 --> 00:06:58.274
and in this case, the cells remained --

00:06:58.298 --> 00:07:01.095
and they became mature neurons.
