You've certainly heard of
one of the famous ones

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.486
called deep brain stimulation,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.362
where you implant an electrode
in the depths of the brain

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:12.962
in order to modulate a circuit of neurons

00:01:12.986 --> 00:01:14.878
to improve a neurological function.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.396
It's really an amazing technology

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.787
in that it has improved
the destiny of patients

00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:22.633
with Parkinson's disease,

00:01:22.657 --> 00:01:25.763
with severe tremor, with severe pain.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.456
However, neuromodulation
does not mean neuro-repair.
