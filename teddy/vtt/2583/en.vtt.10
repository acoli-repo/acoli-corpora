00:04:59.857 --> 00:05:03.929
They have a very important role
during the development stage.

00:05:03.953 --> 00:05:05.708
When you were fetuses,

00:05:06.457 --> 00:05:09.129
they helped your brain to fold itself.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.635
But why do they stay in your head?

00:05:13.371 --> 00:05:14.778
This, we don't know.

00:05:15.414 --> 00:05:18.636
We think that they may
participate in brain repair

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.124
because we find them
in higher concentration

00:05:22.148 --> 00:05:23.300
close to brain lesions.

00:05:23.324 --> 00:05:24.942
But it's not so sure.

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:28.212
But there is one clear thing --

00:05:28.236 --> 00:05:29.833
that from these cells,

00:05:29.857 --> 00:05:32.095
we got our stem cell culture.
