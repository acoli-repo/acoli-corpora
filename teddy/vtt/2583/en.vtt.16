00:07:58.737 --> 00:08:00.524
Patients are completely plegic,

00:08:00.548 --> 00:08:05.656
and then they try to recover
due to a brain plasticity mechanism,

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.320
they recover to a certain extent,

00:08:07.344 --> 00:08:09.185
exactly the same for the monkey.

00:08:09.209 --> 00:08:12.653
So when we were sure that the monkey
had reached his plateau

00:08:12.677 --> 00:08:15.105
of spontaneous recovery,

00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:17.704
we implanted his own cells.

00:08:18.287 --> 00:08:23.823
So on the left side, you see the monkey
that has spontaneously recovered.

00:08:25.426 --> 00:08:30.058
He's at about 40 to 50 percent
of his previous performance
