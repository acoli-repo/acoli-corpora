00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.221
So it was surprising to get
this kind of stem cell culture

00:04:02.245 --> 00:04:04.604
from the superficial part
of swollen brain we had

00:04:04.628 --> 00:04:06.245
in the operating theater.

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.875
And there was another
intriguing observation:

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.116
Regular stem cells
are very active cells --

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.713
cells that divide, divide,
divide very quickly.

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:20.729
And they never die,
they're immortal cells.

00:04:21.407 --> 00:04:23.798
But these cells behave differently.

00:04:24.663 --> 00:04:26.846
They divide slowly,

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.870
and after a few weeks of culture,

00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:30.456
they even died.
