00:01:59.156 --> 00:02:01.176
At that time, I was a chief resident

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.113
working days and nights
in the emergency room.

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.828
I often had to take care
of patients with head trauma.

00:02:09.193 --> 00:02:13.654
You have to imagine that when a patient
comes in with a severe head trauma,

00:02:13.678 --> 00:02:15.977
his brain is swelling

00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:18.981
and he's increasing
his intracranial pressure.

00:02:19.716 --> 00:02:21.945
And in order to save his life,

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.777
you have to decrease
this intracranial pressure.

00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:25.952
And to do that,

00:02:25.976 --> 00:02:29.896
you sometimes have to remove
a piece of swollen brain.
