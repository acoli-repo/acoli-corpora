So instead of throwing away
these pieces of swollen brain,

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.448
we decided with Jean-François Brunet,

00:02:37.472 --> 00:02:39.385
who is a colleague of mine, a biologist,

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:40.583
to study them.

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.150
What do I mean by that?

00:02:43.174 --> 00:02:47.207

00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:49.903
It's not an easy task.

00:02:50.577 --> 00:02:52.942
Growing cells from a piece of tissue

00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:56.425
is a bit the same as growing
very small children

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:57.919

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.006
So you need to find the right nutrients,
