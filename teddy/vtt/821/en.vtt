is the traditional way of learning human anatomy.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
For students, it's quite an experience,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but for a school, it could be very difficult

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
or expensive to maintain.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So we learned the majority of anatomic classes taught,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
they do not have a cadaver dissection lab.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Maybe those reasons, or depending on where you are,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
cadavers may not be easily available.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So to address this, we developed
