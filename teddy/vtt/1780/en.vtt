Now, since this is TEDGlobal,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
who can tell me what this is called in French?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy --

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
"vielle Ã  roue."

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And in Spanish, "zanfona."

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And in Italian, "ghironda," okay?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Hurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So, these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that uses a crank to turn a wheel

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to rub strings, like the bow of a violin,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to produce music.
