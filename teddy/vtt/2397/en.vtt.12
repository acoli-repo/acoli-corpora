00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.786
Where was the world acting together

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.045
to deal with the problems
that they knew arose

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:05.502
from the potential for earthquakes,

00:06:05.526 --> 00:06:07.623
as well as the potential
for climate change?

00:06:07.647 --> 00:06:09.696
And when the world
starts to work together,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.409
with better early-warning systems,

00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:14.115
you can deal with some
of these problems in a better way.

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:16.262
I just think we're not seeing,
at the moment,

00:06:16.286 --> 00:06:20.216
the huge opportunities open to us
by the ability of people to cooperate

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.217
in a world where either
there was isolationism before

00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:26.976
or there was limited alliances
based on convenience

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.466
which never actually took you to deal
with some of the central problems.
