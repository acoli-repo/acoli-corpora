00:00:58.418 --> 00:01:00.379
But I don't think we should underestimate

00:01:00.403 --> 00:01:02.976
the extent to which
massive changes in technology

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.185
make possible the linking up
of people across the world.

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:09.976
CA: But people get excited
about this idea of global citizenship,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.976
but then they get confused a bit again

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
when they start thinking about patriotism,

00:01:14.024 --> 00:01:15.738
and how to combine these two.

00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:17.976
I mean, you're elected as Prime Minister

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.292
with a brief to bat for Britain.

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:24.396
How do you reconcile the two things?

00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:27.898
GB: Well, of course national identity
remains important.

00:01:27.922 --> 00:01:31.638
But it's not at the expense of people
accepting their global responsibilities.
