00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.781
But they are now out of date.
They don't deal with the problems.

00:08:30.805 --> 00:08:32.940
You can't deal
with the environmental problem

00:08:32.964 --> 00:08:34.439
through existing institutions.

00:08:34.463 --> 00:08:37.976
You can't deal with the security problem
in the way that you need to.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.572
You can't deal with the economic
and financial problem.

00:08:40.596 --> 00:08:42.976
So we have got to rebuild
our global institutions,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.219
build them in a way that is suitable
to the challenges of this time.

00:08:46.243 --> 00:08:49.311
And I believe that if you look
at the biggest challenge we face,

00:08:49.335 --> 00:08:51.977
it is to persuade people
to have the confidence

00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:54.482
that we can build a truly global society

00:08:54.506 --> 00:08:57.586
with the institutions
that are founded on these rules.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.927
So, I come back to my initial point.

00:08:59.951 --> 00:09:01.952
Sometimes you think things are impossible.
