00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:30.976
There is so much to do
over the next few years

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.976
that is obvious to so many of us

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.636
to build a better world.

00:00:36.176 --> 00:00:40.542
And there is so much shared sense
of what we need to do,

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.572
that it is vital
that we all come together.

00:00:42.596 --> 00:00:45.298
But we don't necessarily have
the means to do so.

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:47.116
So there are challenges to be met.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.976
I believe the concept
of global citizenship

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.976
will simply grow out of people talking
to each other across continents.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.434
But of course the task
is to create the institutions

00:00:56.458 --> 00:00:58.394
that make that global society work.

00:00:58.418 --> 00:01:00.379
But I don't think we should underestimate
