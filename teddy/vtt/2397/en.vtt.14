the idealism can get moved away.

00:07:01.626 --> 00:07:07.096
I'm just wondering whether
you can see that changing over time,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.976
whether you see in Britain

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.660
that there are changing attitudes,

00:07:10.684 --> 00:07:12.813
and that people are actually
more supportive

00:07:12.837 --> 00:07:15.836
of the kind of global ethic
that you talk about.

00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:19.280

and I'm not just talking here
to people of faith or religion --

00:07:22.433 --> 00:07:26.060
it has this global ethic
at the center of its credo.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.783
And whether it's Jewish
or whether it's Muslim

00:07:29.807 --> 00:07:32.640
or whether it's Hindu,
or whether it's Sikh,
