00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.976
then the danger of Al Qaeda
and related groups

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.976
making progress in Africa is very big.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.976
So, I would say that what seems sometimes

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.818

or in relation to developing countries,

00:04:11.842 --> 00:04:12.991
is more than that.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.420

do, in the long run, come together.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.239
And whatever the short-run price
for taking action on climate change

00:04:28.263 --> 00:04:30.946
or on security, or taking action
to provide opportunities
