00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.276
I mean look, 1918,
the Treaty of Versailles,

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.112
and all the treaties before that,

00:10:05.136 --> 00:10:07.263
the Treaty of Westphalia
and everything else,

00:10:07.287 --> 00:10:09.907
were about protecting
the sovereign right of countries

00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:11.250
to do what they want.

00:10:11.274 --> 00:10:13.526
Since then, the world has moved forward,

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.527
partly as a result of what happened
with the Holocaust,

00:10:16.551 --> 00:10:19.398
and people's concern
about the rights of individuals

00:10:19.422 --> 00:10:22.976
within territories
where they need protection,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.801
partly because of what we saw in Rwanda,

00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:27.802
partly because of what we saw in Bosnia.

00:10:27.826 --> 00:10:29.976
The idea of the responsibility to protect

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.976
all individuals who are in situations
where they are at humanitarian risk
