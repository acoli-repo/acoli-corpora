00:07:29.807 --> 00:07:32.640
or whether it's Hindu,
or whether it's Sikh,

00:07:32.664 --> 00:07:37.659
the same global ethic is at the heart
of each of these religions.

00:07:37.683 --> 00:07:39.976
So, I think you're dealing with something

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.791
that people instinctively
see as part of their moral sense.

00:07:44.815 --> 00:07:48.577
So you're building on something
that is not pure self-interest.

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:52.578
You're building
on people's ideas and values --

00:07:52.602 --> 00:07:58.269
that perhaps they're candles
that burn very dimly on certain occasions.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.878
But it is a set of values that cannot,
in my view, be extinguished.
