00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.976
all individuals who are in situations
where they are at humanitarian risk

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.048
is now being established as a principle
which governs the world.

00:10:37.072 --> 00:10:40.691
So, while I can't automatically say

00:10:40.715 --> 00:10:46.976
that Britain will rush to the aid
of any citizen of any country, in danger,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.976
I can say that Britain is in a position

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.976
where we're working with other countries

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.286
so that this idea
that you have a responsibility

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:59.588
to protect people who are victims
of either genocide or humanitarian attack,

00:10:59.612 --> 00:11:01.937
is something that is accepted
by the whole world.
