Chris Anderson: Thank you
so much, Prime Minister,

00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:12.596
that was both fascinating
and quite inspiring.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.302
So, you're calling for a global ethic.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.976
Would you describe that
as global citizenship?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.191
Is that an idea that you believe in,
and how would you define that?

00:00:23.215 --> 00:00:25.341
Gordon Brown: It is
about global citizenship

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:27.562
and recognizing
our responsibilities to others.

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:30.976
There is so much to do
over the next few years
