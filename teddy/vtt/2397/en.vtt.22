00:10:59.612 --> 00:11:01.937
is something that is accepted
by the whole world.

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:03.962
Now, in the end, that can only be achieved

00:11:03.986 --> 00:11:07.564
if your international institutions
work well enough to be able to do so.

00:11:07.588 --> 00:11:10.732
And that comes back to what the future
role of the United Nations,

00:11:10.756 --> 00:11:12.976
and what it can do, actually is.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.976
But, the responsibility to protect
is a new idea that is, in a sense,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.632
taken over from the idea
of self-determination

00:11:19.656 --> 00:11:22.403
as the principle governing
the international community.

00:11:22.427 --> 00:11:24.976
CA: Can you picture, in our lifetimes,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.420
a politician ever going out on a platform

00:11:28.444 --> 00:11:33.110
of the kind of full-form global ethic,
global citizenship?
