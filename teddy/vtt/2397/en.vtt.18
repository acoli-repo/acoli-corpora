Sometimes you think things are impossible.

00:09:01.976 --> 00:09:03.929
Nobody would have said 50 years ago

00:09:03.953 --> 00:09:05.976
that apartheid would have gone in 1990,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.399
or that the Berlin wall would have fallen
at the turn of the '80s and '90s,

00:09:10.423 --> 00:09:12.197
or that polio could be eradicated,

00:09:12.221 --> 00:09:13.662
or perhaps 60 years ago,

00:09:13.686 --> 00:09:16.154
nobody would have said
a man could gone to the Moon.

00:09:16.178 --> 00:09:17.976
All these things have happened.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.976
By tackling the impossible,
you make the impossible possible.

00:09:21.416 --> 00:09:24.976
CA: And we have had a speaker
who said that very thing,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.419
and swallowed a sword right
after that, which was quite dramatic.

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:29.576
(Laughter)

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.976
GB: Followed my sword and swallow.
