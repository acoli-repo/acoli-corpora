00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.878
But it is a set of values that cannot,
in my view, be extinguished.

00:08:02.902 --> 00:08:04.457
Then the question is,

00:08:04.481 --> 00:08:07.139
how do you make that change happen?

00:08:07.163 --> 00:08:11.051
How do you persuade people
that it is in their interest

00:08:11.075 --> 00:08:12.814
to build strong --

00:08:12.838 --> 00:08:14.342
After the Second World War,

00:08:14.366 --> 00:08:17.343
we built institutions, the United Nations,

00:08:17.367 --> 00:08:18.730
the IMF, the World Bank,

00:08:18.754 --> 00:08:21.588
the World Trade Organization,
the Marshall Plan.

00:08:21.612 --> 00:08:25.645
There was a period in which people
talked about an act of creation,

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:27.646
because these institutions were so new.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.781
But they are now out of date.
They don't deal with the problems.
