00:01:27.922 --> 00:01:31.638
But it's not at the expense of people
accepting their global responsibilities.

00:01:31.662 --> 00:01:34.716
And I think one
of the problems of recession

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.843
is that people become more protectionist,

00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:39.652
they look in on themselves,

00:01:39.676 --> 00:01:41.976
they try to protect their own nation,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.248
perhaps at the expense of other nations.

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:47.976
When you actually look
at the motor of the world economy,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.737
it cannot move forward

00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:52.656
unless there is trade
between the different countries.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.195
And any nation that would become
protectionist over the next few years

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.976
would deprive itself of the chance
of getting the benefits

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.076
of growth in the world economy.
