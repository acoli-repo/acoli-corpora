WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Last year here at TED

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I asked you to give me your data,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to put your data on the web, on the basis

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that if people put data onto the web --

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
government data, scientific data, community data,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
whatever it is -- it will be used by other people

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to do wonderful things, in ways

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that they never could have imagined.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So, today I'm back just to show you a few things,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to show you, in fact, there is

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
an open data movement afoot,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
now, around the world.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The cry of "Raw data now!"
