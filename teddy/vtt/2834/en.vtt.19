00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.640
So that's why I do everything in my power
not to talk about the future.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.040
I talk about futures.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.656
It opens the conversation again.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.136
So when you're sitting and thinking

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.336
about how do we move forward
on this major issue --

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.896
it could be at home,

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.896
it could be at work,

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.776
it could be again on the global stage --

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.216
don't cut yourself off from thinking
about something beyond technology as a fix

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.776
because we're more concerned
about technological evolution right now

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.936
than we are about moral evolution.
