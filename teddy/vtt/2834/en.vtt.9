00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.456
and you do --

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.936
no offense to the consultants
in here who do that --

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.576
and you do a long-term plan,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.040
and then two weeks later,
everyone forgets about it.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.840
Right? Or a week later.
If you're lucky, three months.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.416
It's a practice because
it's not necessarily a thing that you do.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.216
It's a process where you have
to revisit different ways of thinking

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.656
for every major decision
that you're working on.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.160
So I want to go through
those three ways of thinking.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.520
So the first: transgenerational thinking.
