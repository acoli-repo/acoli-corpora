00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.680
And you have to kind of think,
"OK, I can do this."

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.160
But what is this teaching them?

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.096
So what does it mean
if I actually bring some paper

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.856
or engage with them in conversation?

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.736
It's hard. It's not easy,
and I'm making this very personal.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.136
It's actually more traumatic

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.896
than some of the big issues
that I work on in the world --

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.760
entertaining my kids at dinner.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.696
But what it does is it connects them
here in the present with me,

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.976
but it also --

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.456
and this is the crux
of transgenerational thinking ethics --

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.776
it sets them up to how they're
going to interact with their kids
