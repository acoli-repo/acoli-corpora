Now, this isn't something that just has to
be done at the Security Council chamber.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.736
It's something that you can do
in a very kind of personal way.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.176
So every once in a while, if I'm lucky,
my wife and I like to go out to dinner,

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.456
and we have three children
under the age of seven.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.909
So you can imagine
it's a very peaceful, quiet meal.

00:06:19.933 --> 00:06:21.136
(Laughter)

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.736
So we sit down and literally
all I want to do is just eat and chill,

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.416
and my kids have a completely
and totally different idea

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.016
of what we're going to be doing.
