00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.000
We can push through that.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.440
Now I'm getting more comfortable

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.440
in the fact that at some point

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.640
in the inevitable future,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.200
I will die.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.336
But because of these new ways
of thinking and doing,

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.296
both in the outside world
and also with my family at home,

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.456
and what I'm leaving my kids,
I get more comfortable in that fact.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.616
And it's something that a lot of us
are really uncomfortable with,

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.840
but I'm telling you,

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.256
think it through.
