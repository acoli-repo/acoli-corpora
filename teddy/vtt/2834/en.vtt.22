00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.400
And unless you define what comes after,
people aren't going to move.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.816
The businesses --
this isn't just about business --

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.176
but the businesses that do consistently,
who break out of short-termism

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.216
not surprisingly
are family-run businesses.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.816
They're transgenerational. They're telos.
They think about the futures.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.536
And this is an ad for Patek Philippe.
They're 175 years old,

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.616
and what's amazing
is that they literally embody

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.456
this kind of longpathian sense
in their brand,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.376
because, by the way,
you never actually own a Patek Philippe,

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.976
and I definitely won't --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.016
(Laughter)
