00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.176
So I've been "futuring,"
which is a term I made up --

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.456
(Laughter)

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.696
about three seconds ago.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.536
I've been futuring for about 20 years,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.896
and when I first started,
I would sit down with people,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.816
and say, "Hey,
let's talk 10, 20 years out."

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.616
And they'd say, "Great."

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.136
And I've been seeing that time horizon

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.216
get shorter and shorter

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.856
and shorter,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.256
so much so that I met
with a CEO two months ago

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.656
and I said -- we started
our initial conversation.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.416
He goes, "I love what you do.
I want to talk about the next six months."
