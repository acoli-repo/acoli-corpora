00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.016
(Laughter)

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.040
unless somebody wants to just
throw 25,000 dollars on the stage.

00:11:34.064 --> 00:11:37.264
You merely look after it
for the next generation.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.296
So it's important that we remember,

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.456
the future, we treat it like a noun.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.736
It's not. It's a verb.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.016
It requires action.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.856
It requires us to push into it.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.816
It's not this thing that washes over us.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.496
It's something that we
actually have total control over.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.416
But in a short-term society,
we end up feeling like we don't.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.776
We feel like we're trapped.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.000
We can push through that.
