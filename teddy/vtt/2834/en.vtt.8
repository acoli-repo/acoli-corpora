00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.016
into a different future
than the one we have right now,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.096
because I don't think we've hit --

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.096
2016 is not peak civilization.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.456

And longpath isn't
a kind of one-and-done exercise.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.416
I'm sure everyone here
at some point has done an off-site

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.536
with a lot of Post-It notes
and whiteboards,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.456
and you do --
