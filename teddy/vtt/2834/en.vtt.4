00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.696
from spending quality
one-on-one time with their students.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.856
So right now in America,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.720
a high school student
drops out every 26 seconds.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.096
Short-termism prevents Congress --

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.736
sorry if there's anyone
in here from Congress --

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.296
(Laughter)

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.376
or not really that sorry --

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.616
(Laughter)

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.816
from putting money
into a real infrastructure bill.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.456
So what we get
is the I-35W bridge collapse

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.296
over the Mississippi a few years ago,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.520
13 killed.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.520
It wasn't always like this.
We did the Panama Canal.
