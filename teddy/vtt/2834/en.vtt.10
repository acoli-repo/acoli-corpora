00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.520
So the first: transgenerational thinking.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.576
I love the philosophers:

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.416
Plato, Socrates, Habermas, Heidegger.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.640
I was raised on them.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.976
But they all did one thing

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.976
that didn't actually seem like a big deal

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.336
until I really started
kind of looking into this.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.176
And they all took,

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.096
as a unit of measure
for their entire reality

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.073
of what it meant to be virtuous and good,

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.080
the single lifespan,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.160
from birth to death.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.696
But here's a problem with these issues:

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.136
they stack up on top of us,

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.296
because the only way we know
how to do something good in the world
