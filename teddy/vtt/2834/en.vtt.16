00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.776
we always put it through
a technological lens,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.056
a tech-centric, a techno-utopia,
and there's nothing wrong with that,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.376
but it's something that we have to
really think deeply about

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.256
if we're going to move
on these major issues,

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.336
because it wasn't always like this. Right?

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.000
The ancients had their way of thinking

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.360
about what the future was.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:24.536
The Church definitely had their idea
of what the future could be,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.496
and you could actually pay your way
into that future. Right?

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.456
And luckily for humanity,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.616
we got the scientific revolution.
