00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.296
because the only way we know
how to do something good in the world

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.536
is if we do it between
our birth and our death.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.256
That's what we're programmed to do.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.736
If you go to the self-help section
in any bookstore,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.000
it's all about you.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.256
Which is great,

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.200
unless you're dealing
with some of these major issues.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.400
And so with transgenerational thinking,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.936
which is really kind of
transgenerational ethics,

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.576
you're able to expand
how you think about these problems,

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.360
what is your role
in helping to solve them.
