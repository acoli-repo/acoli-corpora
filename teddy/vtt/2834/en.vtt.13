00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.016
of what we're going to be doing.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.376
And so my first idea

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.296
is my sandbag strategy, right?

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.656
It's to go into my pocket
and take out the iPhone

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.136
and give them "Frozen"

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.120
or some other bestselling game thing.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.936
And then I stop

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.536
and I have to kind of put on
this transgenerational thinking cap.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.536
I don't do this in the restaurant,
because it would be bizarre,

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.856
but I have to --

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.496
I did it once, and that's how
I learned it was bizarre.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.536
(Laughter)

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.680
And you have to kind of think,
"OK, I can do this."
