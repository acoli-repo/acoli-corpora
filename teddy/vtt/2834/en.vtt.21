00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.456
Three, five years doesn't cut it.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.760
It's 30, 40, 50, 100 years.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.016
In Homer's epic, "The Odyssey,"

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.096
Odysseus had the answer to his "what end."

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.520
It was Ithaca.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.976
It was this bold vision
of what he wanted --

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.376
to return to Penelope.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.016
And I can tell you,
because of the work that I'm doing,

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.896
but also you know it intuitively --
we have lost our Ithaca.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.456
We have lost our "to what end,"
so we stay on this hamster wheel.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.656
And yes, we're trying
to solve these problems,

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.520
but what comes after we solve the problem?
