He goes, "I love what you do.
I want to talk about the next six months."

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.040
(Laughter)

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.176
We have a lot of problems
that we are facing.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.920
These are civilizational-scale problems.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.960
The issue though is,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.296
we can't solve them

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.896
using the mental models
that we use right now

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.496
to try and solve these problems.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.176
Yes, a lot of great
technical work is being done,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.576
but there is a problem that
we need to solve for a priori, before,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.400
if we want to really
move the needle on those big problems.
