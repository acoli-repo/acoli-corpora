00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.216
So when we think, well,
how are we going to deal with climate

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.816
or with poverty or homelessness,

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.960
our first reaction is to think about it
through a technology lens.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.696
And look, I'm not advocating
that we go to this guy.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.640
I love Joel, don't get me wrong,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.056
but I'm not saying we go to Joel.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.896
What I'm saying is we have to rethink

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.696
our base assumption about
only looking at the future in one way,

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.856
only looking at it
through the dominant lens.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.056
Because our problems
are so big and so vast

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.896
that we need to open ourselves up.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.640
So that's why I do everything in my power
not to talk about the future.
