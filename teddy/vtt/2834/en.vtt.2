00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.400
if we want to really
move the needle on those big problems.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.896
"Short-termism."

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.376
Right? There's no marches.
There's no bracelets.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.256
There's no petitions that you can sign
to be against short-termism.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.096
I tried to put one up, and no one signed.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.336
It was weird.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.560
(Laughter)

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.296
But it prevents us from doing so much.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.016
Short-termism, for many reasons,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.936
has pervaded every
nook and cranny of our reality.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.536
I just want you to take a second

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.376
and just think about an issue
that you're thinking, working on.
