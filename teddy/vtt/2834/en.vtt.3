that you're thinking, working on.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.376
It could be personal, it could be at work

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.456
or it could be
move-the-needle world stuff,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.816
and think about
how far out you tend to think

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.360
about the solution set for that.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.336

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.000
from buying really

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.720
So we get the Deepwater Horizon.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.136
Short-termism prevents teachers

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.696
from spending quality
one-on-one time with their students.
