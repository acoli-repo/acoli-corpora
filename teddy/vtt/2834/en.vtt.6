WEBVTT

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.136
We take people who are fleeing
their war-torn country,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.416
and we go after them.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.056
We take low-level drug offenders,
and we put them away for life.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.456
And then we build McMansions
without even thinking

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.346
about how people are going
to get between them and their job.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.850
It's a quick buck.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.096
Now, the reality is,
for a lot of these problems,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.896
there are some technical fixes,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.136
a lot of them.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.696
I call these technical fixes
sandbag strategies.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.416
So you know there's a storm coming,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.176
the levee is broken,
no one's put any money into it,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.016
you surround your home with sandbags.
