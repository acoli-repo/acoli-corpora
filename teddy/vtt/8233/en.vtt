00:00:00.997 --> 00:00:03.499
I'm a total wildlife nerd.

00:00:04.417 --> 00:00:06.836
But Iâ€™m also a career technologist,

00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:10.048
and it took me 20 years to figure out
how to combine the two

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:11.966
towards wildlife conservation.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:14.594
But I think I finally got it.

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:19.557
Technology has come so far
in that time in generating data

00:00:19.557 --> 00:00:23.019
about our planet and its other
non-human inhabitants.

00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:25.813
For example, there's a satellite in space

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:29.901
that's dedicated to tracking
the movements of hundreds of species.
