Most of the black holes that we’ve found 
can be thought of as two main types.

00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:05.698
The smaller ones, 
called stellar mass black holes,

00:02:05.698 --> 00:02:10.361
have a mass up to 100 times larger 
than that of our sun.

00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:14.442
They’re formed when a massive star 
consumes all its nuclear fuel

00:02:14.442 --> 00:02:17.692
and its core collapses.

00:02:17.692 --> 00:02:22.878
We’ve observed several of these
objects as close as 3000 light-years away,

00:02:22.878 --> 00:02:26.533
and there could be up to 100 million 
small black holes

00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:29.441
just in the Milky Way galaxy.

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:31.163
So should we be worried?
