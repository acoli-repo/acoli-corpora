00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.203
the immense gravitational field
accelerates it to high speed.

00:01:30.203 --> 00:01:33.101
This emits an enormous amount of light.

00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:35.786
And for objects too far away 
to be sucked in,

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:40.254
the massive gravitational force 
still affects their orbits.

00:01:40.254 --> 00:01:45.069
If we observe several stars orbiting
around an apparently empty point,

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.173
a black hole could be leading the dance.

00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:52.238
Similarly, light that passes
close enough to an event horizon

00:01:52.238 --> 00:01:57.803
will be deflected in a phenomenon 
known as gravitational lensing.

00:01:57.803 --> 00:02:02.361
Most of the black holes that we’ve found 
can be thought of as two main types.
