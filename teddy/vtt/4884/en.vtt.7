00:03:27.484 --> 00:03:30.214
These giants have grown 
to immense proportions

00:03:30.214 --> 00:03:34.561
by swallowing matter 
and merging with other black holes.

00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:36.316
Unlike their stellar cousins,

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:39.887
supermassive black holes aren’t
wandering through space.

00:03:39.887 --> 00:03:45.374
Instead, they lie at the center 
of galaxies, including our own.

00:03:45.374 --> 00:03:50.318
Our solar system is in a stable orbit 
around a supermassive black hole

00:03:50.318 --> 00:03:53.344
that resides 
at the center of the Milky Way,

00:03:53.344 --> 00:03:57.150
at a safe distance of 25,000 light-years.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.863
But that could change.

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:01.129
If our galaxy collides with another,
