00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:31.163
So should we be worried?

00:02:31.163 --> 00:02:32.631
Probably not.

00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:34.257
Despite their large mass,

00:02:34.257 --> 00:02:40.214
stellar black holes only have a radius 
of around 300 kilometers or less,

00:02:40.214 --> 00:02:44.036
making the chances 
of a direct hit with us miniscule.

00:02:44.036 --> 00:02:46.229
Although because 
their gravitational fields

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:48.544
can affect a planet from a large distance,

00:02:48.544 --> 00:02:52.166
they could be dangerous 
even without a direct collision.

00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:57.502
If a typical stellar-mass black hole 
were to pass in the region of Neptune,

00:02:57.502 --> 00:03:01.061
the orbit of the Earth 
would be considerably modified,
