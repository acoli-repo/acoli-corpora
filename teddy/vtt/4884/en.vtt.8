00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:01.129
If our galaxy collides with another,

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.239
the Earth could be thrown towards 
the galactic center,

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.803
close enough 
to the supermassive black hole

00:04:06.803 --> 00:04:09.478
to be eventually swallowed up.

00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:12.585
In fact, a collision 
with the Andromeda Galaxy

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:16.359
is predicted to happen 
4 billion years from now,

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.338
which may not be great news
for our home planet.

00:04:19.338 --> 00:04:22.120
But before we judge them too harshly,

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.417
black holes aren’t simply agents 
of destruction.

00:04:25.417 --> 00:04:28.696
They played a crucial role 
in the formation of galaxies,

00:04:28.696 --> 00:04:31.422
the building blocks of our universe.
