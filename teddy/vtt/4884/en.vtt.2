00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:03.993
Thus, a black hole is like a cosmic
vacuum cleaner with infinite capacity,

00:01:03.993 --> 00:01:08.923
gobbling up everything in its path, 
and letting nothing out.

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:12.102
To determine whether a black hole 
could swallow the Earth,

00:01:12.102 --> 00:01:15.032
we first have to figure out 
where they are.

00:01:15.032 --> 00:01:18.623
But since they don’t emit light, 
how’s that possible?

00:01:18.623 --> 00:01:23.358
Fortunately, we’re able to observe 
their effect on the space around them.

00:01:23.358 --> 00:01:25.730
When matter approaches a black hole,

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.203
the immense gravitational field
accelerates it to high speed.
