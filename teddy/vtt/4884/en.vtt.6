00:02:57.502 --> 00:03:01.061
the orbit of the Earth 
would be considerably modified,

00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:03.431
with dire results.

00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:08.096
Still, the combination of how small 
they are and how vast the galaxy is

00:03:08.096 --> 00:03:11.821
means that stellar black holes
don’t give us much to worry about.

00:03:11.821 --> 00:03:14.667
But we still have to meet the second type:

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:17.423
supermassive black holes.

00:03:17.423 --> 00:03:22.648
These have masses millions or billions
times greater than that of our sun

00:03:22.648 --> 00:03:27.484
and have event horizons that
could span billions of kilometers.

00:03:27.484 --> 00:03:30.214
These giants have grown 
to immense proportions
