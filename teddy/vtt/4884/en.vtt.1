00:00:28.222 --> 00:00:31.765
something that wipes out 
everything it comes near.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:36.862
Could the Earth 
be swallowed by a black hole?

00:00:36.862 --> 00:00:39.300
A black hole is an object so dense

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.298
that space and time around it 
are inescapably modified,

00:00:44.298 --> 00:00:46.370
warped into an infinite sink.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.441
Nothing, not even light,
can move fast enough

00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:53.798
to escape a black hole’s 
gravitational pull

00:00:53.798 --> 00:00:56.230
once it passes a certain boundary,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.905
known as the event horizon.

00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:03.993
Thus, a black hole is like a cosmic
vacuum cleaner with infinite capacity,
