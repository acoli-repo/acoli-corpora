00:00:06.848 --> 00:00:10.735
From asteroids capable 
of destroying entire species,

00:00:10.735 --> 00:00:16.670
to gamma-ray bursts and supernovae 
that could exterminate life on Earth,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.989
outer space has no shortage of forces
that could wreak havoc on our tiny planet.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.724
But there’s something in space

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:28.222
that seems more terrifying 
than any of these –

00:00:28.222 --> 00:00:31.765
something that wipes out 
everything it comes near.
