00:03:28.102 --> 00:03:32.121
contemplating how my mind
could have possibly generated all this.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.195
As soon as I walked through the door,

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.384
I collapsed.

00:03:36.837 --> 00:03:39.619
My brain and my spinal cord were burning.

00:03:40.696 --> 00:03:44.467
My neck was so stiff
I couldn't touch my chin to my chest,

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:47.075
and the slightest sound --

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.934
the rustling of the sheets,

00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.223
my husband walking barefoot
in the next room --

00:03:51.737 --> 00:03:53.871
could cause excruciating pain.

00:03:55.832 --> 00:03:58.415
I would spend most
of the next two years in bed.

00:03:59.235 --> 00:04:01.995
How could my doctor
have gotten it so wrong?
