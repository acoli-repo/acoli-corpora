would literally dry up

00:06:37.913 --> 00:06:40.340
and wander around the body
in search of moisture,

00:06:40.364 --> 00:06:42.260
pressing on internal organs --

00:06:42.284 --> 00:06:43.498
yes --

00:06:44.648 --> 00:06:47.343
causing symptoms from extreme emotions

00:06:47.367 --> 00:06:49.612

00:06:54.898 --> 00:06:59.458
These ideas went largely unchanged
for several millennia until the 1880s,

00:06:59.482 --> 00:07:03.180
when neurologists tried to modernize
the theory of hysteria.
