00:13:00.661 --> 00:13:04.202
In Germany, scientists are starting
to find evidence of autoimmunity,

00:13:04.226 --> 00:13:06.568
and in Japan, of brain inflammation.

00:13:07.406 --> 00:13:10.460
In the US, scientists at Stanford
are finding abnormalities

00:13:10.484 --> 00:13:12.380
in energy metabolism

00:13:12.404 --> 00:13:15.866
that are 16 standard deviations
away from normal.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.685
And in Norway, researchers
are running a phase-3 clinical trial

00:13:20.709 --> 00:13:24.376
on a cancer drug that in some patients
causes complete remission.

00:13:25.798 --> 00:13:27.459
What also gives me hope

00:13:28.316 --> 00:13:30.333
is the resilience of patients.
