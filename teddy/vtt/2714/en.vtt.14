00:06:59.482 --> 00:07:03.180
when neurologists tried to modernize
the theory of hysteria.

00:07:03.764 --> 00:07:05.417
Sigmund Freud developed a theory

00:07:05.441 --> 00:07:08.237
that the unconscious mind
could produce physical symptoms

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.276
when dealing with memories or emotions

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.611
too painful for the conscious
mind to handle.

00:07:12.635 --> 00:07:15.514
It converted these emotions
into physical symptoms.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.656
This meant that men
could now get hysteria,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.178
but of course women were still
the most susceptible.

00:07:23.448 --> 00:07:27.065
When I began investigating
the history of my own disease,

00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:30.134
I was amazed to find how deep
these ideas still run.
