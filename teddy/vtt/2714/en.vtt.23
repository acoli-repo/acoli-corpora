ME affects children
and ME affects millions of men.

00:11:33.345 --> 00:11:35.130
And as one patient told me,

00:11:35.154 --> 00:11:36.662
we get it coming and going --

00:11:36.686 --> 00:11:40.294
if you're a woman, you're told
you're exaggerating your symptoms,

00:11:40.318 --> 00:11:43.776
but if you're a guy, you're told
to be strong, to buck up.

00:11:44.676 --> 00:11:48.825
And men may even have
a more difficult time getting diagnosed.

00:11:57.419 --> 00:12:00.284
My brain is not what it used to be.
