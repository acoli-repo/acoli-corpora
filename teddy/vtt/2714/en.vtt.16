All of these outbreaks have tended
to disproportionately affect women,

00:08:01.482 --> 00:08:05.409
and in time, when doctors failed to find
the one cause of the disease,

00:08:05.433 --> 00:08:08.572
they thought that these outbreaks
were mass hysteria.

00:08:09.115 --> 00:08:12.020
Why has this idea had such staying power?

00:08:13.567 --> 00:08:15.363
I do think it has to do with sexism,

00:08:15.387 --> 00:08:18.828
but I also think that fundamentally,
doctors want to help.

00:08:18.852 --> 00:08:20.622
They want to know the answer,

00:08:20.646 --> 00:08:25.537
and this category allows doctors to treat
what would otherwise be untreatable,

00:08:25.561 --> 00:08:28.366
to explain illnesses
that have no explanation.

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:31.771
The problem is that this
can cause real harm.
