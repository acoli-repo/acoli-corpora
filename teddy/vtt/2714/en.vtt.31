00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:30.935
as so many others have done.

00:15:32.094 --> 00:15:35.318
How many lives could
we have saved, decades ago,

00:15:35.957 --> 00:15:37.860
if we had asked the right questions?

00:15:38.626 --> 00:15:40.775
How many lives could we save today

00:15:41.592 --> 00:15:43.754
if we decide to make a real start?

00:15:45.205 --> 00:15:48.248
Even once the true cause
of my disease is discovered,

00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:52.356
if we don't change
our institutions and our culture,

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.756
we will do this again to another disease.

00:15:55.658 --> 00:15:57.652
Living with this illness has taught me

00:15:57.676 --> 00:16:00.604
that science and medicine
are profoundly human endeavors.
