00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:00.972
for three weeks I was so dizzy,
I couldn't leave my house.

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:03.661
I would walk straight into door frames.

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:07.295
I had to hug the walls
just to make it to the bathroom.

00:01:08.613 --> 00:01:11.270
That spring I got infection
after infection,

00:01:11.825 --> 00:01:13.652
and every time I went to the doctor,

00:01:13.676 --> 00:01:16.459
he said there was absolutely
nothing wrong.

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.158
He had his laboratory tests,

00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:21.086
which always came back normal.

00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:23.842
All I had were my symptoms,

00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:25.796
which I could describe,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.512
but no one else can see.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.593
I know it sounds silly,
