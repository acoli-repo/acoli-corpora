00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.064
I saw every kind of specialist:

00:02:00.088 --> 00:02:03.160
infectious disease doctors,
dermatologists, endocrinologists,

00:02:03.184 --> 00:02:04.467
cardiologists.

00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:06.861
I even saw a psychiatrist.

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.923
My psychiatrist said,
"It's clear you're really sick,

00:02:10.947 --> 00:02:13.103
but not with anything psychiatric.

00:02:14.045 --> 00:02:16.783
I hope they can find out
what's wrong with you."

00:02:18.094 --> 00:02:22.160
The next day, my neurologist
diagnosed me with conversion disorder.

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:24.525
He told me that everything --

00:02:25.255 --> 00:02:28.232
the fevers, the sore throats,
the sinus infection,

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:32.246
all of the gastrointestinal,
neurological and cardiac symptoms --
