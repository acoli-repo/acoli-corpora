00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.191
It didn't feel true,

00:03:01.215 --> 00:03:04.685
but I knew from my training
that the truth is often counterintuitive,

00:03:05.356 --> 00:03:07.953
so easily obscured
by what we want to believe.

00:03:08.514 --> 00:03:11.446
So I had to consider the possibility
that he was right.

00:03:13.603 --> 00:03:16.118
That day, I ran a small experiment.

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:20.332
I walked back the two miles
from my neurologist's office to my house,

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:25.264
my legs wrapped in this strange,
almost electric kind of pain.

00:03:26.475 --> 00:03:28.078
I meditated on that pain,

00:03:28.102 --> 00:03:32.121
contemplating how my mind
could have possibly generated all this.
