00:13:57.815 --> 00:14:00.402
I still had to make ridiculous choices:

00:14:00.568 --> 00:14:04.409
Will I sit in the garden for 15 minutes,
or will I wash my hair today?

00:14:04.924 --> 00:14:07.352
But it gave me hope
that I could be treated.

00:14:07.693 --> 00:14:10.035
I had a sick body; that was all.

00:14:10.789 --> 00:14:14.820
And with the right kind of help,
maybe one day I could get better.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.943
I came together with patients
around the world,

00:14:19.466 --> 00:14:21.220
and we started to fight.

00:14:21.863 --> 00:14:25.034
We have filled the void
with something wonderful,

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:27.190
but it is not enough.

00:14:28.662 --> 00:14:32.699
I still don't know if I will ever
be able to run again,
