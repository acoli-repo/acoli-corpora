00:14:28.662 --> 00:14:32.699
I still don't know if I will ever
be able to run again,

00:14:32.723 --> 00:14:34.620
or walk at any distance,

00:14:34.644 --> 00:14:38.553
or do any of those kinetic things
that I now only get to do in my dreams.

00:14:39.143 --> 00:14:42.233
But I am so grateful
for how far I have come.

00:14:43.955 --> 00:14:45.440
Progress is slow,

00:14:45.464 --> 00:14:46.756
and it is up

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.566
and it is down,

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:52.135
but I am getting a little better each day.

00:14:54.013 --> 00:14:57.932
I remember what it was like
when I was stuck in that bedroom,

00:14:58.548 --> 00:15:01.496
when it had been months
since I had seen the sun.
