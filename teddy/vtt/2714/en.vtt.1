00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:31.047
I was 28, and like so many of us
when we are in good health,

00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:33.102
I felt like I was invincible.

00:00:34.477 --> 00:00:38.147
Then one day I had
a fever of 104.7 degrees.

00:00:38.758 --> 00:00:40.807
I probably should have gone to the doctor,

00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:43.395
but I'd never really been sick in my life,

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:45.772
and I knew that usually,
if you have a virus,

00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:48.929
you stay home and you make
some chicken soup,

00:00:48.953 --> 00:00:51.266
and in a few days,
everything will be fine.

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:54.336
But this time it wasn't fine.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.097
After the fever broke,

00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:00.972
for three weeks I was so dizzy,
I couldn't leave my house.
