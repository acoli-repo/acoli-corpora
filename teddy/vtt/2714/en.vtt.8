00:03:59.235 --> 00:04:01.995
How could my doctor
have gotten it so wrong?

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.120
I thought I had a rare disease,

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:07.133
something doctors had never seen.

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:09.121
And then I went online

00:04:09.145 --> 00:04:11.523
and found thousands of people
all over the world

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.600
living with the same symptoms,

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:15.651
similarly isolated,

00:04:15.675 --> 00:04:17.132
similarly disbelieved.

00:04:17.854 --> 00:04:19.137
Some could still work,

00:04:19.161 --> 00:04:21.646
but had to spend their evenings
and weekends in bed,

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.737
just so they could show up
the next Monday.

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:26.444
On the other end of the spectrum,

00:04:26.468 --> 00:04:28.206
some were so sick

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.536
they had to live in complete darkness,
