00:00:00.904 --> 00:00:06.553
So it's 1969, New York City,

00:00:06.577 --> 00:00:10.117
third grade music class,

00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:16.517
and our teacher brings us into a room
with nothing but a piano and chairs.

00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:19.255
And one by one, he calls us up,

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.088
and he plays middle C,
and he asks us to sing it.

00:00:22.787 --> 00:00:24.604
(Singing)

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.167
And you're either instructed
to go to the right of the room

00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:29.675
or the left side of the room.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.912
(Laughter)
