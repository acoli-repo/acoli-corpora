But the "good as can be
expected" comment ...

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.661
even at that young age,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.520
Now, how many people here
have had an experience similar to that,

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:52.853
either at school or the workplace?

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.782
We're not alone.

00:01:59.003 --> 00:02:02.823
