00:01:59.003 --> 00:02:02.823
So I guess it might be ironic

00:02:02.847 --> 00:02:06.774
that my life path
would lead me to a career

00:02:06.798 --> 00:02:10.983
of making music and writing
for Blue Man Group

00:02:11.007 --> 00:02:12.522
(Laughter)

00:02:12.546 --> 00:02:14.123
and starting a school.

00:02:14.147 --> 00:02:16.868
(Laughter)

00:02:16.892 --> 00:02:19.043
But school was torture for me.

00:02:20.047 --> 00:02:24.028
As someone who didn't have
a natural proclivity for academics,

00:02:24.052 --> 00:02:27.714
and my teachers never seemed
to understand me,

00:02:27.738 --> 00:02:29.521
I didn't know how to navigate schools

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:31.972
and schools didn't know
what to do with me.
