00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:31.972
and schools didn't know
what to do with me.

00:02:33.212 --> 00:02:37.507
So I started to ask the question,
even back then,

00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:40.770
if these environments
didn't know what to do

00:02:40.794 --> 00:02:44.778
with people who didn't fit
a standard mold,

00:02:44.802 --> 00:02:48.417
why weren't we reshaping the environments

00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:50.909
to take advantage of people's strengths?

00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:56.035
What I've come to believe

00:02:56.059 --> 00:03:01.269
is that we need to cultivate
safe and conducive conditions
