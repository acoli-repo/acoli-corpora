00:01:10.356 --> 00:01:15.117
first paper of a new semester,

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.164
and I get the paper back,

00:01:17.188 --> 00:01:19.722
and it's C+,

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:23.037
with the comment,
"Good as can be expected."

00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:25.061

00:01:26.584 --> 00:01:29.582
Now, honestly, I didn't mind a C+.

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:32.764
I was just happy it wasn't a C- or a D.
