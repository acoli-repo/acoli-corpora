00:03:56.194 --> 00:04:00.134
and it was a whole series of things
that we had never seen onstage before,

00:04:00.158 --> 00:04:04.358
things like art and pop culture
and technology and sociology

00:04:04.382 --> 00:04:09.834
and anthropology and percussion
and comedy and following your bliss.

00:04:11.698 --> 00:04:13.562
We established a rule

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:18.864
that nothing made it onstage
if we had seen it before,

00:04:18.888 --> 00:04:22.047
and we wanted to inspire
creativity and connectedness

00:04:22.071 --> 00:04:24.992
in ourselves and our audiences;

00:04:25.016 --> 00:04:27.855
we wanted to do
a little bit of social good,

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.555
and we wanted to have fun doing it.
