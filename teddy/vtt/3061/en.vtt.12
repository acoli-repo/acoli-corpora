00:05:58.385 --> 00:06:00.555
Address disagreements head-on.

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:03.039
People should feel seen and heard.

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.270
Take risks and celebrate mistakes.

00:06:06.735 --> 00:06:09.557
A commitment to being
a learning organization,

00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:14.961
always trying to spiral upwards
the innovation and learning curves.

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:18.032
And speak in one voice.

00:06:18.738 --> 00:06:22.778

about someone who's not in the room
