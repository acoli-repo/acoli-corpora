00:02:56.059 --> 00:03:01.269
is that we need to cultivate
safe and conducive conditions

00:03:01.293 --> 00:03:06.126
for new and innovative ideas
to evolve and thrive.

00:03:07.956 --> 00:03:11.291
We know that humans
are innately innovative,

00:03:11.315 --> 00:03:12.673
because if we weren't,

00:03:12.697 --> 00:03:17.283
we'd all be using the same arrowheads
that we were using 10,000 years ago.

00:03:18.152 --> 00:03:21.818
So one of the things
that I started to question is,

00:03:21.842 --> 00:03:26.097
are there ways to make innovation easier

00:03:26.121 --> 00:03:29.053
and happen more frequently?

00:03:29.523 --> 00:03:32.380
Is there a way to take those aha moments,
