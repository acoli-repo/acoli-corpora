00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Here's another example of how comparing to the past

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
can befuddle our decisions.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Imagine that you're going to the theater.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
You're on your way to the theater.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
In your wallet you have a ticket, for which you paid 20 dollars.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
You also have a 20-dollar bill.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
When you arrive at the theater,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
you discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Most people answer, no.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Now, let's just change one thing in this scenario.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
You're on your way to the theater,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
When you arrive you discover you've lost one of them.
