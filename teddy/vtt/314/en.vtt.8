00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
isn't because they're improbable, unlikely or infrequent.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
You kind of shout out the sound, S -- and the word comes.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
It's like the dictionary;

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
it's hard to look things up by the third letter.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So, this is an example of how this idea that

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
the quickness with which things come to mind

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
can give you a sense of their probability --

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
how this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles, though.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
For example, when Americans are asked to estimate the odds

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
that they will die in a variety of interesting ways --

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
these are estimates of number of deaths per year
