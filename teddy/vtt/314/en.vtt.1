00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and I also want to explain to you why it is

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that it hasn't made a damn bit of difference.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now, this is Bernoulli's gift. This is a direct quote.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And if it looks like Greek to you, it's because, well, it's Greek.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But the simple English translation -- much less precise,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say -- was this:

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The expected value of any of our actions --

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that is, the goodness that we can count on getting --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is the product of two simple things:

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the odds that this action will allow us to gain something,
