$2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
so you decide to mull it over for a week.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
By the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone --

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
the package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Why? Because it used to cost 700, and there's no way I'm paying 1,500

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
for something that was 700 last week.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
This tendency to compare to the past

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
is causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Here's another example of how comparing to the past
