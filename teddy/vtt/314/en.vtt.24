00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I'm not paying twice for the same thing.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
You compare the cost of the play now -- 40 dollars --

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
to the cost that it used to have -- 20 dollars -- and you say it's a bad deal.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Comparing with the past causes many of the problems

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
that behavioral economists and psychologists identify

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
in people's attempts to assign value.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
But even when we compare with the possible, instead of the past,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
we still make certain kinds of mistakes.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And I'm going to show you one or two of them.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
One of the things we know about comparison:

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
that when we compare one thing to the other, it changes its value.
