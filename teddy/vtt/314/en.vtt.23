00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
When you arrive you discover you've lost one of them.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Well, of course, I went to the theater to see the play.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
What does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Now, just in case you're not getting it,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
here's a schematic of what happened, OK?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
(Laughter)

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Along the way, you lost something.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
In both cases, it was a piece of paper.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
In one case, it had a U.S. president on it; in the other case it didn't.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
What the hell difference should it make?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I'm not paying twice for the same thing.
