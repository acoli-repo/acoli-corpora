You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
or of flipping a heads.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
But as it turns out, this is not a very easy idea to apply

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
in everyday life. That's why Americans spend more --

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I should say, lose more -- gambling

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
than on all other forms of entertainment combined.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The reason is, this isn't how people do odds.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The way people figure odds

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
requires that we first talk a bit about pigs.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Now, the question I'm going to put to you is whether you think

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
there are more dogs or pigs on leashes

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
observed in any particular day in Oxford.
