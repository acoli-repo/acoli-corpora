People are horrible at estimating both of these things,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and that's what I want to talk to you about today.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
what the right thing is to do, and those are

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
errors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and errors in estimating the value of their own success.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Now, let me talk about the first one first.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy:

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
there are six sides to a die, two sides to a coin, 52 cards in a deck.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades
