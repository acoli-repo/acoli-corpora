spare you the undue burden of money.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And so a retailer, if you were to go into a wine shop

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and you had to buy a bottle of wine,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and you see them here for eight, 27 and 33 dollars, what would you do?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Most people don't want the most expensive,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
they don't want the least expensive.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
So, they will opt for the item in the middle.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
If you're a smart retailer, then, you will put a very expensive item

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
that nobody will ever buy on the shelf,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
because suddenly the $33 wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
So I'm telling you something you already knew:

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
namely, that comparison changes the value of things.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Here's why that's a problem:
