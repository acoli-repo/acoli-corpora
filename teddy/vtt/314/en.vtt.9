00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
these are estimates of number of deaths per year

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
per 200 million U.S. citizens.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
to guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowning, etc.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Compare these to the actual numbers.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Now, you see a very interesting pattern here, which is first of all,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
two things are vastly over-estimated, namely tornadoes and fireworks.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Two things are vastly underestimated:

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
dying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and the headline was, "Boy dies of Asthma?"
