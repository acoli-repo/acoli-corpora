00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
most of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you know

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
that the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that multiplies to five, and that's more

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
than I'm charging you to play. So, the answer is, yes.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Now, the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
but in fact, it's not very simple in everyday life.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
People are horrible at estimating both of these things,
