On the other hand, if you're visiting an underdeveloped country,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal, it's exorbitant for a Big Mac.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
before I'd even told you anything about the context?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Because most of you compared the price of this Big Mac

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
to the price you're used to paying. Rather than asking,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
"What else can I do with my money," comparing this investment

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
to other possible investments, you compared to the past.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And this is a systematic error people make.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
What you knew is, you paid three dollars in the past; 25 is outrageous.
