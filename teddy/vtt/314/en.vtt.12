00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
as a stupidity tax, because the odds of getting any payoff

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
by investing your money in a lottery ticket

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
are approximately equivalent to flushing the money

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
directly down the toilet -- which, by the way,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
doesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Well, there are many answers, but one answer surely is,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
we see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check --

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
how the hell do you cash things that size, I don't know.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
We see this on TV; we read about it in the paper.
