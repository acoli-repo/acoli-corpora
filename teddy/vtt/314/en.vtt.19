What you knew is, you paid three dollars in the past; 25 is outrageous.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
This is an error, and I can prove it to you by showing

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
For example, this is, of course,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
one of the most delicious tricks in marketing,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
is to say something used to be higher,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and suddenly it seems like a very good deal.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
When people are asked about these two different jobs:

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
a job where you make 60K, then 50K, then 40K,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
a job where you're getting a salary cut each year,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and one in which you're getting a salary increase,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
people like the second job better than the first, despite the fact

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
they're all told they make much less money. Why?
