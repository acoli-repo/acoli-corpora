00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and the headline was, "Boy dies of Asthma?"

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
It's not interesting because it's so common.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
It's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
of news stories or newsreels where we've seen

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
tornadoes devastating cities, or some poor schmuck

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
who's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Drownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
They don't come quickly to mind, and as a result,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
we vastly underestimate them.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Indeed, this is kind of like the Sesame Street game

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
of "Which thing doesn't belong?" And you're right to say
