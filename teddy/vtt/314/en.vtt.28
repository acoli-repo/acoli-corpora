00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
our attempts to make rational decisions.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Let me just give you an example.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I have to show you something from my own lab, so let me sneak this in.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
the simplest of all questions:

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
They're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
For some of the subjects, sitting in the far corner of a room

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
is a box of Godiva chocolates, and for others is a can of Spam.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
In fact, these items that are sitting in the room change

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
how much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips.
