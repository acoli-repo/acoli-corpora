00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
there are more dogs or pigs on leashes

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
observed in any particular day in Oxford.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And of course, you all know that the answer is dogs.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
you quickly reviewed in memory the times

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
you've seen dogs and pigs on leashes.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It was very easy to remember seeing dogs,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
not so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
then dogs on leashes are more probable.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
That's not a bad rule of thumb, except when it is.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So, for example, here's a word puzzle.
