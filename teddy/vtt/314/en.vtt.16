even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Now, estimating odds, as difficult as it may seem, is a piece of cake

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
compared to trying to estimate value:

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
trying to say what something is worth, how much we'll enjoy it,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
how much pleasure it will give us.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I want to talk now about errors in value.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
How much is this Big Mac worth? Is it worth 25 dollars?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Most of you have the intuition that it's not --

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
you wouldn't pay that for it.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But in fact, to decide whether a Big Mac is worth 25 dollars requires

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
that you ask one, and only one question, which is:
