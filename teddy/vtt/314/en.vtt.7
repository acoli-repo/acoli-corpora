00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So, for example, here's a word puzzle.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Are there more four-letter English words

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
with R in the third place or R in the first place?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Well, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and it's awfully easy to say to yourself, Ring, Rang, Rung,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But in fact, there are many more words in the English language

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
with R in the third than the first place.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
isn't because they're improbable, unlikely or infrequent.
