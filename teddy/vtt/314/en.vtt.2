00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is the product of two simple things:

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the odds that this action will allow us to gain something,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and the value of that gain to us.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
In a sense, what Bernoulli was saying is,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
if we can estimate and multiply these two things,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
we will always know precisely how we should behave.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Now, this simple equation, even for those of you

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
who don't like equations, is something that you're quite used to.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Here's an example: if I were to tell you, let's play

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
a little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me,
