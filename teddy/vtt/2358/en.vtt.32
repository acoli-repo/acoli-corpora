00:15:56.778 --> 00:16:03.651
and bye-bye, Randolph. Goodbye.

00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:05.175
MB: I actually got Nico,

00:16:05.175 --> 00:16:08.306
I hadn't heard from in 18 months,

00:16:08.306 --> 00:16:12.424
and he just left a message two days ago.

00:16:12.424 --> 00:16:14.850
His voice is completely different,

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:18.350
but he put his babysitter on the phone,

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.211
and she was very nice to Randolph as well.

00:16:22.211 --> 00:16:26.561
But Nico's the best reader I could hope for.

00:16:26.561 --> 00:16:30.287
I would want anyone I was writing for
