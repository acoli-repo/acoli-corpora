00:04:56.686 --> 00:05:00.220
descending on Dublin to take the walking tour

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.825
of Bloomsday and see everything
that happened in "Ulysses,"

00:05:05.825 --> 00:05:08.080
even though none of that happened.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.337
Or people go to London and they visit Baker Street

00:05:10.337 --> 00:05:11.809
to see Sherlock Holmes' apartment,

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:13.936
even though 221B is just a number that was painted

00:05:13.936 --> 00:05:17.082
on a building that never 
actually had that address.

00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:18.807
We know these characters aren't real,

00:05:18.807 --> 00:05:21.427
but we have real feelings about them,

00:05:21.427 --> 00:05:22.471
and we're able to do that.

00:05:22.471 --> 00:05:24.364
We know these characters aren't real,

00:05:24.364 --> 00:05:27.682
and yet we also know that they are.

00:05:27.682 --> 00:05:31.338
Kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can,
