Hi everybody. So my name is Mac.

00:00:02.531 --> 00:00:06.589
My job is that I lie to children,

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.605
but they're honest lies.

00:00:08.605 --> 00:00:10.373
I write children's books,

00:00:10.373 --> 00:00:13.601
and there's a quote from Pablo Picasso,

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:16.787
"We all know that Art is not truth.

00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:20.429
Art is a lie that makes us realize truth

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.127
or at least the truth that is 
given us to understand.

00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:25.237
The artist must know the manner whereby

00:00:25.237 --> 00:00:30.074
to convince others of the 
truthfulness of his lies."
