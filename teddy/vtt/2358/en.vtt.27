And when you call and leave him a message,

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.281
you just, on the outgoing message,

00:13:32.281 --> 00:13:37.399
it's just whale sounds and then a beep,

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:40.954
which actually sounds a lot like a whale sound.

00:13:40.954 --> 00:13:42.934
And they get a picture of their whale too.

00:13:42.934 --> 00:13:45.465
So this is Randolph,

00:13:45.465 --> 00:13:48.806
and Randolph belongs to a kid named Nico

00:13:48.806 --> 00:13:53.088
who was one of the first kids to ever call in,

00:13:53.088 --> 00:13:55.398
and I'll play you some of Nico's message.

00:13:55.398 --> 00:13:59.530
This is the first message I ever got from Nico.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:01.769
(Audio) Nico: Hello, this is Nico.
