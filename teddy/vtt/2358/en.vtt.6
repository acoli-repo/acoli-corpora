00:02:57.971 --> 00:03:00.284
and then she would eat fruit snacks

00:03:00.284 --> 00:03:02.657
and pudding cups, and I was like, "Riley,

00:03:02.657 --> 00:03:05.713
you can't do that, you 
have to eat the fruit."

00:03:05.713 --> 00:03:07.530
And she was like, "Why?"

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.362
And I was like, "Well, when
you throw the fruit in the ivy,

00:03:09.362 --> 00:03:13.254
pretty soon, it's going to be overgrown with melons,"

00:03:13.254 --> 00:03:15.256
which is why I think I ended up

00:03:15.256 --> 00:03:20.875
telling stories to children and not
being a nutritionist for children.

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:22.763
And so Riley was like, "That will never happen.

00:03:22.763 --> 00:03:23.863
That's not going to happen."

00:03:23.863 --> 00:03:26.914
And so, on the last day of camp,

00:03:26.914 --> 00:03:29.367
I got up early and I got a big cantaloupe

00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:31.393
from the grocery store
