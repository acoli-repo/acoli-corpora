00:06:28.188 --> 00:06:30.280
It's at 826 Valencia Street

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.766
in the Mission in San Francisco,

00:06:32.766 --> 00:06:34.792
and when I worked there, there
was a publishing company

00:06:34.792 --> 00:06:37.431
headquartered there called McSweeney's,

00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:40.585
a nonprofit writing center called 826 Valencia,

00:06:40.585 --> 00:06:42.790
but then the front of it

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.360
was a strange shop.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.787
You see, this place was zoned retail,

00:06:45.787 --> 00:06:48.903
and in San Francisco, they were
not going to give us a variance,

00:06:48.903 --> 00:06:51.790
and so the writer who founded
it, a writer named Dave Eggers,

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.129
to come into compliance 
with code, he said, "Fine,

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:58.505
I'm just going to build a pirate supply store."

00:06:58.505 --> 00:07:01.583
And that's what he did. (Laughter)
