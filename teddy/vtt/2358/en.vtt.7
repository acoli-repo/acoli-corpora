00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:31.393
from the grocery store

00:03:31.393 --> 00:03:33.495
and I hid it in the ivy,

00:03:33.495 --> 00:03:34.946
and then at lunchtime, I was like,

00:03:34.946 --> 00:03:37.621
"Riley, why don't you go over
there and see what you've done."

00:03:37.621 --> 00:03:40.796
And — (Laughter) —

00:03:40.796 --> 00:03:43.474
she went trudging through 
the ivy, and then her eyes

00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:45.566
just got so wide, and she pointed out this melon

00:03:45.566 --> 00:03:47.680
that was bigger than her head,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.650
and then all the kids ran over 
there and rushed around her,

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.237
and one of the kids was like, "Hey,

00:03:52.237 --> 00:03:54.126
why is there a sticker on this?"

00:03:54.126 --> 00:03:57.350
(Laughter)

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.819
And I was like, "That is also why I say

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.811
do not throw your stickers in the ivy.
