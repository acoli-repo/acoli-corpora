00:01:28.723 --> 00:01:31.010
I would do it on my summers off from college,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.389
and I loved it.

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:36.148
It was a sports summer camp

00:01:36.148 --> 00:01:37.982
for four- to six-year-olds.

00:01:37.982 --> 00:01:39.628
I was in charge of the four-year-olds,

00:01:39.628 --> 00:01:41.431
which is good, because

00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:44.780
four-year-olds can't play 
sports, and neither can I.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.355
(Laughter)

00:01:46.355 --> 00:01:49.280
I play sports at a four-year-old level,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.997
so what would happen is the kids would

00:01:52.997 --> 00:01:54.696
dribble around some cones, and then got hot,

00:01:54.696 --> 00:01:56.959
and then they would go sit underneath the tree

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.804
where I was already sitting — (Laughter) —

00:01:59.804 --> 00:02:02.349
and I would just make up stories and tell them to them
