Kids can get there a lot more easily than adults can,

00:05:31.338 --> 00:05:32.891
and that's why I love writing for kids.

00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:34.871
I think kids are the best audience

00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:39.260
for serious literary fiction.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.084
When I was a kid,

00:05:42.084 --> 00:05:44.710
I was obsessed with secret door novels,

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.871
things like "Narnia,"

00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:49.574
where you would open a wardrobe
and go through to a magical land.

00:05:49.574 --> 00:05:52.304
And I was convinced that secret doors really did exist

00:05:52.304 --> 00:05:54.332
and I would look for them and try to go through them.

00:05:54.332 --> 00:05:58.076
I wanted to live and cross over into 
that fictional world, which is —

00:05:58.076 --> 00:06:03.771
I would always just open people's closet doors.
