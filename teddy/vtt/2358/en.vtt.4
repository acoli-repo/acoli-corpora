00:01:59.804 --> 00:02:02.349
and I would just make up stories and tell them to them

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:04.168
and I would tell them stories about my life.

00:02:04.168 --> 00:02:05.911
I would tell them about how, on the weekends,

00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:09.126
I would go home and I would
spy for the Queen of England.

00:02:09.126 --> 00:02:12.447
And soon, other kids

00:02:12.447 --> 00:02:14.287
who weren't even in my group of kids,

00:02:14.287 --> 00:02:15.756
they would come up to me, and they would say,

00:02:15.756 --> 00:02:17.668
"You're Mac Barnett, right?

00:02:17.668 --> 00:02:20.737
You're the guy who spies for the Queen of England."

00:02:20.737 --> 00:02:23.959
And I had been waiting my whole life for strangers

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.389
to come up and ask me that question.

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:28.662
In my fantasy, they were svelte Russian women,

00:02:28.662 --> 00:02:29.899
but, you know, four-year-olds —

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:34.528
you take what you can get in Berkeley, California.
