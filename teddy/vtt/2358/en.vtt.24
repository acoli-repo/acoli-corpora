And he has to take it to school with him.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.454
He lives in San Francisco —

00:12:01.454 --> 00:12:03.985
very tough city to own a blue whale in.

00:12:03.985 --> 00:12:08.419
A lot of hills, real estate is at a premium.

00:12:08.419 --> 00:12:10.927
This market's crazy, everybody.

00:12:10.927 --> 00:12:14.718
But underneath the jacket is this case,

00:12:14.718 --> 00:12:18.904
and that's the cover underneath the book, the jacket,

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:20.284
and there's an ad

00:12:20.284 --> 00:12:23.527
that offers a free 30-day risk-free trial

00:12:23.527 --> 00:12:25.426
for a blue whale.

00:12:25.426 --> 00:12:28.420
And you can just send in a
self-addressed stamped envelope

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.270
and we'll send you a whale.
