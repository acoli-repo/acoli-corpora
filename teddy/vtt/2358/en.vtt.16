00:07:57.358 --> 00:08:00.840
and it was my job to build the store down there.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.400
So we have The Echo Park Time Travel Mart.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.240

(Laughter)

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.857
And it's on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.

00:08:15.857 --> 00:08:17.967
Our friendly staff is ready to help you.

They're from all eras,

00:08:23.719 --> 00:08:25.916
he's from the very recent past.

00:08:25.916 --> 00:08:27.618
There's our Employees of the Month,

00:08:27.618 --> 00:08:30.604
including Genghis Khan, Charles Dickens.
