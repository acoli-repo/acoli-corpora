The joke isn't a joke.

00:10:31.295 --> 00:10:33.695
You can't find the seams on the fiction,

00:10:33.695 --> 00:10:36.603
and I love that. It's this little bit of fiction

00:10:36.603 --> 00:10:39.865
that's colonized the real world.

00:10:39.865 --> 00:10:43.922
I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions.

00:10:43.922 --> 00:10:46.162
There's a term called metafiction,

00:10:46.162 --> 00:10:50.245
and that's just stories about stories,

00:10:50.245 --> 00:10:51.820
and meta's having a moment now.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.845
Its last big moment was probably in the 1960s

00:10:53.845 --> 00:10:56.522
with novelists like John Barth and William Gaddis,

00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:57.770
but it's been around.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.311
It's almost as old as storytelling itself.
