00:00:25.237 --> 00:00:30.074
to convince others of the 
truthfulness of his lies."

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:32.932
I first heard this when I was a kid,

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:34.623
and I loved it,

00:00:34.623 --> 00:00:37.415
but I had no idea what it meant.

00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:38.992
(Laughter)

00:00:38.992 --> 00:00:40.889
So I thought, you know what, it's what I'm here

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:42.508
to talk to you today about, though,

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:44.721
truth and lies, fiction and reality.

00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:46.573
So how could I untangle

00:00:46.573 --> 00:00:49.100
this knotted bunch of sentences?

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.527
And I said, I've got PowerPoint.
Let's do a Venn diagram.

00:00:52.527 --> 00:00:55.020
["Truth. Lies."]
(Laughter)

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.780
So there it is, right there, boom.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.485
We've got truth and lies

00:00:58.485 --> 00:00:59.557
and then there's this little space,

00:00:59.557 --> 00:01:01.118
the edge, in the middle.
