00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:34.528
you take what you can get in Berkeley, California.

00:02:34.528 --> 00:02:38.956
And I realized that the stories that I was telling

00:02:38.956 --> 00:02:42.453
were real in this way that was familiar to me

00:02:42.453 --> 00:02:43.658
and really exciting.

00:02:43.658 --> 00:02:45.864
I think the pinnacle of this for 
me — I'll never forget this —

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:48.687
there was this little girl 
named Riley. She was tiny,

00:02:48.687 --> 00:02:51.126
and she used to always take 
out her lunch every day

00:02:51.126 --> 00:02:53.466
and she would throw out her fruit.

00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:54.874
She would just take her fruit,

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:56.222
her mom packed her a melon every day,

00:02:56.222 --> 00:02:57.971
and she would just throw it in the ivy

00:02:57.971 --> 00:03:00.284
and then she would eat fruit snacks
