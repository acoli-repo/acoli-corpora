00:07:28.312 --> 00:07:32.324
people came to them and bought things,

00:07:32.324 --> 00:07:34.151
and they ended up paying the rent

00:07:34.151 --> 00:07:36.215
for our tutoring center, which was behind it,

00:07:36.215 --> 00:07:39.267
but to me, more important was the fact

00:07:39.267 --> 00:07:41.918
that I think the quality of work you do,

00:07:41.918 --> 00:07:44.404
kids would come and get instruction in writing,

00:07:44.404 --> 00:07:48.670
and when you have to walk this weird, liminal,
fictional space like this to go do your writing,

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.420
it's going to affect the kind of work that you make.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.607
It's a secret door that you can walk through.

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:57.358
So I ran the 826 in Los Angeles,

00:07:57.358 --> 00:08:00.840
and it was my job to build the store down there.
