And Riley carried that melon around with her all day,

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:15.661
and she was so proud.

00:04:15.661 --> 00:04:20.505
And Riley knew she didn't 
grow a melon in seven days,

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:23.441
but she also knew that she did,

00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:25.657
and it's a weird place,

00:04:25.657 --> 00:04:28.402
but it's not just a place that kids can get to.

00:04:28.402 --> 00:04:31.934
It's anything. Art can get us to that place.
