00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.311
It's almost as old as storytelling itself.

00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:03.851
And one metafictive technique

00:11:03.851 --> 00:11:05.645
is breaking the fourth wall. Right?

00:11:05.645 --> 00:11:08.895
It's when an actor will turn to the audience

00:11:08.895 --> 00:11:09.961
and say, "I am an actor,

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:12.552
these are just rafters."

00:11:12.552 --> 00:11:14.577
And even that supposedly honest moment,

00:11:14.577 --> 00:11:16.803
I would argue, is in service of the lie,

00:11:16.803 --> 00:11:19.559
but it's supposed to foreground the artificiality

00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:21.246
of the fiction.

00:11:21.246 --> 00:11:23.395
For me, I kind of prefer the opposite.

00:11:23.395 --> 00:11:25.529
If I'm going to break down the fourth wall,

00:11:25.529 --> 00:11:27.872
I want fiction to escape

00:11:27.872 --> 00:11:29.955
and come into the real world.

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:34.554
I want a book to be a secret door that opens
