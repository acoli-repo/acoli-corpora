WEBVTT

00:08:59.021 --> 00:09:00.607
and we didn't know what to do.

00:09:00.607 --> 00:09:01.639
It was going to be the highlight of our store.

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:02.984
So we just put that sign on it that said,

00:09:02.984 --> 00:09:07.489
"Out of order. Come back yesterday."
(Laughter)

00:09:07.489 --> 00:09:09.525
And that ended up being a better joke than slushies,

00:09:09.525 --> 00:09:13.621
so we just left it there forever.

00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:17.934
Mammoth Chunks. These things
weigh, like, seven pounds each.

00:09:17.934 --> 00:09:20.134
Barbarian repellent. It's full of salad

00:09:20.134 --> 00:09:24.712
and potpourri — things that barbarians hate.

00:09:24.712 --> 00:09:26.670
Dead languages.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.370
(Laughter)

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:32.450
Leeches, nature's tiny doctors.
