WEBVTT

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.501
But there's a nonprofit behind it,

00:10:00.501 --> 00:10:02.481
and kids go through a door
that says "Employees Only"

00:10:02.481 --> 00:10:03.696
and they end up in this space

00:10:03.696 --> 00:10:05.870
where they do homework and write stories

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.330
and make films and this is a book release party

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.814
where kids will read.

00:10:09.814 --> 00:10:11.716
There's a quarterly that's published

00:10:11.716 --> 00:10:13.145
with just writing that's done by the kids

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:14.202
who come every day after school,

00:10:14.202 --> 00:10:15.730
and we have release parties

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.677
and they eat cake and read for their parents

00:10:18.677 --> 00:10:21.529
and drink milk out of champagne glasses.

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:24.777
And it's a very special space,

00:10:24.777 --> 00:10:27.996
because it's this weird space in the front.

00:10:27.996 --> 00:10:31.295
The joke isn't a joke.
