Many of you could ask the question, you know,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
why is a flying car, or maybe more accurately,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
a roadable aircraft, possible at this time?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A number of years ago,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Mr. Ford predicted that flying cars

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
of some form would be available.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, 60 years later,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm here to tell you why it's possible.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
When I was about five years old,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
not very much -- about a year after

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Mr. Ford made his predictions,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I was living in a rural part of Canada,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area.
