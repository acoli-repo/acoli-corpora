00:00:00.737 --> 00:00:03.166
Human beings start putting each other into boxes

00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:04.983
the second that they see each other --

00:00:04.983 --> 00:00:08.053
Is that person dangerous? Are they attractive?

00:00:08.053 --> 00:00:11.319
Are they a potential mate? Are they a potential networking opportunity?

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:13.853
We do this little interrogation when we meet people

00:00:13.853 --> 00:00:16.020
to make a mental resume for them.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.537
What's your name? Where are you from?

00:00:17.537 --> 00:00:20.898
How old are you? What do you do?

00:00:20.898 --> 00:00:23.699
Then we get more personal with it.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.847
Have you ever had any diseases?

00:00:26.847 --> 00:00:28.834
Have you ever been divorced?

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:32.280
Does your breath smell bad while you're answering my interrogation right now?
