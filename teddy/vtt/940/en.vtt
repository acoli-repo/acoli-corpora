00:00:00.713 --> 00:00:03.422
That's how we traveled in the year 1900.

00:00:03.422 --> 00:00:05.791
That's an open buggy. It doesn't have heating.

00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:07.420
It doesn't have air conditioning.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.477
That horse is pulling it along

00:00:09.477 --> 00:00:11.775
at one percent of the speed of sound,

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:13.527
and the rutted dirt road

00:00:13.527 --> 00:00:17.909

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:20.654
That's a Boeing 707.

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:22.955
Only 60 years later, it travels

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:25.172
at 80 percent of the speed of sound,

00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:27.805
and we don't travel any faster today

00:00:27.805 --> 00:00:30.944
