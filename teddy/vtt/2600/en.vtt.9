00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.456
I started with my family and friends,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.376
then more and more people
joined the adventure,

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.160
thanks to public calls
coming through the social media.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.016
I thought that the main space
to show my work was the Internet

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.576
because I want an open concept
that invites everybody

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.880
to push the share button
in both the computer and their brain.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.120
The snowball started to roll.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.000
The project had a great welcome --
