but I never understood

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.735
I was made of flesh but I wasn't pink.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.536
My skin was brown,
and people said I was black.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.720
I was seven years old
with a mess of colors in my head.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.160
Later,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.376
when I took my cousin to school,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.800
I was usually taken for the nanny.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.976
By helping in the kitchen
at a friend's party,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.120
people thought I was the maid.
