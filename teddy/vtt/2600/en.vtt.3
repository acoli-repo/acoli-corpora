00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.496
more on the beige side,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.816
like a pancake.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.216
(Laughter)

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.096
Growing up in this family,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.720
color was never important for me.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.040
Outside home, however,
things were different soon.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.880
Color had many other meanings.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.936
I remember my first
drawing lessons in school

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.896
as a bunch of contradictory feelings.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.856
It was exciting and creative

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.680
but I never understood
the unique flesh-colored pencil.
