00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.616
In some way,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.176
I get to used to it and accept part of it.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.000
However, something inside of me
keeps revolving and struggling.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.880
Years later I married a Spaniard.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.616
But not any Spaniard.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.536
I chose one with the skin color
of a lobster when sunburnt.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.576
(Laughter)

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.936
Since then, a new question
started to chase me.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.320
What will be the color of your children?
