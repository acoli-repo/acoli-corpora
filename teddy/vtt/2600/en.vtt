00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.816
It has been 128 years

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.400
since the last country
in the world abolished slavery

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.656
and 53 years

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.760
since Martin Luther King pronounced
his "I Have A Dream" speech.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.976
But we still live in a world

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.200
where the color of our skin
not only gives a first impression,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.760
but a lasting one that remains.
