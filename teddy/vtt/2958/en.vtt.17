00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.336
And in a tradition where we often
don't know the dancer's names,

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.576
who they were,

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.096
what their lives were like,

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.976
what they felt,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.200
let me propose that we move forward
honestly and openly from "khnhom."

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.576
Khnhom not as in slave,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.520
but as in conscious service.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.216
Khnhom:

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.856
"I,"

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.376
"me,"

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.600
"flowering."

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.776
My name is Prumsodun Ok.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.016
I am Khmer,

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.016
and I am American.
