00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.416
losing their lives from disease,

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.656
overwork,

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.680
execution and starvation.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.336
The result of this is that an entire third
of Cambodia's population was lost

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.176
in less than four years,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.040
and in that number were 90 percent
of Khmer dance artists.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.496
In other words,

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.120
nine out of 10 visions
for the tradition and future were lost.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.456
Thankfully, however,

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.536
it was my teacher's teachers,

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.296
