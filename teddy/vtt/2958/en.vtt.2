the introduction of major religions,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.840
Khmers, and people all over the world
practiced animism.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.016
Serpents were especially important
in this belief system

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.416
because in their fluid,
curvilinear movement,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.080
they mimicked the flow of water.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.056
So to invoke the serpent
in your dancing body then

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.840
was to conjure the image
of rivers cutting across the earth:

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.640
inspire the flow of life-giving waters.
