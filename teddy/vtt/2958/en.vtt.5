00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.536
These four gestures are then used

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.216
to create a whole entire language
with which dancers express themselves.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.536
So for example,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.896
I can say,

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.120
"I."

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.200
"I."

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.120
In dance that would be ...

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.296
"I."

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.520
Or I can say ...

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.376
"Hey you, come here, come here."

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.600
In dance ...

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.696
"Come here,"
