00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.296
Chea Samy, Soth Sam On and Chheng Phon,

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.376
who would lead the revival of the art form

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.640
from the ashes of war and genocide:

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.296
one student,

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.896
one gesture,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.896
one dance at a time.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.816
They wrote the love,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.296
magic,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.536
beauty,

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.896
history and philosophy of our lineage

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.400
into the bodies of the next generation.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.536
Nearly 40 years later,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.080
Khmer classical dance
has been revived to new heights.
