"Robam kbach boran,"

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.336
or the art of Khmer classical dance,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.160
is more than 1,000 years old.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.576
It was developed as a prayer in movement

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.776
for rain and fertility,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.200
and a prosperity that this meant
for an agricultural society.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.736
Dancers who were both men and women

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.016
were offered to temples

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.120
where they served as living bridges
between heaven and earth.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.736
Their dancing bodies carried the prayers
of the people up to the gods,

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.136
and the will of the deities
was delivered back through them
