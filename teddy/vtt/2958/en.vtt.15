00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.080
Khmer classical dance
has been revived to new heights.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.640
Yet somehow it still exists
in a vulnerable environment.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.816
The disastrous effects of war
still haunt Khmer people today.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.936
It is written in our bodies,

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.496
manifested in a genetic passage of PTSD

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.296
and in families facing cyclical poverty

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.040
and immense cultural rifts
and language barriers.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.400
Yet beauty is a most resilient thing.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.936
Beauty has this ability
to grow anywhere and everywhere
