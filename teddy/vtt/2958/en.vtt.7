00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.816
There's a certain magic

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.976
in the way that things are filtered,
transformed and put together

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.640
to create limitless possibilities in art.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.336
The Khmer word for art,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.576
silapak,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.200
in fact, at its root, means "magic."

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.536
The artist --

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.056
the silapakar,

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.496
or the silapakarani, then,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.680
is nothing short of a magician.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.296
I am very proud to say

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.336
that I belong to a long line of magicians,

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.640
