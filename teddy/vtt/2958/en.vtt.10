Your light skin meant
you didn't have to work beneath the sun.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.576
Under the Khmer Rouge,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.936
who took over Cambodia from 1975 to 1979,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.136
we would all be dead now,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.040
targeted because of our assumed privilege.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.376
You see,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.536

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.176
and they saw centuries
of rigid inequality.
