00:00:00.755 --> 00:00:04.342
I grew up in a family where
my father managed all of the money.

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.987
But for some reason,
when I was eight or nine years old,

00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:09.373
he started showing me things about money.

00:00:09.397 --> 00:00:12.818
We would sit at the kitchen table,
and he'd show me all the bank books.

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:15.531
Now, that was back in the day
before the internet,

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:19.032
when we used to have little books
that we used to keep our information in.

00:00:19.963 --> 00:00:22.425
And he would show me
how he saved in these accounts,

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.323
and he'd pay bills out of these.

00:00:24.347 --> 00:00:26.934
And every time he would show me
something about money,

00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:30.335
he would end by saying,
"And don't you tell your mother."
