The last problem is lack of giving
and getting support.

00:07:32.302 --> 00:07:34.882
Many people don't know
that there are free resources

00:07:34.906 --> 00:07:36.529
online and in your local community

00:07:36.553 --> 00:07:40.684
to help you learn and establish
healthy money habits.

00:07:41.192 --> 00:07:45.589
There are also free resources
if you are a victim of financial abuse,

00:07:45.613 --> 00:07:47.224
like the Purple Purse.

00:07:47.951 --> 00:07:52.272
Giving support includes listening
to others that are financially dependent

00:07:52.296 --> 00:07:55.359
without judgment or criticism.

00:07:55.383 --> 00:07:57.733
It also involves sharing your story,

00:07:57.757 --> 00:08:01.065
because when you share your story,
you empower others,
