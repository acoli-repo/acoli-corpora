00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:30.801
It's even hard for me right now to break
that rule that I learned so long ago.

00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:33.309
So, what can I do? What can you do?

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:36.664
What can we all do to disarm
this invisible weapon?

00:05:36.688 --> 00:05:38.847
We can solve three problems.

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:40.956
The first problem is lack of awareness,

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.983
because knowing about money
and having money

00:05:44.007 --> 00:05:45.671
aren't always the solution.

00:05:46.084 --> 00:05:50.030
In my situation, I was educated
and experienced in managing money,

00:05:50.054 --> 00:05:53.437
but that didn't stop me
from becoming financially dependent.

00:05:53.461 --> 00:05:54.612
Why?

00:05:54.636 --> 00:05:57.799
Because of the beliefs
and experiences I had growing up:

00:05:57.823 --> 00:06:00.304
one person manages all the money.
