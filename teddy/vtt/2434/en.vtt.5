00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.959
For the first time since
that first job at 16 years old,

00:02:31.983 --> 00:02:34.721
I didn't have to be responsible
for managing my money.

00:02:35.253 --> 00:02:38.618
But what I failed to realize was
what felt like freedom

00:02:38.642 --> 00:02:41.016
was really dependency.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.764
My mistake is that I didn't stay involved

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:46.932
or understand what was going on
with our money.

00:02:47.514 --> 00:02:49.408
You may have experienced this yourself,

00:02:49.432 --> 00:02:52.972
or you may have heard stories
of celebrities or professional athletes

00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:56.782
that have relied on family, friends
and others to manage their money,

00:02:56.806 --> 00:03:00.426
and they are left broke,
bankrupt and betrayed
