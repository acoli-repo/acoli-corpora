"How does that happen to someone

00:01:30.103 --> 00:01:33.135
that's educated and skilled
at managing people's money?"

00:01:33.658 --> 00:01:36.707
I had reverted back
to what I learned growing up:

00:01:36.731 --> 00:01:39.758
that one person managed all the money.

00:01:39.782 --> 00:01:42.099
I had handed over my financial power,

00:01:42.123 --> 00:01:45.250
and I had become financially dependent.

00:01:45.917 --> 00:01:49.196
Financial dependency is when someone
is dependent on a person,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.766
a job or a situation for money,

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.523
and they feel trapped.

00:01:53.547 --> 00:01:55.216
People fall into two categories:

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.471
dependent with choice
and dependent without a choice.

00:01:59.104 --> 00:02:03.004
Someone is dependent with choice
when they hand over their financial power
