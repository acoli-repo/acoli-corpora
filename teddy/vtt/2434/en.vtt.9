financial abuse helps keep victims
trapped in their relationship.

00:04:31.702 --> 00:04:36.228
The Purple Purse has coined
financial abuse "the invisible weapon,"

00:04:36.252 --> 00:04:39.388
because visible abuse
leaves bruises and scars

00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:41.694
but financial abuse doesn't.

00:04:41.718 --> 00:04:46.693
Financial abuse and financial dependency
leave emotional scars that you can't see.

00:04:46.717 --> 00:04:51.617
They include hopelessness,
guilt, shame, depression,

00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:54.344
lack of confidence and self-esteem.

00:04:54.831 --> 00:04:59.105
Financial dependency is also invisible,
because no one's talking about it.

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:00.280
