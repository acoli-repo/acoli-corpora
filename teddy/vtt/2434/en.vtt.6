00:02:56.806 --> 00:03:00.426
and they are left broke,
bankrupt and betrayed

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.447
because they made the choice
to hand over their financial power.

00:03:05.153 --> 00:03:08.840
Someone that's dependent
without a choice feels trapped

00:03:08.864 --> 00:03:11.434
because of their financial situation.

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:15.580
They can be in a job or career
where they're unhappy or being harassed

00:03:15.604 --> 00:03:18.494
but they can't afford to leave.

00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.735
Or, someone that's had to move in
with family and friends

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:23.470
because they've had an illness

00:03:23.494 --> 00:03:26.394
or gone through a divorce
or experienced a tragedy,

00:03:26.418 --> 00:03:29.255
and now they're financially
dependent on others.

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:33.451
And how many of us know someone
that has an elderly parent or a relative
