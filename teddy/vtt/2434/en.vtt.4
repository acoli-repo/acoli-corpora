Someone is dependent with choice
when they hand over their financial power

00:02:03.028 --> 00:02:04.987
and their participation.

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:08.532
It can happen in personal

00:02:08.556 --> 00:02:11.358
when one person doesn't want
to be involved with the money,

00:02:11.382 --> 00:02:16.538
so they hand over the responsibility
to a spouse, a partner or a professional,

00:02:16.562 --> 00:02:18.554
like an accountant or a manager.

00:02:18.578 --> 00:02:20.069

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.809
that my husband was interested
and good at managing ours.

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:28.986
I was free!

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.959
For the first time since
that first job at 16 years old,
