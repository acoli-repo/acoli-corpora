00:00:29.776 --> 00:00:33.461
Our farmers are an important part
of all of our communities,

00:00:33.485 --> 00:00:35.818
particularly our rural communities.

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:38.167
And more than that,

00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:41.968
they're a strong driver
of resilient economics.

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.219
Think about it this way:

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:47.672
When a brewer buys hops from me,
grown here in Minnesota,

00:00:47.696 --> 00:00:50.044
90 percent of that dollar
stays in our state,

00:00:50.068 --> 00:00:53.188
compared to just 10 percent
when they buy it from somewhere else.

00:00:53.212 --> 00:00:55.077
What that means is a lot.

00:00:55.101 --> 00:00:57.403
That 90 percent means local jobs.

00:00:57.427 --> 00:01:00.370
It means tax revenue
for better schools and roads.
