00:06:58.772 --> 00:07:00.374
where there used to be hundreds?

00:07:00.954 --> 00:07:04.454
The same could be said
with corn or beans or field crops.

00:07:05.116 --> 00:07:08.815
What happens when it takes 10,000 acres
for one person to support themselves?

00:07:09.871 --> 00:07:11.804
When it used to only take 40.

00:07:13.038 --> 00:07:15.951
We know what happens,
we read about it in the news.

00:07:16.448 --> 00:07:18.068
Broadly determined, rural decline,

00:07:18.092 --> 00:07:19.983
but schools close, schools consolidate,

00:07:20.007 --> 00:07:22.713
post offices close, grocery stores close.

00:07:23.649 --> 00:07:24.847
People leave,

00:07:24.871 --> 00:07:27.271
the community suffers and goes away.

00:07:28.109 --> 00:07:31.204
I believe all of us in this audience
with ties to rural Minnesota
