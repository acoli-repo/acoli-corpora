00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:34.458
However, that shift turned
our farmers from a venerated class

00:06:34.482 --> 00:06:36.228
and a valued class in our society

00:06:36.252 --> 00:06:38.119
into a cost to be minimized.

00:06:39.355 --> 00:06:42.006
That shift made it
so that my great-grandfather,

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.286
who supported the family with six cows,

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.204
that same dairy,

00:06:47.228 --> 00:06:50.117
trying to support their family,
has to be 600 cows today.

00:06:50.141 --> 00:06:54.188
Six-thousand-cow dairies
are not unheard of.

00:06:55.446 --> 00:06:57.549
What happens when
there's this one dairy farm

00:06:57.573 --> 00:06:58.748
in an entire county,

00:06:58.772 --> 00:07:00.374
where there used to be hundreds?
