00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.721
The green movement,
we're all kind of familiar,

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:34.927
started in the '60s, planting trees.

00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:37.188
And now we've come such a long way.

00:03:37.212 --> 00:03:39.488
Green is part of our day-to-day lives.

00:03:39.512 --> 00:03:42.520
It's part of the day-to-day lives
of Fortune 500 businesses.

00:03:42.544 --> 00:03:44.561
It's the subject
of international treaties,

00:03:44.585 --> 00:03:46.696
the subject of presidential debates.

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:49.077
You and I, we switch our light bulbs,

00:03:49.101 --> 00:03:51.272
we use reusable bags.

00:03:51.744 --> 00:03:54.403
We participate in the green movement
each and every day.

00:03:54.427 --> 00:03:55.760
Yet ...

00:03:55.784 --> 00:03:58.514
and this is how we get to the idea --

00:03:58.538 --> 00:03:59.689
the food movement,

00:03:59.713 --> 00:04:03.093
relatively younger,
but also somewhat familiar, I imagine.
