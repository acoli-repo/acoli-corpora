I believe all of us in this audience
with ties to rural Minnesota

00:07:31.228 --> 00:07:32.628
know this story well.

00:07:34.117 --> 00:07:38.998
This is not a problem that we can solve
with farmers markets and good intentions.

00:07:39.022 --> 00:07:41.608
We have to do more for our farmers.

00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:43.895
Policy got us into this mess,

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:45.652
and policy can get us out.

00:07:47.109 --> 00:07:51.781
American farmers are only getting
older, fewer and poorer,

00:07:52.163 --> 00:07:54.430

00:07:54.782 --> 00:07:57.186
They're the vibrancy
in our rural communities.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.552
They're the drivers
of economic growth and stability,
