So what do people usually say
when you're about to give a public talk?

00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:07.627
It's to imagine
that your audience is naked.

00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:09.420
(Laughter)

00:00:09.444 --> 00:00:11.585
Well, I'm doing a different trick tonight,

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:15.156
and I'm going to imagine
all of us without farmers,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.871
and well, it's not so much different.

00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:20.324
[Without farmers you'd be hungry,
naked and sober]

00:00:20.348 --> 00:00:21.349
(Laughter)

00:00:21.373 --> 00:00:24.395
And our farmers do so much more for us

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.307
than simply feed and clothe
and provide us excellent things to drink.

00:00:29.776 --> 00:00:33.461
Our farmers are an important part
of all of our communities,
