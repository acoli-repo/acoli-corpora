Skeptics are thinking,

00:06:01.007 --> 00:06:03.988
"Wow, what do we need to change
about our food system?"

00:06:04.704 --> 00:06:05.904
Farmers are great.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.593
We have unlimited food,
and it's real cheap, too,

00:06:08.617 --> 00:06:09.767
isn't that great?

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:11.696
Well, unfortunately,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.998
in the '80s and the '90s in this country,
we went down a path of policy

00:06:16.022 --> 00:06:18.855
that could be described
as "get big or get out."

00:06:19.926 --> 00:06:23.696
And what "get big or get out" means
is you maximize production

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.254
while minimizing costs.

00:06:25.792 --> 00:06:28.228
On its face value,
that sounds pretty simple.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:34.458
However, that shift turned
our farmers from a venerated class
