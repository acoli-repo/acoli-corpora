00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.147
And this, I think, is what we need to do.

00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:35.409
Just voting with our fork
is not solving the issues

00:04:35.433 --> 00:04:36.782
that our farmers are facing.

00:04:36.806 --> 00:04:38.560
And so we need to do more than that.

00:04:38.584 --> 00:04:41.497
I believe we must move on
from just voting with our fork

00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:43.397
to voting with our vote.

00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:46.278
We need to take our dollars

00:04:46.302 --> 00:04:47.987
and continue to spend them locally.

00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:50.744
We also need to show up
at the ballot box for our farmers.

00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:53.516
This is bigger than just
buying local strawberries

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.317
once a year at a pick-your-own.

00:04:55.341 --> 00:04:57.913
This is a year-round effort
that we must make together

00:04:57.937 --> 00:04:59.324
to make the change we need.

00:04:59.793 --> 00:05:02.324
Changes like fair pricing for farmers.
