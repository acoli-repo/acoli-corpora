00:03:59.713 --> 00:04:03.093
relatively younger,
but also somewhat familiar, I imagine.

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:04.474
You go to the grocery store,

00:04:04.498 --> 00:04:06.307
you see a sign that says "Buy local,"

00:04:06.331 --> 00:04:08.950
you go to the farmers market,
you go to the co-op,

00:04:08.974 --> 00:04:11.238
you read books by prominent authors.

00:04:11.903 --> 00:04:13.117
The food movement to date

00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:16.029
could be summarized
as voting with your fork.

00:04:16.053 --> 00:04:18.592
The idea is: you pull a dollar
out of your wallet --

00:04:18.616 --> 00:04:20.958
how you spend that dollar
affects the food system.

00:04:20.982 --> 00:04:23.249
It supports farmers close to home.

00:04:23.974 --> 00:04:26.482
And that's all well and good,
but where are we going?

00:04:26.506 --> 00:04:28.570
How do we get to our
renewable-energy moment

00:04:28.594 --> 00:04:29.934
like the green movement did?

00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:32.147
And this, I think, is what we need to do.
