00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:00.552
They're the drivers
of economic growth and stability,

00:08:00.576 --> 00:08:04.354
and they are our best protectors
of our shared resources

00:08:04.378 --> 00:08:05.911
of land, water and air.

00:08:06.268 --> 00:08:08.307
So we have to do better for them.

00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:09.798
So join me, would you?

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.728
Let's fight for our farmers.

00:08:11.752 --> 00:08:12.903
You can see it,

00:08:12.927 --> 00:08:16.082
we're already doing it in Minnesota,
having great success.

00:08:16.736 --> 00:08:18.569
And together, we can do even more.

00:08:18.593 --> 00:08:19.815
And we must.

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:23.154
So we were voting with our fork before,

00:08:23.178 --> 00:08:24.970
and we want to keep doing that.

00:08:24.994 --> 00:08:27.877
But if I could have one idea
for you to go home with today,

00:08:27.901 --> 00:08:29.702
it's vote with your vote.

00:08:29.726 --> 00:08:30.996
And so to that end,
