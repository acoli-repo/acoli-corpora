00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.271
Farmer gets ...

00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:01.446
Twelve cents.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.621
Audience: Oh!

00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:05.795
And so how are we supposed to have
strong local farms

00:03:07.342 --> 00:03:08.512

00:03:26.426 --> 00:03:27.656
I'll tell you that.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.947
But first, a story.

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.721
The green movement,
we're all kind of familiar,
