00:02:58.514 --> 00:03:02.033
They all recognize
that urban violence is sticky,

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.451
meaning that it clusters together

00:03:04.475 --> 00:03:08.299
among a surprisingly small number
of people and places.

00:03:08.967 --> 00:03:10.637
In New Orleans, for instance,

00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:13.199
a network of fewer than 700 individuals

00:03:13.223 --> 00:03:16.620
accounts for the majority
of the city's lethal violence.

00:03:16.644 --> 00:03:19.233
Some call these individuals "hot people."

00:03:19.807 --> 00:03:20.982
Here in Boston,

00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:22.356
70 percent of shootings

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.942
are concentrated on blocks and corners
covering just five percent of the city.

00:03:27.688 --> 00:03:30.648
These locations
are often known as "hot spots."
