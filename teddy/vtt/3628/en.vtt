00:00:01.254 --> 00:00:03.912
You are a trauma surgeon,

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:07.334
working in the midnight shift
in an inner city emergency room.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.204
A young man is wheeled in before you,

00:00:10.228 --> 00:00:12.418
lying unconscious on a gurney.

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:15.488
He's been shot in the leg
and is bleeding profusely.

00:00:15.925 --> 00:00:17.822
Judging from the entry and exit wounds,

00:00:17.846 --> 00:00:19.656
as well as the amount of hemorrhaging,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.053
the bullet most likely
clipped the femoral artery,

00:00:22.077 --> 00:00:24.672
one of the largest
blood vessels in the body.

00:00:24.696 --> 00:00:27.998
As the young man's doctor,
what should you do?

00:00:28.022 --> 00:00:31.114
Or more precisely,
what should you do first?
