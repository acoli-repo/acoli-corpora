that we would treat
a gunshot wound in the ER.

00:01:32.137 --> 00:01:35.700
What are we talking about
when we say "urban violence"?

00:01:36.217 --> 00:01:39.259
Urban violence is the lethal
or potentially lethal violence

00:01:39.283 --> 00:01:41.283
that happens on the streets of our cities.

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:43.093
It goes by many names:

00:01:43.117 --> 00:01:45.201
street violence, youth violence,

00:01:45.225 --> 00:01:47.225
gang violence, gun violence.

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:49.796
Urban violence happens

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.744
among the most disadvantaged
and disenfranchised among us.

00:01:53.768 --> 00:01:55.364
Mostly young men,

00:01:55.388 --> 00:01:57.633
without a lot of options or much hope.

00:01:59.328 --> 00:02:02.368
I have spent hundreds of hours
with these young men.
