And you can't stop killings
if you won't go where people get killed.

00:04:03.522 --> 00:04:04.697
Four years ago,

00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:07.355
my colleagues and I performed
a systematic meta-review

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.225
of antiviolence strategies,

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:15.177
summarizing the results of over 1,400
individual impact evaluations.

00:04:15.717 --> 00:04:17.993
What we found, again and again,

00:04:18.017 --> 00:04:20.636
was that the strategies
that were the most focused,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.001
the most targeted,

00:04:22.025 --> 00:04:23.993
the stickiest strategies,

00:04:24.017 --> 00:04:25.533
were the most successful.

00:04:25.927 --> 00:04:27.276
We saw this in criminology,

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.831
in studies of policing,
gang prevention and reentry.
