Meaningful progress on poverty
will take decades to achieve,

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.967
while poor people need and deserve
relief from violence right now.

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:10.664
Root causes also can't explain
the stickiness phenomenon.

00:06:10.974 --> 00:06:13.026
If poverty always drove violence,

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.193
then we would expect to see violence
among all poor people.

00:06:16.534 --> 00:06:18.000
But we don't see that.

00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:23.561
Instead, we can empirically observe
that poverty concentrates,

00:06:23.585 --> 00:06:25.823
crime concentrates further still

00:06:25.847 --> 00:06:28.251
and violence concentrates most of all.

00:06:29.085 --> 00:06:31.367
That is why sticky solutions work.
