00:00:28.022 --> 00:00:31.114
Or more precisely,
what should you do first?

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.621
You look at the young man's clothes,
which seem old and worn.

00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:37.423
He may be jobless, homeless,

00:00:37.447 --> 00:00:39.447
lacking a decent education.

00:00:40.015 --> 00:00:42.658
Do you start treatment
by finding him a job,

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:43.944
getting him an apartment

00:00:43.968 --> 00:00:45.968
or helping him earn his GED?

00:00:46.856 --> 00:00:48.038
On the other hand,

00:00:48.062 --> 00:00:50.777
this young man has been involved
in some sort of conflict

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:52.045
and may be dangerous.

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:53.696
Before he wakes up,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.379
do you place him in restraints,

00:00:55.403 --> 00:00:58.299
alert hospital security or call 911?

00:00:59.868 --> 00:01:02.661
Most of us wouldn't do
any of these things.
