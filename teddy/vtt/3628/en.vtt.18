00:08:59.307 --> 00:09:00.743
using these same techniques,

00:09:00.767 --> 00:09:03.434
but with those at the highest risk
for gun violence.

00:09:03.458 --> 00:09:06.100
And the program is showing
promising results.

00:09:07.169 --> 00:09:08.876
What's more,

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.847
because these strategies
are so focused, so targeted,

00:09:11.871 --> 00:09:14.259
they tend not to cost much
in absolute terms.

00:09:14.561 --> 00:09:17.474
And they work with the laws
already on the books today.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.333
So that's the good news.

00:09:20.947 --> 00:09:23.161
We can have peace in our cities,

00:09:23.185 --> 00:09:24.526
right now,

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:26.355
without big budgets

00:09:26.379 --> 00:09:28.148
and without new laws.
