00:05:31.582 --> 00:05:33.114
What about root causes?

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:37.228
Isn't addressing poverty or inequality
or lack of opportunity

00:05:37.252 --> 00:05:39.252
the best way to prevent violence?

00:05:39.768 --> 00:05:41.323
Well, according to the science,

00:05:41.347 --> 00:05:42.649
yes and no.

00:05:42.673 --> 00:05:46.455
Yes, in that high rates of violence
are clearly associated

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.653
with various forms of social
and economic disadvantage.

00:05:49.677 --> 00:05:51.883
But no, in that changes in these factors

00:05:51.907 --> 00:05:54.783
do not necessarily result
in changes in violence,

00:05:54.807 --> 00:05:56.553
especially not in the short run.

00:05:57.188 --> 00:05:59.114
Take poverty, for instance.

00:05:59.138 --> 00:06:02.796
Meaningful progress on poverty
will take decades to achieve,
