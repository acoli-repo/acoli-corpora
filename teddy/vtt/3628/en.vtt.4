00:01:59.328 --> 00:02:02.368
I have spent hundreds of hours
with these young men.

00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:04.976
I've taught them at a high school
in Washington DC,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.077
where one of my students was murdered.

00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:09.896
I've stood across form them
in courtrooms in New York City,

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.626
where I worked as a prosecutor.

00:02:12.087 --> 00:02:13.269
And finally,

00:02:13.293 --> 00:02:17.109
I've gone from city to city
as a policymaker and as a researcher,

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:18.617
meeting with these young men

00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:21.964
and exchanging ideas
on how to make our communities safer.

00:02:24.923 --> 00:02:26.925
Why should we care about these young men?

00:02:27.942 --> 00:02:29.942
Why does urban violence matter?
