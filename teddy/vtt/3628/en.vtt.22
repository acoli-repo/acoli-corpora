00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:01.815
What are the simplest ways
to reduce violence?

00:11:02.712 --> 00:11:03.950
More cops.

00:11:04.268 --> 00:11:05.586
More jobs.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.014
Fewer guns.

00:11:08.498 --> 00:11:09.855
These are easy to spell out,

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:12.506
but they tend not to work
as well in practice.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:13.744
While on the other hand,

00:11:13.768 --> 00:11:17.022
research-based solutions
are harder to explain,

00:11:17.046 --> 00:11:18.800
but get better results.

00:11:19.504 --> 00:11:21.766
Right now, we have a lot of professors

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.155
writing about violence
in academic journals.

00:11:24.179 --> 00:11:27.313
And we have a lot of people
keeping us safe out on the street.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.839
But what we don't have

00:11:28.863 --> 00:11:31.291
is a lot of communication
between these two groups.
