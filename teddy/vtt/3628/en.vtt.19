00:09:30.411 --> 00:09:32.411
So why hasn't this happened yet?

00:09:32.934 --> 00:09:36.459
Why are these solutions still limited
to a small number of cities,

00:09:36.483 --> 00:09:39.656
and why do they struggle,
even when successful,

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.378
to maintain support?

00:09:42.133 --> 00:09:43.831
Well, that's the bad news.

00:09:43.855 --> 00:09:47.395
The truth is, we have not been very good
at organizing our efforts

00:09:47.419 --> 00:09:49.558
around this phenomenon of stickiness.

00:09:50.249 --> 00:09:53.344
There are at least three reasons
why we don't follow the evidence

00:09:53.368 --> 00:09:55.400
when it comes to urban violence reduction.

00:09:55.424 --> 00:09:57.553
And the first, as you might expect,

00:09:57.577 --> 00:09:58.933
is politics.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:04.045
Most sticky solutions don't conform
to one political platform or another.
