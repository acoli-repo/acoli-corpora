It may be difficult
to acknowledge or accept,

00:12:05.114 --> 00:12:07.876
but race is the third and final reason

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.429
why more has not been done
to reduce violence.

00:12:12.795 --> 00:12:16.414
Urban violence concentrates
among poor communities of color.

00:12:17.152 --> 00:12:20.807
That makes it easy for those of us
who don't live in those communities

00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:24.015
to ignore the problem
or pretend it's not ours to solve.

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:26.728
That is wrong, of course.

00:12:26.752 --> 00:12:29.553
Urban violence is everyone's problem.

00:12:29.577 --> 00:12:31.291
Directly or indirectly,
