00:00:59.868 --> 00:01:02.661
Most of us wouldn't do
any of these things.

00:01:02.685 --> 00:01:05.407
And instead, we would take
the only sensible

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:08.147
and humane course of action
available at the time.

00:01:08.753 --> 00:01:11.253
First, we would stop the bleeding.

00:01:11.277 --> 00:01:13.380
Because unless we stop the bleeding,

00:01:13.404 --> 00:01:15.555
nothing else matters.

00:01:16.957 --> 00:01:20.576
What's true in the emergency room
is true for cities all around the country.

00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:26.164
When it comes to urban violence,
the first priority is to save lives.

00:01:26.188 --> 00:01:28.546
Treating that violence
with the same urgency

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.410
that we would treat
a gunshot wound in the ER.
