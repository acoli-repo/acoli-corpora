00:03:27.688 --> 00:03:30.648
These locations
are often known as "hot spots."

00:03:31.292 --> 00:03:32.834
In city after city,

00:03:32.858 --> 00:03:35.831
a small number of hot people and hot spots

00:03:35.855 --> 00:03:38.701
account for the clear majority
of lethal violence.

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.479
In fact, this finding
has been replicated so many times

00:03:42.503 --> 00:03:46.876
that researchers now call this phenomenon
the law of crime concentration.

00:03:47.365 --> 00:03:52.000
When we look at the science,
we see that sticky solutions work best.

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:54.444
To put it bluntly,

00:03:54.468 --> 00:03:57.995
you can't stop shootings
if you won't deal with shooters.

00:03:58.577 --> 00:04:02.482
And you can't stop killings
if you won't go where people get killed.
