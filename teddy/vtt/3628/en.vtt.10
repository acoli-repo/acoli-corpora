Some worry that when police focus
on certain locations,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.226
crime will be displaced,

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.733
moving down the street
or around the corner.

00:05:07.496 --> 00:05:11.723
Fortunately, we know now
that because of the stickiness phenomenon,

00:05:11.747 --> 00:05:16.131
the replacement and displacement effects
associated with these sticky strategies

00:05:16.155 --> 00:05:17.467
are minimal.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.193
It takes a lifetime of trauma
to create a shooter

00:05:21.217 --> 00:05:24.407
and decades of disinvestment
to create a hot spot.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.105
So these people and places
don't move around easily.
