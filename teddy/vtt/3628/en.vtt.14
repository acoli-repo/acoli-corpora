00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:01.842
to pay attention, to behave and to learn.

00:07:02.387 --> 00:07:04.323
And if poor children can't learn,

00:07:04.347 --> 00:07:06.220
then they can't do well in school.

00:07:06.244 --> 00:07:11.006
And that ultimately impacts their ability
to earn a paycheck later in life

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.900
that is large enough to escape poverty.

00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:16.054
And unfortunately,
in a series of landmark studies

00:07:16.078 --> 00:07:18.220
by economist Raj Chetty,

00:07:18.244 --> 00:07:20.244
that is exactly what we've seen.

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:24.871
Poor children exposed to violence
have lower income mobility

00:07:24.895 --> 00:07:26.895
than poor children who grow up peacefully.

00:07:27.553 --> 00:07:30.947
Violence literally traps
poor kids in poverty.
