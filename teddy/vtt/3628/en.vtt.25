Directly or indirectly,

00:12:31.315 --> 00:12:33.814
we all pay a price
for the shootings and killings

00:12:33.838 --> 00:12:35.838
that happen on the streets of our cities.

00:12:36.417 --> 00:12:39.671
That is why we need to find new ways
to motivate more people

00:12:39.695 --> 00:12:42.667
to cross class and color lines
to join this struggle.

00:12:43.822 --> 00:12:46.861
Because these strategies
are not resource-intensive,

00:12:46.885 --> 00:12:49.496
we don't need to motivate
many new allies --

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.145
we just need a few.

00:12:51.169 --> 00:12:53.169
And we just need them to be loud.

00:12:54.747 --> 00:12:56.899
If we can overcome these challenges

00:12:56.923 --> 00:13:00.363
and spread these sticky solutions
to the neighborhoods that need them,
