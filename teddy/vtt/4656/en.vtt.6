00:02:59.976 --> 00:03:01.798
since you’ll need them later.

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:03.319
This gets you to 6.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.580
Does that help?

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.957
Looking at your options,
you see that 16 is now in your sights.

00:03:08.957 --> 00:03:11.475
You add 5 twice more to reach it.

00:03:11.475 --> 00:03:14.212
Then hit square root twice.

00:03:14.212 --> 00:03:15.571
That gets you to 2.

00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:17.055
You’re on your way!

00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:18.436
Now to 10.

00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:21.059
You can’t get straight 
there through addition alone,

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.867
so you’re going to have 
to reach another square.

00:03:23.867 --> 00:03:28.393
Taking the square root of 9 or 25 would 
get you to a good place,

00:03:28.393 --> 00:03:32.750
but it turns out that 25 
is unreachable from 2.
