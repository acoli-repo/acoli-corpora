Answer in: 3

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:00.973
2

00:02:00.973 --> 00:02:02.077
1.

00:02:02.077 --> 00:02:03.813
You look over your options.

00:02:03.813 --> 00:02:07.124
Adding 5 or 7 increases the number,

00:02:07.124 --> 00:02:09.673
and the square root button 
will make it smaller.

00:02:09.673 --> 00:02:13.032
But there are only a few options 
where you can use that button:

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:13.748
4

00:02:13.748 --> 00:02:14.530
9

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.246
16

00:02:15.246 --> 00:02:16.059
25,

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.942
36,

00:02:16.942 --> 00:02:18.547
and 49.

00:02:18.547 --> 00:02:20.521
You’d love to make 4 or 16.

00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:24.383
Then you could hit the square root button 
once or twice to get 2.

00:02:24.383 --> 00:02:27.972
But you can’t make either with 
just the 5 and 7 buttons.

00:02:27.972 --> 00:02:29.456
What will you do?

00:02:29.456 --> 00:02:33.940
You look at the other possible options for
numbers you could take the square root of.
