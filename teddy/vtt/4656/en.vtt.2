one which adds 5 to the display number,

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:01.681
one which adds 7,

00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:04.243
and one which takes the square root.

00:01:04.243 --> 00:01:07.113
You need to make the display output
the numbers

00:01:07.113 --> 00:01:10.497
2, 10, and 14, 
in that order.

00:01:10.497 --> 00:01:13.509
It’s okay if it outputs different 
numbers in between,

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.294
but there’s no way to reset the display,

00:01:16.294 --> 00:01:17.897
so once you get to 2,

00:01:17.897 --> 00:01:22.416
you’ll have to continue 
on to 10 and 14 from there.

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:24.970
Not only that, Agent Delta explains

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.773
that there are other traps 
built into the panel.

00:01:27.773 --> 00:01:30.858
If it ever shows the same number 
more than once,
