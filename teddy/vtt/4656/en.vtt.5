00:02:29.456 --> 00:02:33.940
You look at the other possible options for
numbers you could take the square root of.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.566
Nine you can’t reach.

00:02:35.566 --> 00:02:39.003
Twenty-five and 49 would take you back to 
5 or 7,

00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:41.333
and you can already get to each
of those.

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:44.646
Thirty-six is your only option.

00:02:44.646 --> 00:02:45.733
You add 5,

00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:46.450
7,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.161
5,

00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:47.916
7,

00:02:47.916 --> 00:02:48.634
5,

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:49.672
7,

00:02:49.672 --> 00:02:51.624
and then hit the square root button.

00:02:51.624 --> 00:02:53.714
Why that series of 5s and 7s?

00:02:53.714 --> 00:02:55.302
It’s somewhat arbitrary,

00:02:55.302 --> 00:02:59.976
but you know that you want 
to avoid 10, 14, and perfect squares,

00:02:59.976 --> 00:03:01.798
since you’ll need them later.
