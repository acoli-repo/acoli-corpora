00:03:58.213 --> 00:04:00.032
You add your way towards it,

00:04:00.032 --> 00:04:03.431
being careful not to hit any 
of the numbers you’ve hit so far.

00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:05.105
You thread your way carefully,

00:04:05.105 --> 00:04:08.063
adding five 5s and two 7s.

00:04:08.063 --> 00:04:12.259
Then, square root to 7, and add 7 more.

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:15.277
The door opens, 
and you’re out of the trap.

00:04:15.277 --> 00:04:17.458
Thanks to your problem-solving skills,

00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:21.673
your team gets Schrödinger’s cats out 
of the box in the nick of time.

00:04:21.673 --> 00:04:24.795
As for Schrödinger, 
you can be certain of one thing:

00:04:24.795 --> 00:04:28.333
he’ll be spending quite some
time in a box of his own.
