If it ever shows the same number 
more than once,

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:32.677
a number greater than 60,

00:01:32.677 --> 00:01:34.801
or a non-whole number,

00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:37.163
the room will explode.

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:42.149
Right now, the display reads zero, 
and time is running out.

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.617
There’s only one way to solve the puzzle,
with a few small variations.

00:01:45.617 --> 00:01:49.973
How will you input the code to escape 
from Dr. Schrödinger’s lair

00:01:49.973 --> 00:01:51.782
and save the day?

00:01:51.782 --> 00:01:58.249
Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself!
