00:03:28.393 --> 00:03:32.750
but it turns out that 25 
is unreachable from 2.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.074
So you add 7 to get to 9,

00:03:35.074 --> 00:03:36.974
then take the square root again.

00:03:36.974 --> 00:03:38.620
That gets you to 3.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.293
Adding 7 again makes 10.

00:03:41.293 --> 00:03:43.995
Finally, you need to reach 14.

00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:48.337
Thinking backwards, you imagine where 
you could be before 14:

00:03:48.337 --> 00:03:50.249
7 or 9.

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:53.684
But 9 won’t work because 
you’ve already used 9.

00:03:53.684 --> 00:03:58.213
However, you could get to 7 
by reaching 49 first.

00:03:58.213 --> 00:04:00.032
You add your way towards it,
