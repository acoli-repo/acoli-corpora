Lauren Hodge: If you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
which would you choose, grilled or fried chicken?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now most people would answer grilled,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and it's true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
However, grilled chicken poses a hidden danger.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The hidden danger is heterocyclic amines --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
specifically phenomethylimidazopyridine,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
or PhIP --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
(laughter)

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
A carcinogen is any substance or agent

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that causes abnormal growth of cells,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
which can also cause them to metastasize or spread.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
They are also organic compounds
