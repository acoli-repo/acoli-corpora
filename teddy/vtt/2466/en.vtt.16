I'd like to share with you
a piano metaphor,

00:08:02.144 --> 00:08:05.129
to have you have a better
understanding of how ASL works.

00:08:05.153 --> 00:08:06.711
So, envision a piano.

00:08:08.299 --> 00:08:11.654
ASL is broken down into
many different grammatical parameters.

00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:16.831
If you assign a different parameter
to each finger as you play the piano --

00:08:16.855 --> 00:08:21.860
such as facial expression, body movement,

00:08:21.884 --> 00:08:25.656
speed, hand shape and so on,

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.888
as you play the piano --

00:08:27.912 --> 00:08:29.749
English is a linear language,

00:08:29.773 --> 00:08:32.578
as if one key is being pressed at a time.
