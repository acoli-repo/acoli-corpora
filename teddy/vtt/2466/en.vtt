Interpreter: Piano, "p,"
is my favorite musical symbol.

00:00:07.504 --> 00:00:09.293
It means to play softly.

00:00:10.007 --> 00:00:14.170
If you're playing a musical instrument
and you notice a "p" in the score,

00:00:14.194 --> 00:00:15.817
you need to play softer.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.480
Two p's -- even softer.

00:00:18.804 --> 00:00:21.959
Four p's -- extremely soft.

00:00:26.353 --> 00:00:29.756

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.090
