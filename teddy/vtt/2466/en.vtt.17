00:08:29.773 --> 00:08:32.578
as if one key is being pressed at a time.

00:08:32.602 --> 00:08:36.250
However, ASL is more like a chord --

00:08:36.274 --> 00:08:39.658
all 10 fingers need
to come down simultaneously

00:08:39.682 --> 00:08:43.304
to express a clear concept or idea in ASL.

00:08:45.548 --> 00:08:49.574
If just one of those keys
were to change the chord,

00:08:49.598 --> 00:08:51.791
it would create a completely
different meaning.

00:08:52.152 --> 00:08:56.426
The same applies to music
in regards to pitch, tone and volume.
