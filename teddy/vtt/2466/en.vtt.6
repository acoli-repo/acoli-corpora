00:02:59.353 --> 00:03:01.435
around sound, about what's to come next.

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.743
Hence, this drawing.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.894
TBD, to be decided.

00:03:07.724 --> 00:03:10.264
TBC, to be continued.

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.616
TBA, to be announced.

00:03:16.793 --> 00:03:18.659
And you notice the staff --

00:03:18.683 --> 00:03:20.874
there are no notes contained in the lines.

00:03:20.898 --> 00:03:24.546
That's because the lines
already contain sound

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.901
through the subtle smudges and smears.

00:03:28.863 --> 00:03:32.242
In Deaf culture,
movement is equivalent to sound.
