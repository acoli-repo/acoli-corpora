There's a massive culture
around spoken language.

00:06:01.233 --> 00:06:06.500
And just because I don't use
my literal voice to communicate,

00:06:06.524 --> 00:06:10.276
in society's eyes
it's as if I don't have a voice at all.

00:06:12.945 --> 00:06:16.863
So I need to work with individuals
who can support me as an equal

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:18.359
and become my voice.

00:06:20.523 --> 00:06:24.765
And that way, I'm able to maintain
relevancy in society today.

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:27.211
So at school, at work and institutions,

00:06:27.235 --> 00:06:29.559
I work with many
different ASL interpreters.
