00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:31.816
Is it going to further
distance me from art?

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.496
I realized that doesn't
have to be the case at all.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.671
I actually know sound.

00:04:37.695 --> 00:04:40.337
I know it so well

00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:43.699
that it doesn't have to be something
just experienced through the ears.

00:04:43.723 --> 00:04:46.708
It could be felt tactually,

00:04:46.732 --> 00:04:48.615
or experienced as a visual,

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.313
or even as an idea.

00:04:53.048 --> 00:04:56.309
So I decided to reclaim ownership of sound

00:04:56.333 --> 00:04:58.447
and to put it into my art practice.
