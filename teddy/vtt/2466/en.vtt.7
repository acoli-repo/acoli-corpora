In Deaf culture,
movement is equivalent to sound.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:40.301
This is a sign for "staff" in ASL.

00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:42.817
A typical staff contains five lines.

00:03:43.904 --> 00:03:46.678
Yet for me, signing it
with my thumb sticking up like that

00:03:46.702 --> 00:03:48.029
doesn't feel natural.

00:03:48.053 --> 00:03:51.461
That's why you'll notice in my drawings,
I stick to four lines on paper.

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:57.188
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity
to travel to Berlin, Germany,

00:03:57.212 --> 00:03:58.981
for an artist residency there.
