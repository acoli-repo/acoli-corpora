00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.930
So how is it that I understand sound?

00:02:06.282 --> 00:02:09.226
Well, I watch how people
behave and respond to sound.

00:02:10.654 --> 00:02:14.276
You people are like my loudspeakers,
and amplify sound.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.421
I learn and mirror that behavior.

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:19.733
At the same time,
I've learned that I create sound,

00:02:19.757 --> 00:02:21.914
and I've seen how people respond to me.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.456
Thus I've learned, for example ...

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.119
"Don't slam the door!"

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.747
"Don't make too much noise when
you're eating from the potato-chip bag!"
