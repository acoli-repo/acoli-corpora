00:07:29.186 --> 00:07:30.703
For example,

00:07:30.727 --> 00:07:33.079
a musical note

00:07:33.103 --> 00:07:36.126
cannot be fully captured
and expressed on paper.

00:07:36.783 --> 00:07:39.835
And the same holds true
for a concept in ASL.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.624
They're both highly spatial
and highly inflected --

00:07:50.213 --> 00:07:52.370
meaning that subtle changes

00:07:52.394 --> 00:07:54.903
can affect the entire meaning

00:07:54.927 --> 00:07:56.711
of both signs and sounds.

00:07:59.898 --> 00:08:02.120
I'd like to share with you
a piano metaphor,
