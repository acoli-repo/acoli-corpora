00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:02.819
Prior to this time,
I had been working as a painter.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.075
During this summer, I visited
different museums and gallery spaces,

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.081
and as I went from one place to the next,

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:13.424
I noticed there was no visual art there.

00:04:14.618 --> 00:04:19.885
At that time, sound was trending,
and this struck me ...

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:21.887
there was no visual art,

00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:23.418
everything was auditory.

00:04:25.482 --> 00:04:28.122
Now sound has come into my art territory.

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:31.816
Is it going to further
distance me from art?
