power, control --

00:05:30.375 --> 00:05:31.919
social currency.

00:05:35.782 --> 00:05:39.646
In the back of my mind, I've always felt
that sound was your thing,

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.157
a hearing person's thing.

00:05:44.014 --> 00:05:46.489
And sound is so powerful

00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:50.269
that it could either
disempower me and my artwork,

00:05:50.293 --> 00:05:52.301
or it could empower me.

00:05:53.138 --> 00:05:54.675
I chose to be empowered.

00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:00.317
There's a massive culture
around spoken language.
