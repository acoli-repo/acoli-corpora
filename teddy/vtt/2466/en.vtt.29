that you don't need
to be deaf to learn ASL,

00:14:32.007 --> 00:14:34.294
nor do you have to be hearing
to learn music.

00:14:36.891 --> 00:14:39.586
ASL is such a rich treasure

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.395
that I'd like you
to have the same experience.

00:14:42.419 --> 00:14:45.195
And I'd like to invite you
to open your ears,

00:14:45.219 --> 00:14:47.110
to open your eyes,

00:14:47.134 --> 00:14:48.845
take part in our culture

00:14:48.869 --> 00:14:51.388
and experience our visual language.

00:14:51.412 --> 00:14:52.847
And you never know,

00:14:52.871 --> 00:14:54.611
you might just fall in love with us.

00:14:54.635 --> 00:14:56.693
(Applause)

00:14:56.717 --> 00:14:57.879
Thank you.
