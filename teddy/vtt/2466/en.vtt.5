"Don't make too much noise when
you're eating from the potato-chip bag!"

00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:32.771
(Laughter)

00:02:32.795 --> 00:02:34.063
"Don't burp,

00:02:34.087 --> 00:02:35.268
and when you're eating,

00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:38.134
make sure you don't scrape
your utensils on the plate."

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.688
All of these things
I term "sound etiquette."

00:02:43.927 --> 00:02:46.358
Maybe I think about sound etiquette

00:02:46.382 --> 00:02:48.596
more than the average hearing person does.

00:02:49.963 --> 00:02:51.919
I'm hyper-vigilant around sound.

00:02:55.463 --> 00:02:59.329
And I'm always waiting
in eager nervous anticipation

00:02:59.353 --> 00:03:01.435
around sound, about what's to come next.
