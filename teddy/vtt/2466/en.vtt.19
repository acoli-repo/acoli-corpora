00:09:29.608 --> 00:09:30.779
Uh-oh.

00:09:33.521 --> 00:09:34.935
What are you looking at?

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:38.738
Aw, stop.

00:09:38.762 --> 00:09:40.431
(Laughter)

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:41.639
I then started thinking,

00:09:41.663 --> 00:09:44.580
"What if I was to look at ASL
through a musical lens?"

00:09:45.011 --> 00:09:48.218
If I was to create a sign
and repeat it over and over,

00:09:48.242 --> 00:09:50.631
it could become
like a piece of visual music.

00:09:52.016 --> 00:09:55.652
For example, this is the sign for "day,"

00:09:55.676 --> 00:09:57.848
as the sun rises and sets.

00:09:59.789 --> 00:10:02.129
This is "all day."
