00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:00.606
what automatically comes to mind for me
is "at the same time."

00:12:01.645 --> 00:12:04.856
So notice RH: right hand, LH: left hand.

00:12:05.578 --> 00:12:08.197
We have the staff
across the head and the chest.

00:12:08.221 --> 00:12:09.403
[Head: RH, Flash claw]

00:12:09.427 --> 00:12:10.677
[Common time]

00:12:10.701 --> 00:12:12.234
[Chest: LH, Flash claw]

00:12:13.712 --> 00:12:16.810
I'm now going to demonstrate
a hand shape called the "flash claw."

00:12:18.722 --> 00:12:20.699
Can you please follow along with me?

00:12:21.723 --> 00:12:23.067
Everybody, hands up.

00:12:26.776 --> 00:12:29.474
Now we're going to do it
in both the head and the chest,

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:31.872
kind of like "common time"
or at the same time.
