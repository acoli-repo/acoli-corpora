When people meet me
for the first time on my job,

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.726
they often feel inspired to share
a revelation they've had about me,

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.268
and it kind of goes something like this.

00:00:10.292 --> 00:00:12.559
"Hey, I know why police chiefs

00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:15.018
like to share their deep,
dark secrets with you.

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:18.059
Phil, with your PhD in psychology,

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:19.351
and your shiny bald head,

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:21.518
you're basically
the Black Dr. Phil, right?"

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:22.768
(Laughter)

00:00:22.792 --> 00:00:25.434
And for each and every person
who's ever said that to me

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:26.726
I do want to say thank you

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.351
because that was the first time
I ever heard that joke.

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:30.393
(Laughter)
