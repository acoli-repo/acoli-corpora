00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:13.989
This syringe contains a radioactive form 
of glucose known as FDG.

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:18.025
The doctor will soon inject its contents 
into her patient’s arm,

00:00:18.025 --> 00:00:21.158
whom she’s testing for cancer 
using a PET scanner.

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:24.598
The FDG will quickly circulate 
through his body.

00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:25.888
If he has a tumor,

00:00:25.888 --> 00:00:30.538
cancer cells within it will take up a 
significant portion of the FDG,
