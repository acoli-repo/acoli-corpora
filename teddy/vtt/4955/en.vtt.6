00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:04.645
in which the mass of the two particles is 
converted into two high-energy photons,

00:03:04.645 --> 00:03:06.146
similar to X-rays,

00:03:06.146 --> 00:03:08.736
that shoot out in opposite directions.

00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:10.976
These photons will then impact an array

00:03:10.976 --> 00:03:14.976
of paired radiation detectors 
in the scanner walls.

00:03:14.976 --> 00:03:18.006
The software in the scanner 
uses those detectors

00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:21.726
to estimate where inside the body 
the collision occurred

00:03:21.726 --> 00:03:25.476
and create a 3D map of the 
tracer’s distribution.

00:03:25.476 --> 00:03:27.936
PET scans can detect the spread of cancer

00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:31.056
before it can be spotted with 
other types of imaging.
