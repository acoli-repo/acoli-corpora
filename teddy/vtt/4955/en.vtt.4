00:01:55.924 --> 00:02:00.415
FDG is a common one because the rate at 
which cells consume glucose

00:02:00.415 --> 00:02:02.391
can signal the presence of cancer;

00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:04.021
the location of an infection;

00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:07.721
or the slowing brain function of dementia.

00:02:07.721 --> 00:02:10.911
The FDG is now ready for 
the patient’s scan.

00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:13.861
When a radiolabeled tracer 
enters the body,

00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:18.351
it travels through the circulatory system 
and gets taken up by its target—

00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:22.641
whether that's a protein in the brain,
cancer cells, or otherwise.

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:23.996
Within a few minutes,

00:02:23.996 --> 00:02:27.996
a significant amount of the tracer has 
found its way to the target area

00:02:27.996 --> 00:02:30.866
and the rest has cleared from circulation.
