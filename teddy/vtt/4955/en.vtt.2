00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.273
like protons faster and faster 
along a spiraling path.

00:01:00.273 --> 00:01:02.967
When the protons reach 
their maximum speed,

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:08.117
they shoot out onto a target that contains
a few milliliters of a type of water

00:01:08.117 --> 00:01:12.361
with a heavy form of oxygen 
called oxygen-18.

00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:16.200
When a proton slams into one of these 
heavier oxygen atoms,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.390
it kicks out another subatomic particle 
called a neutron.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.985
This impact turns oxygen-18 
into fluorine-18,

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:29.225
a radioactive isotope that can be 
detected on a PET scan.

00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:30.844
In a little under two hours,
