00:00:25.888 --> 00:00:30.538
cancer cells within it will take up a 
significant portion of the FDG,

00:00:30.538 --> 00:00:33.538
which will act as a beacon 
for the scanner.

00:00:33.548 --> 00:00:35.939
PET tracers such as FDG

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:39.679
are among the most remarkable tools 
in medical diagnostics,

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.619
and their life begins in 
a particle accelerator,

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:44.939
just hours earlier.

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:48.539
The particle accelerator in question 
is called a cyclotron,

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.739
and it’s often housed in a bunker 
within hospitals.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.879
It uses electromagnetic fields to propel 
charged particles

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.273
like protons faster and faster 
along a spiraling path.
