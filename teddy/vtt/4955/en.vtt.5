00:02:27.996 --> 00:02:30.866
and the rest has cleared from circulation.

00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:33.666
Now the doctors can see 
their target using a PET,

00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:37.786
or positron emission tomography, scanner.

00:02:37.786 --> 00:02:41.856
The radiation that the tracer emits 
is what makes this possible.

00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:46.066
The isotopes used in PET decay 
by positron emission.

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:50.189
Positrons are essentially electrons 
with positive charge.

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.235
When emitted, a positron collides 
with an electron

00:02:53.235 --> 00:02:56.375
from another molecule in its surroundings.

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:59.165
This causes a tiny nuclear reaction

00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:04.645
in which the mass of the two particles is 
converted into two high-energy photons,
