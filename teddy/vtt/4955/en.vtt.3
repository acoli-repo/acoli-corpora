00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:30.844
In a little under two hours,

00:01:30.844 --> 00:01:34.554
about half the fluorine will be gone 
due to radioactive decay,

00:01:34.554 --> 00:01:38.264
so the clock is ticking 
to get the scan done.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:42.034
So how can fluorine-18 be 
used to detect diseases?

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:46.024
Radiochemists at the hospital can use 
a series of chemical reactions

00:01:46.024 --> 00:01:49.664
to attach the radioactive fluorine 
to different molecules,

00:01:49.664 --> 00:01:51.874
creating radiotracers.

00:01:51.874 --> 00:01:55.924
The identity of the tracer depends on what
doctors want to observe.

00:01:55.924 --> 00:02:00.415
FDG is a common one because the rate at 
which cells consume glucose
