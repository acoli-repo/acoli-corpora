00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:31.056
before it can be spotted with 
other types of imaging.

00:03:31.056 --> 00:03:34.936
They’re also revolutionizing the diagnosis
of Alzheimer’s disease

00:03:34.936 --> 00:03:37.356
by allowing doctors to see amyloid,

00:03:37.356 --> 00:03:41.656
the telltale protein buildup that 
otherwise couldn’t be confirmed

00:03:41.656 --> 00:03:43.270
without an autopsy.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.475
Meanwhile, researchers are actively 
working to develop new tracers

00:03:47.475 --> 00:03:52.015
and expand the possibilities of what 
PET scans can be used for.

00:03:52.015 --> 00:03:56.262
But with all this talk of radiation and
nuclear reactions inside the body,

00:03:56.262 --> 00:03:57.806
are these scans safe?

00:03:57.806 --> 00:04:01.986
Even though no amount of ionizing 
radiation is completely safe,
