Even though no amount of ionizing 
radiation is completely safe,

00:04:01.986 --> 00:04:06.530
the amount of radiation the body receives
during a PET scan is actually quite low.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.641
One scan is comparable to what you’re 
exposed to over two or three years

00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:14.091
from natural radioactive sources, 
like radon gas;

00:04:14.091 --> 00:04:16.111
or the amount a pilot would rack up

00:04:16.111 --> 00:04:20.531
from cosmic radiation after 
20 to 30 transatlantic flights.

00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:23.143
Most patients feel that those risks 
are acceptable

00:04:23.143 --> 00:04:26.673
for the chance to diagnose 
and treat their illnesses.
