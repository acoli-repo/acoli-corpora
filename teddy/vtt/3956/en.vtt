00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.616
In the year 1901,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.120
a woman called Auguste was taken
to a medical asylum in Frankfurt.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.496
Auguste was delusional

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.520
and couldn't remember
even the most basic details of her life.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.400
Her doctor was called Alois.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.096
Alois didn't know how to help Auguste,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.640
but he watched over her until,
sadly, she passed away in 1906.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.256
After she died, Alois performed an autopsy

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.496
and found strange plaques
and tangles in Auguste's brain --

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.856
the likes of which he'd never seen before.
