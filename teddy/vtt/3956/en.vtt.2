00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.136
We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines
to protect us from infections,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.016
many treatments for cancer,
antiretrovirals for HIV,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.520
statins for heart disease and much more.

00:01:10.896 --> 00:01:17.761
But we've made essentially no progress
at all in treating Alzheimer's disease.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.976
I'm part of a team of scientists

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.286
who has been working to find
a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.256
So I think about this all the time.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.880
Alzheimer's now affects
40 million people worldwide.
