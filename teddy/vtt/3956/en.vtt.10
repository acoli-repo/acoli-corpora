00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.696
Cutting one wire might do nothing.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.320
Cutting others might
make the bomb explore.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.336
We have to find the right step to block,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.480
and then create a drug that does it.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.056
Until recently, we for the most part

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.536
have been cutting wires
and hoping for the best.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.416
But now we've got together
a diverse group of people --

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.016
medics, biologists, geneticists, chemists,
physicists, engineers and mathematicians.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.256
And together, we've managed
to identify a critical step in the process

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.496
and are now testing a new class of drugs
which would specifically block this step
