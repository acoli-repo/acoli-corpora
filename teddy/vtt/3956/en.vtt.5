Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical
and social challenges of our generation.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.040
But we've done relatively
little to address it.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.480
Today, of the top 10
causes of death worldwide,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.520
Alzheimer's is the only one
we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.160
We understand less about the science
of Alzheimer's than other diseases

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.600
because we've invested less time
and money into researching it.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.376
The US government
spends 10 times more every year

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.376
on cancer research than on Alzheimer's
