00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.856
For most of the past 114 years,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.336
everyone, including scientists, mistakenly
confused Alzheimer's with aging.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.837
We thought that becoming senile

00:03:37.861 --> 00:03:40.100
was a normal and inevitable
part of getting old.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.016
But we only have to look at a picture

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.896
of a healthy aged brain compared
to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.960
to see the real physical damage
caused by this disease.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.816
As well as triggering severe loss
of memory and mental abilities,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.056
the damage to the brain
caused by Alzheimer's

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.840
significantly reduces life expectancy
and is always fatal.
