significantly reduces life expectancy
and is always fatal.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.536
Remember Dr. Alzheimer
found strange plaques and tangles

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.560
in Auguste's brain a century ago.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.280
For almost a century,
we didn't know much about these.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.920
Today we know they're made
from protein molecules.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.296
You can imagine a protein molecule

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.360
as a piece of paper that normally folds
into an elaborate piece of origami.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.256
There are spots
on the paper that are sticky.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.536
And when it folds correctly,
these sticky bits end up on the inside.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.016
But sometimes things go wrong,
and some sticky bits are on the outside.
