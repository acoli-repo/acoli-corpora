00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.496
and are now testing a new class of drugs
which would specifically block this step

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.040
and stop the disease.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.856
Now let me show you
some of our latest results.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.536
No one outside of our lab
has seen these yet.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.536
Let's look at some videos of what happened
when we tested these new drugs in worms.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.416
So these are healthy worms,

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.640
and you can see
they're moving around normally.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.000
These worms, on the other hand,

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.576
have protein molecules
sticking together inside them --

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.216
like humans with Alzheimer's.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.536
And you can see they're clearly sick.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.536
But if we give our new drugs
to these worms at an early stage,
