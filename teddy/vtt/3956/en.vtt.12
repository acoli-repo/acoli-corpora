00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.536
But if we give our new drugs
to these worms at an early stage,

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.240
then we see that they're healthy,
and they live a normal lifespan.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.856
This is just an initial positive result,
but research like this

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.616
shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease
that we can understand and we can cure.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.536
After 114 years of waiting,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.936
there's finally real hope
for what can be achieved

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.680
in the next 10 or 20 years.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.360
But to grow that hope,
to finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.776
This isn't about scientists like me --
