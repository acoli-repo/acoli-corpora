00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.016
But sometimes things go wrong,
and some sticky bits are on the outside.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.056
This causes the protein molecules
to stick to each other,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.760
forming clumps that eventually become
large plaques and tangles.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.400
That's what we see
in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.336
We've spent the past 10 years
at the University of Cambridge

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.080
trying to understand
how this malfunction works.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.496
There are many steps, and identifying
which step to try to block is complex --

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.800
like defusing a bomb.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.696
Cutting one wire might do nothing.
