00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.776
This isn't about scientists like me --

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.000
it's about you.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.176
We need you to raise awareness
that Alzheimer's is a disease

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.816
and that if we try, we can beat it.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.656
In the case of other diseases,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.816
patients and their families
have led the charge for more research

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.776
and put pressure on governments,
the pharmaceutical industry,

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.016
scientists and regulators.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.896
That was essential for advancing treatment
for HIV in the late 1980s.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.600
Today, we see that same drive
to beat cancer.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.656
But Alzheimer's patients are often
unable to speak up for themselves.
