But by 2050, it will affect
150 million people --

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.520
which, by the way,
will include many of you.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.040
If you're hoping
to live to be 85 or older,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.840
your chance of getting Alzheimer's
will be almost one in two.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.816
In other words, odds are
you'll spend your golden years

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.056
either suffering from Alzheimer's

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.400
or helping to look after a friend
or loved one with Alzheimer's.
