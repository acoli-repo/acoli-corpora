You and Paul Allen spoke about this
even as you were founding Microsoft.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.011
BG: Yeah, I was in high school with Paul,
he was two years ahead of me.

00:06:06.035 --> 00:06:10.021
And he showed me on page 73
of "Electronics" magazine

00:06:10.045 --> 00:06:12.847
that chips were going to double --
this is Moore's law --

00:06:12.871 --> 00:06:14.688
in power every year.

00:06:14.712 --> 00:06:19.768
And people should just be
mind-blown if that's true,

00:06:19.792 --> 00:06:22.887
because what it means
is these big computers

00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:25.664
that Paul and I would stay up
till three in the morning

00:06:25.688 --> 00:06:27.694
just to get an hour of time on,

00:06:27.718 --> 00:06:33.050
that people will have it
on an individual level, 24 hours a day.
