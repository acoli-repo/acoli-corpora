00:10:57.553 --> 00:11:02.704
but absent getting rid of human freedom
to choose what you read online,

00:11:02.728 --> 00:11:05.399
the solutions are still too limited.

00:11:05.423 --> 00:11:07.282
CA: Do you have solutions?

00:11:07.306 --> 00:11:09.768
What would be your advice

00:11:09.792 --> 00:11:12.102
to someone like Mark
Zuckerberg at this moment?

00:11:12.126 --> 00:11:16.898
Because you were, for a while,
regarded with as much,

00:11:16.922 --> 00:11:19.335
I would say, mistrust,
by parts of the world.

00:11:19.359 --> 00:11:23.319
You know, Microsoft was perceived
as a super powerful monopoly,

00:11:23.343 --> 00:11:25.276
and you were facing government action,

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.879
and certainly in Silicon Valley,
you weren't the most popular person there.

00:11:28.903 --> 00:11:31.577
And yet, here you are,
in a very different place today.
