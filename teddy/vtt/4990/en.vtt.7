There's no reason only poor people
should have the experience.

00:03:31.822 --> 00:03:33.672
(Laughter)

00:03:33.696 --> 00:03:36.593
(Studio) CA: Great line,
got you headlines around the world.

00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:39.942
But I was interviewing you and I was
a couple of earnest questions in,

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:42.138
and suddenly, the audience
started guffawing.

00:03:42.457 --> 00:03:45.331
(TED Talk) CA: I'm not distracted,
I'm reading a question.

00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:47.815
(Laughter)

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:50.220
(Studio) CA: And I didn't know
what had happened.

00:03:50.244 --> 00:03:53.696
This was at the time, I guess
there was still Microsoft-Apple rivalry.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.227
I had opened my laptop,
and there was this big, glowing Apple logo

00:03:57.251 --> 00:03:58.585
right in your face.

00:03:58.609 --> 00:03:59.609
(BG laughs)

00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:01.396
And that was bad.
