00:04:33.728 --> 00:04:36.196
you've influenced so many people
with your thinking.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.188
So that's what we're going to talk about,

00:04:38.212 --> 00:04:41.963
and I'd love to just start with
that technology vision that you had

00:04:41.987 --> 00:04:46.613
of, you know, a computer
on every desktop and in every home.

00:04:46.637 --> 00:04:50.613
I mean, in a way, that has come true
more than you could have imagined, right?

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:58.091
BG: Yeah, it's pretty phenomenal
that what was viewed as a silly dream

00:04:58.115 --> 00:05:00.297
is now so commonplace.
