00:01:27.536 --> 00:01:32.827
and about a man facing the same kind
of scrutiny he was 20 years ago,

00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:35.095
Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg.

00:01:35.518 --> 00:01:37.795
But the biggest single topic
of our conversation

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.208
ended up being around philanthropy.

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:41.998
Not just because the Gates Foundation

00:01:42.022 --> 00:01:44.688
is the single largest
foundation out there,

00:01:44.712 --> 00:01:48.077
but because Bill's influence
goes far beyond that,

00:01:48.101 --> 00:01:50.692
thanks to his conversations
with governments

00:01:50.716 --> 00:01:54.307
and his championing of the Giving Pledge,

00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:57.331
where he's persuaded
nearly 200 billionaires

00:01:57.355 --> 00:02:00.705
to commit more than half
their fortunes to philanthropy.
