00:13:27.888 --> 00:13:30.127
The idea that software
was a good thing, though,

00:13:30.151 --> 00:13:31.658
wasn't what was in question.

00:13:31.682 --> 00:13:34.697
What was in question
was did the market share

00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:39.583
or our competitive practices at Microsoft,

00:13:39.607 --> 00:13:41.490
were they appropriate.

00:13:41.514 --> 00:13:44.681
You know, giving opportunities
for other people to compete with us.

00:13:44.705 --> 00:13:45.856
It wasn't so much

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.274
that our dream of personal computing
was bad for the world.

00:13:49.641 --> 00:13:51.927
CA: And part of what seems
to have happened today

00:13:51.951 --> 00:13:55.645
is that it's some mix
of the corporate system

00:13:55.669 --> 00:13:59.200
giving these giant companies
that are powered by advertizing

00:13:59.224 --> 00:14:03.169
incentives that are at odds
with the public good.
