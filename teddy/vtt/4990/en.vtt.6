CA: I'm hugely looking forward
to this conversation,

00:03:01.173 --> 00:03:04.232
I hope it goes better than
the very first time I interviewed you,

00:03:04.256 --> 00:03:07.791
which was possibly one of the more
embarrassing moments of my TED time.

00:03:07.815 --> 00:03:09.530
I don't know if you remember this --

00:03:09.554 --> 00:03:10.733
we were onstage,

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:14.368
you'd just given this amazing talk
where you'd released a jar of mosquitoes

00:03:14.392 --> 00:03:15.598
into the audience.

00:03:15.622 --> 00:03:18.256
(TED Talk) BG: Now,
malaria's transmitted by mosquitoes,

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.904
and I brought some here
so you could experience this.

00:03:20.928 --> 00:03:26.127
We'll let those roam around
the auditorium a little bit.

00:03:26.151 --> 00:03:27.498
(Laughter)

00:03:27.522 --> 00:03:28.709
There.

00:03:28.733 --> 00:03:31.798
There's no reason only poor people
should have the experience.
