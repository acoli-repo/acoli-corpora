You know, 10 years of doubling
is 1,000 times improvement,

00:06:37.288 --> 00:06:38.915

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:41.955
the only thing limiting
is going to be the software,"

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:45.687
and to Paul's credit,
from that moment forward,

00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:49.664
he wanted me to drop out
so we could get going,

00:06:49.688 --> 00:06:54.331

where I was at Harvard,

00:06:54.355 --> 00:06:56.276

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.760
"Hey, we've got to get going,

00:06:57.784 --> 00:07:00.940
and get on the ground floor
of doing the software."
