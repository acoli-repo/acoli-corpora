00:07:58.443 --> 00:08:02.617
in a way that our partnership
would be pretty magical.

00:08:03.157 --> 00:08:07.372
And so there wouldn't be
a Microsoft without Paul

00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:11.487
and even after he left Microsoft,
he funded lots of amazing things,

00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:15.084
like this Brain Institute
that's doing great things,

00:08:15.108 --> 00:08:16.711
and will continue to.

00:08:16.735 --> 00:08:19.862
So his legacy will live on.

00:08:19.886 --> 00:08:21.332
He also, in those later years,

00:08:21.356 --> 00:08:24.926
got to enjoy owning
the Seattle football team,

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.887
and it was fun to see him enjoying that.

00:08:26.911 --> 00:08:31.502
But the main thing about Paul
is he was so curious about everything.
