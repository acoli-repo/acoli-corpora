00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.256
Where you really
do have to rely on others.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.936
And so it creates a kind of --
everybody's vulnerable together.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.496
And it makes you close.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.336
AG: When you think about
getting to know people in a group,

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.176
what comes first --
trust or vulnerability?

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.376
Most of us assume
that you have to build trust

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.856
in order to be vulnerable.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.976
But actually, the opposite is true.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.096
DC: Our intuition has it backwards.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.416
You do not build trust
in order to be vulnerable.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.056
When you're vulnerable, it builds trust.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.936
Being vulnerable together
builds closeness and creates it.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.096
AG: Consider an experiment
where people were told to ask strangers
