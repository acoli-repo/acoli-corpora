AG: Consider an experiment
where people were told to ask strangers

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:05.320
simple but increasingly
personal questions:

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.056
When was the last time
you sang to yourself?

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.576
Or to someone else?

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.416
Is there something you've dreamed
of doing for a long time?

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.016
Why haven't you done it?

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.576
If your house was on fire,

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.160
what one belonging would you save and why?

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.336
DC: And then you answer those questions
back and forth to each other.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.656
And at the end of it,

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.456
you take these tests
of cooperation and closeness

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.256
and it turns out you're way closer.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:33.416
In fact, two of the original strangers
they gave the experimenter to got married.
