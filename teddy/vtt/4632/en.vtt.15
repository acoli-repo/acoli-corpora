00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.880
AG: Meet Jeff Ashby.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.296
Jeff is the chief
of mission assurance at Blue Origin,

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.360
the rocket company founded by Jeff Bezos.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.216

whether it's a brand new crew

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.416
or someone that you've known
maybe all your life and worked with,

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.456
is to immerse yourself with that person
