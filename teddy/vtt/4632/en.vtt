Paolo Nespoli: It feels to me,
the rare moment you have in life --

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.376
that, you know, surreal situation --

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.056
and you are like
living in a different time zone,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.120
in a different time speed.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.616
Adam Grant: This is Paolo Nespoli.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.856
He's an astronaut.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.696
(Radio) PN: Roger, stand by a second.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.536
(Music)

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.216
In 2011, on the International
Space Station,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.016
Paolo and his crewmate, Cady,
had to do an insane maneuver

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.816
using a robotic arm
to capture a free-flying supply ship.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.816
Only one crew had ever
pulled this off before.
