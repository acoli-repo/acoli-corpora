In this show, I'm inviting myself in
to some truly unusual places,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.056
where they've mastered something
I wish everyone knew about work.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.936
Today: trust.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.296
And why the strongest bonds

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.759
are forged in the most
challenging situations.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.216

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.056
So, Paolo and his crewmate, Cady,
are flying on the space station,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.096
which is the size of a factory.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.976
They're trying to capture a ship
the size of a semitrailer

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.216
and the robotic arm they're using
is the size of a crane.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.400
They only have one chance
to grab the ship.
