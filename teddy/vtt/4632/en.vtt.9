00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.016
of sleeping under the stars for one night.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.776
AG: That's John Kanengieter.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.416
He's a wilderness training
and leadership expert.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.696
He's the guy NASA called

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.440
to prepare astronauts
for long-duration space flights.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.656
John takes people on expeditions
through rugged landscapes

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.296
to learn about group dynamics.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.496
JK: In fact, I'm leaving
for Antarctica in a couple of weeks

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.456
to help lead an expedition down there.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.456
AG: Your job is so much cooler than mine.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.880
JK: I don't know about that.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.216
AG: In an expedition,
the crew decides on a goal for each day,

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.280
like, reaching a summit before sundown.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.301
Then they come up
with a strategy and assign roles.
