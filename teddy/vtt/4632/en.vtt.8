When nurses wanted
a second opinion on a diagnosis,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.616
they often went to the colleagues
they felt most comfortable with

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.000
instead of the true experts.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.456
"How much do I like this person?"

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.176
is the wrong question
to ask about a teammate.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.440
The right question is,
"How much can I count on this person?"

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.480
If you're an astronaut,
that's a life-and-death question.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.816
So NASA has a way to build trust
in crews like Paolo's.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.096
They send them out into the wilderness.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.576
John Kanengieter:
Never ever underestimate the power

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.016
of sleeping under the stars for one night.
