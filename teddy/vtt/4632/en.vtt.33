00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.416
In the summer of 2016,
he was deeply disturbed

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.880
by the news of two police shootings
of unarmed black men.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.896
DT: I was upset.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.136
I'm raising, at the time, one child.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.816
He's a young black boy
and I know he's cute now,

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.776
but at some point in time
when he's a teenager

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.736
some people age him up
and make him an adult.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.976
And it's scary.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.096
AG: The unending string of injustices
felt like more than he could bear.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.616
So he posted about it on Facebook.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.616
DT: "The violence will continue
until there's a cultural change

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.496
in the perception of black people.
