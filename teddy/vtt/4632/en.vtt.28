That's wonderful,
but that kind of wears off.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.456
A deep fun of actual connection
to the experience

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.896
and giving ownership
over that experience to the whole group

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.776
ends up being more powerful
and contributing more to the bottom line.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.376
AG: Some teams try to build trust

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.256
through activities like going
through a maze blindfolded

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.216
or doing trust falls.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.576
But that's mostly friendly interaction
and fake vulnerability.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.920
You're all on good terms and you know
the other people will catch you.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.336
Deep fun involves real vulnerability.
