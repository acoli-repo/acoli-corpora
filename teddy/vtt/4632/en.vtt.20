00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.456
There was very little water,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.456
we had to chip
through the ice on mud puddles

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.336
to get drinking water.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.816
We had very few hours of daylight.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.736
And we had the cold to deal with.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.496
AG: That's my idea of a fun trip.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.456
JA: You know, I wouldn't recommend

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.576
that you go for 11 days
in the canyons on the first date.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.656
But you certainly wouldn't waste any time
with the partner that wasn't right

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.336
if you did that.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.176
You would know at the end of 11 days.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.016
AG: I feel like we need to call
Chris Harrison and tell him
