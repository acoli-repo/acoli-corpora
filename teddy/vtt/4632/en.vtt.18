00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.576
They fly off the handle
when colleagues are stubborn,

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.080
rude, selfish or judgmental.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.656
Others lose it when
their colleagues lack motivation.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.976
They can't stand working with someone
who procrastinates or shows up unprepared.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.191
And then there are people
who are most bothered by shallow thinking.

00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:16.271
Like when collaborators
do a shoddy analysis

00:09:16.295 --> 00:09:18.176
or pretend to know things they don't.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.456
There's evidence that people
who know each other's emotional triggers

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.256
have more trust and less conflict.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.976
They're able to avoid
pushing each other's buttons.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.096
Talk about what
your emotional triggers are.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.056
That's a step you can take
to build trust in your team.
