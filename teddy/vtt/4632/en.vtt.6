00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.416
We use this line all the time, you know.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.960
In space, we joke,
"Houston, we have no problem."

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.760
AG: This couldn't have happened
if they didn't build trust.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.680
How do you build trust in your workplace?

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.696
You do things that help people
like each other.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.680
Company parties and picnics,
softball games, team dinners.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.360
But liking your coworkers
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.696
Research suggests that
when people go to professional mixers,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.936
they don't really mix.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.816
They just end up hanging out
with their existing friends.
