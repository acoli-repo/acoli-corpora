You rarely have people in your life
that you trust in every situation.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.856
You might trust a friend
to decide on the restaurant for dinner,

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.160
but not to decide
what your next job should be.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.896
And you probably have colleagues
you trust to drive you in a car

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.560
but not to fly you in an airplane.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.256
In the wilderness,

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.296
it can take a little while
to figure out who to trust for what.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.376
JK: Adam, if you imagine
going on a trip with somebody

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.456
for about four or five days,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.576
chances are you can probably
put up with most of the stuff

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.736
that they might give you
over that period of time.
