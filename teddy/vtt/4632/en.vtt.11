(Laughter)

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.376
I tell you, the first feeling
that comes over you,

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.656
is sort of hanging your head and going,
"Oh, man, this is going to be a long day."

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.776
Because you're carrying a pack as well.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.136
There are times where
you just want to intercede

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.856
but you need to just bite your tongue

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.176
because when you do that,

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.000
you really rob someone
of a learning opportunity.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.216
AG: The learning opportunity
is to see everyone's skills in action.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.656
Because trust is situation-specific.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.000
You rarely have people in your life
that you trust in every situation.
