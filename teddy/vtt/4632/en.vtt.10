00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.301
Then they come up
with a strategy and assign roles.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.360
John's not leading the group,
he's just observing.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.256
Because usually,
the crews don't have experience

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.856
working together
for an extended period of time.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.216
John remembers one crew
that came to a critical decision.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.216
JK: Do we go right
or do we go left, basically.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.696
And they chose right.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.736
When looking at the map,
you knew they needed to go left.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.376
AG: And you just let that happen?

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.816
JK: You just let that happen.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.216
AG: Do you feel like a jerk?

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.456
JK: Yeah.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.136
(Laughter)
