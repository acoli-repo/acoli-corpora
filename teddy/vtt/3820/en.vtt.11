00:05:29.476 --> 00:05:32.147
with the sharp edges and the motion.

00:05:32.147 --> 00:05:34.817
There are many more examples,
but these are just two

00:05:34.817 --> 00:05:37.580
that you construct what you see.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.955
But neuroscientists go further.

00:05:41.395 --> 00:05:46.496
They say that we reconstruct reality.

00:05:46.496 --> 00:05:50.722
So, when I have an experience
that I describe as a red tomato,

00:05:50.722 --> 00:05:54.855
that experience is actually
an accurate reconstruction

00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:56.970
of the properties of a real red tomato

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.265
that would exist
even if I weren't looking.
