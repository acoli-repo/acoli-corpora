We'd better take them seriously.

00:13:37.276 --> 00:13:39.481
If you see a snake, don't pick it up.

00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:43.150
If you see a cliff, don't jump off.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.726
They're designed to keep us safe,
and we should take them seriously.

00:13:46.726 --> 00:13:49.417
That does not mean that we
should take them literally.

00:13:49.417 --> 00:13:51.671

00:13:54.876 --> 00:13:58.800
Physicists have told us for a long time
that the metal of that train looks solid

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.188
but really it's mostly empty space
with microscopic particles zipping around.
