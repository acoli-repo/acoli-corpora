00:14:27.754 --> 00:14:30.145
they're still in the user interface.

00:14:30.145 --> 00:14:33.907
So I'm saying something far more radical
than those physicists.

00:14:34.727 --> 00:14:36.200
Finally, you might object,

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.759
look, we all see the train,

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:41.801
therefore none of us constructs the train.

00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:43.891
But remember this example.

00:14:43.891 --> 00:14:46.607
In this example, we all see a cube,

00:14:47.597 --> 00:14:49.690
but the screen is flat,

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.427
so the cube that you see
is the cube that you construct.

00:14:53.736 --> 00:14:55.779
We all see a cube

00:14:55.779 --> 00:15:00.638
because we all, each one of us,
constructs the cube that we see.
