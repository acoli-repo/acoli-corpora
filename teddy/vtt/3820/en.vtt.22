00:10:59.906 --> 00:11:03.668
Those perceptions of reality go extinct.

00:11:03.668 --> 00:11:05.688
Now, this is a bit stunning.

00:11:05.688 --> 00:11:09.370
How can it be that not seeing
the world accurately

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.190
gives us a survival advantage?

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.303
That is a bit counterintuitive.

00:11:13.303 --> 00:11:15.138
But remember the jewel beetle.

00:11:15.138 --> 00:11:18.899
The jewel beetle survived
for thousands, perhaps millions of years,

00:11:18.899 --> 00:11:21.593
using simple tricks and hacks.

00:11:21.593 --> 00:11:24.770
What the equations
of evolution are telling us

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:30.413
is that all organisms, including us, 
are in the same boat as the jewel beetle.
