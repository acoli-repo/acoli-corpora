In 1868, Thomas Huxley wrote,

00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:37.892
"How it is that anything so remarkable
as a state of consciousness comes about

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:41.259
as the result of irritating nervous tissue

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:43.325
is just as unaccountable

00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:47.378
as the appearance of the genie
when Aladdin rubbed his lamp."

00:00:49.268 --> 00:00:51.545
Now, Huxley knew that brain activity

00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:54.819
and conscious experiences are correlated,

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:56.978
but he didn't know why.

00:00:56.978 --> 00:01:00.299
To the science of his day,
it was a mystery.
