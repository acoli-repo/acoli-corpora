00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:00.822
is just an icon of your desktop,

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:02.947
why don't you step in front of it?

00:13:02.947 --> 00:13:05.240
And after you're gone,
and your theory with you,

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.554
we'll know that there's more
to that train than just an icon.

00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:10.597
Well, I wouldn't step
in front of that train

00:13:10.597 --> 00:13:12.153
for the same reason

00:13:12.153 --> 00:13:16.448
that I wouldn't carelessly drag
that icon to the trash can:

00:13:16.448 --> 00:13:19.629
not because I take the icon literally --

00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:22.634
the file is not literally blue
or rectangular --

00:13:22.934 --> 00:13:25.260
but I do take it seriously.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.291
I could lose weeks of work.

00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:29.845
Similarly, evolution has shaped us

00:13:29.845 --> 00:13:34.281
with perceptual symbols
that are designed to keep us alive.
