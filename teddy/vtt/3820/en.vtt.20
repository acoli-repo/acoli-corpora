00:09:58.236 --> 00:10:01.789
Fitness is not the same thing
as reality as it is,

00:10:01.789 --> 00:10:05.272
and it's fitness,
and not reality as it is,

00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:09.451
that figures centrally
in the equations of evolution.

00:10:09.451 --> 00:10:12.642
So, in my lab,

00:10:12.642 --> 00:10:16.417
we have run hundreds of thousands
of evolutionary game simulations

00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:19.482
with lots of different
randomly chosen worlds

00:10:19.482 --> 00:10:23.661
and organisms that compete
for resources in those worlds.

00:10:23.661 --> 00:10:27.980
Some of the organisms
see all of the reality,

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.869
others see just part of the reality,

00:10:29.869 --> 00:10:31.974
and some see none of the reality,
