00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.617
must be your construction.

00:05:03.397 --> 00:05:05.310
In this next example,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.534
you see glowing blue bars
with pretty sharp edges

00:05:09.534 --> 00:05:12.718
moving across a field of dots.

00:05:13.708 --> 00:05:16.845
In fact, no dots move.

00:05:16.845 --> 00:05:21.466
All I'm doing from frame to frame
is changing the colors of dots

00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:23.927
from blue to black or black to blue.

00:05:23.927 --> 00:05:25.761
But when I do this quickly,

00:05:25.761 --> 00:05:29.476
your visual system creates
the glowing blue bars

00:05:29.476 --> 00:05:32.147
with the sharp edges and the motion.
