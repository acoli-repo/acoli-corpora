00:02:00.606 --> 00:02:03.849
As a result, I come to believe
that in reality,

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:06.491
there's a red tomato a meter away.

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:11.615
I then close my eyes, and my experience
changes to a gray field,

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:17.591
but is it still the case that in reality,
there's a red tomato a meter away?

00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:21.913
I think so, but could I be wrong?

00:02:21.913 --> 00:02:26.511
Could I be misinterpreting
the nature of my perceptions?

00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:30.551
We have misinterpreted
our perceptions before.
