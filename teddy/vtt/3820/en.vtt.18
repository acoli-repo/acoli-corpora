00:08:55.336 --> 00:09:01.327
Does natural selection really favor
seeing reality as it is?

00:09:01.877 --> 00:09:05.413
Fortunately, we don't have
to wave our hands and guess;

00:09:05.413 --> 00:09:08.594
evolution is a mathematically
precise theory.

00:09:08.594 --> 00:09:12.147
We can use the equations of evolution
to check this out.

00:09:12.147 --> 00:09:16.300
We can have various organisms
in artificial worlds compete

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.253
and see which survive and which thrive,

00:09:18.253 --> 00:09:21.806
which sensory systems are more fit.

00:09:21.806 --> 00:09:25.891
A key notion in those
equations is fitness.

00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:28.586
Consider this steak:

00:09:29.956 --> 00:09:32.918
What does this steak do
for the fitness of an animal?
