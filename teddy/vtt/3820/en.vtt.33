But we have an advantage
over the jewel beetle:

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:32.544
our science and technology.

00:16:32.544 --> 00:16:34.935
By peering through the lens of a telescope

00:16:34.935 --> 00:16:39.571
we discovered that the Earth
is not the unmoving center of reality,

00:16:39.571 --> 00:16:42.449
and by peering through the lens
of the theory of evolution

00:16:42.449 --> 00:16:44.771
we discovered that spacetime and objects

00:16:44.771 --> 00:16:47.139
are not the nature of reality.

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:51.424
When I have a perceptual experience
that I describe as a red tomato,

00:16:51.424 --> 00:16:54.361
I am interacting with reality,

00:16:54.361 --> 00:16:59.571
but that reality is not a red tomato
and is nothing like a red tomato.

00:16:59.571 --> 00:17:04.972
Similarly, when I have an experience
that I describe as a lion or a steak,
