So the idea is that evolution
has given us an interface

00:12:37.128 --> 00:12:41.443
that hides reality and guides
adaptive behavior.

00:12:41.443 --> 00:12:44.461

perceive them right now,

00:12:44.461 --> 00:12:46.635
are your desktop.

00:12:46.635 --> 00:12:51.372
Physical objects are simply icons
in that desktop.

coming down the track at 200 MPH

00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:00.822
is just an icon of your desktop,
