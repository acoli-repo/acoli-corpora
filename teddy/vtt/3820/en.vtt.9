00:04:27.226 --> 00:04:30.407
We don't construct
the whole world at once.

00:04:30.407 --> 00:04:33.172
We construct what we need in the moment.

00:04:33.542 --> 00:04:36.909
Now, there are many demonstrations
that are quite compelling

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.720
that we construct what we see.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.763
I'll just show you two.

00:04:40.763 --> 00:04:46.529
In this example, you see some red discs
with bits cut out of them,

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.470
but if I just rotate
the disks a little bit,

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.207
suddenly, you see a 3D cube
pop out of the screen.

00:04:54.207 --> 00:04:57.040
Now, the screen of course is flat,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.640
so the three-dimensional cube
that you're experiencing

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.617
must be your construction.
