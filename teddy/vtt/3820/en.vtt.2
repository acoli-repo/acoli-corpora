00:00:56.978 --> 00:01:00.299
To the science of his day,
it was a mystery.

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:02.435
In the years since Huxley,

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:05.801
science has learned a lot
about brain activity,

00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:07.822
but the relationship
between brain activity

00:01:07.822 --> 00:01:10.910
and conscious experiences
is still a mystery.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.555
Why? Why have we made so little progress?

00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:19.414
Well, some experts think
that we can't solve this problem

00:01:19.414 --> 00:01:23.213
because we lack the necessary
concepts and intelligence.

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:27.952
We don't expect monkeys to solve
problems in quantum mechanics,

00:01:27.952 --> 00:01:32.117
and as it happens, we can't expect
our species to solve this problem either.
