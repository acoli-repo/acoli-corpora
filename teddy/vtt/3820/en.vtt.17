the bigger the better.

00:08:32.535 --> 00:08:37.375
Even when crawling all over the bottle,
the male couldn't discover his mistake.

00:08:37.945 --> 00:08:41.590
Now, you might say, beetles, sure,
they're very simple creatures,

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.448
but surely not mammals.

00:08:43.448 --> 00:08:46.165
Mammals don't rely on tricks.

00:08:46.165 --> 00:08:52.178
Well, I won't dwell on this,
but you get the idea. (Laughter)

00:08:52.178 --> 00:08:55.336
So this raises an important
technical question:

00:08:55.336 --> 00:09:01.327
Does natural selection really favor
seeing reality as it is?
