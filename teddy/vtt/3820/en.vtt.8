00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.219
so the eye is like a 130-megapixel camera.

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:05.702
But that doesn't explain
the billions of neurons

00:04:05.702 --> 00:04:09.324
and trillions of synapses
that are engaged in vision.

00:04:09.324 --> 00:04:11.623
What are these neurons up to?

00:04:11.623 --> 00:04:15.830
Well, neuroscientists tell us
that they are creating, in real time,

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.160
all the shapes, objects, colors,
and motions that we see.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.651
It feels like we're just taking a snapshot
of this room the way it is,

00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:27.226
but in fact, we're constructing
everything that we see.

00:04:27.226 --> 00:04:30.407
We don't construct
the whole world at once.
