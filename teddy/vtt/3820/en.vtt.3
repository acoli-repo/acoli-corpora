00:01:27.952 --> 00:01:32.117
and as it happens, we can't expect
our species to solve this problem either.

00:01:32.527 --> 00:01:35.661
Well, I disagree. I'm more optimistic.

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:38.703
I think we've simply
made a false assumption.

00:01:38.703 --> 00:01:42.209
Once we fix it, we just
might solve this problem.

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:44.626
Today, I'd like tell you
what that assumption is,

00:01:44.626 --> 00:01:47.384
why it's false, and how to fix it.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:49.568
Let's begin with a question:

00:01:49.778 --> 00:01:52.866
Do we see reality as it is?

00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:54.561
I open my eyes

00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:59.498
and I have an experience that I describe
as a red tomato a meter away.
