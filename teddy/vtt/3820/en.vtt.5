00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:30.551
We have misinterpreted
our perceptions before.

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:34.010
We used to think the Earth is flat,
because it looks that way.

00:02:34.707 --> 00:02:37.586
Pythagorus discovered that we were wrong.

00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:41.598
Then we thought that the Earth
is the unmoving center of the Universe,

00:02:41.603 --> 00:02:43.506
again because it looks that way.

00:02:44.406 --> 00:02:49.312
Copernicus and Galileo discovered,
again, that we were wrong.

00:02:49.312 --> 00:02:53.400
Galileo then wondered if we might
be misinterpreting our experiences

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.908
in other ways.

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:59.917
He wrote: "I think that tastes,
odors, colors, and so on

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:01.921
reside in consciousness.
