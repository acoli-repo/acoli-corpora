When you simply open your eyes
and look about this room,

00:03:31.292 --> 00:03:35.564
billions of neurons
and trillions of synapses are engaged.

00:03:35.564 --> 00:03:37.172
Now, this is a bit surprising,

00:03:37.172 --> 00:03:39.813
because to the extent that
we think about vision at all,

00:03:39.813 --> 00:03:42.650
we think of it as like a camera.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.590
It just takes a picture
of objective reality as it is.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.290
Now, there is a part of vision
that's like a camera:

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.929
the eye has a lens that focuses
an image on the back of the eye

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:58.319
where there are 130 million
photoreceptors,

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.219
so the eye is like a 130-megapixel camera.
