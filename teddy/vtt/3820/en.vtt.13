00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:31.680
our perceptions are accurate.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.375
You see this in the standard textbooks.

00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:37.369
One textbook says, for example,

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:39.340
"Evolutionarily speaking,

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.383
vision is useful precisely
because it is so accurate."

00:06:43.383 --> 00:06:48.181
So the idea is that accurate perceptions
are fitter perceptions.

00:06:48.181 --> 00:06:50.325
They give you a survival advantage.

00:06:50.325 --> 00:06:52.240
Now, is this correct?

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.899
Is this the right interpretation
of evolutionary theory?

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:58.280
Well, let's first look at a couple
of examples in nature.
