00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.238
The Australian jewel beetle

00:07:01.238 --> 00:07:04.349
is dimpled, glossy and brown.

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:06.694
The female is flightless.

00:07:06.694 --> 00:07:10.711
The male flies, looking,
of course, for a hot female.

00:07:10.711 --> 00:07:14.659
When he finds one, he alights and mates.

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:17.130
There's another species in the outback,

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.464
Homo sapiens.

00:07:18.464 --> 00:07:21.531
The male of this species
has a massive brain

00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:25.479
that he uses to hunt for cold beer.

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:27.168
(Laughter)

00:07:27.168 --> 00:07:29.542
And when he finds one, he drains it,

00:07:29.542 --> 00:07:32.932
and sometimes throws the bottle
into the outback.
