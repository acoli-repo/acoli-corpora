00:11:55.792 --> 00:12:01.643
to the peoples who are getting
the impact of climate change?

00:12:01.667 --> 00:12:04.393
And now it's not only
the developing countries.

00:12:04.417 --> 00:12:06.101
It's the developed countries also.

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:09.934
We saw the hurricane.
We saw the flood around all the places.

00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:13.351
We saw the fire, even here in California.

00:12:13.375 --> 00:12:15.893
So we need all this knowledge
to come together.

00:12:15.917 --> 00:12:18.226
We need the people in the center.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.768
And we need the decision makers to change,

00:12:20.792 --> 00:12:22.208
scientists tell them,

00:12:23.417 --> 00:12:25.268
and we tell them,

00:12:25.292 --> 00:12:27.809
and we do have this knowledge.

00:12:27.833 --> 00:12:31.083
We have 10 years to change it.
