00:01:55.875 --> 00:02:00.143
It's our pharmacy where we can
collect our medicinal plants.

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:01.643
But it's our school,

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:05.476
where we can learn better
how to protect it

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.542
and how it can give us back what we need.

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:12.375
But with the climate change impact,

00:02:13.542 --> 00:02:17.958
we are experiencing a different impact.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.500
In my community,

00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:28.434
we have one of the top five
fresh waters in Africa.

00:02:28.458 --> 00:02:30.333
It's Lake Chad.
