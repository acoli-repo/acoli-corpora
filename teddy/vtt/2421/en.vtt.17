00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:32.768
So that's how I started working

00:08:32.792 --> 00:08:37.726
with meteorological scientists
and my communities

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:42.458
to give better information
to get peoples adapted to climate change.

00:08:45.042 --> 00:08:51.268
I think, if we put together
all the knowledge systems that we have --

00:08:51.292 --> 00:08:54.101
science, technology,

00:08:54.125 --> 00:08:56.018
traditional knowledge --

00:08:56.042 --> 00:09:01.184
we can give the best of us
to protect our peoples,
