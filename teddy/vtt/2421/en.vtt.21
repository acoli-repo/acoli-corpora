00:10:28.625 --> 00:10:30.226
Here's where I collect --"

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.684
So we changed the knowledge in the map,

00:10:32.708 --> 00:10:34.375
and we called the men.

00:10:35.208 --> 00:10:37.393
Well, they think about what women said.

00:10:37.417 --> 00:10:39.018
All of them shaking their heads.

00:10:39.042 --> 00:10:41.393
"They are right. They are right.

00:10:41.417 --> 00:10:42.809
They are right."

00:10:42.833 --> 00:10:46.434
So that's how we build
the capacity of the women

00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:47.893
in giving them a voice

00:10:47.917 --> 00:10:50.059
in this 3D participatory mapping,

00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:52.268
so women get the detailed knowledge

00:10:52.292 --> 00:10:55.059
that can help the community to adapt.

00:10:55.083 --> 00:10:58.101
And man have the bigger picture knowledge.

00:10:58.125 --> 00:11:00.684
So when we put it together,
