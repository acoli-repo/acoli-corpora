It's Lake Chad.

00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:33.768
When my mother was born,

00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:40.768
Lake Chad used to be
about 25,000 kilometers square of water.

00:02:40.792 --> 00:02:47.018
When I was born, 30 years ago,
it was 10,000 kilometers square.

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:49.601
And actually now,

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:54.518
it's about 1,200 kilometers
square of water.

00:02:54.542 --> 00:02:59.625
Ninety percent of this water
just evaporated, disappeared.
