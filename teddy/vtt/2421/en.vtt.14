00:06:57.208 --> 00:07:02.101
So one day, I took a scientist
to my community.

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:07.500
I said, you are giving the good weather
information through the TV and radio,

00:07:08.875 --> 00:07:11.393
but how about coming to my people?

00:07:11.417 --> 00:07:12.667
And then they come,

00:07:14.042 --> 00:07:15.559
they sit around,

00:07:15.583 --> 00:07:20.351
and suddenly, as we are nomadic,
we just start packing our stuff,

00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:22.601
and then they say, like, "Are we moving?"

00:07:22.625 --> 00:07:25.934
I'm like, "No, we are not moving.
It's going to rain."

00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:29.643
And they're like, "Oh, there's no cloud.
How do you know it's going to rain?"

00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:33.059
We're like, "Yeah, it's going to rain."
We pack our stuff.
