00:01:27.458 --> 00:01:30.268
We move from one place to another one

00:01:30.292 --> 00:01:32.434
to find water and pasture.

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:38.500
We can move up to a thousand kilometers,
the size of California, within one year.

00:01:39.792 --> 00:01:45.542
And this life helps us to live
in harmony with our ecosystem.

00:01:46.583 --> 00:01:48.250
We understand each other.

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:52.643
For us, the nature is our supermarket,

00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:54.559
where we can collect our food,

00:01:54.583 --> 00:01:55.851
our water.

00:01:55.875 --> 00:02:00.143
It's our pharmacy where we can
collect our medicinal plants.
