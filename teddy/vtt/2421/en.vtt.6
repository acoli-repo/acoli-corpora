00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:04.101
And you have more than 40 million people

00:03:04.125 --> 00:03:08.184
living around this lake
and depending on it.

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:09.601
They are pastoralists.

00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:11.309
They are fishermen.

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:13.643
And they are farmers.

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:17.184
They do not depend on
the end of the month's salary.

00:03:17.208 --> 00:03:19.434
They depend on the rainfall.

00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:22.184
They depend on the crops that are growing

00:03:22.208 --> 00:03:25.000
or the pasture for their cattle.

00:03:26.583 --> 00:03:28.934
The shrinking resources,

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:34.351
you have many communities
that are fighting to get access.
