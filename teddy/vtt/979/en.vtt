In Oxford in the 1950s,

00:00:02.286 --> 00:00:06.054
there was a fantastic doctor, who was very unusual,

00:00:06.054 --> 00:00:08.086
named Alice Stewart.

00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:11.229
And Alice was unusual partly because, of course,

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:14.709
she was a woman, which was pretty rare in the 1950s.

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.820
And she was brilliant, she was one of the,

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.636
at the time, the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians.

00:00:21.636 --> 00:00:25.393
She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married,

00:00:25.393 --> 00:00:27.488
after she had kids,

00:00:27.488 --> 00:00:30.496
and even after she got divorced and was a single parent,
