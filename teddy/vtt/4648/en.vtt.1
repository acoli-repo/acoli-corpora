00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:30.526
But an ancient Irish myth 
has a different accounting.

00:00:30.526 --> 00:00:32.158
According to legend,

00:00:32.158 --> 00:00:36.401
the giant Finn MacCool lived happily 
on the North Antrim coast

00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:38.279
with his wife Oonagh.

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:41.008
Their only disturbance came from
the taunts and threats

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:43.338
of the giant Benandonner,

00:00:43.338 --> 00:00:47.870
or the red man, 
who lived across the sea in Scotland.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.078
The two roared insults 
and hurled rocks at each other

00:00:51.078 --> 00:00:54.077
in dramatic shows of strength.

00:00:54.077 --> 00:00:58.601
Once, Finn tore up a great clump of land 
and heaved it at his rival,

00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:01.223
but it fell short of reaching land.
