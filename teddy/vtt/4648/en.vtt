On the coast of Northern Ireland,

00:00:08.624 --> 00:00:12.121
a vast plateau of basalt slabs
and columns

00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:14.162
called the Giant’s Causeway

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:16.042
stretches into the ocean.

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:18.042
The scientific explanation for this

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:22.397
is that it’s the result of
molten lava contracting and fracturing

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:25.775
as it cooled in the wake 
of a volcanic eruption.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:30.526
But an ancient Irish myth 
has a different accounting.
