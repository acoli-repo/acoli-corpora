00:01:59.663 --> 00:02:02.180
And so Oonagh hatched a cunning plan -

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.583
they needed to create an illusion of size,

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:09.850
to suggest Finn was a mountain 
of a man whilst keeping him out of sight.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.533
As Benandonner neared 
the end of the bridge,

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:15.785
Oonagh stuffed her husband 
in a huge cradle.

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:18.602
Disguised as an enormous baby,

00:02:18.602 --> 00:02:22.405
Finn lay quiet as Benandonnner 
pounded on the door.

00:02:22.405 --> 00:02:25.053
The house shook as he stepped inside.

00:02:25.053 --> 00:02:29.106
Oonagh told the enraged visitor 
that her husband wasn’t home,

00:02:29.106 --> 00:02:32.897
but welcomed him to sit
and eat while he waited.
