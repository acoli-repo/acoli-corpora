00:02:58.838 --> 00:03:02.704
So hefty was the infant swaddled 
under piles of blankets,

00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:07.170
Benandonner shuddered at the thought 
of what the father would look like.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.681
He decided he’d rather not find out.

00:03:09.681 --> 00:03:13.947
As he fled, Benandonner tore up the rocks 
connecting the shores,

00:03:13.947 --> 00:03:15.984
breaking up the causeway.

00:03:15.984 --> 00:03:19.436
What remains are two identical 
rock formations:

00:03:19.436 --> 00:03:22.305
one on the North Antrim coast of Ireland

00:03:22.305 --> 00:03:26.663
and one at Fingal’s Cave in Scotland, 
right across the sea.
