Pasture is the single
largest type of land

00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:06.796
on the surface of the Earth today,

00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:10.116
thanks to our taste for meat and dairy.

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:14.636
Just over a quarter of all land
is used for livestock.

00:00:15.436 --> 00:00:19.356
That's more than forests
or farm fields or anything else.

00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:23.196
Most of that land is best for ruminants,

00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:24.756
such as cows,

00:00:24.756 --> 00:00:29.556
that can digest high-fiber feed
such as grass and straw.
