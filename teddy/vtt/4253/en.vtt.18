00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So my co-author, Roo Rogers, and I

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
have actually gathered thousands of examples

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
from all around the world of collaborative consumption.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And although they vary enormously

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
in scale, maturity and purpose,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
when we dived into them,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
The first is redistribution markets.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Redistribution markets, just like Swaptree,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
are when you take a used, or pre-owned, item

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and move it from where it's not needed

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
to somewhere, or someone, where it is.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' --

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
reduce, reuse, recycle, repair
