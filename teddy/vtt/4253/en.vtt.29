00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
But now with the Web, we leave a trail.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
With every spammer we flag,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
with every idea we post, comment we share,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
we're actually signaling how well we collaborate,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and whether we can or can't be trusted.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Let's go back to my first example,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Swaptree.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
I can see that Rondoron

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
has completed 553 trades

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
with a 100 percent success rate.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
In other words, I can trust him or her.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Now mark my words,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
it's only a matter of time
