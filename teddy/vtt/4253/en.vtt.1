00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
have books, CDs, DVDs, or videos

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
lying around your house

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that you probably won't use again,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Can't see all the hands,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but it looks like all of you, right?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
On our shelves at home,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we have a box set of the DVD series "24,"

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
season six to be precise.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now my husband, Chris, and I

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
love this show.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
you don't really want to watch it again,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists.
