00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
our relationship to satisfying what we want

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
is far less tangible

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
than any other previous generation.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
I don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I don't want a clunky answering machine;

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I want the message it saves.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I don't want a CD; I want the music it plays.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
In other words, I don't want stuff;

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I want the needs or experiences it fulfills.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
This is fueling a massive shift

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
from where usage trumps possessions --

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
or as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
"where access is better than ownership."
