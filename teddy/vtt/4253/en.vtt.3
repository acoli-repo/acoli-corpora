00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
for a wanted copy of "Sex and the City?"

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now you may have noticed

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
there's a new sector emerging called swap-trading.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Now the easiest analogy for swap-trading

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
is like an online dating service

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
for all your unwanted media.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
What it does is use the Internet

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
to create an infinite marketplace

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
to match person A's "haves"

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
with person C's "wants,"

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
whatever they may be.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The other week, I went on one of these sites,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
appropriately called Swaptree,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and there were over 59,300 items

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that I could instantly swap
