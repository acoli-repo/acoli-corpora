00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and we're born and bred to share and cooperate.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And we were doing so for thousands of years,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
whether it's when we hunted in packs,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
or farmed in cooperatives,

is the digital natives, or Gen-Y.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
They're growing up sharing --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
files, video games, knowledge.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
It's second nature to them.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So we, the millennials -- I am just a millennial --
