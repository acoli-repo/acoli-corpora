00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
to a knitter

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
can make a living selling peer-to-peer.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And the ubiquitous force

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
of this peer-to-peer revolution

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I mean, it's amazing to think

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000

Now what I find fascinating about these examples

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
is how they're actually tapping into

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
our primate instincts.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I mean, we're monkeys,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and we're born and bred to share and cooperate.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And we were doing so for thousands of years,
