00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and there were over 59,300 items

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that I could instantly swap

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000

a problem the economists call "the coincidence of wants,"

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
in approximately 60 seconds.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
