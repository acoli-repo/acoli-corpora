00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Now mark my words,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
it's only a matter of time

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
before we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
and see a cumulative picture

I believe we're actually in a period

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
where we're waking up

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
from this humongous hangover

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
of emptiness and waste,
