WEBVTT

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
is enabling

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
trust between strangers.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
We now live in a global village

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
where we can mimic the ties

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
that used to happen face to face,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
but on a scale and in ways

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that have never been possible before.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So what's actually happening

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
is that social networks and real-time technologies

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
are taking us back.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
We're bartering, trading,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
swapping, sharing,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
but they're being reinvented

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
into dynamic and appealing forms.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
What I find fascinating

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
is that we've actually wired our world to share,
