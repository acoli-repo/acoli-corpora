00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and said, "I'm going to write about collaborative consumption,"

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
but actually it was a complicated web

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
of seemingly disconnected ideas.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Over the next minute,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
of all the dots that went on in my head.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
how many big concepts were emerging --

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
from the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs --

around how ridiculously easy it is

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
to form groups for a purpose.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And linked to this crowd mania

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
were examples all around the world --

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
from the election of a president

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
to the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between --
