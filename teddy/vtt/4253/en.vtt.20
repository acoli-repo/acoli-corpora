00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
is called Landshare.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
It's a scheme in the U.K.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that matches Mr. Jones,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
with some spare space in his back garden,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
with Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Together they grow their own food.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
It's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Now, the third system

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
is product-service systems.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
This is where you pay for the benefit of the product --

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
what it does for you --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
without needing to own the product outright.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
This idea is particularly powerful
