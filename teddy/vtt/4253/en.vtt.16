00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
One, a renewed belief in the importance of community,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
A torrent of peer-to-peer social networks

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and real-time technologies,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
fundamentally changing the way we behave.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Three, pressing unresolved environmental concerns.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And four, a global recession

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000

consumer behaviors.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
These four drivers

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
are fusing together

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and creating the big shift --

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
away from the 20th century,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
defined by hyper-consumption,
