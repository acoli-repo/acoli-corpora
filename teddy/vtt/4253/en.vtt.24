and got them to surrender their keys for a month.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Instead, these people had to walk,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000

just from the extra exercise.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
out of the 250 participants

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
did not want their keys back.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
