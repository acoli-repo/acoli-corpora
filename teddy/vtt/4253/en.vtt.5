What's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
because it knows the way of the item.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Now there are layers of technical wonder

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
behind sites such as Swaptree,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but that's not my interest,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and nor is swap trading, per se.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
My passion, and what I've spent the last few years

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
dedicated to researching,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
is the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
inherent in these systems.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
When you think about it,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
it would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that I would swap my stuff with a total stranger
