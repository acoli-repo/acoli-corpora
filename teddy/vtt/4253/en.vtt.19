They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' --

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
reduce, reuse, recycle, repair

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and redistribute --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
because they stretch the life cycle of a product

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and thereby reduce waste.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
The second is collaborative lifestyles.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
This is the sharing of resources

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
of things like money, skills and time.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I bet, in a couple of years,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
that phrases like "coworking"

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and "couchsurfing" and "time banks"

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
are going to become a part of everyday vernacular.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
is called Landshare.
