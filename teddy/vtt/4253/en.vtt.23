00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
costs 8,000 dollars a year to run.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Yet, that car sits idle

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
for 23 hours a day.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
So when you consider these two facts,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
it starts to make a little less sense

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
that we have to own one outright.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
So this is where car-sharing companies

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
such as Zipcar and GoGet come in.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
In 2009,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Zipcar took 250 participants

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
from across 13 cities --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and they're all self-confessed car addicts

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and car-sharing rookies --

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and got them to surrender their keys for a month.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Instead, these people had to walk,
