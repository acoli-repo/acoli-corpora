00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
What I find fascinating

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
is that we've actually wired our world to share,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
whether that's our neighborhood, our school,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
our office, or our Facebook network,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and that's creating an economy

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
of "what's mine is yours."

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
From the mighty eBay,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
the grandfather of exchange marketplaces,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
to car-sharing companies such as GoGet,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
to social lending platforms such as Zopa,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that will take anyone in this audience

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
with 100 dollars to lend,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world,
