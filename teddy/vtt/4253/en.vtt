00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So today I'm going to talk to you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about the rise of collaborative consumption.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm going to explain what it is

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and try and convince you -- in just 15 minutes --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that this isn't a flimsy idea,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
or a short-term trend,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but a powerful cultural and economic force

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
reinventing not just what we consume,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but how we consume.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now I'm going to start with a deceptively simple example.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Hands up -- how many of you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
have books, CDs, DVDs, or videos

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
lying around your house
