00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
or as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
"where access is better than ownership."

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Now as our possessions

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
dematerialize into the cloud,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
This represents an eight-year time span.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
We've gone from traditional car-ownership

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
to car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
to ride-sharing platforms that match rides

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
to the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental,
