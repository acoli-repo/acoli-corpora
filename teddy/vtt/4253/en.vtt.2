00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
you don't really want to watch it again,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So there it sits on our shelves

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
obsolete to us,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but with immediate latent value to someone else.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now before we go on, I have a confession to make.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I lived in New York for 10 years,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and I am a big fan of "Sex and the City."

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Now I'd love to watch the first movie again

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
as sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So how easily could I swap

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
our unwanted copy of "24"

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
for a wanted copy of "Sex and the City?"

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now you may have noticed
