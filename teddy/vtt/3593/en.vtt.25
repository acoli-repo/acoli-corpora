00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.440
tremendous sources of marine life death.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.496
We also could look at not a fish at all.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.936
We could look at a vegetable.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.696
We could look at seaweed, the kelps,

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.056
all these different varieties of things
that can be high in omega-3s,

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.376
can be high in proteins,

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.016
tremendously good things.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.696
They filter the water
just like mussels do.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.976
And weirdly enough,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.616
it turns out that you
can actually feed this to cows.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.856
Now, I'm not a big fan of cattle.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.816
But if you wanted to keep growing cattle

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.656
in a time and place
where water resources are limited,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.776
you're growing seaweed in the water,
you don't have to water it --
