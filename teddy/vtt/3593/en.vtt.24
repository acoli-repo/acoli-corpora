00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.576
they actually get their omega-3s
by filtering the water of microalgae.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.816
In fact, that's where omega-3s come from,
they don't come from fish.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.896
Microalgae make the omega-3s,
they're only bioconcentrated in fish.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.176
Mussels and other bivalves

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.200
do tremendous amounts of water filtration.

00:12:11.224 --> 00:12:14.776
A single mussel can filter
dozens of gallons every single day.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.576
And this is incredibly important
when we look at the world.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.176
Right now, nitrification,
overuse of phosphates in our waterways

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.536
are causing tremendous algal blooms.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.816
Over 400 new dead zones
have been created in the last 20 years,

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.440
tremendous sources of marine life death.
