Shrimp in the wild --
as a wild product --

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.416
is a terrible product.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.896
5, 10, 15 pounds of wild fish
are regularly killed

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.336
to bring one pound of shrimp
to the market.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.456
They're also incredibly fuel inefficient
to bring to the market.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.576
In a recent study that was produced
out of Dalhousie University,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.416
it was found that dragging for shrimp

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.280
is one of the most carbon-intensive
ways of fishing that you can find.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.296
So you can farm them,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.576
and people do farm them,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.616
and they farm them a lot
in this very area.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.856
Problem is ...

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.096
the place where you farm shrimp
is in these wild habitats --
