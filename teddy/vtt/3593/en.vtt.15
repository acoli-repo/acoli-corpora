00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.576
The industry has, to its credit,
greatly improved.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.267
They've gotten it below two to one,

00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:34.576
although it's a little bit of a cheat

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.416
because if you look at the way
aquaculture feed is produced,

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.896
they're measuring pellets --

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.176
pounds of pellets per pound of salmon.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.856
Those pellets are in turn reduced fish.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.376
So the actual -- what's called the FIFO,
the fish in and the fish out --

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.736
kind of hard to say.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.976
But in any case,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.216
credit to the industry,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.816
it has lowered the amount of fish
per pound of salmon.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.016
Problem is we've also gone crazy

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.256
with the amount of salmon
that we're producing.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.896
Aquaculture is the fastest growing
food system on the planet.
