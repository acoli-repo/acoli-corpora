00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.096
you'll see raccoons,
you'll see, you know, wolves,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.176
you'll see all kinds
of different creatures.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.856
But if you telescope to the age of --
you know, 2,000 years ago,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.776
you'll see these four mammals:

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.216
pigs, cows, sheep and goats.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.456
It's true of birds, too.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.296
You look at the menus
in New York City restaurants

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.216
150 years ago, 200 years ago,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.976
you'll see snipe, woodcock, grouse,
dozens of ducks, dozens of geese.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.936
But telescope ahead to the age
of modern animal husbandry,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.336
and you'll see four:

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.400
turkeys, ducks, chicken and geese.
