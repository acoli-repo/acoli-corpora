Ray wanted the sandwich
to come in at 25 cents,

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.576
so he turned to Atlantic cod.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.376
We all know what happened to
Atlantic cod in New England.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.896
So now the Filet-O-Fish sandwich
is made out of Alaska pollock,

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.656
it's the largest fin fish fishery
in the United States,

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.056
2 to 3 billion pounds of fish
taken out of the sea every single year.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.616
If we go through the pollock,

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.096
the next choice is probably
going to be tilapia.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.096
Tilapia is one of those fish
nobody ever heard of 20 years ago.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.376
It's actually a very efficient converter
of plant protein into animal protein,

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.456
and it's been a godsend
to the third world.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.856
It's actually a tremendously
sustainable solution,
