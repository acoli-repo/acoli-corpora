00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.096
the place where you farm shrimp
is in these wild habitats --

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.336
in mangrove forests.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.416
Now look at those lovely
roots coming down.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.536
Those are the things
that hold soil together,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.336
protect coasts, create habitats
for all sorts of young fish, young shrimp,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.137
all sorts of things
that are important to this environment.

00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:17.161
Well, this is what happens
to a lot of coastal mangrove forests.

00:04:17.185 --> 00:04:19.495
We've lost millions of acres
of coastal mangroves

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.935
over the last 30 or 40 years.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.416
That rate of destruction has slowed,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.040
but we're still
in a major mangrove deficit.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.496
The other thing that's going on here

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.080
is a phenomenon that the filmmaker
Mark Benjamin called "Grinding Nemo."
