00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.776
starting to exceed the amount
of wild fish that we produce.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.816
So that if you add wild fish
and farmed fish together,

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.296
you get the equivalent
of two Chinas created from the ocean

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.576
each and every year.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.736
And again, it's not a coincidence
that I use China as the example,

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.816
because China, in addition
to being the biggest catcher of fish,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.920
is also the biggest farmer of fish.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.376
So let's look though at the four choices
we are making right now.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.616
The first one --

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.336
by far the most consumed seafood
in America and in much of the West,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.576
is shrimp.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.056
Shrimp in the wild --
as a wild product --
