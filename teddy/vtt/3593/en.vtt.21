It's actually a tremendously
sustainable solution,

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.096
it goes from an egg
to an adult in nine months.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.456
The problem is that when you
look about the West,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.496
it doesn't do what the West
wants it to do.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.256
It really doesn't have what's called
an oily fish profile.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.656
It doesn't have the EPA and DHA omega-3s

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.976
that we all think are going
to make us live forever.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.496
So what do we do?

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.696
I mean, first of all,
what about this poor fish, the clupeids?

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.160
The fish that represent a huge part
of that 20 to 30 million metric tons.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.816
Well, one possibility
that a lot of conservationists have raised

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.456
is could we eat them?
