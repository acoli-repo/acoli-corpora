00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.256
get ground up and fed to fish.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.496
So I often wonder,

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.760
is there a fish that ate
a chicken that ate a fish?

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.376
It's sort of a reworking
of the chicken and egg thing. Anyway --

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.496
(Laughter)

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.296
All together, though,
it results in a terrible mess.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.696
What you're talking about

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:51.376
is something between 20 and 30 million
metric tons of wild creatures

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.376
that are taken from the ocean
and used and ground up.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.456
That's the equivalent
of a third of a China,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.536
or of an entire United States of humans

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.960
that's taken out of the sea
each and every year.
