It was like literally having
your roster devastated.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.416
And as I sort of looked into that,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.816
from a very personal
point of view as a fisherman,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.416
I started to kind of figure out,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.016
well, what was the rest of the world
thinking about it?

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.256
First place I started to look
was fish markets.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.056
And when I went to fish markets,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.336
in spite of where I was --

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.416
whether I was in North Carolina,
or Paris, or London, or wherever --

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.616
I kept seeing this weirdly
repeating trope of four creatures,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.856
again and again --

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.456
on the menus, on ice --

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.336
shrimp, tuna, salmon and cod.
