00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.016
"You know, you oughtn't be so hard
on your Connecticut,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.856
cause we here in North Carolina,
we got 35,000 dams."

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.736
So it's a national epidemic,
it's an international epidemic.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.216
And there are dams everywhere,

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.896
and these are precisely the things

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.696
that stop wild salmon
from reaching their spawning grounds.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.816
So as a result,
we've turned to aquaculture,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.496
and salmon is one the most successful,
at least from a numbers point of view.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.736
When they first started farming salmon,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.696
it could take as many
as six pounds of wild fish

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.896
to make a single pound of salmon.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.576
The industry has, to its credit,
greatly improved.
