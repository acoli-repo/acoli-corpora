00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.080
is a phenomenon that the filmmaker
Mark Benjamin called "Grinding Nemo."

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.176
This phenomenon is very, very relevant

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.696
to anything that you've ever seen
on a tropical reef.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.376
Because what's going on right now,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.576
we have shrimp draggers
dragging for shrimp,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.456
catching a huge amount of bycatch,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.576
that bycatch in turn gets ground up
and turned into shrimp food.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.736
And sometimes, many of these vessels --

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.136
manned by slaves --

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.856
are catching these so-called "trash fish,"

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.833
fish that we would love to see on a reef,

00:04:55.857 --> 00:04:57.056
grinding them up

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.830
and turning them into shrimp feed --

00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:02.334
an ecosystem literally eating itself
and spitting out shrimp.
