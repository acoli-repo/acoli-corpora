"The International Conspiracy
to Catch all the Tunas."

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.176
Of course we've seen
incredible improvement

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.696
in ICCAT in the last few years,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.456
there is total room for improvement,

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.376
but it remains to be said
that tuna is a global fish,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.216
and to manage it,
we have to manage the globe.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.176
Well, we could also try to grow tuna

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.360
but tuna is a spectacularly bad
animal for aquaculture.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.936
Many people don't know this
but tuna are warm-blooded.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.376
They can heat their bodies 20 degrees
above ambient temperature,

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.496
they can swim at over 40 miles an hour.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.256
So that pretty much eliminates

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.376
all the advantages
of farming a fish, right?
