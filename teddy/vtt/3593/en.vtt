00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.056
So when I was a kid ...

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.376
this was my team.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.576
(Laughter)

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.616
I stunk at sports.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.856
I didn't like to play them,
I didn't like to watch them.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.136
So this is what I did. I went fishing.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.656
And for all of my growing up
I fished on the shores of Connecticut,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.880
and these are the creatures
that I saw on a regular basis.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.216
But after I grew up and went to college,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.896
and I came home in the early 90's,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.616
this is what I found.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.256
My team had shrunk.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.375
It was like literally having
your roster devastated.
