Aquaculture is the fastest growing
food system on the planet.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.896
It's growing at something
like seven percent per year.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.936
And so even though
we're doing less per fish

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.256
to bring it to the market,

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.016
we're still killing
a lot of these little fish.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.216
And it's not just fish
that we're feeding fish to,

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.840
we're also feeding fish
to chickens and pigs.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.536
So we've got chickens
and they're eating fish,

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.816
but weirdly, we also have fish
that are eating chickens.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.936
Because the byproducts of chickens --
feathers, blood, bone --

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.256
get ground up and fed to fish.
