00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.056
I have been reporting
on these subjects for 15 years.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.976
Every time I do a new story,
somebody tells me,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.856
"We can do all that. We can do it.
We've figured it all out.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.096
We can produce a fish

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.696
that's a net gain of marine protein
and has omega-3s."

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.936
Great.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.096
It doesn't seem to be getting scaled up.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.856
It is time to scale this up.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.096
If we do,

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.616
30 million metric tons of seafood,
a third of the world catch,

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.840
stays in the water.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.176
So I guess what I'm saying is
this is what we've been going with.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.376
We tend to go with our appetites
rather than our minds.
