00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.376
all the advantages
of farming a fish, right?

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.616
A farmed fish is --

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.069
or a fish is cold-blooded,
it doesn't move too much.

00:06:04.093 --> 00:06:06.096
That's a great thing for growing protein.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.456
But if you've got
this crazy, wild creature

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.976
that swims at 40 miles an hour
and heats its blood --

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.320
not a great candidate for aquaculture.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.976
The next creature --

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.976
most consumed seafood in America
and throughout the West --

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.216
is salmon.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.416
Now salmon got its plundering, too,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.576
but it didn't really necessarily
happen through fishing.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.376
This is my home state of Connecticut.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.456
Connecticut used to be home
to a lot of wild salmon.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.536
But if you look
at this map of Connecticut,
