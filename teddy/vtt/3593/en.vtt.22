00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.456
is could we eat them?

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.376
Could we eat them directly
instead of feeding them to salmon?

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.736
There are arguments for it.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.380
They are tremendously fuel efficient
to bring to market,

00:11:08.404 --> 00:11:10.496
a fraction of the fuel cost
of say, shrimp,

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.856
and at the very top
of the carbon efficiency scale.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.016
They also are omega-3 rich,
a great source for EPA and DHA.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.496
So that is a potential.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.216
And if we were to go down that route
what I would say is,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.056
instead of paying a few bucks a pound --
or a few bucks a ton, really --

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.056
and making it into aquafeed,

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.376
could we halve the catch
and double the price for the fishermen
