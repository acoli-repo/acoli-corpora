you're growing seaweed in the water,
you don't have to water it --

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.456
major consideration.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.216
And the last fish is a question mark.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.096
We have the ability
to create aquacultured fish

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.536
that creates a net gain
of marine protein for us.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.696
This creature would have to be vegetarian,

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.496
it would have to be fast growing,

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.176
it would have to be adaptable
to a changing climate

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.536
and it would have to have
that oily fish profile,

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.456
that EPA, DHA, omega-3
fatty acid profile that we're looking for.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.416
This exists kind of on paper.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.056
I have been reporting
on these subjects for 15 years.
