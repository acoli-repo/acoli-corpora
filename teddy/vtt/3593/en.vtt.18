00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.960
that's taken out of the sea
each and every year.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.696
The last of the four
is a kind of amorphous thing.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.216
It's what the industry calls "whitefish."

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.216
There are many fish that get cycled
into this whitefish thing

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.456
but the way to kind of tell
the story, I think,

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.416
is through that classic piece
of American culinary innovation,

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.816
the Filet-O-Fish sandwich.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.816
So the Filet-O-Fish sandwich
actually started as halibut.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.176
And it started because
a local franchise owner

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.736
found that when he served
his McDonald's on Friday, nobody came.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.296
Because it was a Catholic
community, they needed fish.
