00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.056
So it makes sense
that we've headed in this direction.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.033
But how have we headed in this direction?

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:06.256
Well ...

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.136
first it's a very, very new problem.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.896
This is the way we've been fishing
the oceans over the last 50 years.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.136
World War II was a tremendous incentive
to arm ourselves in a war against fish.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.416
All of the technology
that we perfected during World War II --

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.096
sonar, lightweight polymers --

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.416
all these things
were redirected towards fish.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.856
And so you see this tremendous buildup
in fishing capacity,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.536
quadrupling in the course of time,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.456
from the end of World War II
to the present time.
