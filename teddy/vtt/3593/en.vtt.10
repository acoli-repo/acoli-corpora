00:04:58.864 --> 00:05:02.334
an ecosystem literally eating itself
and spitting out shrimp.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.296
The next most consumed seafood in America,

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.016
and also throughout the West,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.256
is tuna.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.336
So tuna is this ultimate global fish.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.376
These huge management areas
have to be observed

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.336
in order for tuna to be well managed.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.136
Our own management area,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.616
called a Regional Fisheries
Management Organization,

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.856
is called ICCAT,

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.096
the International Commission
for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.816
The great naturalist
Carl Safina once called it,

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.096
"The International Conspiracy
to Catch all the Tunas."
