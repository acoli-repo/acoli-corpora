00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.296
Because it was a Catholic
community, they needed fish.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.176
So he went to Ray Kroc and he said,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.696
"I'm going to bring you a fish sandwich,
going to be made out of halibut."

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.016
Ray Kroc said, "I don't think
it's going to work.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.336
I want to do a Hula Burger,

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.884
and there's going to be
a slice of pineapple on a bun.

00:09:42.908 --> 00:09:44.644
But let's do this, let's have a bet.

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:48.176
Whosever sandwich sells more,
that will be the winning sandwich."

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.536
Well, it's kind of sad for the ocean
that the Hula Burger didn't win.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.696
So he made his halibut sandwich.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.056
Unfortunately though,
the sandwich came in at 30 cents.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.616
Ray wanted the sandwich
to come in at 25 cents,
