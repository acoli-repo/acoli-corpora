00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.456
from the end of World War II
to the present time.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.856
And right now that means

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.536
we're taking between 80 and 90 million
metric tons out of the sea every year.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.776
That's the equivalent
of the human weight of China

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.336
taken out of the sea every year.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.976
And it's no coincidence
that I use China as the example

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.016
because China is now
the largest fishing nation in the world.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.656
Well, that's only half the story.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.056
The other half of the story

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.136
is this incredible boom
in fish farming and aquaculture,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.376
which is now, only
in the last year or two,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.776
starting to exceed the amount
of wild fish that we produce.
