00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
One of the biggest challenges in computer graphics

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
has been being able to create a photo-real,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
digital human face.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that, unlike aliens and dinosaurs,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
we look at human faces every day.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They are very important to how we communicate with each other.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
As a result, we're tuned in to the subtlest things

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in order to believe whether these things are realistic.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And what I'm going to do in the next five minutes

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is take you through a process

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
where we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
using some computer graphics technology we've developed,
