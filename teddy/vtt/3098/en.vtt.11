00:05:29.215 --> 00:05:32.842
was that dust naturally
accumulates over the surface,

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:35.516
eventually camouflaging it
with the ground.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.652
We also had to make sure that the sensor
is no higher than 12 millimeters.

00:05:41.206 --> 00:05:43.435
Otherwise, people might trip over it,

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:45.364
which in itself would cause stampedes.

00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:49.579
(Laughter)

00:05:49.603 --> 00:05:50.965
We don't want that.

00:05:50.989 --> 00:05:52.778
(Laughter)

00:05:52.802 --> 00:05:56.881
So we were able to design a sensor
which was only 10 millimeters thick.

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:59.709
Now the data is sent
to the server in real time,

00:05:59.733 --> 00:06:01.381
and a heat map is plotted,
