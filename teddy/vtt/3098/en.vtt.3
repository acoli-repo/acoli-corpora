and use it in the next Kumbh Mela in 2015,

00:01:32.078 --> 00:01:35.683
to have fewer stampedes
and, hopefully, fewer deaths.

00:01:36.177 --> 00:01:38.648
It seemed like a mission impossible,

00:01:38.672 --> 00:01:40.440
a dream too big,

00:01:40.464 --> 00:01:42.645
especially for a 15-year-old,

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:46.208
yet that dream came true in 2015,

00:01:46.232 --> 00:01:49.925
when not only did we succeed

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:52.901
in reducing the stampedes
and their intensity,

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:55.102
but we marked 2015

00:01:55.126 --> 00:01:59.133
as the first Nashik Kumbh Mela
to have zero stampedes.

00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:04.934
