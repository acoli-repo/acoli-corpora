00:03:00.021 --> 00:03:02.899
along with the disadvantages
of being non-portable

00:03:02.923 --> 00:03:05.741
and being completely useless
in the case of rain,

00:03:05.765 --> 00:03:08.147
which is a common thing

Can we use cell phone tower data?

00:03:11.806 --> 00:03:14.273
It sounds like the perfect solution,

00:03:14.297 --> 00:03:16.070
but the funny part is,

00:03:16.094 --> 00:03:18.839
most of the people
do not carry cell phones

00:03:18.863 --> 00:03:20.347

00:03:20.887 --> 00:03:24.601

00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:27.078

00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:30.419
low-cost, sturdy and waterproof,
