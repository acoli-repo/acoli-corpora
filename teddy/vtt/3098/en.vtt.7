00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:30.419
low-cost, sturdy and waterproof,

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:32.854
and it was easy to get
the data for processing.

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:36.028
So we built Ashioto,

00:03:36.052 --> 00:03:38.137
meaning "footstep" in Japanese,

00:03:38.161 --> 00:03:42.346
as it consists of a portable mat
which has pressure sensors

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.861
which can count the number
of people walking on it,

00:03:44.885 --> 00:03:47.317
and sends the data over the internet

00:03:47.341 --> 00:03:49.888
to the advanced data analysis
software we created.

00:03:50.483 --> 00:03:53.771
The possible errors,
like overcounting or double-stepping,

00:03:53.795 --> 00:03:56.445
were overcome using design interventions.

00:03:56.803 --> 00:04:00.329
The optimum breadth of the mat
was determined to be 18 inches,
