00:03:56.803 --> 00:04:00.329
The optimum breadth of the mat
was determined to be 18 inches,

00:04:00.353 --> 00:04:02.592
after we tested many different versions

00:04:02.616 --> 00:04:05.203
and observed the average
stride length of a person.

00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:09.016
Otherwise, people might step
over the sensor.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.612
We started with a proof of concept
built in three days,

00:04:11.636 --> 00:04:14.510
made out of cardboard and aluminum foil.

00:04:14.534 --> 00:04:15.535
(Laughter)

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:17.933
It worked, for real.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:20.647
We built another one
with aluminum composite panels

00:04:20.671 --> 00:04:22.309
and piezoelectric plates,

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:25.904
which are plates that generate a small
pulse of electricity under pressure.

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:30.228
We tested this at 30 different
pilots in public,
