Now, this system, eventually,
with other innovations,

00:06:31.898 --> 00:06:35.050
is what helped prevent stampedes
altogether at that festival.

00:06:35.585 --> 00:06:38.458
The code used by Ashioto during Kumbh Mela

00:06:38.482 --> 00:06:41.894
will soon be made publicly available,
free to use for anyone.

00:06:41.918 --> 00:06:43.895
I would be glad if someone used this code

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:46.131
to make many more gatherings safer.

00:06:46.878 --> 00:06:48.804
Having succeeded at Kumbh Mela

00:06:48.828 --> 00:06:52.740
has inspired me to help others
who may also suffer from stampedes.

00:06:52.764 --> 00:06:55.573
The design of the system
makes it adaptable

00:06:55.597 --> 00:06:57.591
to pretty much any event

00:06:57.615 --> 00:07:01.411
that involves an organized
gathering of people.
