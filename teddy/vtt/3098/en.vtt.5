00:02:25.784 --> 00:02:30.292
Now, we figured out to solve
the stampede problem,

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.480
we wanted to know only three things:

00:02:32.504 --> 00:02:35.243
the number of people, the location,

00:02:35.267 --> 00:02:38.726
and the rate of the flow
of people per minute.

00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:43.370
So we started to look for technologies
that would help us get these three things.

00:02:44.091 --> 00:02:48.345
Can we distribute radio-frequency tokens
to identify people?

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:51.782
We figured out that it would
be too expensive and impractical

00:02:51.806 --> 00:02:53.742
to distribute 30 million tags.

00:02:54.545 --> 00:02:57.926
Can you use CCTV cameras
with image-processing techniques?

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.997
Again, too expensive for that scale,
