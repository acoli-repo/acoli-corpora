00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:30.228
We tested this at 30 different
pilots in public,

00:04:30.252 --> 00:04:33.974
in crowded restaurants,
in malls, in temples, etc.,

00:04:33.998 --> 00:04:35.632
to see how people reacted.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.743
And people let us run these pilots

00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:45.243
because they were excited to see localites
work on problems for the city.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.799
I was 15 and my team members
were in their early 20s.

00:04:49.736 --> 00:04:54.227
When the sensors were colored,

00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:57.092
people would get scared
and would ask us questions like,

00:04:57.116 --> 00:04:59.323
"Will I get electrocuted
if I step on this?"

00:04:59.347 --> 00:05:00.348
(Laughter)
