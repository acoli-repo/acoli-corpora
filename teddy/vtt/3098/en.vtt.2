WEBVTT

00:00:59.243 --> 00:01:03.758
is seeing people around me
resigning to the city's fate

00:01:03.782 --> 00:01:07.607
in witnessing the seemingly
inevitable deaths of dozens

00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:08.908
at every Kumbh Mela.

00:01:09.448 --> 00:01:10.878
I sought to change this,

00:01:10.902 --> 00:01:13.877
and I thought, why can't I try
to find a solution to this?

00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:15.389
Because I knew it is wrong.

00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:19.153
Having learned coding at an early age
and being a maker,

00:01:19.177 --> 00:01:20.845
I considered the wild idea --

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.057
(Laughter)

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:23.466
[Makers always find a way]

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.555
I considered the wild idea
of building a system

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.041
that would help regulate
the flow of people

00:01:29.065 --> 00:01:32.054
and use it in the next Kumbh Mela in 2015,
