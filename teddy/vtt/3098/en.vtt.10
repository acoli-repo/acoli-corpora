00:04:59.347 --> 00:05:00.348
(Laughter)

00:05:00.372 --> 00:05:04.744
Or, if it was very obvious that it was
an electronic sensor on the ground,

00:05:04.768 --> 00:05:06.261
they would just jump over it.

00:05:06.285 --> 00:05:07.361
(Laughter)

00:05:07.385 --> 00:05:10.449
So we decided to design
a cover for the sensor

00:05:10.473 --> 00:05:13.530
so that people don't have to worry
what it is on the ground.

00:05:13.554 --> 00:05:15.530
So after some experimentation,

00:05:15.554 --> 00:05:18.364
we decided to use an industrial sensor,

00:05:18.388 --> 00:05:21.357
used as a safety trigger
in hazardous areas

00:05:21.381 --> 00:05:22.532
as the sensor,

00:05:22.556 --> 00:05:24.637
and a black neoprene rubber sheet

00:05:24.661 --> 00:05:25.903
as the cover.

00:05:26.374 --> 00:05:29.191
Now, another added benefit
of using black rubber

00:05:29.215 --> 00:05:32.842
was that dust naturally
accumulates over the surface,
