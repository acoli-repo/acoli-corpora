00:05:59.733 --> 00:06:01.381
and a heat map is plotted,

00:06:01.405 --> 00:06:04.748
taking into account
all the active devices on the ground.

00:06:04.772 --> 00:06:09.057
The authorities could be alerted
if the crowd movement slowed down

00:06:09.081 --> 00:06:12.216
or if the crowd density
moved beyond a desired threshold.

00:06:12.992 --> 00:06:17.984
We installed five of these mats
in the Nashik Kumbh Mela 2015,

00:06:18.008 --> 00:06:20.398
and counted over half a million people

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:22.104
in 18 hours,

00:06:22.128 --> 00:06:26.505
ensuring that the data was available
in real time at various checkpoints,

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:28.405
ensuring a safe flow of people.

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:31.874
Now, this system, eventually,
with other innovations,
