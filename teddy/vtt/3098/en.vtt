00:00:00.691 --> 00:00:01.969
I was only nine

00:00:01.993 --> 00:00:06.916
when my grandfather first described to me
the horrors he witnessed six years earlier

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.844
when human stampedes killed 39 people

00:00:09.868 --> 00:00:11.884
in our hometown of Nashik, India.

00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:15.750
It was during the 2003 Nashik Kumbh Mela,

00:00:15.774 --> 00:00:18.746
one of the world's largest
religious gatherings.

00:00:19.213 --> 00:00:22.943
Every 12 years,
over 30 million Hindu worshippers

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:24.546
descend upon our city --

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.410
which is built
only for 1.5 million people --

00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:29.077
and stay for 45 days.

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:32.672
The main purpose
is to wash away all their sins
