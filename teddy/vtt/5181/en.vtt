Picture yourself driving
down the road tomorrow,

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:08.114
heading somewhere to buy an item
you found on Craigslist,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.601
perhaps a nice mountain bike
for 3,000 dollars.

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:15.625
At that price, it's probably
one of those bikes

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:17.449
with a little electric motor on it --

00:00:17.473 --> 00:00:18.496
(Laughter)

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.589
maybe some streamers from the handlebars.

00:00:20.613 --> 00:00:21.654
(Laughter)

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.006
The seller has declared this
a cash-only deal,

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.420
so you have, in the console
of your car, 3,000 dollars.

00:00:29.444 --> 00:00:32.317
Suddenly, you are pulled over.
