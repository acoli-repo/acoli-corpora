00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:30.701
They've had three other children. I'm the fourth. The third was an accident.

00:09:30.701 --> 00:09:34.746
And I said, "Yeah, of course I do." Because you do.

00:09:34.746 --> 00:09:36.897
My foster mother asked me to go away to think about love

00:09:36.897 --> 00:09:39.741
and what it is and to read the Scriptures and to come back tomorrow

00:09:39.741 --> 00:09:42.684
and give my most honest and truthful answer.

00:09:42.684 --> 00:09:45.524
So this was an opportunity. If they were asking me

00:09:45.524 --> 00:09:47.860
whether I loved them or not, then I mustn't love them,

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.725
which led me to the miracle of thought that I thought they wanted me to get to.

00:09:50.725 --> 00:09:53.396
"I will ask God for forgiveness and His light will shine

00:09:53.396 --> 00:09:57.164
through me to them. How fantastic." This was an opportunity.

00:09:57.164 --> 00:09:59.949
The theology was perfect, the timing unquestionable,

00:09:59.949 --> 00:10:02.852
and the answer as honest as a sinner could get.
