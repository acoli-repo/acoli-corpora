00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:02.350
I know famous musicians,

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.422
I know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists

00:03:07.422 --> 00:03:10.923
and top lawyers and television executives

00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:13.373
and magazine editors and national journalists

00:03:13.373 --> 00:03:16.214
and dustbinmen and hairdressers, all who were

00:03:16.214 --> 00:03:19.750
looked after children, fostered, adopted or orphaned,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.422
and many of them grow into their adult lives

00:03:22.422 --> 00:03:26.693

00:03:26.693 --> 00:03:31.000
somehow weaken their standing in the foreground,
