So she goes from Oxford, she's sent to the north of England

00:07:02.303 --> 00:07:06.663
to a mother and baby home, and appointed a social worker.

00:07:06.663 --> 00:07:10.903
It's her plan. You know, I have to say this in the Houses --

00:07:10.903 --> 00:07:15.174
It's her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time

00:07:15.174 --> 00:07:18.749
while she studies. But the social worker,

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:21.743
he had a different agenda.

00:07:21.743 --> 00:07:25.950
He found the foster parents, and he said to them,

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.782
"Treat this as an adoption. He's yours forever.

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:33.229
His name is Norman." (Laughter)
