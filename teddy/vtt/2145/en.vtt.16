00:07:59.716 --> 00:08:02.793
too selfish to sign, so I spent those 11 years

00:08:02.793 --> 00:08:05.549
kneeling and praying.

00:08:05.549 --> 00:08:08.670
I tried praying. I swear I tried praying.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.478
"God, can I have a bike for Christmas?"

00:08:12.478 --> 00:08:16.826
But I would always answer myself, "Yes, of course you can."

00:08:16.826 --> 00:08:18.440
(Laughter)

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.177
And then I was supposed to determine whether that

00:08:21.177 --> 00:08:24.709
was the voice of God or it was the voice of the Devil.

00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:32.068
And it turns out I've got the Devil inside of me.
