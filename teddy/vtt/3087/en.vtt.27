And got the chance to record this music,

00:13:30.077 --> 00:13:32.156
this new music that they were creating,

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.322
and to spread it throughout the world.

00:13:35.807 --> 00:13:39.195
Without the Great Migration,
"Motown" would not have existed.

00:13:39.843 --> 00:13:42.819
The founder, Berry Gordy,
his parents were from Georgia.

00:13:42.843 --> 00:13:44.446
They migrated to Detroit.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:48.164
And when he got to be a grown man,
he decided he wanted to go into music.

00:13:48.188 --> 00:13:51.560
But he didn't have the wherewithal
to go all over the country

00:13:51.584 --> 00:13:53.164
looking for the best talent,

00:13:53.188 --> 00:13:55.453
and it turned out he didn't have to.

00:13:55.477 --> 00:13:57.386
It turned out that there he was,

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.433
surrounded by children
of the Great Migration
