It stands out because this
was the first time in American history

00:04:04.815 --> 00:04:11.032
that American citizens
had to flee the land of their birth

00:04:11.056 --> 00:04:15.176
just to be recognized as the citizens
that they had always been.

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:18.276
No other group of Americans

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.378
has had to act like immigrants

00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:24.894
in order to be recognized as citizens.

00:04:25.864 --> 00:04:29.807
So this great migration was not a move.
