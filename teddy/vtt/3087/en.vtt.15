00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:30.156
migration from Europe
came to a virtual halt.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.697
And so the North had a labor problem.

00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:38.506
And so the North decided to go
and find the cheapest labor in the land

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.410
which meant African Americans
in the South,

00:07:41.434 --> 00:07:45.133
many of whom were not even being paid
for their hard work.

00:07:45.157 --> 00:07:46.506
Many of them were working

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.902
for the right to live on the land
that they were farming.

00:07:49.926 --> 00:07:52.553
They were sharecroppers
and not even being paid.

00:07:52.577 --> 00:07:54.844
So they were ripe for recruitment.

00:07:55.482 --> 00:07:57.379
But it turned out

00:07:57.403 --> 00:08:02.211
that the South did not take kindly
to this poaching of its cheap labor.
