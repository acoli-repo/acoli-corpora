00:15:57.941 --> 00:16:02.989
These are all a few
of the millions of people

00:16:03.013 --> 00:16:06.925
who were products
of the single decision to migrate.

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:10.761
The people of the Great Migration

00:16:10.785 --> 00:16:13.292
met with tremendous
resistance in the North.

00:16:13.809 --> 00:16:18.364
And they were not able to defeat
all social injustice.

00:16:19.275 --> 00:16:21.100
But one person

00:16:21.124 --> 00:16:23.219
added to another person,

00:16:23.243 --> 00:16:24.886
added to another person,

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.965
multiplied by millions,

00:16:27.989 --> 00:16:32.915
were able to become the advance guard
of the civil rights movement.
