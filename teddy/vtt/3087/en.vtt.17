00:08:34.211 --> 00:08:37.568
And as they made their way
out of the South,

00:08:37.592 --> 00:08:40.068
away from Jim Crow,

00:08:40.092 --> 00:08:43.501
they followed three
beautifully predictable streams

00:08:43.525 --> 00:08:48.084
as is the case in any migration
throughout human history.

00:08:48.541 --> 00:08:51.685
In this particular case,
there were three streams.

00:08:51.709 --> 00:08:56.578
One was the migration along the East Coast

00:08:56.602 --> 00:09:00.822
from Florida, Georgia,
the Carolinas and Virginia
