00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Not likely.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
This gift came to me about five months ago.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
not quite so pretty.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And this,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and then this.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It was a rare gem --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
a brain tumor,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
hemangioblastoma --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the gift that keeps on giving.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And while I'm okay now,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I wouldn't wish this gift for you.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm not sure you'd want it.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But I wouldn't change my experience.
