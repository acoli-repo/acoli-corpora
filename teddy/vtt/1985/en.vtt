00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Do you know

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that we have 1.4 million cellular radio masts

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
deployed worldwide?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And these are base stations.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And we also have

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
more than five billion

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
of these devices here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
These are cellular mobile phones.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And with these mobile phones,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
we transmit more than 600 terabytes of data

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
every month.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is a 6 with 14 zeroes --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a very large number.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And wireless communications
