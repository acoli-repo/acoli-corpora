In the year 1919,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
a virtually unknown German mathematician, named Theodor Kaluza

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
suggested a very bold and, in some ways, a very bizarre idea.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
He proposed that our universe

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
might actually have more than the three dimensions

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that we are all aware of.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That is in addition to left, right, back, forth and up, down,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space
