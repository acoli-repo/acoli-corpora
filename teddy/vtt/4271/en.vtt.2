00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:00.707
Now, the kicker is, everything I'm about to do here

00:01:00.707 --> 00:01:04.513
you can do at home, because we built this

00:01:04.513 --> 00:01:07.323
for the public for you guys to use.

00:01:07.323 --> 00:01:09.244
So what you're looking at right now is the Earth.

00:01:09.244 --> 00:01:11.215
You can see the United States and California

00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:13.994
and San Diego, and you can use the mouse

00:01:13.994 --> 00:01:16.049
or the keyboard to spin things around.

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.488
Now, this isn't new. Anyone who's used Google Earth

00:01:19.488 --> 00:01:22.499
has seen this before, but one thing we like to say

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:26.312
in our group is, we do the opposite of Google Earth.

00:01:26.312 --> 00:01:30.361
Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard.
