WEBVTT

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.064
And the cool thing is, we actually created 3D models

00:02:01.064 --> 00:02:04.329
for a number of these spacecraft, so if you want to visit

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.355
any of these, all you need to do is double-click on them.

00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:10.591
So I'm going to find the International Space Station,

00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:15.598
double-click, and it will take us all the way down to the ISS.

00:02:15.598 --> 00:02:18.207
And now you're riding along with the ISS

00:02:18.207 --> 00:02:21.402
where it is right now.

00:02:21.402 --> 00:02:23.194
And the other cool thing is, not only can we

00:02:23.194 --> 00:02:26.469
move the camera around, we can also control time,

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.582
so I can slide this jog dial here

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:30.877
to shuttle time forward, and now
