00:02:59.297 --> 00:03:01.386
Here we have the Mars Science Laboratory

00:03:01.386 --> 00:03:03.929
on its way to Mars, just launched last weekend.

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:07.911
Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter, there.

00:03:07.911 --> 00:03:09.873
We have Dawn orbiting Vesta,

00:03:09.873 --> 00:03:11.883
and we have over here New Horizons

00:03:11.883 --> 00:03:14.341
on a straight shot to Pluto.

00:03:14.341 --> 00:03:16.296
And I mention this because

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:19.101
there's this strange public perception that

00:03:19.101 --> 00:03:21.894
NASA's dead, that the space shuttles stopped flying

00:03:21.894 --> 00:03:24.478
and all of the sudden there's no more spacecraft out there.

00:03:24.478 --> 00:03:29.057
Well, a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration,

00:03:29.057 --> 00:03:31.656
and we have a lot of spacecraft out there.
