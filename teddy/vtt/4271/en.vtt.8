00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:00.911
and this is happening right now.

00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:05.118
I'm going to double-click on Uranus, and we can see

00:04:05.118 --> 00:04:08.426
Uranus rotating on its side along with its moons.

00:04:08.426 --> 00:04:12.218
You can see how it's tilted at about 89 degrees.

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:16.178
And just being able to visit different places

00:04:16.178 --> 00:04:17.464
and go through different times,

00:04:17.464 --> 00:04:20.559
we have data from 1950 to 2050.

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:22.776
Granted, we don't have everything in between,

00:04:22.776 --> 00:04:24.542
because some of the data is hard to get.

00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:28.457
Just being able to visit places in different times,

00:04:28.457 --> 00:04:32.125
you can explore this for hours,
