WEBVTT

00:03:29.057 --> 00:03:31.656
and we have a lot of spacecraft out there.

00:03:31.656 --> 00:03:33.929
Granted, we're not sending humans up at the moment,

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:36.736
well at least with our own launch vehicles,

00:03:36.736 --> 00:03:38.980
but NASA is far from dead,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.310
and one of the reasons why we write a program like this

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.797
is so that people realize that there's so many other things

00:03:44.797 --> 00:03:46.488
that we're doing.

00:03:46.488 --> 00:03:48.210
Anyway, while we're here, again,

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.140
if you want to visit anything,

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.057
all you need to do is double-click.

00:03:52.057 --> 00:03:54.627
So I'm just going to double-click on Vesta,

00:03:54.627 --> 00:03:58.721
and here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta,

00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:00.911
and this is happening right now.
