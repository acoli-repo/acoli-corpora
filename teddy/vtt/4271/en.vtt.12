00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.036
And even better, because it's an interactive application,

00:06:01.036 --> 00:06:03.016
you can tell the story for yourself.

00:06:03.016 --> 00:06:05.221
If you want to pause it, you can pause it.

00:06:05.221 --> 00:06:06.708
If you want to keep going, if you want to change

00:06:06.708 --> 00:06:09.032
the camera angle, you can do that,

00:06:09.032 --> 00:06:11.555
and because of that, I can show you

00:06:11.555 --> 00:06:14.376
that Voyager 1 doesn't just fly by Saturn.

00:06:14.376 --> 00:06:18.355
It actually flies underneath Saturn.

00:06:18.355 --> 00:06:21.725
Now, what happens is, as it flies underneath Saturn,

00:06:21.725 --> 00:06:24.636
Saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up

00:06:24.636 --> 00:06:26.926
and out of the solar system,

00:06:26.926 --> 00:06:29.964
so if I just keep letting this go,

00:06:29.964 --> 00:06:34.621
you can see Voyager 1 fly up like that.
