00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:31.377
as my own personal dream, and part of that dream was,

00:00:31.377 --> 00:00:33.986
I always wanted to just fly around the solar system

00:00:33.986 --> 00:00:37.383
and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft.

00:00:37.383 --> 00:00:42.077
Well, a number of years later, I graduated from UCLA

00:00:42.077 --> 00:00:44.259
and I found myself at NASA,

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:46.363
working for the jet propulsion laboratory,

00:00:46.363 --> 00:00:49.058
and there our team was challenged

00:00:49.058 --> 00:00:53.447
to create a 3D visualization of the solar system,

00:00:53.447 --> 00:00:57.321
and today I want to show you what we've done so far.

00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:00.707
Now, the kicker is, everything I'm about to do here
