00:06:59.726 --> 00:07:03.022
You can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself.

00:07:03.022 --> 00:07:06.513
You know, the theme today is "The World In Your Grasp."

00:07:06.513 --> 00:07:07.935
Well, we're trying to give you

00:07:07.935 --> 00:07:09.532
the solar system in your grasp — (Laughter) —

00:07:09.532 --> 00:07:11.081
and we hope once it's there,

00:07:11.081 --> 00:07:13.334
you'll be able to learn for yourself

00:07:13.334 --> 00:07:15.528
what we've done out there, and what we're about to do.

00:07:15.528 --> 00:07:19.027
And my personal dream is for kids to take this

00:07:19.027 --> 00:07:21.712
and explore and see the wonders out there

00:07:21.712 --> 00:07:24.721
and be inspired, as I was as a kid,

00:07:24.721 --> 00:07:26.279
to pursue STEM education

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.029
and to pursue a dream in space exploration.

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:32.251
Thank you. (Applause)
