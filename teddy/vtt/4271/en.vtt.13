00:06:29.964 --> 00:06:34.621
you can see Voyager 1 fly up like that.

00:06:34.621 --> 00:06:36.753
And, in fact, I'm going to go back to the solar system.

00:06:36.753 --> 00:06:39.661
I'm going to go back to today, now,

00:06:39.661 --> 00:06:43.307
and I want to show you where Voyager 1 is.

00:06:43.307 --> 00:06:47.910
Right there, above, way above the solar system,

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.450
way beyond our solar system.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.037
And here's the thing. Now you know how it got there.

00:06:53.037 --> 00:06:54.665
Now you know why, and to me,

00:06:54.665 --> 00:06:56.453
that's the point of this program.

00:06:56.453 --> 00:06:59.726
You can manipulate it yourself.

00:06:59.726 --> 00:07:03.022
You can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself.
