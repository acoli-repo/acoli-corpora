00:05:27.485 --> 00:05:30.331
I'm going to speed up time, and we can watch

00:05:30.331 --> 00:05:32.986
as Voyager 1 flies by Titan,

00:05:32.986 --> 00:05:35.201
which is a hazy moon of Saturn.

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:37.505
It actually has a very thick atmosphere.

00:05:37.505 --> 00:05:40.766
And I'm going to recenter the camera on Saturn, here.

00:05:40.766 --> 00:05:44.655
I'm going to pull out, and I want to show you

00:05:44.655 --> 00:05:47.885
Voyager 1 as it flies by Saturn.

00:05:47.885 --> 00:05:50.135
There's a point to be made here.

00:05:50.135 --> 00:05:52.777
With a 3D visualization like this,

00:05:52.777 --> 00:05:56.558
we can not only just say Voyager 1 flew by Saturn.

00:05:56.558 --> 00:05:58.180
There's a whole story to tell here.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.036
And even better, because it's an interactive application,
