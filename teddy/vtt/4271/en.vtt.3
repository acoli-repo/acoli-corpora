00:01:26.312 --> 00:01:30.361
Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard.

00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:33.894
We go from this view out to the stars.

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:36.821
So the Earth is cool, but what we really want to show

00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:38.687
are the spacecraft,

00:01:38.687 --> 00:01:41.432
so I'm going to bring the interface back up,

00:01:41.432 --> 00:01:44.154
and now you're looking at a number of satellites

00:01:44.154 --> 00:01:45.091
orbiting the Earth.

00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:48.373
These are a number of our science space Earth orbiters.

00:01:48.373 --> 00:01:50.691
We haven't included military satellites and weather satellites

00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:52.704
and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites.

00:01:52.704 --> 00:01:55.203
If we did, it would be a complete mess,

00:01:55.203 --> 00:01:57.259
because there's a lot of stuff out there.

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.064
And the cool thing is, we actually created 3D models
