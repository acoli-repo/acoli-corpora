00:04:28.457 --> 00:04:32.125
you can explore this for hours,

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:34.081
literally hours on end,

00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:36.959
but I want to show you one thing in particular,

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:39.344
so I'm going to open up the destination tab,

00:04:39.344 --> 00:04:42.731
spacecraft outer planet missions, Voyager 1,

00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:45.731
and I'm going to bring up the Titan flyby.

00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:48.521
So now we've gone back in time.

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:51.458
We're now riding along with Voyager 1.

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:54.855
The date here is November 11, 1980.

00:04:54.855 --> 00:04:57.184
Now, there's a funny thing going on here.

00:04:57.184 --> 00:04:59.377
It doesn't look like anything's going on.

00:04:59.377 --> 00:05:01.477
It looks like I've paused the program.
