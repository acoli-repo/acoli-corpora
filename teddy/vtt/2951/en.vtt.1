00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.216
like if I only had the tools

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.616
to change things in my city,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.896
what would I do?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.520
What would my dream city be like?

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.896
And these tools,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.280
this is just what we gave them.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.656
Two years ago, my team and I,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.096
we released a game,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.816
"Cities: Skylines."

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.680
It is a game about building cities.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.336
So I have always been
interested in cities as systems.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.256
It's something that I find
immensely interesting.
