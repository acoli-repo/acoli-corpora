00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.576
So I have a couple of videos.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.416
These are from YouTube.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.895
And these are some of the most
interesting city designs I have seen.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.416
So they are all different,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.760
and I hope you like all of these.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.376
This one is called The Netherlands.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.600
It's by Silvarret.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.496
And when you start the game,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.600
you have an empty piece of land.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.056
This land, it can be based
on the real world,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.016
it can be hand-crafted in the map editor,
