But then let's go even more
on the fantasy side.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.880
Let's go into the future.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.616
This is one of my personal favorites.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.360
These city designs
are what I love the most.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.296
So this is a tiered city by Conflictnerd,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.480
and the basic idea is
that you have concentric circle routes.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.536
So the city is a big circle

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.400
with tinier circles inside.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.656
And the thing is that you put
all of the services in the center,
