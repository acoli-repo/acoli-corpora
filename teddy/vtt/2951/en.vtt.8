00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.656
And the thing is that you put
all of the services in the center,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.096
and then people actually live
on the outer ring,

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.896
because there is less traffic,
less noise, less pollution,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.856
so that is where you want to live.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.816
But the services
are still really close by.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.495
They are in the center.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.680
And this is the soul of the game.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.376
The player has to understand

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.976
what are the wishes, what are the needs

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
of the tiny people living in the cities.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.496
So you need to know
where you should put the things.
