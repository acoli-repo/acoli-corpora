00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.296
and combined a couple of those,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.016
and this is what he created.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.696
So it is a city,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.976
but it is not a real city,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.256
but it could be.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.960
It looks just like the Netherlands.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.936
So the places are really
densely populated.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.936
So what you need is highways, trains,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.216
anything connecting
these small town centers together.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.456
Lots of people, lots of moving,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.600
so transportation is the key here.
