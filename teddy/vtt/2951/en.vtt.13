will also work in the real world,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.736
so that you can actually try out things,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.736
see if this intersection
might fit this kind of a situation.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.296
If we build a new road, would it help?

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.280
And this is what you can do
with this game.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.176
There was one really
interesting contest held

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.880
by the Finnish city of Hämeenlinna.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.656
So what they did
was that they had a new area

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.080
that they wanted to develop in the city.
