00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.120
to actually build the real city.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.776
And these videos that I have shown you,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.400
these are the people who are
coming up with new kinds of solutions.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.856
We know that cities are growing.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.336
They're getting bigger as we go,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.576
and the percentage of population
living in cities is projected to rise.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.496
So we need the solutions

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.216
and these people, playing the game,

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.896
they are trying out
different kinds of solutions.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.600
They might have something
that is really important.
