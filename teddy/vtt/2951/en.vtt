We humans are becoming an urban species,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.136

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.360
That is where we live.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.976
In 2014, over 54 percent

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.616
of the world population

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.680
was living in cities,

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.256

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.936

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.536
