00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.656
The basic idea is that
if you want your citizens to walk,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.616
which is kind of beneficial,

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.376
you actually need to have walking
as a reasonable means of transportation.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.200
It should be a good way to reach places.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.376
So what Yuttho did
was that he explained this concept,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.416
he had Speck explain it, too,

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.400
and then he applied it
to the city that he was building.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.096
So what we are seeing
is Yuttho's vision of the future:

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.376
lots of public transportation,
walkways, plazas,
