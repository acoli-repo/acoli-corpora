it can be hand-crafted in the map editor,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.016
or you can, of course, download
a city made by someone else

and play in that.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.016

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.616
is that what he wanted to make

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.376

This is a fantasy city,

and combined a couple of those,
