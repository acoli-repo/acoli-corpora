It's something that I find
immensely interesting.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.416
But what I didn't understand

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.920
was that I am not alone in this.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.336
People love cities.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.240
They are interested. They have ideas.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.096
The game was an instant hit.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.720
So far, over three and a half
million people have played it.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.056
And it's not just about playing.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.816
We also have really awesome
sharing systems.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.536
So people play, they create cities
