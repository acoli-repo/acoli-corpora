00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.536
So people play, they create cities

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.376
and then they are sharing these creations,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.440
showing off what they have made.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.536
And what I will show you

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.776
is some of these cities

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.120
created by the players.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.216
So the game is about self-expression,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.496
creativity,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.136
not just overcoming the challenges
posed by the simulation.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.760
It is about showing
what your cities look like.
