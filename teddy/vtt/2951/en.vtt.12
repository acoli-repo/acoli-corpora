00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.376
lots of public transportation,
walkways, plazas,

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.000
connecting high-rise buildings.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.376
Maybe this is what
the future might look like.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.856
And the game system
works really well for this.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.696
We are seeing some
real-world uses to this game.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:21.416
So we know that some urban planners
are using it as a sketching tool,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.736
so while the simulation
is not completely realistic,

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.696
it is realistic enough
that if something works in the game,

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.616
it is highly likely that it
will also work in the real world,
