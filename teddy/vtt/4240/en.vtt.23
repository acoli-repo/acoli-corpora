00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
but they never had the seriousness

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
of the first identity

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
because they were too individual, and they didn't have that heft

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
of everything being the same thing.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Now -- and I think since the Public Theater,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
I must have done more than a dozen

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
cultural identities for major institutions,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and I don't think I ever -- I ever

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
grasped that seriousness again --

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
I do them for very big, important institutions

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
in New York City.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
The institutions are solemn,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and so is the design.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
They're better crafted than the Public Theater was,
