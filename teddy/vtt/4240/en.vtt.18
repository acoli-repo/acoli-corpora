00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
in this project

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
in a way I never was before.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
This is what theater advertising looked like at that time.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
This is what was in the newspapers and in the New York Times.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
So, this is sort of a comment on the time.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And the Public Theater actually had much better advertising than this.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
They had no logo and no identity,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
but they had these very iconic posters

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
painted by Paul Davis.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And George Wolf had taken over from another director

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and he wanted to change the theater,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and he wanted to make it urban and loud

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and a place that was inclusive.
