This is a current project

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
where I got to be goofy.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I was invited to design

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
a logo for this neighborhood, called the North Side,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and I thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
I think that's rather creepy, actually. Why would a neighborhood have a logo?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
A neighborhood has a thing -- it's got a landmark, it's got a place,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
it's got a restaurant. It doesn't have a logo. I mean, what would that be?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
So I had to actually give a presentation

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
to a city council

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
and neighborhood constituents,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and I went to Pittsburgh and I said,
