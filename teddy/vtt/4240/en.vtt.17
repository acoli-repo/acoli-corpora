00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And in that moment of

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
desire and focus,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
he can win.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And that is a wonderful

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
position to be in to create some serious play.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And I had that moment in 1994

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
when I met a theater director

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
named George Wolfe,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
who was going to have me design

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
an identity for the New York Shakespeare Festival,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
then known,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and then became the Public Theater.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And I began getting immersed

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
in this project

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
in a way I never was before.
