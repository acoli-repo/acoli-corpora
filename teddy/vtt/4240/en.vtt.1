00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
with the structure or the situation you're in,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
if you're a designer.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But the serious part is what threw me,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and I couldn't quite get a handle

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
on it until I remembered an essay.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And it's an essay I read 30 years ago.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It was written by Russell Baker,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
who used to write an "Observer" column in the New York Times.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
He's a wonderful humorist. And I'm going to read you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
this essay,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
or an excerpt from it

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
because it really hit home for me.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Here is a letter of friendly advice.
