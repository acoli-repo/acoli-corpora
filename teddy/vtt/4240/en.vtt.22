00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And what happened was

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
that New York City, to a degree,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
ate my identity

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
because people began to copy it.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Here's an ad in the New York Times

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
somebody did for a play called "Mind Games."

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Then "Chicago" came out, used similar graphics,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and the Public Theater's identity was just totally eaten and taken away,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
which meant I had to change it.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
So, I changed it so that every season was different,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and I continued to do these posters,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
but they never had the seriousness

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
of the first identity
