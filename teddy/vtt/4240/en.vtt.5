00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
spontaneously, intuitively,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
accidentally or incidentally.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It can be achieved out of innocence, or arrogance,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
or out of selfishness, sometimes out of carelessness.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
But mostly, it's achieved through all those kind of crazy

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
parts of human behavior that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
don't really make any sense.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Serious design is imperfect.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
the first of its kind.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Serious design is also -- often -- quite unsuccessful

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
from the solemn point of view.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
That's because the art of serious play

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
is about invention, change, rebellion -- not perfection.
