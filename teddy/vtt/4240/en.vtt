00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
My work is play.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And I play when I design.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I even looked it up in the dictionary, to make sure

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that I actually do that,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and the definition of play,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
number one, was engaging in a childlike

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
activity or endeavor,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and number two was gambling.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And I realize I do both

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
when I'm designing.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'm both a kid and I'm gambling all the time.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And I think that if you're not,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
there's probably something inherently wrong

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
with the structure or the situation you're in,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
if you're a designer.
