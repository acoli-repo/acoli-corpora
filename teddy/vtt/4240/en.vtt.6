00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
That's because the art of serious play

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
is about invention, change, rebellion -- not perfection.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Perfection happens during solemn play.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Now, I always saw design careers

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
like surreal staircases.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
If you look at the staircase, you'll see

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that in your 20s the risers are very high

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and the steps are very short,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and you make huge discoveries.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
You sort of leap up very quickly in your youth.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
That's because you don't know anything and you have a lot to learn,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and so that anything you do is a learning experience
