there wasn't a plethora of design publishing.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
You actually had to go to antique stores. You had to go to Europe.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
You had to go places and find the stuff.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And what I responded to was, you know,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Art Nouveau, or deco,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
or Victorian typography,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
or things that were just completely not Helvetica.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And I taught myself design this way,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and this was sort of my early years,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and I used these things

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
in really goofy ways

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
on record covers and in my design.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I wasn't educated. I just sort of

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
put these things together.
