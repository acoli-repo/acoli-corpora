00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
where I would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I'd never done this kind of work before.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I didn't know how to read an architectural plan,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
I didn't know what they were talking about,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and I really couldn't handle the fact that a job --

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
a single job -- could go on for four years

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
because I was used to immediacy in graphic design,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and that kind of attention to detail

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
was really bad for somebody like me, with ADD.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
So, it was a rough -- it was a rough go,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
but I fell in love with this process

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
of actually integrating graphics into architecture

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
because I didn't know what I was doing.
