00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
because I didn't know what I was doing.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I said, "Why can't the signage be on the floor?"

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
New Yorkers look at their feet.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And then I found that actors and actresses

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
actually take their cues from the floor,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
began to make sense.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
They integrated with the building in really peculiar ways.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
They ran around corners,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
they went up sides of buildings,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and they melded into the architecture.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
This is Symphony Space on 90th Street and Broadway,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
and backlit with fiber optics.
