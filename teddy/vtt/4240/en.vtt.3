That's because it is hard for most people

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to recognize seriousness, which is rare,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but more comfortable to endorse solemnity,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
which is commonplace.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Jogging, which is commonplace,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and widely accepted as good for you, is solemn.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Poker is serious.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Washington, D.C. is solemn.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
New York is serious.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Going to educational conferences to tell you anything

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
about the future is solemn.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Taking a long walk by yourself,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing Tiffany's,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
is serious.
