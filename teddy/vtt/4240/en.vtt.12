00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I wasn't educated. I just sort of

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
put these things together.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I mixed up Victorian designs with pop,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and I mixed up Art Nouveau with something else.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And I made these very lush,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
very elaborate record covers,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
not because I was being a post-modernist or a historicist --

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
because I didn't know what those things were.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I just hated Helvetica.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
(Laughter)

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And that kind of passion

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
drove me into very serious play,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
a kind of play I could never do now

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
because I'm too well-educated.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And there's something wonderful about
