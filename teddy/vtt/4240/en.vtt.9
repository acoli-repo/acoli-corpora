00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
the way I looked at design and the way I looked at the world was,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
what was going on around me

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and the things that came at the time I walked into design

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
were the enemy.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I really, really, really hated

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
the typeface Helvetica.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I thought the typeface Helvetica

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
was the cleanest, most boring, most fascistic,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
really repressive typeface,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and I hated everything that was designed in Helvetica.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And when I was in

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
my college days,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
this was the sort of design

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that was fashionable and popular.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
This is actually quite a lovely book jacket by Rudy de Harak,
