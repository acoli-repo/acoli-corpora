00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
and backlit with fiber optics.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And the architect, Jim Polshek,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
essentially gave me a canvas

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
to play typography out on.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And it was serious play.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
This is the children's museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
made out of completely inexpensive materials.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Extruded typography that's backlit with neon.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Things I never did before, built before.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I just thought they'd be kind of fun to do.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Donors' walls made out of Lucite.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And then, inexpensive signage.
