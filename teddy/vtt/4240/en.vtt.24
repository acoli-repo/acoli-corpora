They're better crafted than the Public Theater was,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and they spend more money on them, but I think

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
that that moment comes and goes.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
The best way to accomplish serious design --

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
which I think we all have the opportunity to do --

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
That doesn't happen very often,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
but it happened to me in the year 2000,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
when for some reason or another,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
a whole pile of different architects

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
started to ask me to design

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
the insides of theaters with them,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
where I would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I'd never done this kind of work before.
