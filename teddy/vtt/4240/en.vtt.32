00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and I went to Pittsburgh and I said,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
"You know, really what you have here

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
are all these underpasses

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
that separate the neighborhood from the center of town.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Why don't you celebrate them, and make the underpasses landmarks?"

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
So I began doing this crazy presentation

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
of these installations --

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
potential installations -- on

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
these underpass bridges,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
and stood up in front of the city council --

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and was a little bit scared,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
I have to admit.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
But I was so utterly unqualified for this project,
