00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Here is a letter of friendly advice.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Be serious, it says.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
What it means, of course, is, be solemn.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Being solemn is easy.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Being serious is hard.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Children almost always begin by being serious,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
which is what makes them so entertaining

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
when compared with adults as a class.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Adults, on the whole, are solemn.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
In politics, the rare candidate who is serious,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
like Adlai Stevenson,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn, like Eisenhower.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That's because it is hard for most people

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to recognize seriousness, which is rare,
