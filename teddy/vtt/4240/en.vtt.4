00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing Tiffany's,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
is serious.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
(Laughter)

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now, when I apply Russell Baker's definition

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
of solemnity or seriousness to design,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Serious design, serious play,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is something else.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
For one thing, it often happens

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
spontaneously, intuitively,
