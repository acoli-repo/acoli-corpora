00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And first I was praised for it, then criticized for it,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
but the fact of the matter was, I had become solemn.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I didn't do what I think

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
was a piece of serious work again for about 14 years.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I spent most of the '80s being quite solemn,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
turning out these sorts of designs

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
that I was expected to do

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
because that's who I was,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and I was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
to hackneyed to dead, and getting rediscovered all over again.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So, here was the second condition

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
for which I think I accomplished some serious play.
