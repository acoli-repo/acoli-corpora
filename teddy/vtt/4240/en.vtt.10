00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that was fashionable and popular.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
This is actually quite a lovely book jacket by Rudy de Harak,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
but I just hated it, because it was designed with Helvetica,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and I made parodies about it.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I just thought it was, you know, completely boring.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
(Laughter)

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So -- so, my goal in life

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
was to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And to do stuff that wasn't made out of Helvetica

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
was actually kind of hard because you had to find it.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And there weren't a lot of books about the history of design

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
in the early 70s. There weren't --

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
there wasn't a plethora of design publishing.
