00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and so that anything you do is a learning experience

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and you're just jumping right up there.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
As you get older, the risers get shallower

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and the steps get wider,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and you start moving along at a slower pace

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
because you're making fewer discoveries.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And as you get older and more decrepit,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
you sort of inch along on this

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
sort of depressing, long staircase,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
leading you into oblivion.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
(Laughter)

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I find it's actually getting really hard to be serious.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I'm hired to be solemn, but I find more and more

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
that I'm solemn when I don't have to be.
