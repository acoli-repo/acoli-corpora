00:03:28.431 --> 00:03:30.745
they'd have to create some extra energy

00:03:30.745 --> 00:03:34.076
to nudge the system 
past its stopping point,

00:03:34.076 --> 00:03:37.596
breaking the first law of thermodynamics.

00:03:37.596 --> 00:03:39.687
There are ones that seem to keep going,

00:03:39.687 --> 00:03:43.148
but in reality, they invariably turn out
to be drawing energy

00:03:43.148 --> 00:03:46.177
from some external source.

00:03:46.177 --> 00:03:48.707
Even if engineers could 
somehow design a machine

00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:51.618
that didn't violate the first law
of thermodynamics,

00:03:51.618 --> 00:03:56.387
it still wouldn't work in the real world
because of the second law.

00:03:56.387 --> 00:03:58.118
The second law of thermodynamics

00:03:58.118 --> 00:04:03.345
tells us that energy tends to spread out
through processes like friction.
