00:03:58.118 --> 00:04:03.345
tells us that energy tends to spread out
through processes like friction.

00:04:03.345 --> 00:04:05.677
Any real machine would have moving parts

00:04:05.677 --> 00:04:08.562
or interactions with air 
or liquid molecules

00:04:08.562 --> 00:04:12.348
that would generate tiny amounts
of friction and heat,

00:04:12.348 --> 00:04:14.635
even in a vacuum.

00:04:14.635 --> 00:04:16.998
That heat is energy escaping,

00:04:16.998 --> 00:04:18.561
and it would keep leeching out,

00:04:18.561 --> 00:04:21.488
reducing the energy available
to move the system itself

00:04:21.488 --> 00:04:25.248
until the machine inevitably stopped.

00:04:25.248 --> 00:04:27.769
So far, these two laws of thermodynamics

00:04:27.769 --> 00:04:31.299
have stymied every idea 
for perpetual motion
