00:00:57.371 --> 00:01:01.179
These devices have captured many
inventors' imaginations

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.470
because they could transform 
our relationship with energy.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.999
For example, if you could build 
a perpetual motion machine

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:12.829
that included humans as part of its
perfectly efficient system,

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.250
it could sustain life indefinitely.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.269
There's just one problem.

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:20.359
They don't work.

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:22.389
Ideas for perpetual motion machines

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:27.410
all violate one or more 
fundamental laws of thermodynamics,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.649
the branch of physics that describes
the relationship

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.540
between different forms of energy.
