00:02:28.105 --> 00:02:30.372
What about a different approach?

00:02:30.372 --> 00:02:33.692
In the 17th century, Robert Boyle
came up with an idea

00:02:33.692 --> 00:02:36.413
for a self-watering pot.

00:02:36.413 --> 00:02:39.303
He theorized that capillary action,

00:02:39.303 --> 00:02:42.032
the attraction 
between liquids and surfaces

00:02:42.032 --> 00:02:44.853
that pulls water through thin tubes,

00:02:44.853 --> 00:02:49.463
might keep the water cycling
around the bowl.

00:02:49.463 --> 00:02:53.013
But if the capillary action is strong
enough to overcome gravity

00:02:53.013 --> 00:02:54.733
and draw the water up,

00:02:54.733 --> 00:02:59.294
it would also prevent it from falling
back into the bowl.

00:02:59.294 --> 00:03:03.485
Then there are versions with magnets,
like this set of ramps.
