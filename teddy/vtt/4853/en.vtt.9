00:04:27.769 --> 00:04:31.299
have stymied every idea 
for perpetual motion

00:04:31.299 --> 00:04:36.639
and the dreams of perfectly efficient
energy generation they imply.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.748
Yet it's hard to conclusively say we'll
never discover a perpetual motion machine

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:46.550
because there's still so much we don't
understand about the universe.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.313
Perhaps we'll find 
new exotic forms of matter

00:04:49.313 --> 00:04:53.340
that'll force us to revisit the laws
of thermodynamics.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.600
Or maybe there's perpetual motion
on tiny quantum scales.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.730
What we can be reasonably sure about
is that we'll never stop looking.
