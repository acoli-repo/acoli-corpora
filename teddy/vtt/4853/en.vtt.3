00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.540
between different forms of energy.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.440
The first law of thermodynamics says
that energy can't be created or destroyed.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.580
You can't get out more energy
than you put in.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.461
That rules out a useful
perpetual motion machine right away

00:01:45.461 --> 00:01:50.381
because a machine could only ever
produce as much energy as it consumed.

00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:54.751
There wouldn't be any left over
to power a car or charge a phone.

00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:59.501
But what if you just wanted the machine
to keep itself moving?

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:01.881
Inventors have proposed plenty of ideas.
