00:02:59.294 --> 00:03:03.485
Then there are versions with magnets,
like this set of ramps.

00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:07.364
The ball is supposed to be pulled
upwards by the magnet at the top,

00:03:07.364 --> 00:03:09.175
fall back down through the hole,

00:03:09.175 --> 00:03:11.352
and repeat the cycle.

00:03:11.352 --> 00:03:14.396
This one fails because like
the self-watering pot,

00:03:14.396 --> 00:03:18.176
the magnet would simply hold
the ball at the top.

00:03:18.176 --> 00:03:20.435
Even if it somehow did keep moving,

00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:23.176
the magnet's strength 
would degrade over time

00:03:23.176 --> 00:03:25.897
and eventually stop working.

00:03:25.897 --> 00:03:28.431
For each of these machines to keep moving,

00:03:28.431 --> 00:03:30.745
they'd have to create some extra energy
