00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:01.881
Inventors have proposed plenty of ideas.

00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:06.951
Several of these have been variations
on Bhaskara's over-balanced wheel

00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:11.582
with rolling balls 
or weights on swinging arms.

00:02:11.582 --> 00:02:13.241
None of them work.

00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:16.081
The moving parts that make one
side of the wheel heavier

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:21.243
also shift its center of mass downward
below the axle.

00:02:21.243 --> 00:02:22.753
With a low center of mass,

00:02:22.753 --> 00:02:26.052
the wheel just swings back and forth
like a pendulum,

00:02:26.052 --> 00:02:28.105
then stops.

00:02:28.105 --> 00:02:30.372
What about a different approach?
