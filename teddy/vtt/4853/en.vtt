00:00:08.306 --> 00:00:11.045
Around 1159 A.D.,

00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:13.626
a mathematician called 
Bhaskara the Learned

00:00:13.626 --> 00:00:19.996
sketched a design for a wheel
containing curved reservoirs of mercury.

00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:22.179
He reasoned that as the wheels spun,

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.797
the mercury would flow to the bottom
of each reservoir,

00:00:25.797 --> 00:00:30.217
leaving one side of the wheel
perpetually heavier than the other.
