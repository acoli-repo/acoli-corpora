00:03:57.965 --> 00:04:02.511
So I went to Mexico
and swam with dolphins underwater.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.632
And then the cool thing
that I did also that year

00:04:05.656 --> 00:04:07.745
that was my mountain

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.659
was I wrote my book,

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:11.735
"I'm Judging You: The Do-Better Manual,"

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:12.912
And I had to own --

00:04:12.936 --> 00:04:13.950
(Applause)

00:04:13.974 --> 00:04:15.771
that whole writing thing now, right?

00:04:15.795 --> 00:04:17.038
Yes.

00:04:17.062 --> 00:04:20.090
But the very anti-me thing
that I did that year

00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:21.906
that scared the crap out of me --

00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:24.410
I went skydiving.

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.347
We're about to fall out of the plane.

00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:30.831
I was like, "I've done some stupid
things in life. This is one of them."
