00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:30.831
I was like, "I've done some stupid
things in life. This is one of them."

00:04:30.855 --> 00:04:31.858
(Laughter)

00:04:31.882 --> 00:04:33.806
And then we come falling down to Earth,

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.073
and I literally lose my breath
as I see Earth, and I was like,

00:04:37.097 --> 00:04:39.747
"I just fell out of a perfectly good
plane on purpose."

00:04:39.771 --> 00:04:40.795
(Laughter)

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:42.261
"What is wrong with me?!"

00:04:42.285 --> 00:04:44.201
But then I looked down at the beauty,

00:04:44.225 --> 00:04:46.975
and I was like, "This is
the best thing I could have done.

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:49.232
This was an amazing decision."

00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:52.105
And I think about the times
when I have to speak truth.

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:55.440
It feels like I am falling
out of that plane.

00:04:55.464 --> 00:04:58.319
It feels like that moment
when I'm at the edge of the plane,

00:04:58.343 --> 00:05:00.206
and I'm like, "You shouldn't do this,"
