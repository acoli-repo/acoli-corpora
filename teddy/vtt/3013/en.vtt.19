00:09:30.011 --> 00:09:32.412
When it's time to say these hard things,

00:09:32.436 --> 00:09:34.074
I ask myself three things.

00:09:34.098 --> 00:09:35.937
One: Did you mean it?

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:38.626
Two: Can you defend it?

00:09:39.221 --> 00:09:41.344
Three: Did you say it with love?

00:09:41.368 --> 00:09:43.600
If the answer is yes to all three,

00:09:43.624 --> 00:09:45.481
I say it and let the chips fall.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:48.696
That's important.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.245
That checkpoint with myself

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:52.975
always tells me, "Yes,
you're supposed to do this."

00:09:54.595 --> 00:09:56.980
Telling the truth --
telling thoughtful truths --

00:09:57.004 --> 00:09:58.788
should not be a revolutionary act.
