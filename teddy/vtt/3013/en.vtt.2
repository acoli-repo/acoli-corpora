Being the domino, for me,
looks like speaking up

00:01:03.327 --> 00:01:05.564
and doing the things
that are really difficult,

00:01:05.588 --> 00:01:07.683
especially when they are needed,

00:01:07.707 --> 00:01:10.069
with the hope that others
will follow suit.

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:13.600

00:01:13.624 --> 00:01:17.081

00:01:17.105 --> 00:01:19.872

00:01:19.896 --> 00:01:21.874

00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:23.056
We're not fearless.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.554
We're not unafraid of the consequences

00:01:25.578 --> 00:01:27.788
or the sacrifices that we have to make

00:01:27.812 --> 00:01:29.808
by speaking truth to power.

00:01:29.832 --> 00:01:32.031
What happens is, we feel like we have to,
