00:08:56.006 --> 00:09:01.597
Now, being the domino sometimes
comes down to being exactly who you are.

00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:05.175
So, I've been a shady somebody
since I was three.

00:09:05.199 --> 00:09:06.278
(Laughter)

00:09:06.302 --> 00:09:07.978
This is me on my third birthday.

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:11.267
But I've been this girl all my life,

00:09:11.291 --> 00:09:13.360
and I feel like
even that's been the domino,

00:09:13.384 --> 00:09:15.684
because in a world
that wants us to walk around

00:09:15.708 --> 00:09:17.548
as representatives of ourselves,

00:09:17.572 --> 00:09:19.832
being yourself can be a revolutionary act.

00:09:20.428 --> 00:09:22.781
And in a world that wants us to whisper,

00:09:22.805 --> 00:09:24.359
I choose to yell.

00:09:25.001 --> 00:09:29.987
(Applause)
