00:02:01.115 --> 00:02:04.183
I got the first and last D
of my academic career.

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:05.881
(Laughter)

00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:08.477
So I went to my advisor, and I was like,

00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:10.755
"OK, let's drop the premed,

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:13.002
because this doctor thing
is not going to work,

00:02:13.026 --> 00:02:14.770
because I don't even like hospitals.

00:02:14.794 --> 00:02:15.945
So ..."

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.000
(Laughter)

00:02:17.024 --> 00:02:19.152
"Let's just consider that done for."

00:02:19.728 --> 00:02:22.148
And that same semester,
I started blogging.

00:02:22.172 --> 00:02:23.601
That was 2003.

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:26.484
So as that one dream was ending,
another was beginning.

00:02:26.508 --> 00:02:30.077
And then what was a cute hobby
became my full-time job
