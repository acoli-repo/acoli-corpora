00:06:00.483 --> 00:06:03.295
But besides that, with these
as my core values,

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:04.594
I have to speak the truth.

00:06:04.618 --> 00:06:06.473
I have no other choice in the matter.

00:06:06.497 --> 00:06:08.890
But people like me,
the professional troublemakers,

00:06:08.914 --> 00:06:12.213
should not be the only ones who are
committed to being these dominoes

00:06:12.237 --> 00:06:13.974
who are always falling out of planes

00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:15.933
or being the first one to take this hit.

00:06:15.957 --> 00:06:18.286
People are so afraid
of these acute consequences,

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.362
not realizing that there are many times
when we walk in rooms

00:06:21.386 --> 00:06:24.375
and we are some of the most
powerful people in those rooms --

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:27.162
we might be the second-most powerful,
third-most powerful.

00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:30.043
And I firmly believe
that our job in those times
