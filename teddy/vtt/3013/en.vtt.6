00:02:59.858 --> 00:03:04.050
of keeping us from doing and saying
the things that are our purpose.

00:03:04.822 --> 00:03:06.496
And I was like, "You know what?

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.122
I'm not going to let fear rule my life.

00:03:09.146 --> 00:03:12.568
I'm not going to let fear
dictate what I do."

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:15.576
And then all of these
awesome things started happening,

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.179
and dominoes started to fall.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.529
So when I realized that,
I was like, "OK, 2015,

00:03:20.553 --> 00:03:21.818
I turned 30,

00:03:21.842 --> 00:03:24.030
it's going to be my year
of 'Do it anyway.'

00:03:24.054 --> 00:03:27.079
Anything that scares me,
I'm going to actively pursue it."

00:03:27.667 --> 00:03:29.857
So, I'm a Capricorn.

00:03:29.881 --> 00:03:32.003
I like my feel solidly on the ground.
