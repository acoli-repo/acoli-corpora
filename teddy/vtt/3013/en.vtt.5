00:02:26.508 --> 00:02:30.077
And then what was a cute hobby
became my full-time job

00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:32.996
when I lost my marketing job in 2010.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.394
But it still took me two more years
to say, "I'm a writer."

00:02:36.418 --> 00:02:41.636
Nine years after I had started writing,
before I said, "I'm a writer,"

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.459
because I was afraid of what happens

00:02:44.483 --> 00:02:46.499
without 401ks,

00:02:46.523 --> 00:02:49.031
without, "How am I going
to keep up my shoe habit?

00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:50.221
That's important to me."

00:02:50.245 --> 00:02:51.364
(Laughter)

00:02:51.388 --> 00:02:54.383
So it took me that long to own this thing

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:56.041
that was what my purpose was.

00:02:56.065 --> 00:02:57.500
And then I realized,

00:02:57.524 --> 00:02:59.834
fear has a very concrete power

00:02:59.858 --> 00:03:04.050
of keeping us from doing and saying
the things that are our purpose.
