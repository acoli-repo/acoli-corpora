00:10:00.267 --> 00:10:03.624
Speaking truths to power
should not be sacrificial, but they are.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.558
But I think if more of us chose
to do this for the greater good,

00:10:07.582 --> 00:10:09.882
we'd be in better spaces
than we are right now.

00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:12.789
Speaking of the greater good,

00:10:13.438 --> 00:10:16.870
I think we commit ourselves
to telling truths to build bridges

00:10:16.894 --> 00:10:18.371
to common ground,

00:10:18.395 --> 00:10:21.607
and bridges that aren't based
on truth will collapse.

00:10:21.631 --> 00:10:23.492
So it is our job,

00:10:23.516 --> 00:10:26.844
it is our obligation, it is our duty

00:10:26.868 --> 00:10:29.040
to speak truth to power, to be the domino,

00:10:29.883 --> 00:10:31.502
not just when it's difficult --
