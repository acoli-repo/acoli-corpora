00:06:27.186 --> 00:06:30.043
And I firmly believe
that our job in those times

00:06:30.067 --> 00:06:32.116
is to disrupt what is happening.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.239
And then if we're not the most powerful,

00:06:34.263 --> 00:06:36.489
if two more of us band together,

00:06:36.513 --> 00:06:37.970
it makes us powerful.

00:06:37.994 --> 00:06:40.457
It's like cosigning
the woman in the meeting,

00:06:40.481 --> 00:06:43.376
you know, the woman
who can't seem to get her word out,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.804
or just making sure that other person
who can't make a point

00:06:46.828 --> 00:06:48.137
is being heard.

00:06:48.161 --> 00:06:51.415
Our job is to make sure
they have room for that.

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:53.547
Everyone's well-being
is community business.

00:06:53.571 --> 00:06:55.794
If we made that a point,
we'd understand that,

00:06:55.818 --> 00:06:57.480
for the times when we need help,

00:06:57.504 --> 00:06:59.455
we wouldn't have to look around so hard

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:01.815
if we made sure
we were somebody else's help.
