00:04:58.343 --> 00:05:00.206
and I'm like, "You shouldn't do this,"

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.868
but then I do it anyway,
because I realize I have to.

00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:05.360
Sitting at the edge of that plane

00:05:05.384 --> 00:05:08.178
and kind of staying on that plane
is comfort to me.

00:05:08.202 --> 00:05:10.511
And I feel like every day
that I'm speaking truth

00:05:10.535 --> 00:05:13.334
against institutions and people
who are bigger than me

00:05:13.358 --> 00:05:15.687
and just forces that are
more powerful than me,

00:05:15.711 --> 00:05:17.770
I feel like I'm falling out of that plane.

00:05:17.794 --> 00:05:19.900
But I realize comfort is overrated.

00:05:19.924 --> 00:05:22.634
Because being quiet is comfortable.

00:05:22.658 --> 00:05:25.979
Keeping things the way
they've been is comfortable.

00:05:26.003 --> 00:05:28.699
And all comfort has done
is maintain the status quo.

00:05:28.723 --> 00:05:31.405
So we've got to get comfortable
with being uncomfortable
