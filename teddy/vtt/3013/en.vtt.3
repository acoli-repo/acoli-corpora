00:01:29.832 --> 00:01:32.031
What happens is, we feel like we have to,

00:01:32.055 --> 00:01:34.658
because there are too few
people in the world

00:01:34.682 --> 00:01:36.309
willing to be the domino,

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.691
too few people willing to take that fall.

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:40.437
We're not doing it without fear.

00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:41.833
Now, let's talk about fear.

00:01:42.406 --> 00:01:44.741
I knew exactly what I wanted
to be when I grew up.

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:46.703
I was like, "I'm going to be a doctor!"

00:01:46.727 --> 00:01:48.289
Doctor Luvvie was the dream.

00:01:48.876 --> 00:01:51.129
I was Doc McStuffins
before it was a thing.

00:01:51.153 --> 00:01:52.352
(Laughter)

00:01:52.376 --> 00:01:54.583
And I remember when I went to college,

00:01:54.607 --> 00:01:58.313
my freshman year,
I had to take Chemistry 101

00:01:58.337 --> 00:01:59.726
for my premed major.
