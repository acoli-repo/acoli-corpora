00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:01.815
if we made sure
we were somebody else's help.

00:07:02.313 --> 00:07:04.083
And there are times when I feel like

00:07:04.107 --> 00:07:08.127
I have taken very public
tumbles and falls,

00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:10.832
like the time when I was asked
to speak at a conference,

00:07:10.856 --> 00:07:13.849
and they wanted me to pay my way there.

00:07:14.341 --> 00:07:15.704
And then I did some research

00:07:15.728 --> 00:07:18.831
and found out the white men
who spoke there got compensated

00:07:18.855 --> 00:07:20.752
and got their travel paid for.

00:07:20.776 --> 00:07:23.800
The white women who spoke there
got their travel paid for.

00:07:23.824 --> 00:07:28.106
The black women who spoke there were
expected to actually pay to speak there.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.828
And I was like, "What do I do?"
