00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and it was a really cool device.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You could play games with it. You could program it in BASIC.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And I was fascinated.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
between the memory, the RAM and the ALU,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the arithmetic and logic unit.
