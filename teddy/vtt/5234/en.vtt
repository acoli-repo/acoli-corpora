How is it that so many
intergalactic species in movies and TV

00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:12.704
just happen to speak perfect English?

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.704
The short answer is that no one
wants to watch a starship crew

00:00:15.746 --> 00:00:19.954
spend years compiling an alien dictionary.

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:22.954
But to keep things consistent,

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:25.996
the creators of Star Trek
and other science-fiction worlds

00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:28.871
have introduced the concept
of a universal translator,

00:00:28.913 --> 00:00:33.121
a portable device that can instantly
translate between any languages.
