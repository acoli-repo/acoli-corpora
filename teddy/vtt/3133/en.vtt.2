00:00:59.577 --> 00:01:02.172
It's like the six degrees of separation,

00:01:02.196 --> 00:01:03.506
but with research.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.679
(Laughter)

00:01:04.703 --> 00:01:08.006
So, when I said I read a study,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.198
what I actually read was 59 characters
that summarized 10 years of research.

00:01:14.222 --> 00:01:16.155
(Laughter)

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:18.942
So, when I said I read a study,

00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:22.054
I was reading fractions of the study

00:01:22.078 --> 00:01:24.799
that were put together
by four different writers

00:01:24.823 --> 00:01:26.720
that were not the author,

00:01:26.744 --> 00:01:28.077
before it got to me.

00:01:28.823 --> 00:01:30.387
That doesn't seem right.
