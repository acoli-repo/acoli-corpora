Do you ever find yourself
referencing a study in conversation

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:08.547
that you didn't actually read?

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:10.609
(Laughter)

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:13.306
I was having coffee
with a friend of mine the other day,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.985
and I said, "You know, I read a new study

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.178
that says coffee reduces
the risk of depression in women."

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:25.135
But really, what I read was a tweet.

00:00:25.476 --> 00:00:27.104
(Laughter)

00:00:27.128 --> 00:00:28.307
That said --

00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:29.498
(Laughter)

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:33.678
"A new study says drinking coffee
may decrease depression risk in women."
