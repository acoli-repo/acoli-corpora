00:01:59.087 --> 00:02:00.934
So, how did we get here?

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:05.903
To understand why scholars
aren't engaging with popular media,

00:02:05.927 --> 00:02:08.720
you first have to understand
how universities work.

00:02:09.497 --> 00:02:10.814
Now, in the last six years,

00:02:10.838 --> 00:02:13.458
I've taught at seven
different colleges and universities

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:14.743
in four different states.

00:02:15.473 --> 00:02:17.355
I'm a bit of an adjunct extraordinaire.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.417
(Laughter)

00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:21.028
And at the same time, I'm pursuing my PhD.

00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:23.807
In all of these different institutions,

00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:26.866
the research and publication process
works the same way.

00:02:27.232 --> 00:02:30.533
First, scholars produce
research in their fields.
