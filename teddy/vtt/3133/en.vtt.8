00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.346
And I bet you can see the irony here.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.403
If the public is funding
academics' research,

00:04:03.427 --> 00:04:06.399
but then we have to pay again
to access the results,

00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:09.648
it's like we're paying for it twice.

00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:12.164
And the other major problem

00:04:12.188 --> 00:04:14.911
is that most academics
don't have a whole lot of incentive

00:04:14.935 --> 00:04:18.207
to publish outside of these prestigious
subscription-based journals.

00:04:18.988 --> 00:04:21.569
Universities build their tenure
and promotion systems

00:04:21.593 --> 00:04:23.993
around the number of times
scholars publish.

00:04:24.338 --> 00:04:28.593
So, books and journal articles are kind of
like a form of currency for scholars.

00:04:28.617 --> 00:04:32.807
Publishing articles helps you get tenure
and more research grants down the road.
