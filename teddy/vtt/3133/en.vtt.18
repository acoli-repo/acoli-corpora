It's about shifting academic culture
from publishing to practice

00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:04.521
and from talking to doing.

00:09:05.458 --> 00:09:09.188
And you should know
that this idea, this hope --

00:09:09.212 --> 00:09:11.146
it doesn't just belong to me.

00:09:11.743 --> 00:09:15.672
I'm standing on the shoulders
of many scholars, teachers,

00:09:15.696 --> 00:09:18.672
librarians and community members

00:09:18.696 --> 00:09:22.117
who also advocate for including
more people in the conversation.

00:09:22.912 --> 00:09:25.516
I hope you join our conversation, too.

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.706
Thank you.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:31.182
