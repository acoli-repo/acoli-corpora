First, scholars produce
research in their fields.

00:02:30.557 --> 00:02:34.708
To fund their research,
they apply for public and private grants

00:02:34.732 --> 00:02:36.410
and after the research is finished,

00:02:36.434 --> 00:02:38.569
they write a paper about their findings.

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.855
Then they submit that paper
to relevant academic journals.

00:02:42.807 --> 00:02:45.180
Then it goes through a process
called peer review,

00:02:45.204 --> 00:02:47.204
which essentially means that other experts

00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:49.324
are checking it
for accuracy and credibility.

00:02:50.553 --> 00:02:52.886
And then, once it's published,

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.006
for-profit companies
resell that information

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.998
back to universities and public libraries

00:02:58.022 --> 00:03:00.223
through journal
and database subscriptions.
