Now, as a PhD student,

00:08:03.133 --> 00:08:06.366
I realize I'm critiquing
the club I want to join.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:07.649
(Laughter)

00:08:07.673 --> 00:08:09.276
Which is a dangerous thing to do,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.674
since I'm going to be on the academic
job market in a couple of years.

00:08:13.347 --> 00:08:16.809
But if the status quo in academic research

00:08:16.833 --> 00:08:19.657
is to publish in the echo chambers
of for-profit journals

00:08:19.681 --> 00:08:22.053
that never reach the public,

00:08:22.077 --> 00:08:25.014
you better believe
my answer is going to be "nope."

00:08:26.085 --> 00:08:29.514
I believe in inclusive,
democratic research

00:08:29.538 --> 00:08:33.203
that works in the community
and talks with the public.
