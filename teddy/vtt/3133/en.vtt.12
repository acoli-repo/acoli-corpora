So, let's talk about translation.

00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:08.847
I don't envision this translation to look
like the six degrees of separation

00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:10.394
that I illustrated earlier.

00:06:11.847 --> 00:06:15.935
Instead, what if scholars were able
to take the research that they're doing

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.800
and translate it on popular media

00:06:17.824 --> 00:06:20.357
and be able to engage with the public?

00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:23.037
If scholars did this,

00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:26.315
the degrees of separation
between the public and research

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:27.806
would shrink by a lot.

00:06:28.276 --> 00:06:32.212
So, you see, I'm not suggesting
a dumbing-down of the research.
