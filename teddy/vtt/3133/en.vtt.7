00:03:30.498 --> 00:03:32.617
According to the National
Science Foundation,

00:03:32.641 --> 00:03:35.783
29 percent of that
goes to public research universities.

00:03:35.807 --> 00:03:41.045
So, if you're quick at math,
that's 17.4 billion dollars.

00:03:41.707 --> 00:03:42.873
Tax dollars.

00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:46.001
And just five corporations are responsible

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:48.619
for distributing most
publicly funded research.

00:03:48.643 --> 00:03:54.881
In 2014, just one of those companies
made 1.5 billion dollars in profit.

00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:56.838
It's a big business.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.346
And I bet you can see the irony here.
