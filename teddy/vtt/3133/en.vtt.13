00:06:28.276 --> 00:06:32.212
So, you see, I'm not suggesting
a dumbing-down of the research.

00:06:32.236 --> 00:06:35.443
I'm just suggesting that we give
the public access to that research

00:06:35.467 --> 00:06:39.403
and that we shift the venue
and focus on using plain language

00:06:39.427 --> 00:06:42.117
so that the public
who's paying for the research

00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:43.942
can also consume it.

00:06:45.395 --> 00:06:48.026
And there are some other benefits
to this approach.

00:06:49.427 --> 00:06:52.290
By showing the public
how their tax dollars

00:06:52.314 --> 00:06:54.458
are being used to fund research,

00:06:54.482 --> 00:06:57.736
they can begin to redefine
universities' identities

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.720
so that universities' identities
are not just based on a football team
