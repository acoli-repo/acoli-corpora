00:01:28.823 --> 00:01:30.387
That doesn't seem right.

00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:34.045
But accessing original
research is difficult,

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:37.965
because academics aren't regularly
engaging with popular media.

00:01:38.982 --> 00:01:40.728
And you might be asking yourself,

00:01:40.752 --> 00:01:43.561
why aren't academics engaging
with popular media?

00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:46.553
It seems like they'd be
a more legitimate source of information

00:01:46.577 --> 00:01:47.910
than the media pundits.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.910
Right?

00:01:49.934 --> 00:01:51.085
(Laughter)

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:54.680
In a country with over
4,100 colleges and universities,

00:01:54.704 --> 00:01:56.656
it feels like this should be the norm.

00:01:57.513 --> 00:01:58.663
But it's not.

00:01:59.087 --> 00:02:00.934
So, how did we get here?
