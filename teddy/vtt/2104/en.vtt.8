00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
For example, for the first time, a few years ago,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
by simply collecting little fecal samples

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
we were able to have them analyzed -- to have DNA profiling done --

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
so for the first time, we actually know which male chimps

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
are the fathers of each individual infant.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So this opens up a whole new avenue of research.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And we use GSI -- geographic whatever it is, GSI --
