00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
The one thing we have, which makes us so different

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
from chimpanzees or other living creatures,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
is this sophisticated spoken language --

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
a language with which we can tell children

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
about things that aren't here.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
We can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
discuss ideas with each other,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
We can do it by talking to each other;

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
we can do it through video; we can do it through the written word.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards,
