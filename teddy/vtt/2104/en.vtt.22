studying emotions in animals, studying personalities in animals.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
can recognize themselves in mirrors -- "self" as opposed to "other."

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
They have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
But this teaches us a new respect -- and it's a new respect

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
not only for the chimpanzees, I suggest,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet.
