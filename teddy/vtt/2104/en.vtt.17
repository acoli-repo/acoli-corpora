00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
there are completely different tool-using behaviors.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And because it seems that these patterns are passed

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
from one generation to the next, through observation,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
imitation and practice -- that is a definition of human culture.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
What we find is that over these 40-odd years

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
that I and others have been studying chimpanzees

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and the other great apes, and, as I say, other mammals

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
with complex brains and social systems,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
we have found that after all, there isn't a sharp line

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom.
