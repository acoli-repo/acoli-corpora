00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And we use GSI -- geographic whatever it is, GSI --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
to determine the range of the chimps.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And we're using -- you can see that I'm not really into this kind of stuff --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
but we're using satellite imagery

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
to look at the deforestation in the area.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And of course, there's developments in infrared,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
so you can watch animals at night,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and equipment for recording by video,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
and tape recording is getting lighter and better.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So in many, many ways, we can do things today
