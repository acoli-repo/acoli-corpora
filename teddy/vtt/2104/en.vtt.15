Anyway, David Greybeard -- and I saw that

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
he was picking little pieces of grass and using them

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
to fish termites from their underground nest.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and strip the leaves --

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose --

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
the beginning of tool-making.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
is at that time, it was thought that humans,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and only humans, used and made tools.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
When I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker.
