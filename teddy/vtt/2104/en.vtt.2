a world that isn't polluted.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
with what we're all talking about here at TED,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
is that there, right in the middle of this rainforest,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
was some solar panels -- the first in that part of Ecuador --

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and that was mainly to bring water up by pump

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
so that the women wouldn't have to go down.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
they were able to store a lot of electricity.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So every house -- and there were, I think, eight houses

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in this little community -- could have light

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
for, I think it was about half an hour each evening.
