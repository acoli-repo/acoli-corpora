And it's not sustainable, and the huge logging camps in the forest

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
are now demanding meat, so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
who've lived there with their wonderful way of living

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
They're given weapons; they shoot for the logging camps; they get money.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Their culture is being destroyed,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
along with the animals upon whom they depend.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
So, when the logging camp moves, there's nothing left.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and I've seen it happening with my own eyes.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And the grim picture in Africa -- I love Africa,
