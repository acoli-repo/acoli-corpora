00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So in many, many ways, we can do things today

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that we couldn't do when I began in 1960.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Especially when chimpanzees, and other animals

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
with large brains, are studied in captivity,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
modern technology is helping us to search

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So that we know today, they're capable of performances

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
that would have been thought absolutely impossible

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
by science when I began.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled
