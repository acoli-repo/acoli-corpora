We've talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by Wade Davis

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
about the different cultures of the humans around the world --

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
but the world is not composed only of human beings;

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
there are also other animal beings.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And I propose to bring into this TED conference,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
as I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Too often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
but these beings have voices that mean something.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And so, I want to give you a greeting,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania --

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
