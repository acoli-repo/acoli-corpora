When I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So that when Louis Leakey, my mentor, heard this news,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
he said, "Ah, we must now redefine 'man,' redefine 'tool,'

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
or accept chimpanzees as humans."

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
(Laughter)

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Moreover, we know that in different parts of Africa,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
wherever chimps have been studied,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
there are completely different tool-using behaviors.
