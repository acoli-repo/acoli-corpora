Informed by his Arctic exploration,

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.310
he drew on both Inuit and 
Norwegian experience,

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.360
arriving with a small team of
men and more than a hundred dogs.


00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.570
His explorers were clothed
in sealskin and furs,

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.728
as well as specially
designed skis and boots.

00:02:18.728 --> 00:02:21.348

00:02:21.348 --> 00:02:24.898
Launching an extensive scientific 
research expedition,

00:02:24.898 --> 00:02:28.118
he traveled with over three times 
more men than Amundsen,

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:32.619
alongside over 30 dogs, 
19 Siberian ponies,
