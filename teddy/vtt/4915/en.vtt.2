news came that the American explorers
Frederick Cook and Robert Peary

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.570
had staked rival claims
to the achievement.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.090
Instead of abandoning the planned voyage,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.690
Amundsen decided to alter its course to
what he called “the last great problem.”

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.930
But Amundsen’s crew weren’t 
the only ones kept in the dark.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.190
British naval officer Robert F. Scott had
already visited the Antarctic,

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.090
and was leading his own 
South Pole expedition.
