00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.669
To avoid the ambiguity that surrounded
Cook and Peary’s North Pole claims,

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.579
Amundsen’s team traversed
the area in a grid

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.699

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:38.609
Along with flags and a tent marker,

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:44.029
they left a letter for Scott, which would
not be found until over a month later.

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:46.301

the least of their problems. 


00:03:49.161 --> 00:03:53.901
On the way back towards the camp,

00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:56.101
starvation, and exhaustion.

00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:59.341
The remaining explorers hoped for a
prearranged rendezvous

00:03:59.341 --> 00:04:01.111
with a team sent from their base,
