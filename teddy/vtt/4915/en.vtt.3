that Amundsen was also heading south.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.640
Reluctantly, Scott found himself pitted
against the Norwegian

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.540
in what the newspapers 
called a ‘race to the Pole.’

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.910

it was a strange one.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.130
The expeditions left at different times
from different locations,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.750
and they had very different 
plans for the journey.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.010
Amundsen was focused solely
on reaching the Pole.
