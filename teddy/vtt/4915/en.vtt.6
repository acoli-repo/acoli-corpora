Scott’s team traveled

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.799
following the path of Ernest Shackleton's
earlier attempt to reach the pole.

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.549
But although this course had been
documented, it proved slow and laborious.

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.149
Meanwhile, despite an initial false start,

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:17.119
Amundsen’s five-man team made good time
using a previously uncharted route

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:20.139
through the same Transantarctic Mountains.


00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.939
They stayed ahead of Scott’s team,

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.669
and on December 14, arrived first
at their desolate destination.

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.669
To avoid the ambiguity that surrounded
Cook and Peary’s North Pole claims,
