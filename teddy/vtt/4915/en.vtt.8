00:03:59.341 --> 00:04:01.111
with a team sent from their base,

00:04:01.111 --> 00:04:05.471
but due to a series of mishaps, 
misjudgements and miscommunications,

00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:07.571
their rescue never arrived.

00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:12.851
Their remains, along with Scott’s diary,
would not be found until spring.

00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:15.612
Today, scientists from various countries


00:04:15.612 --> 00:04:18.732
live and work at Antarctic 
research stations.

00:04:18.732 --> 00:04:22.092
But the journeys of these early
explorers are not forgotten.

00:04:22.092 --> 00:04:25.892
Despite their divergent fates,
they are forever joined in history,


00:04:25.892 --> 00:04:29.550
and in the name of the research
base that marks the South Pole.
