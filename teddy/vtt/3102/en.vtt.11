00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:32.583
When I was thinking through this,
I began to understand

00:05:32.607 --> 00:05:35.082
why I was feeling stressed out
in the first place.

00:05:35.506 --> 00:05:38.022
Instead of working in harmony
with my environment,

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.712
I was working against it.

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:41.867
I was forcing things to change

00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:45.915
because I was consumed
by the need to succeed or to prove myself.

00:05:46.616 --> 00:05:48.251
In the end, nothing did.

00:05:48.775 --> 00:05:50.322
And I got more frustrated.

00:05:51.211 --> 00:05:54.656
By simply shifting my focus
from trying to achieve more success

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.426
to trying to achieve more harmony,

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.920
I was immediately able
to feel calm and focused again.
