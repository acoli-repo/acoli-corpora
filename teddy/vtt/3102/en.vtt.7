It doesn't actually draw
any attention to itself,

00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:34.356
nor does it need
any reward or recognition.

00:03:35.442 --> 00:03:36.710
It is humble.

00:03:37.792 --> 00:03:40.291
But without water's humble contribution,

00:03:40.315 --> 00:03:42.848
life as we know it may not exist.

00:03:45.103 --> 00:03:47.692
Water's humility taught me
a few important things.

00:03:48.492 --> 00:03:52.000
It taught me that instead of acting
like I know what I'm doing

00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:53.720
or I have all the answers,

00:03:53.744 --> 00:03:55.799
it's perfectly OK to say,

00:03:55.823 --> 00:03:57.188
"I don't know.

00:03:57.212 --> 00:03:58.609
I want to learn more,

00:03:58.633 --> 00:03:59.885
and I need your help."
