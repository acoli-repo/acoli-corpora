00:00:59.627 --> 00:01:01.603
or maybe even faster?

00:01:03.516 --> 00:01:05.167
I started looking for answers.

00:01:05.594 --> 00:01:08.397
I spoke to many people,
I spoke to my friends,

00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:09.895
I spoke to my family.

00:01:09.919 --> 00:01:12.288
I even read many self-help books.

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:16.005
But I couldn't find anything satisfactory.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.950
In fact, the more self-help books I read,

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:21.479
the more stressed and anxious I became.

00:01:21.503 --> 00:01:22.649
(Laughter)

00:01:22.673 --> 00:01:25.974
It was like I was feeding
my mind with junk food,

00:01:25.998 --> 00:01:28.763
and I was becoming mentally obese.

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:30.823
(Laughter)
