00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.288
the next day starts all over again.

00:00:32.272 --> 00:00:34.780
That was how I felt two years ago.

00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:38.452
I felt stressed; I felt anxious.

00:00:38.916 --> 00:00:40.473
I felt a bit trapped.

00:00:41.457 --> 00:00:44.457
The world around me
was moving very quickly.

00:00:45.431 --> 00:00:47.365
And I didn't know what to do.

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.656
I started wondering to myself:

00:00:50.205 --> 00:00:51.776
How do I keep up with all this?

00:00:52.257 --> 00:00:54.815
How do we find fulfillment

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.973
in a world that's literally changing
as fast as we can think,

00:00:59.627 --> 00:01:01.603
or maybe even faster?
