00:07:56.902 --> 00:08:00.244
are not the ones with the most
experienced team members,

00:08:00.268 --> 00:08:03.053
but the ones with members
who are open to learn,

00:08:03.077 --> 00:08:04.677
who are open to unlearn

00:08:04.998 --> 00:08:07.117
and who are open to helping each other

00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:09.601
navigate through
the changing circumstances.

00:08:11.244 --> 00:08:13.176

"I will never be able to talk
