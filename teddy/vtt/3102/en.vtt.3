(Laughter)

00:01:30.847 --> 00:01:32.069
I was about to give up,

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:35.528
until one day, I found this.

00:01:36.076 --> 00:01:40.846
"The Tao Te Ching:
The Book of the Way and Its Virtue."

00:01:42.028 --> 00:01:45.172
This is an ancient Chinese
philosophy classic

00:01:45.196 --> 00:01:47.940
that was written
more than 2,600 years ago.

00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:53.334
And it was by far the thinnest
and the smallest book on the bookshelf.

00:01:54.162 --> 00:01:55.859
It only had 81 pages.

00:01:56.488 --> 00:01:58.555
And each page had a short poem.

00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:02.520
I remember I flipped
to one particular poem.
