I've been trying to apply the concepts
in this passage to my day-to-day life.

00:03:04.406 --> 00:03:07.707
And today, I'd like to share with you
three lessons I learned so far

00:03:07.731 --> 00:03:09.580
from this philosophy of water --

00:03:09.604 --> 00:03:13.962
three lessons that I believe
have helped me find greater fulfillment

00:03:13.986 --> 00:03:15.627
in almost everything that I do.

00:03:17.023 --> 00:03:19.540
The first lesson is about humility.

00:03:20.475 --> 00:03:22.785
If we think about water
flowing in a river,

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:24.804
it is always staying low.

00:03:25.847 --> 00:03:28.910
It helps all the plants grow
and keeps all the animals alive.

00:03:29.427 --> 00:03:31.997
It doesn't actually draw
any attention to itself,
