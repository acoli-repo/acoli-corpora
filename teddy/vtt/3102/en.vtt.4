I remember I flipped
to one particular poem.

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:04.358
Here it is.

00:02:04.382 --> 00:02:05.634
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.109
(Laughter)

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:08.412
Let me read it out to you.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.548
"The supreme goodness is like water.

00:02:13.473 --> 00:02:16.245
It benefits all things without contention.

00:02:17.038 --> 00:02:19.564
In dwelling, it stays grounded.

00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:22.688
In being, it flows to depths.

00:02:23.445 --> 00:02:25.603
In expression, it is honest.

00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:29.497
In confrontation, it stays gentle.
