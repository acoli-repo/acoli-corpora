00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.222
You may know this feeling:

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.547
you wake up to multiple unread
notifications on your mobile phone.

00:00:07.532 --> 00:00:09.714
Your calendar is already
packed with meetings,

00:00:09.738 --> 00:00:12.187
sometimes double- or triple-booked.

00:00:12.822 --> 00:00:14.818
You feel engaged, you feel busy.

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:17.328
In fact, you feel productive.

00:00:18.573 --> 00:00:22.966
But at the end of it all,
something still feels missing.

00:00:24.176 --> 00:00:26.203
You try to figure out what it is.

00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:28.506
But before you do,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.288
the next day starts all over again.
