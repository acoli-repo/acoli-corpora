00:07:29.002 --> 00:07:32.356
We also live in a world today
of constant change.

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:36.185
We can no longer expect to work
to a static job description

00:07:36.209 --> 00:07:38.174
or follow a single career path.

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:42.625
We, too, are expected to constantly
reinvent and refresh our skills

00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:43.799
to stay relevant.

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:48.213
In our organization,
we host a lot of hackathons,

00:07:48.237 --> 00:07:50.493
where small groups
or individuals come together

00:07:50.517 --> 00:07:53.259
to solve a business problem
in a compressed time frame.

00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:56.878
And what's interesting to me
is that the teams that usually win

00:07:56.902 --> 00:08:00.244
are not the ones with the most
experienced team members,
