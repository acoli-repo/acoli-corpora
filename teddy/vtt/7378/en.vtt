00:00:00.676 --> 00:00:03.636
When I was a kid growing up
in the Mediterranean,

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:05.956
I was fascinated by the underwater world

00:00:05.996 --> 00:00:08.076
that Jacques Cousteau showed us on TV.

00:00:09.516 --> 00:00:12.796
When he started filming in the mid-1940s,

00:00:12.836 --> 00:00:16.076
the Mediterranean shores
were still full of large fish.

00:00:16.396 --> 00:00:18.956
But when I went to the sea
to swim in the '70s,

00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:20.516
I saw none of that.

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:23.876
There were sea urchins on a barren bottom,

00:00:23.916 --> 00:00:26.436
but I never saw a large fish.

00:00:26.996 --> 00:00:29.676
The industrialization of fishing
after the World War II

00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:33.836
put the latest nail in the coffin
of Mediterranean marine life.
