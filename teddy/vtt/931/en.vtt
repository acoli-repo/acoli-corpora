00:00:00.686 --> 00:00:03.684
So what I want to try to do is tell a quick story

00:00:03.684 --> 00:00:07.394
about a 404 page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it.

00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:10.113
But to start it probably helps to have an understanding

00:00:10.113 --> 00:00:13.625
of what a 404 page actually is.

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:16.731
The 404 page is that.

00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:19.071
It's that broken experience on the Web.

00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:21.382
It's effectively the default page

00:00:21.382 --> 00:00:24.958
when you ask a website for something and it can't find it.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.258
And it serves you the 404 page.

00:00:27.258 --> 00:00:32.083
It's inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it.
