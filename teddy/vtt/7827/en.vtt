00:00:00.836 --> 00:00:05.356
Tropical forests are one of the world's
most important carbon sinks,

00:00:05.396 --> 00:00:08.036
absorbing over one fifth of the emissions

00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:11.036
from burning fossil fuels every year.

00:00:11.556 --> 00:00:13.956
The latest research suggests
that without them

00:00:13.996 --> 00:00:18.196
the world would already be
nearly one degree Celsius hotter.

00:00:18.636 --> 00:00:22.636
We can't solve climate change
without tropical forests.

00:00:22.636 --> 00:00:23.836
But right now,

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:26.876
instead of protecting forests,
we're cutting them down.

00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:29.916
Already, about one sixth
of the Amazon has been lost,

00:00:29.956 --> 00:00:33.276
and some scientists fear
that we're nearing a tipping point
