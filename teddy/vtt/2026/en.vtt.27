00:13:29.274 --> 00:13:33.045
explaining to them how a single person in the bureaucracy

00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:35.176
has the power to make a decision

00:13:35.176 --> 00:13:39.661
about which patent application becomes the next patent,

00:13:39.661 --> 00:13:42.403
and therefore monopolizes for 20 years the rights

00:13:42.403 --> 00:13:45.410
over an entire field of inventive activity.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.322
Well, what did we do? We said, we can make a website,

00:13:48.322 --> 00:13:50.715
we can make an expert network, a social network,

00:13:50.715 --> 00:13:52.987
that would connect the network to the institution

00:13:52.987 --> 00:13:55.368
to allow scientists and technologists to get

00:13:55.368 --> 00:13:58.003
better information to the patent office

00:13:58.003 --> 00:14:00.466
to aid in making those decisions.
