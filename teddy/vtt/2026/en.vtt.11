We might even call them citizens, because they've recently

00:05:31.467 --> 00:05:34.842
risen up to fight against legislative incursion,

00:05:34.842 --> 00:05:37.377
and the citizens of these networks work together

00:05:37.377 --> 00:05:40.618
to serve each other in great ways.

00:05:40.618 --> 00:05:43.410
But private communities, private, corporate,

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.550
privatizing communities, are not bottom-up democracies.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.560
They cannot replace government.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.662
Friending someone on Facebook is not complex enough

00:05:51.662 --> 00:05:54.315
to do the hard work of you and I collaborating

00:05:54.315 --> 00:05:58.207
with each other and doing the hard work of governance.

00:05:58.207 --> 00:06:01.145
But social media do teach us something.
