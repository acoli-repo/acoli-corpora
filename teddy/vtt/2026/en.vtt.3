Companies make goods, but governments,

00:01:30.828 --> 00:01:33.948
they make public goods. They work on the cure for cancer

00:01:33.948 --> 00:01:36.756
and educating our children and making roads,

00:01:36.756 --> 00:01:40.397
but we don't have institutions that are particularly good

00:01:40.397 --> 00:01:42.933
at this kind of complexity. We don't have institutions

00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:46.050
that are good at bringing our talents to bear,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.512
at working with us in this kind of open and collaborative way.

00:01:50.512 --> 00:01:52.773
So when we wanted to create our Open Government policy,

00:01:52.773 --> 00:01:55.349
what did we do? We wanted, naturally, to ask public sector

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:58.293
employees how we should open up government.

00:01:58.293 --> 00:02:01.525
Turns out that had never been done before.
