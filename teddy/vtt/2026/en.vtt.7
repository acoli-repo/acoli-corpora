00:03:29.136 --> 00:03:32.400
that the design of our systems, whether natural or social,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.083
channel the flow of whatever runs through them.

00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:38.360
So a river is designed to channel the flow of water,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.830
and the lightning bolt that comes out of a cloud channels

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.334
the flow of electricity, and a leaf is designed to channel

00:03:44.334 --> 00:03:46.354
the flow of nutrients to the tree,

00:03:46.354 --> 00:03:49.358
sometimes even having to route around an obstacle,

00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:52.078
but to get that nutrition flowing.

00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:54.415
The same can be said for our social systems, for our

00:03:54.415 --> 00:03:56.903
systems of government, where, at the very least,

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.918
flow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding

00:03:59.918 --> 00:04:02.574
what the problem is, what's really broken,
