00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:32.343
emerging all around us -- maybe not even evolution,

00:07:32.343 --> 00:07:36.152
I'd even start to call it a revolution -- in the way that we govern.

00:07:36.152 --> 00:07:37.636
Some of it's very high-tech,

00:07:37.636 --> 00:07:39.690
and some of it is extremely low-tech,

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.060
such as the project that MKSS is running in Rajasthan,

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.604
India, where they take the spending data of the state

00:07:46.604 --> 00:07:50.047
and paint it on 100,000 village walls,

00:07:50.047 --> 00:07:52.342
and then invite the villagers to come and comment

00:07:52.342 --> 00:07:54.830
who is on the government payroll, who's actually died,

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.454
what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere,

00:07:57.454 --> 00:07:59.798
and to work together through civic engagement to save

00:07:59.798 --> 00:08:03.561
real money and participate and have access to that budget.
