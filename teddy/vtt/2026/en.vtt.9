in broadband and science education and science grants,

00:04:40.602 --> 00:04:43.953
but we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning

00:04:43.953 --> 00:04:46.553

00:04:52.353 --> 00:04:55.269
to complain about government. It's a perennial pastime,

00:04:55.269 --> 00:04:57.921

00:04:57.921 --> 00:05:01.307
the world is complex. We soon will have 10 billion people,
