00:01:58.293 --> 00:02:01.525
Turns out that had never been done before.

00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:04.144
We wanted to ask members of the public to help us

00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:07.422
come up with a policy, not after the fact, commenting

00:02:07.422 --> 00:02:10.805
on a rule after it's written, the way is typically the case,

00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:14.125
but in advance. There was no legal precedent,

00:02:14.125 --> 00:02:17.267
no cultural precedent, no technical way of doing this.

00:02:17.267 --> 00:02:20.108
In fact, many people told us it was illegal.

00:02:20.108 --> 00:02:23.221
Here's the crux of the obstacle.

00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:25.822
Governments exist to channel the flow of two things,

00:02:25.822 --> 00:02:29.316
really, values and expertise to and from government

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:33.165
and to and from citizens to the end of making decisions.
