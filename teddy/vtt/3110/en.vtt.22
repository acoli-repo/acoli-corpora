00:10:56.863 --> 00:11:01.474
what we could build are spaces
for job training and entrepreneurship.

00:11:01.498 --> 00:11:04.655
These are spaces for what we call
"restorative economics."

00:11:05.387 --> 00:11:08.252
Located in East Oakland, California,

00:11:08.276 --> 00:11:11.046
"Restore Oakland" will be
the country’s first center

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.664
for restorative justice
and restorative economics.

00:11:13.688 --> 00:11:19.728
(Applause)

00:11:19.752 --> 00:11:21.355
So here's what we're going to do.

00:11:21.379 --> 00:11:24.585
We're going to gut this building
and turn it into three things.

00:11:24.609 --> 00:11:26.887
First, a restaurant called "Colors,"

00:11:26.911 --> 00:11:29.760
that will break the racial divide
in the restaurant industry

00:11:29.784 --> 00:11:31.784
by training low-wage restaurant workers
