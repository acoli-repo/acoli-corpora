of mass incarceration.

00:14:30.593 --> 00:14:34.497
And not a single one of them
is a jail or a prison.

Activist, philosopher, writer
Cornel West says

00:14:41.363 --> 00:14:43.934
that "Justice is what love
looks like in public."

00:14:44.871 --> 00:14:49.291
So with this in mind,
I ask you one more time

00:14:49.315 --> 00:14:52.013
to imagine a world without prisons,

00:14:53.038 --> 00:14:56.712
and join me in creating all the things
that we could build instead.

00:14:57.545 --> 00:14:58.696
Thank you.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:05.613
