00:10:00.955 --> 00:10:03.330
So after this project,
I didn't go into a thing

00:10:03.354 --> 00:10:05.701
where I'm going to make a huge
peacemaking center.

00:10:05.725 --> 00:10:10.022
I did want to have peacemaking
centers in every community.

00:10:10.847 --> 00:10:12.826
But then a new idea emerged.

00:10:13.744 --> 00:10:18.197
I was doing a workshop
in Santa Rita Jail in California,

00:10:18.221 --> 00:10:21.966
and one of our incarcerated
designers, Doug, said,

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:25.411
"Yeah, you know, repairing the harm,
getting back on my feet, healing --

00:10:25.435 --> 00:10:26.751
really important.

00:10:26.775 --> 00:10:29.219
But the reality is, Deanna,
when I get home,

00:10:29.243 --> 00:10:31.664
I don't have anywhere to go.
