WEBVTT

00:13:00.918 --> 00:13:04.843
Instead of building prisons,
we could build villages on wheels.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.219
It's called the Pop-Up Resource Village,

00:13:09.243 --> 00:13:12.116
and it brings an entire
constellation of resources

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.347
to isolated communities
in the greater San Francisco area,

00:13:15.371 --> 00:13:18.966
including mobile medical,
social services and pop-up shops.

00:13:20.022 --> 00:13:21.378
And so what we're doing now

00:13:21.402 --> 00:13:24.164
is we're building this whole village
with the community,

00:13:24.188 --> 00:13:29.053
starting with transforming municipal buses
into classrooms on wheels

00:13:29.077 --> 00:13:32.982
that bring GED and high school
education across turf lines.
