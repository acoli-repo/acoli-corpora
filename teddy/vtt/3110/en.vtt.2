00:00:59.212 --> 00:01:02.319
And I built it after I got
sent home from school

00:01:02.343 --> 00:01:06.013
for punching this kid in the face
because he called me the N-word.

00:01:06.037 --> 00:01:07.304
OK, he deserved it.

00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:10.267
It happened a lot, though,

00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:15.107
because my family had desegregated
a white community in rural Virginia.

00:01:16.093 --> 00:01:18.433
And I was really scared.

00:01:18.893 --> 00:01:20.069
I was afraid.

00:01:20.498 --> 00:01:21.648
I was angry.

00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:25.744
And so I would run into the forest,
and I would build these little huts.

00:01:25.768 --> 00:01:30.094
They were made out of twigs and leaves
and blankets I had taken from my mom.
