00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:31.863
could I work with the community
to design a peacemaking center?"

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.006
And they said yes.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.363
Thank God, because
I had no backup to these guys.

00:08:39.466 --> 00:08:43.164
And so, in the Near Westside
of Syracuse, New York,

00:08:43.188 --> 00:08:46.879
we started to run design workshops
with the community

00:08:46.903 --> 00:08:50.204
to both locate and reenvision
an old drug house

00:08:50.228 --> 00:08:52.095
to be a peacemaking center.

00:08:52.537 --> 00:08:55.752
The Near Westside
Peacemaking Project is complete.

00:08:55.776 --> 00:08:58.220
And they are already running
over 80 circles a year,

00:08:58.244 --> 00:09:00.425
with a very interesting outcome,
