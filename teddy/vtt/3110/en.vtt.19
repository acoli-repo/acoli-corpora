00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.776
But when she showed up,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.069
she was stressed, she was anxious.

00:09:34.093 --> 00:09:36.681
But when she got in,
she kind of looked around,

00:09:36.705 --> 00:09:38.053
and she settled in.

00:09:38.639 --> 00:09:40.776
And she turned
to the coordinator and said,

00:09:41.446 --> 00:09:44.326
"I feel comfortable here -- at ease.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:46.580
It's homey."

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.967
Isabel and her daughter
made a decision that day

00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:53.783
to engage and complete
the peacemaking process.

00:09:53.807 --> 00:09:56.815
And today, their relationship
is transformed;

00:09:56.839 --> 00:09:59.038
they're doing really well
and they're healing.
