00:13:58.411 --> 00:14:01.177
So what do we build instead of prisons?

00:14:01.807 --> 00:14:03.339
We've looked at three things:

00:14:03.363 --> 00:14:04.783
peacemaking centers,

00:14:04.807 --> 00:14:08.212
centers for restorative justice
and restorative economics

00:14:08.236 --> 00:14:09.569
and pop-up villages.

00:14:11.038 --> 00:14:14.434
But I'm telling you,
I have a list a mile long.

00:14:15.403 --> 00:14:18.990
This is customized housing for youth
transitioning out of foster care.

00:14:19.014 --> 00:14:22.291
These are reentry centers for women
to reunite with their children.

00:14:22.315 --> 00:14:25.249
These are spaces
for survivors of violence.

00:14:25.807 --> 00:14:28.934
These are spaces
that address the root causes

00:14:28.958 --> 00:14:30.569
of mass incarceration.
