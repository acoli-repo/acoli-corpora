And many school districts --
probably some of your own --

00:04:31.864 --> 00:04:34.870
are turning to restorative justice
as an alternative.

So, my first project -- I just turned
this dirty little storage room

00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:43.379
into a peacemaking room
for a program in a high school

00:04:43.403 --> 00:04:45.203
in my hometown of Oakland.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.058

00:04:49.082 --> 00:04:51.670

00:04:51.694 --> 00:04:54.693
were more powerful in bringing
the community together

00:04:54.717 --> 00:04:58.288
after fighting at school
and gun violence in the community,

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:01.736
and that students and teachers
started to come here
