00:10:29.243 --> 00:10:31.664
I don't have anywhere to go.

00:10:31.688 --> 00:10:33.918
I have no job -- who's going to hire me?

00:10:33.942 --> 00:10:35.686
I'm just going to end up back here."

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.410
And you know what, he's right,

00:10:37.434 --> 00:10:41.656
because 60 to 75 percent of those
returning to their communities

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.918
will be unemployed
a year after their release.

00:10:45.315 --> 00:10:48.942
We also know, if you can't meet
your basic economic needs,

00:10:48.966 --> 00:10:50.463
you're going to commit crime --

00:10:50.487 --> 00:10:51.843
any of us would do that.

00:10:53.173 --> 00:10:56.839
So instead of building prisons,

00:10:56.863 --> 00:11:01.474
what we could build are spaces
for job training and entrepreneurship.
