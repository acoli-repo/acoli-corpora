00:00:00.825 --> 00:00:05.634
A lot of people call me
a "justice architect."

00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:08.802
But I don't design prisons.

00:00:09.786 --> 00:00:11.461
I don't design jails.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.058
I don't design detention centers,
and I don't even design courthouses.

00:00:16.872 --> 00:00:20.799
All the same, I get a call every week,

00:00:20.823 --> 00:00:25.172
saying, "OK, but you design
better prisons, right?

00:00:25.196 --> 00:00:28.116
You know, like those pretty ones
they're building in Europe."

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.188
And I always pause.
