00:01:25.768 --> 00:01:30.094
They were made out of twigs and leaves
and blankets I had taken from my mom.

00:01:30.776 --> 00:01:34.094
And as the light would stream
into my refuge,

00:01:35.284 --> 00:01:36.750
I would feel at peace.

00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:41.504
Despite my efforts to comfort myself,

00:01:41.528 --> 00:01:44.617
I still left my community
as soon as I could,

00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:46.664
and I went to architecture school

00:01:46.688 --> 00:01:50.358
and then into a professional career
designing shopping centers,

00:01:50.382 --> 00:01:51.783
homes for the wealthy

00:01:51.807 --> 00:01:53.339
and office buildings,

00:01:54.454 --> 00:01:57.657
until I stepped into a prison
for the first time.

00:01:58.193 --> 00:02:02.241
It was the Chester State
Correctional Institution in Pennsylvania.
