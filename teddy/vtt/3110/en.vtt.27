00:13:29.077 --> 00:13:32.982
that bring GED and high school
education across turf lines.

00:13:33.006 --> 00:13:34.157
(Applause)

00:13:34.181 --> 00:13:37.074
We will serve thousands
of more students with this.

00:13:37.581 --> 00:13:39.792
We're creating mobile spaces of refuge

00:13:39.816 --> 00:13:42.459
for women released from jail
in the middle of the night,

00:13:42.483 --> 00:13:43.800
at their most vulnerable.

00:13:44.246 --> 00:13:48.109
Next summer, the village will launch,
and it pops up every single week,

00:13:48.133 --> 00:13:51.344
expanding to more and more
communities as it goes.

00:13:52.077 --> 00:13:53.355
So look out for it.

00:13:53.379 --> 00:13:58.387
(Applause)

00:13:58.411 --> 00:14:01.177
So what do we build instead of prisons?
