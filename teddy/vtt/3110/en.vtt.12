00:05:56.966 --> 00:06:00.601
Ninety-five percent
of all these folks are coming home.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.931
And most of them are survivors of severe
sexual, physical and emotional abuse.

00:06:08.323 --> 00:06:10.870
They have literally been
on both sides of the harm.

00:06:11.577 --> 00:06:13.950
So I thought, uh, maybe I should ask them

00:06:13.974 --> 00:06:16.212
what we should build instead of prisons.

00:06:17.317 --> 00:06:21.515
So I returned with
a restorative justice expert,

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:24.643
and we started to run
the country's first design studios

00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:26.537
with incarcerated men and women

00:06:26.561 --> 00:06:29.607
around the intersection
of restorative justice and design.
