00:02:29.204 --> 00:02:34.461
there's a wall of cells filled with
so many black and brown bodies.

00:02:35.257 --> 00:02:38.114
And I realized that what I was seeing

00:02:38.138 --> 00:02:42.875
was the end result of our racist policies
that had caused mass incarceration.

00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:46.315
But as an architect, what I was seeing

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:50.172
was how a prison is the worst
building type we could have created

00:02:50.196 --> 00:02:52.744
to address the harm
that we're doing to one another.

00:02:54.085 --> 00:02:56.718
I thought, "Well, could I design
an alternative to this,

00:02:56.742 --> 00:02:58.743
other than building a prettier prison?"

00:02:58.767 --> 00:03:01.463
It didn't feel good to me;
it still doesn't feel good.
