00:01:58.193 --> 00:02:02.241
It was the Chester State
Correctional Institution in Pennsylvania.

00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:04.331
And my friend, she invited me there

00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:06.514
to work with some
of her incarcerated students

00:02:06.538 --> 00:02:09.937
and teach them about
the positive power of design.

00:02:10.704 --> 00:02:12.772
The irony is so obvious, right?

00:02:12.796 --> 00:02:16.252
As I approached this concrete building,
these tiny little windows,

00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:19.759
barbed wire, high walls,
observation towers,

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:24.021
and on the inside,
these cold, hard spaces,

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.300
little light or air,

00:02:26.324 --> 00:02:29.180
the guards are screaming,
the doors are clanking,

00:02:29.204 --> 00:02:34.461
there's a wall of cells filled with
so many black and brown bodies.
