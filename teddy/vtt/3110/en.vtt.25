(Applause)

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.966
That is a better use of your tax dollars.

00:12:33.982 --> 00:12:36.115
So I want to build all of these.

00:12:36.712 --> 00:12:39.131
But building buildings
is a really heavy lift.

00:12:39.155 --> 00:12:40.305
It takes time.

00:12:41.188 --> 00:12:44.061
And what was happening
in the communities that I was serving

00:12:44.085 --> 00:12:48.818
is we were losing people every week
to gun violence and mass incarceration.

00:12:49.521 --> 00:12:53.724
We needed to serve more people and faster
and keep them out of the system.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.307
And a new idea emerged from the community,

00:12:57.331 --> 00:12:59.931
one that was a lot lighter on its feet.
