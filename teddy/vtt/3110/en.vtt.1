00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.188
And I always pause.

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:32.864
And I invite them,

00:00:33.586 --> 00:00:35.161
and I invite you today,

00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:37.950
to imagine a world without prisons.

00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:42.402
What does that justice feel and look like?

00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:46.086
What do we need to build to get there?

00:00:47.673 --> 00:00:51.395
I'd like to show you some ideas today
of things that we're building.

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:54.371
And I'm going to start
with an early prototype.

00:00:54.395 --> 00:00:56.553
This I built when I was five.

00:00:56.577 --> 00:00:58.391
I call it "the healing hut."

00:00:59.212 --> 00:01:02.319
And I built it after I got
sent home from school
