and that students and teachers
started to come here

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.427
just because they saw it
as a space of refuge.

00:05:05.434 --> 00:05:10.845
So what was happening is that the space
was amplifying the effects of the process.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.692
OK, then I did something
that architects always do, y'all.

00:05:17.323 --> 00:05:20.871
I was like, I'm going to build
something massive now, right?

00:05:20.895 --> 00:05:25.679
I'm going to build the world's first
restorative justice center all by myself.

00:05:26.173 --> 00:05:29.188
And it's going to be
a beautiful figure on the skyline,

00:05:29.212 --> 00:05:31.037
like a beacon in the night.
