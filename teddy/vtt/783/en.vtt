00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to 10,000 feet.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let me explain why we are here

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and why some of you have a pine cone close to you.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Once upon a time, I did a book called "How Buildings Learn."

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Today's event you might call "How Mountains Teach."

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
A little background: For 10 years I've been trying to figure out how to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
hack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
or in some cases, non-existent.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking
