It is a thrill to be here at a conference

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that's devoted to "Inspired by Nature" -- you can imagine.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And I'm also thrilled to be in the foreplay section.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Did you notice this section is foreplay?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which is the Western Grebe. You haven't lived

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I was on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which is a long, skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it,
