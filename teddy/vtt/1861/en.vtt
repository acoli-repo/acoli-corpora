00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:02.872
So my moment of truth

00:00:02.872 --> 00:00:05.936
did not come all at once.

00:00:05.936 --> 00:00:09.562
In 2010, I had the chance to be considered

00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:11.889
for promotion from my job

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.961
as director of policy planning

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:16.718
at the U.S. State Department.

00:00:16.718 --> 00:00:20.449
This was my moment to lean in,

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.334
to push myself forward

00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:26.028
for what are really only a handful

00:00:26.028 --> 00:00:29.045
of the very top foreign policy jobs,

00:00:29.045 --> 00:00:32.125
and I had just finished a big, 18-month project
