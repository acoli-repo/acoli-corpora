00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
the last great pandemic,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
in that it also jumped directly from birds to people.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
We had evolution over time,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings:

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
55 percent of people who have become infected

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
with H5N1 have, in fact, succumbed.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And we don't have a huge number of people

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
who got infected and never developed disease.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
In experimental feeding in monkeys

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
you can see that it actually downregulates

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
a specific immune system modulator.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
The result is that what kills you

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
is not the virus directly, but your own immune system overreacting, saying,
