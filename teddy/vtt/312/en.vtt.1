becomes not an obscure event, but a globalized event --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Katrina showed us

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that we cannot completely depend on government

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
to have readiness in hand, to be capable of handling things.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Indeed, an outbreak would be multiple Katrinas at once.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Our big concern at the moment is a virus called H5N1 flu --

which first emerged in southern China, in the mid-1990s,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but we didn't know about it until 1997.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
At the end of last Christmas only 13 countries had seen H5N1.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But we're now up to 55 countries in the world,
