00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
We're worried because this virus, unlike any other flu

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
we've ever studied, can be transmitted by eating raw meat

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
of the infected animals.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
We've seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and now also domestic pet dogs.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu:

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
seizures, central nervous system disorders, partial paralysis.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
This is not your normal garden-variety flu.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
It mimics what we now understand

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
about reconstructing the 1918 flu virus,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
the last great pandemic,
