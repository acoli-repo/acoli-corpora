00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
in a timely fashion, a specific vaccine

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
for more than 260 million people.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It's not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
You've heard about the vaccine we're stockpiling.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
if we have a real outbreak.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So one thought is:

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
after 9/11, when the airports closed,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
our flu season was delayed by two weeks.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So the thought is, hey, maybe what we should do is just

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
immediately -- we hear there is H5N1 spreading from human to human,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
the virus has mutated to be a human-to-human transmitter --

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
let's shut down the airports.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
However, huge supercomputer analyses,
