00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
of the federal stockpile of a drug called Tamiflu,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
which may or may not be helpful -- I'll get into that --

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
of available vaccines, and any other treatments,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and masks, and anything that's been stockpiled.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And you'll have massive competition.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Now we did purchase a vaccine, you've probably all heard about it,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
made by Sanofi-Aventis.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Unfortunately it's made against the current form of H5N1.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
We know the virus will mutate. It will be a different virus.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
The vaccine will probably be useless.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So here's where the decisions come in.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
You're the mayor of your local town.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Let's see, should we order that all pets be kept indoors?
