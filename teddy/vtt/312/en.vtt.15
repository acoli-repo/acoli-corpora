regarding quarantine across the United States.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And some states have differential policies, county by county.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Well then what about all the workers? They won't go to work

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000

What they found was, the core functions --

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
you know you still sort of had banks,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
but you couldn't get people to put money in the ATM machines.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Nobody was processing the credit cards.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Your insurance payments didn't go through.
