00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Exercises, drills, all over the world.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Let's pretend there's a pandemic.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Let's everybody run around and play your role.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Main result is that there is tremendous confusion.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Most of these people don't actually know what their job will be.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And the bottom line, major thing that has come through

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
in every single drill: nobody knows who's in charge.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Nobody knows the chain of command.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
If it were Los Angeles, is it the mayor, the governor,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
the President of the United States, the head of Homeland Security?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
In fact, the federal government says it's a guy called

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
the Principle Federal Officer,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
who happens to be with TSA.
