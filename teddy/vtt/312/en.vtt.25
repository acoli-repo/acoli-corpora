for yourself, your family, or your employees --

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
unless you've really done your homework.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
What mask works, what mask doesn't work.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
How many masks do you need?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
The Institute of Medicine study felt that

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
flu-like symptoms.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
So then how can you tell

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
who in your family has the flu
