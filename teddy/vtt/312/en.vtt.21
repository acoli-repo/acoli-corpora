00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
When I say enough, that's two weeks worth.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And then you're on your own because

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
the pandemic is going to last for 18 to 24 months.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Some of the poorer countries

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
that have had the most experience with H5N1 have built up stockpiles;

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
they're already expired. They are already out of date.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
What do we know from 1918,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
the last great pandemic?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
The federal government abdicated most responsibility.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
all over America.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Every city, county, state did their own thing.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And the rules

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and the belief systems were wildly disparate.
