00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
to breed resistant strains.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And we now have seen Tamiflu-resistant strains

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
in both Vietnam in person-to-person transmission,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and in Egypt in person-to-person transmission.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So I personally think that our life expectancy

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
for Tamiflu as an effective drug

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
is very limited -- very limited indeed.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Nevertheless most of the governments

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
have based their whole flu policies

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
on building stockpiles of Tamiflu.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Russia has actually stockpiled enough

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
for 95 percent of all Russians.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
We've stockpiled enough for 30 percent.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
When I say enough, that's two weeks worth.
