00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
A public health survey analyzed the effect

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
that large-scale Tamiflu use would have,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
actually shows it counteractive

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
to public health measures, making matters worse.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And here is the other interesting thing:

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
when a human being ingests Tamiflu, only 20 percent

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
is metabolized appropriately

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
to be an active compound in the human being.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
The rest turns into a stable compound,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
which survives filtration into the water systems,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and providing them a chance

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
to breed resistant strains.
