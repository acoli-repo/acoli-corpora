00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
The virus was 100 percent lethal to pregnant women

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and we don't actually know why.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds --

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
robustly healthy young adults.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
It was likened to the plague.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
We don't actually know how many people died.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
The low-ball estimate is 35 million.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
This was based on European and North American data.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
A new study by Chris Murray at Harvard

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
shows that if you look at the databases that were kept

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
by the Brits in India,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
there was a 31-fold greater death rate among the Indians.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
So there is a strong belief that in places of poverty
