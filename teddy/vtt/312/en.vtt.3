00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And we've dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
with the result that there's cover-up.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's also carried on migration patterns

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
of wild migratory aquatic birds.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
There has been this centralized event

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in a place called Lake Chenghai, China.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Two years ago the migrating birds

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
had a multiple event

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
where thousands died because of a mutation occurring

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
in the virus,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
which made the species range broaden dramatically.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So that birds going to Siberia, to Europe, and to Africa

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
carried the virus, which had not previously been possible.
