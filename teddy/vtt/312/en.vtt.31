To say ahh, if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
LG: The moment that you see any evidence

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
of serious human-to-human to transmission.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Not just intimately between family members

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
who took care of an ailing sister or brother,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
but a community infected --

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
spread within a school,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
spread within a dormitory, something of that nature.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Then I think that there is universal agreement

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
now, at WHO all the way down:

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Send out the alert.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Audience member: Some research has indicated that statins can be helpful.
