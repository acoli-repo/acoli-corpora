Your insurance payments didn't go through.

And that's just office workers, bankers.

We don't know how important hand washing is for flu --

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Can we figure out a way, since we know we won't have enough masks

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
because we don't make them in America anymore,
