00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
is not the virus directly, but your own immune system overreacting, saying,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
"Whatever this is so foreign I'm going berserk."

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
The result: most of the deaths

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
have been in people under 30 years of age,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
robustly healthy young adults.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
We have seen human-to-human transmission

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
in at least three clusters --

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
fortunately involving very intimate contact,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
still not putting the world at large at any kind of risk.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Alright, so I've got you nervous.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Now you probably assume, well the governments are going to do something.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And we have spent a lot of money.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Most of the spending in the Bush administration

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
has actually been more related to the anthrax results
