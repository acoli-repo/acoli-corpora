00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
However, huge supercomputer analyses,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
done of the likely effectiveness of this,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
show that it won't buy us much time at all.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
For example, all masks are made in China.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
How do you get them mobilized around the world

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
if you've shut all the airports down?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
How do you get the vaccines moved around the world

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and the drugs moved, and whatever may or not be available that would work.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
We're worried because this virus, unlike any other flu

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
we've ever studied, can be transmitted by eating raw meat
