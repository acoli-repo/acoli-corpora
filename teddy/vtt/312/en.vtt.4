WEBVTT

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
carried the virus, which had not previously been possible.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We're now seeing outbreaks in human populations --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
so far, fortunately, small events,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
tiny outbreaks, occasional clusters.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
to form two distinct families, if you will,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
of the H5N1 viral tree

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
with branches in them,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and with different attributes that are worrying.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So what's concerning us? Well, first of all,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
at no time in history have we succeeded in making

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
in a timely fashion, a specific vaccine

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
for more than 260 million people.
