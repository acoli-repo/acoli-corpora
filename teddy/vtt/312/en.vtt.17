00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Can we figure out a way, since we know we won't have enough masks

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
because we don't make them in America anymore,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
they're all made in China --

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
do we need N95? A state-of-the-art, top-of-the-line,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
must-be-fitted-to-your-face mask?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Or can we get away with some different kinds of masks?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
In the SARS epidemic, we learned in Hong Kong

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
that most of transmission was because

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
people were removing their masks improperly.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and then they rubbed their nose. Bingo! They got SARS.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
It wasn't flying microbes.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
If you go online right now, you'll get so much phony-baloney information.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
You'll end up buying -- this is called an N95 mask. Ridiculous.
