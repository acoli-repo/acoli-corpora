00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Most of the spending in the Bush administration

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
has actually been more related to the anthrax results

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and bio-terrorism threat.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
But a lot of money has been thrown out at the local level and at the federal level

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
to look at infectious diseases.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
End result: only 15 states

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
have been certified to be able to do mass distribution

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
of vaccine and drugs in a pandemic.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Half the states would run out of hospital beds

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
in the first week, maybe two weeks.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And 40 states already have an acute nursing shortage.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Add on pandemic threat, you're in big trouble.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So what have people been doing with this money?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Exercises, drills, all over the world.
