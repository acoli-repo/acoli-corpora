00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So the first question is, why do we need to

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
even worry about a pandemic threat?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What is it that we're concerned about?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
When I say "we," I'm at the Council on Foreign Relations.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We're concerned in the national security community,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and of course in the biology community and the public health community.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
While globalization has increased travel,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
it's made it necessary that everybody be everywhere,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
all the time, all over the world.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So a plague outbreak in Surat, India

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
becomes not an obscure event, but a globalized event --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation.
