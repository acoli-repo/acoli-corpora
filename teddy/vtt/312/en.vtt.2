00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But we're now up to 55 countries in the world,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
have had this virus emerge,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
in either birds, or people or both.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
In the bird outbreaks we now can see

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that pretty much the whole world has seen this virus

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
except the Americas.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And I'll get into why we've so far been spared in a moment.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
In domestic birds, especially chickens,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
it's 100 percent lethal.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
It's one of the most lethal things we've seen

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in circulation in the world

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
in any recent centuries.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And we've dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers
