00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
So there is a strong belief that in places of poverty

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
the death toll was far higher.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And that a more likely toll

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 million people

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
before we had commercial air travel.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So are we ready?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
As a nation, no we're not.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And I think even those in the leadership

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
would say that is the case,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that we still have a long ways to go.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
So what does that mean for you? Well the first thing is,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
I wouldn't start building up personal stockpiles of anything --

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
for yourself, your family, or your employees --

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
unless you've really done your homework.
