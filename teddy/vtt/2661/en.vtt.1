So the Yap just keep track
of who owns part of what stone.

00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:42.138
There's a story about these sailors

00:00:42.162 --> 00:00:44.818
that were transporting a stone
across the ocean

00:00:44.842 --> 00:00:48.668
when they ran into some trouble
and the stone actually fell in.

00:00:49.574 --> 00:00:51.896
The sailors got back to the main island

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.177
and they told everyone what had happened.

00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:56.950
And everyone decided that, actually, yes,

00:00:56.974 --> 00:01:01.348
the sailors had the stone
and -- why not? -- it still counted.
