00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:30.094
But it was too inconvenient
to think about actually shipping

00:01:30.118 --> 00:01:32.047
all of that gold over to Europe.

00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:35.904
So instead, someone went to where
that gold was being stored

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:39.982
and they just labeled it
as belonging to France now.

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:43.474
And everyone agreed
that France owned the gold.

00:01:43.843 --> 00:01:45.825
It's just like those Rai stones.

00:01:46.517 --> 00:01:48.838
The point I want to make
with these two examples

00:01:48.862 --> 00:01:52.250
is that there's nothing
inherently valuable

00:01:52.274 --> 00:01:55.635
about a dollar or a stone or a coin.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.782
The only reason these things
have any value

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:01.374
is because we've all decided they should.
