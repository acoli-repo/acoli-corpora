But it's also going to create
new, flexible forms of employment.

00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:34.527
With programmable money,

00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:39.503
we decouple the need
for large, trusted institutions

00:15:39.527 --> 00:15:41.820
from the architecture of the network.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:47.656
And this pushes innovation in money
out to the edges, where it belongs.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.774
Programmable money democratizes money.

00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:55.219
And because of this,
things are going to change and unfold

00:15:55.243 --> 00:15:57.234
in ways that we can't even predict.

00:15:58.488 --> 00:15:59.650
Thank you.

00:15:59.674 --> 00:16:03.638
