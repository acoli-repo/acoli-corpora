00:05:58.485 --> 00:06:02.262
money becomes more
than just a static unit of value,

00:06:02.286 --> 00:06:05.476
and we don't have to rely
on institutions for security.

00:06:06.176 --> 00:06:07.705
In a programmable world,

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:11.663
we remove humans
and institutions from the loop.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:13.969
And when this happens,

00:06:13.993 --> 00:06:16.685
we won't even feel like
we're transacting anymore.

00:06:17.683 --> 00:06:19.957
Money will be directed by software,

00:06:19.981 --> 00:06:22.849
and it will just safely and securely flow.

00:06:24.828 --> 00:06:27.967
Cryptocurrencies are the first step

00:06:28.787 --> 00:06:30.442
Cryptocurrencies are digital money
