00:09:30.023 --> 00:09:31.719
It's done through computer code,

00:09:31.743 --> 00:09:34.406
running on thousands
of networked computers

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.638
around the world.

00:09:37.235 --> 00:09:40.979
All of these computers
are collectively confirming

00:09:41.003 --> 00:09:42.887
who owns what Bitcoin.

00:09:42.911 --> 00:09:46.324
So the Bitcoin blockchain
is core to how Bitcoin works.

00:09:46.348 --> 00:09:49.253
But where do bitcoins actually come from?

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.790
Well, the code is designed
to create new Bitcoin

00:09:53.814 --> 00:09:55.111
according to a schedule.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.096
And the way that it works
is that to get those Bitcoin,

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.906
I have to solve a puzzle --
a random cryptographic puzzle.
