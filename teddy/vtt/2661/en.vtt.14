I have an app on my phone
that I can use to buy sashimi.

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:03.429
But it's not just for small transactions.

00:07:03.453 --> 00:07:08.282
In March, there was a transaction
that moved around 100,000 bitcoins.

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:11.711
That's the equivalent
of 40 million US dollars.

00:07:13.445 --> 00:07:16.976
Cryptocurrencies are based on
a special field of mathematics

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.383
called cryptography.

00:07:19.023 --> 00:07:22.794
Cryptography is the study
of how to secure communication,

00:07:22.818 --> 00:07:25.517
and it's about two
really important things:

00:07:25.541 --> 00:07:29.119
masking information so it can
be hidden in plain sight,

00:07:29.143 --> 00:07:32.370
and verifying a piece
of information's source.
