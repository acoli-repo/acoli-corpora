I want to tell you
about the future of money.

00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:07.064
Let's start with a story
about this culture

00:00:07.088 --> 00:00:11.276
that lived in Micronesia
in the early 1900s, called the Yap.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.083
Now, I want to tell you about the Yap

00:00:13.107 --> 00:00:15.973
because their form of money
is really interesting.

00:00:15.997 --> 00:00:19.635
They use these limestone discs
called Rai stones.

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:23.386
Now, the Yap don't actually
move these Rai stones around

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.207
or exchange them the way
we do with our coins,

00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:29.696
because Rai stones can get
to be pretty massive.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.048
The largest is about four tons
and 12 feet across.
