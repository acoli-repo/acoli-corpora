And there's a lot of impediments
in the system slowing things down.

00:04:04.498 --> 00:04:08.040
That's because digital money
isn't really mine,

00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:11.638
it's entries in databases
that belong to my bank,

00:04:11.662 --> 00:04:14.815
my credit card company
or my investment firm.

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:18.203
And these companies
have the right to say "no."

00:04:18.856 --> 00:04:20.648
If I'm a PayPal merchant

00:04:20.672 --> 00:04:25.143
and PayPal wrongly flags me for fraud,

00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:26.323
that's it.

00:04:26.347 --> 00:04:29.634
My account gets frozen,
and I can't get paid.
