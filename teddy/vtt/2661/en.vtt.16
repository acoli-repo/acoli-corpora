a pretty sophisticated cryptosystem.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.991
It's what we use to secure
our interactions on the Internet.

00:08:05.015 --> 00:08:08.176
It's what makes it safe for us
to type our passwords in

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.891
and to send financial
information to websites.

00:08:11.322 --> 00:08:14.149
So what the banks used to give us --

00:08:14.173 --> 00:08:16.393
trustworthy digital money transfer --

00:08:16.417 --> 00:08:20.635
we can now get with a clever
application of cryptography.

00:08:21.202 --> 00:08:24.109
And this means that we don't
have to rely on the banks anymore

00:08:24.133 --> 00:08:25.764
to secure our transactions.

00:08:26.248 --> 00:08:28.077
We can do it ourselves.

00:08:28.857 --> 00:08:33.596
Bitcoin is based on the very same
idea that the Yap used,
