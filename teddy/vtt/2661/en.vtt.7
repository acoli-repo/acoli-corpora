00:03:26.908 --> 00:03:30.014
Half my credit cards
still don't work in Europe.

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:31.936
That's friction.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.472
Transferring money across borders
and across currencies

00:03:36.496 --> 00:03:38.140
is really expensive:

00:03:38.807 --> 00:03:40.268
friction.

00:03:40.292 --> 00:03:45.215
An entrepreneur in India
can set up an online business in minutes,

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.768
but it's hard for her
to get loans and to get paid:

00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:50.666
friction.

00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:56.545
Our access to digital money
and our ability to freely transact

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.512
is being held captive
by these gatekeepers.

00:03:59.536 --> 00:04:03.352
And there's a lot of impediments
in the system slowing things down.
