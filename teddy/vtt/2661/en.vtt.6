00:02:59.627 --> 00:03:01.008
in seconds.

00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:03.492
Now when this works,

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:08.361
it's because there are large institutions
underwriting every 1 or 0

00:03:08.385 --> 00:03:10.314
that changes on a computer.

00:03:10.338 --> 00:03:11.503
And when it doesn't,

00:03:11.527 --> 00:03:13.925
it's often the fault
of those large institutions.

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:16.892
Or at least, it's up to them
to fix the problem.

00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:18.476
And a lot of times, they don't.

00:03:18.862 --> 00:03:21.031
There's a lot of friction in the system.

00:03:21.938 --> 00:03:24.813
How long did it take
the US credit card companies

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:26.413
to implement chip and pin?

00:03:26.908 --> 00:03:30.014
Half my credit cards
still don't work in Europe.
