00:08:58.721 --> 00:09:01.567
Let's say we just give everyone this paper

00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:05.419
and everyone writes down
the transfers that they're doing

00:09:05.443 --> 00:09:06.899
in the Bitcoin system.

00:09:07.688 --> 00:09:11.634
All of these transfers get copied
around to everyone else's pieces of paper.

00:09:11.658 --> 00:09:13.676
And I can look at mine

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.225
and I'll have a list of all
of the transfers that are happening

00:09:17.249 --> 00:09:19.138
in the entire Bitcoin economy.

00:09:19.779 --> 00:09:23.341
This is actually what's happening
with the Bitcoin blockchain,

00:09:23.365 --> 00:09:27.161
which is a list of all
of the transactions in Bitcoin.

00:09:27.185 --> 00:09:29.999
Except, it's not done through paper.
