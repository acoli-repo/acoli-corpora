00:02:29.843 --> 00:02:32.516
So I get paid via direct deposit,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.023
I pay my rent via bank transfer,

00:02:35.047 --> 00:02:36.991
I pay my taxes online.

00:02:37.015 --> 00:02:38.167
And every month,

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.956
a small amount of money
is deducted from my paycheck

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.947
and invested in mutual funds
in my retirement account.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.629
All of these interactions

00:02:46.653 --> 00:02:50.711
are literally just changing
1's and 0's on computers.

00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:55.109
There's not even anything physical,
like a stone or a coin.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.603
Digital money makes it
so that I can pay someone around the world

00:02:59.627 --> 00:03:01.008
in seconds.
