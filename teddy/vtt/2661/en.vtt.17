Bitcoin is based on the very same

In Bitcoin, I spend

00:08:41.488 --> 00:08:44.659
and I get paid when someone
transfers Bitcoin to me.

00:08:46.313 --> 00:08:49.068
Imagine that we had this magic paper.

00:08:49.711 --> 00:08:53.299
So the way that this paper works
is I can give you a sheet of it

00:08:53.323 --> 00:08:55.053
and if you write something on it,

00:08:55.077 --> 00:08:57.700
it will magically appear
on my piece as well.

00:08:58.721 --> 00:09:01.567
Let's say we just give everyone this paper
