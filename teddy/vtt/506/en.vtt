My mom has always reminded me

00:00:03.631 --> 00:00:06.928
that I have the same
proportions as a LEGO man.

00:00:06.952 --> 00:00:08.365
(Laughter)

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.563
And she does actually have a point.

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.910
LEGO is a company that has succeeded

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:18.823
in making everybody believe
that LEGO is from their home country.

00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:21.595
But it's not, it's from my home country.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.269
So you can imagine my excitement
when the LEGO family called me

00:00:25.293 --> 00:00:28.262
and asked us to work with them
to design the Home of the Brick.

00:00:28.988 --> 00:00:32.470
This is the architectural model --
we built it out of LEGO, obviously.
