but can transcend disability
through technological innovation.

00:14:30.599 --> 00:14:34.559
Indeed, through fundamental advances
in bionics in this century,

00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:38.741
we will set the technological foundation
for an enhanced human experience,

00:14:38.765 --> 00:14:40.702
and we will end disability.

00:14:41.456 --> 00:14:45.011
I'd like to finish up
with one more story, a beautiful story.

00:14:45.613 --> 00:14:47.630
The story of Adrianne Haslet-Davis.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.198
Adrianne lost her left leg
in the Boston terrorist attack.

00:14:52.766 --> 00:14:56.721
I met Adrianne when this photo was taken,
at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.

00:14:56.745 --> 00:14:59.221
Adrianne is a dancer, a ballroom dancer.

00:14:59.245 --> 00:15:01.858
Adrianne breathes and lives dance.
