00:07:58.474 --> 00:08:00.982
How do my bionic limbs
move like flesh and bone?

00:08:01.799 --> 00:08:05.784
At my MIT lab, we study how humans
with normal physiologies

00:08:05.808 --> 00:08:07.314
stand, walk and run.

00:08:07.338 --> 00:08:08.729
What are the muscles doing,

00:08:08.753 --> 00:08:11.126
and how are they controlled
by the spinal cord?

00:08:11.697 --> 00:08:14.142
This basic science
motivates what we build.

00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:16.504
We're building bionic ankles,
knees and hips.

00:08:16.528 --> 00:08:19.044
We're building body parts
from the ground up.

00:08:19.854 --> 00:08:23.017
The bionic limbs that I'm wearing
are called BiOMs.

00:08:23.041 --> 00:08:26.995
They've been fitted
to nearly 1,000 patients,

00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:29.981
400 of which have been
wounded U.S. soldiers.
