that when a normal, healthy person
wears the device for 40 minutes

00:10:01.579 --> 00:10:03.278
and then takes it off,

00:10:03.302 --> 00:10:07.357
their own biological legs feel
ridiculously heavy and awkward.

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:11.450
We're beginning the age in which
machines attached to our bodies

00:10:11.474 --> 00:10:14.484
will make us stronger
and faster and more efficient.

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:17.446
Moving on to electrical interface:

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.627
How do my bionic limbs communicate
with my nervous system?

00:10:20.651 --> 00:10:22.493
Across my residual limb are electrodes

00:10:22.517 --> 00:10:25.262
that measure the electrical
pulse of my muscles.

00:10:25.286 --> 00:10:27.205
That's communicated to the bionic limb,

00:10:27.229 --> 00:10:30.282
so when I think about moving
my phantom limb,
