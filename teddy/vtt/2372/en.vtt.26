Hugh Herr: Next week,
I'm visiting the Center --

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.332
Thank you. Thank you.

00:13:04.356 --> 00:13:07.862
(Applause)

00:13:07.886 --> 00:13:09.169
Thank you.

00:13:09.193 --> 00:13:13.018
Next week I'm visiting the Center
for Medicare and Medicaid Services,

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:15.645
and I'm going to try to convince CMS

00:13:15.669 --> 00:13:18.224
to grant appropriate
code language and pricing,

00:13:18.248 --> 00:13:21.979
so this technology can be made available
to the patients that need it.

00:13:22.003 --> 00:13:23.026
(Applause)

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.210
Thank you.

00:13:24.234 --> 00:13:27.849
(Applause)

00:13:27.873 --> 00:13:31.817
It's not well appreciated,
but over half of the world's population
