00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.532
into the synthetic skins.

00:07:01.556 --> 00:07:06.024
This is a material developed
by SRI International, California.

00:07:06.048 --> 00:07:09.036
Under electrostatic effect,
it changes stiffness.

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:12.674
So under zero voltage,
the material is compliant,

00:07:12.698 --> 00:07:14.072
it's floppy like paper.

00:07:14.096 --> 00:07:16.564
Then the button's pushed,
a voltage is applied,

00:07:16.588 --> 00:07:18.580
and it becomes stiff as a board.

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.722
(Tapping sounds)

00:07:21.666 --> 00:07:24.314
We embed this material
into the synthetic skin

00:07:24.338 --> 00:07:27.447
that attaches my bionic limb
to my biological body.

00:07:27.888 --> 00:07:30.318
When I walk here, it's no voltage.
