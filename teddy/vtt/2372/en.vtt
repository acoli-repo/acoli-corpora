00:00:01.252 --> 00:00:03.958
Looking deeply inside nature,

00:00:03.982 --> 00:00:07.071
through the magnifying glass of science,

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:10.676
designers extract principles,
processes and materials

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.815
that are forming the very basis
of design methodology.

00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:20.328
From synthetic constructs
that resemble biological materials,

00:00:20.352 --> 00:00:23.719
to computational methods
that emulate neural processes,

00:00:23.743 --> 00:00:26.208
nature is driving design.

00:00:27.398 --> 00:00:29.200
Design is also driving nature.
