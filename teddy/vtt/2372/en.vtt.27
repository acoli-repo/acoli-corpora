00:13:27.873 --> 00:13:31.817
It's not well appreciated,
but over half of the world's population

00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:36.608
suffers from some form of cognitive,
emotional, sensory or motor condition,

00:13:36.632 --> 00:13:41.042
and because of poor technology,
too often, conditions result in disability

00:13:41.066 --> 00:13:42.701
and a poorer quality of life.

00:13:43.113 --> 00:13:48.053
Basic levels of physiological function
should be a part of our human rights.

00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:52.033
Every person should have the right
to live life without disability

00:13:52.057 --> 00:13:53.954
if they so choose --

00:13:53.978 --> 00:13:56.700
the right to live life
without severe depression;

00:13:56.724 --> 00:14:00.105
the right to see a loved one,
in the case of seeing-impaired;
