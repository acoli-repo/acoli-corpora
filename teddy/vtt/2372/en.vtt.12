00:05:59.407 --> 00:06:02.978
to measure tissue compliances
at each anatomical point.

00:06:03.542 --> 00:06:05.789
We combine these imaging and robotic data

00:06:05.813 --> 00:06:09.455
to build a mathematical description
of my biological limb, shown on the left.

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:11.233
You see a bunch of points, or nodes?

00:06:11.257 --> 00:06:14.407
At each node, there's a color
that represents tissue compliance.

00:06:14.431 --> 00:06:18.373
We then do a mathematical transformation
to the design of the synthetic skin,

00:06:18.397 --> 00:06:19.596
shown on the right.

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:22.492
And we've discovered optimality is:

00:06:22.516 --> 00:06:25.373
where the body is stiff,
the synthetic skin should be soft,

00:06:25.397 --> 00:06:28.857
where the body is soft,
the synthetic skin is stiff,

00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:32.164
and this mirroring occurs
across all tissue compliances.
