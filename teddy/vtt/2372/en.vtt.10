00:04:59.293 --> 00:05:01.714
of Professor Neri Oxman
at the MIT Media Lab,

00:05:01.738 --> 00:05:05.162
showing spatially varying
exoskeletal impedances,

00:05:05.186 --> 00:05:09.200
shown here by color variation
in this 3D-printed model.

00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:14.335
Imagine a future where clothing
is stiff and soft where you need it,

00:05:14.359 --> 00:05:17.889
when you need it, for optimal
support and flexibility,

00:05:17.913 --> 00:05:19.588
without ever causing discomfort.

00:05:20.112 --> 00:05:23.534
My bionic limbs are attached
to my biological body

00:05:23.558 --> 00:05:27.620
via synthetic skins
with stiffness variations,

00:05:27.644 --> 00:05:31.264
that mirror my underlying
tissue biomechanics.
