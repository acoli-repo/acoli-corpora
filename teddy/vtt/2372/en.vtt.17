00:08:30.005 --> 00:08:31.163
How does it work?

00:08:31.187 --> 00:08:33.202
At heel strike, under computer control,

00:08:33.226 --> 00:08:35.202
the system controls stiffness,

00:08:35.226 --> 00:08:38.263
to attenuate the shock
of the limb hitting the ground.

00:08:38.287 --> 00:08:42.383
Then at mid-stance, the bionic limb
outputs high torques and powers

00:08:42.407 --> 00:08:44.762
to lift the person
into the walking stride,

00:08:44.786 --> 00:08:48.271
comparable to how muscles
work in the calf region.

00:08:49.096 --> 00:08:52.826
This bionic propulsion is very important
clinically to patients.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.904
So on the left, you see
the bionic device worn by a lady,

00:08:55.928 --> 00:08:58.863
on the right, a passive device
worn by the same lady,

00:08:58.887 --> 00:09:01.713
that fails to emulate
normal muscle function,
