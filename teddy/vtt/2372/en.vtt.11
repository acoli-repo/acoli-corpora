00:05:27.644 --> 00:05:31.264
that mirror my underlying
tissue biomechanics.

00:05:32.359 --> 00:05:35.533
To achieve that mirroring, we first
developed a mathematical model

00:05:35.557 --> 00:05:37.105
of my biological limb.

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:40.411
To that end, we used
imaging tools such as MRI,

00:05:40.435 --> 00:05:41.999
to look inside my body,

00:05:42.023 --> 00:05:45.728
to figure out the geometries
and locations of various tissues.

00:05:45.752 --> 00:05:47.139
We also took robotic tools --

00:05:47.163 --> 00:05:52.074
here's a 14-actuator circle
that goes around the biological limb.

00:05:52.891 --> 00:05:55.439
The actuators come in,
find the surface of the limb,

00:05:55.463 --> 00:05:57.708
measure its unloaded shape,

00:05:57.732 --> 00:05:59.383
and then they push on the tissues

00:05:59.407 --> 00:06:02.978
to measure tissue compliances
at each anatomical point.
