00:07:27.888 --> 00:07:30.318
When I walk here, it's no voltage.

00:07:30.342 --> 00:07:32.399
My interface is soft and compliant.

00:07:32.423 --> 00:07:35.414
The button's pushed,
voltage is applied, and it stiffens,

00:07:35.438 --> 00:07:38.454
offering me a greater maneuverability
over the bionic limb.

00:07:38.915 --> 00:07:40.751
We're also building exoskeletons.

00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:43.583
This exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft

00:07:43.607 --> 00:07:46.545
in just the right areas
of the running cycle,

00:07:46.569 --> 00:07:50.823
to protect the biological joints
from high impacts and degradation.

00:07:50.847 --> 00:07:53.633
In the future, we'll all
be wearing exoskeletons

00:07:53.657 --> 00:07:55.942
in common activities, such as running.

00:07:56.966 --> 00:07:58.450
Next, dynamic interface.

00:07:58.474 --> 00:08:00.982
How do my bionic limbs
move like flesh and bone?
