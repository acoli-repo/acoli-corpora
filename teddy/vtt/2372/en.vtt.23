00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:31.865
between the human
and the bionic external limb.

00:11:32.407 --> 00:11:33.558
We're doing experiments

00:11:33.582 --> 00:11:36.051
where we're growing nerves,
transected nerves,

00:11:36.075 --> 00:11:38.105
through channels, or micro-channel arrays.

00:11:38.129 --> 00:11:39.823
On the other side of the channel,

00:11:39.847 --> 00:11:42.176
the nerve then attaches to cells,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.108
skin cells and muscle cells.

00:11:44.926 --> 00:11:49.046
In the motor channels, we can sense
how the person wishes to move.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.707
That can be sent out wirelessly
to the bionic limb,

00:11:52.731 --> 00:11:55.112
then [sensory information]
on the bionic limb

00:11:55.137 --> 00:11:58.637
can be converted to stimulations
in adjacent channels,

00:11:58.662 --> 00:11:59.894
sensory channels.

00:11:59.918 --> 00:12:03.946
So when this is fully developed
and for human use,
