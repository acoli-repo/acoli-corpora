00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:32.164
and this mirroring occurs
across all tissue compliances.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.481
With this framework,
we've produced bionic limbs

00:06:35.505 --> 00:06:38.426
that are the most comfortable
limbs I've ever worn.

00:06:39.077 --> 00:06:45.166
Clearly, in the future, our clothing,
our shoes, our braces, our prostheses,

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.846
will no longer be designed
and manufactured using artisan strategies,

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.074
but rather, data-driven
quantitative frameworks.

00:06:52.098 --> 00:06:56.302
In that future, our shoes
will no longer give us blisters.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.937
We're also embedding
sensing and smart materials

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.532
into the synthetic skins.
