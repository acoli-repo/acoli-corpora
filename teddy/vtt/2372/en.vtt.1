In realms of genetics, regenerative
medicine and synthetic biology,

00:00:33.887 --> 00:00:36.592
designers are growing novel technologies,

00:00:36.616 --> 00:00:39.693
not foreseen or anticipated by nature.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.083
Bionics explores the interplay

00:00:47.107 --> 00:00:50.002
As you can see, my legs are bionic.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.514
Today, I will tell human stories
of bionic integration;

00:00:56.538 --> 00:01:02.237
how electromechanics attached
to the body, and implanted inside the body
