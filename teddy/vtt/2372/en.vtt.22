00:10:56.993 --> 00:11:00.088
the modeled spinal reflex,
with the neural signal,

00:11:00.112 --> 00:11:03.541
so when I relax my muscles
in my residual limb,

00:11:03.565 --> 00:11:06.412
I get very little torque and power,

00:11:06.436 --> 00:11:09.157
but the more I fire my muscles,
the more torque I get,

00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:10.593
and I can even run.

00:11:12.014 --> 00:11:16.958
And that was the first demonstration
of a running gait under neural command.

00:11:16.982 --> 00:11:18.134
Feels great.

00:11:18.158 --> 00:11:23.324
(Applause)

00:11:24.149 --> 00:11:25.534
We want to go a step further.

00:11:25.558 --> 00:11:28.605
We want to actually close the loop

00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:31.865
between the human
and the bionic external limb.
