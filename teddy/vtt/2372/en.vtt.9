00:04:27.942 --> 00:04:30.832
and electrical, how they communicate
with my nervous system.

00:04:30.856 --> 00:04:33.102
I'll begin with mechanical interface.

00:04:33.904 --> 00:04:37.047
In the area of design,
we still do not understand

00:04:37.071 --> 00:04:39.947
how to attach devices
to the body mechanically.

00:04:41.185 --> 00:04:44.328
It's extraordinary to me
that in this day and age,

00:04:44.352 --> 00:04:46.677
one of the most mature,
oldest technologies

00:04:46.701 --> 00:04:51.097
in the human timeline, the shoe,
still gives us blisters.

00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:52.578
How can this be?

00:04:52.602 --> 00:04:55.554
We have no idea how to attach
things to our bodies.

00:04:56.364 --> 00:04:59.269
This is the beautifully
lyrical design work
