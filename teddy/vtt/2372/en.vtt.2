00:00:56.538 --> 00:01:02.237
how electromechanics attached
to the body, and implanted inside the body

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:06.975
are beginning to bridge the gap
between disability and ability,

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:11.808
between human limitation
and human potential.

00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:15.363
Bionics has defined my physicality.

00:01:16.228 --> 00:01:18.680
In 1982, both of my legs were amputated

00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:20.808
due to tissue damage from frostbite,

00:01:20.832 --> 00:01:23.084
incurred during
a mountain-climbing accident.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.537
At that time, I didn't
view my body as broken.

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:32.758
I reasoned that a human being
can never be "broken."
