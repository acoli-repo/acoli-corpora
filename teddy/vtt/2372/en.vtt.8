00:03:55.682 --> 00:04:00.603
across a broad range
of brain and body disabilities.

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:05.444
Today, I'm going to tell you
how my legs function, how they work,

00:04:05.468 --> 00:04:08.746
as a case in point for this center.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.897
Now, I made sure to shave
my legs last night,

00:04:10.921 --> 00:04:12.868
because I knew I'd be showing them off.

00:04:12.892 --> 00:04:14.341
(Laughter)

00:04:14.365 --> 00:04:17.595
Bionics entails the engineering
of extreme interfaces.

00:04:17.619 --> 00:04:20.491
There's three extreme
interfaces in my bionic limbs:

00:04:20.515 --> 00:04:24.595
mechanical, how my limbs
are attached to my biological body;

00:04:24.619 --> 00:04:27.918
dynamic, how they move
like flesh and bone;

00:04:27.942 --> 00:04:30.832
and electrical, how they communicate
with my nervous system.
