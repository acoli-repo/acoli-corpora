As a testimony to current technology,
he is out of the wheelchair,

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.671
but we need to do a better job in bionics,
to allow, one day, full rehabilitation

00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:40.900
for a person with this level of injury.

00:03:41.876 --> 00:03:45.455
At the MIT Media Lab, we've established
the Center for Extreme Bionics.

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:50.027
The mission of the center
is to put forth fundamental science

00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:51.887
and technological capability

00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:55.658
that will allow the biomechatronic
and regenerative repair of humans,

00:03:55.682 --> 00:04:00.603
across a broad range
of brain and body disabilities.
