00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:32.143
because I've read about things
captive chimps could do --

00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:34.184
but I knew that science believed

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:37.559
that humans, and only humans,
used and made tools.

00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:40.809
And I knew how excited 
[Dr. Louis] Leakey would be.

00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:42.559
And it was that observation

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:45.643
that enabled him to go
to the National Geographic,

00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:49.726
and they said, "OK, we'll continue
to support the research,"

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.893
and they sent Hugo van Lawick,
the photographer-filmmaker,

00:04:53.917 --> 00:04:56.559
to record what I was seeing.

00:04:56.583 --> 00:05:01.018
So a lot of scientists
didn't want to believe the tool-using.
