00:09:57.792 --> 00:10:01.226
That that feels, even to someone
who spent so much time with chimpanzees,

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.434
that feels like a fundamentally
different skill set

00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:06.601
that we just have to take
responsibility for

00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:09.434
and use much more wisely than we do.

00:10:09.458 --> 00:10:11.351
JG: Yes, and I personally think,

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:13.684
I mean, there's a lot
of discussion about this,

00:10:13.708 --> 00:10:17.601
but I think it's a fact that we developed
the way of communication

00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:19.393
that you and I are using.

00:10:19.417 --> 00:10:21.518
And because we have words,

00:10:21.542 --> 00:10:24.934
I mean, animal communication
is way more sophisticated

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.226
than we used to think.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.226
And chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.708
can learn human sign language of the Deaf.
