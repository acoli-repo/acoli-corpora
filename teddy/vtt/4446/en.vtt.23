is about this passion for trying
not to screw up the natural world.

So is it possible, is it healthy,
is it essential, perhaps,

00:11:47.125 --> 00:11:51.976
to simultaneously accept
that many aspects of nature

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.934
are terrifying,

00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:56.851
but also, I don't know, that it's awesome,

00:11:56.875 --> 00:12:02.018
and that some of the awesomeness
comes from its potential to be terrifying
