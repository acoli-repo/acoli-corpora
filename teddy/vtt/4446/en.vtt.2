where it's lived harmoniously
for maybe hundreds of years,

00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:03.476
jumps into a new species,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.643
then you also get animals being pushed
into closer contact with humans.

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:14.643
And sometimes one of these animals
that has caught a virus can --

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:18.893
you know, provides the opportunity
for that virus to jump into people

00:01:18.917 --> 00:01:22.976
and create a new disease, like COVID-19.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.018

00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:29.518
We hunt them,

00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:31.851
we kill them, we eat them,
