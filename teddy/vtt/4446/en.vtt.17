00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:33.143
and Africa was very pristine
when I was young.

00:08:33.167 --> 00:08:36.101
And there were animals everywhere.

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:40.018
And I never liked the fact
that lions killed,

00:08:40.042 --> 00:08:42.559
they have to, I mean, that's what they do,

00:08:42.583 --> 00:08:46.393
if they didn't kill animals,
they would die.

00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:50.101
And the big difference
between them and us, I think,

00:08:50.125 --> 00:08:56.018
is that they do what they do
because that's what they have to do.

00:08:56.042 --> 00:08:59.393
And we can plan to do things.

00:08:59.417 --> 00:09:01.184
Our plans are very different.
