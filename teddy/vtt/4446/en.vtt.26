00:12:59.583 --> 00:13:01.309
growing up in inner cities,

00:13:01.333 --> 00:13:04.059
where there basically isn't any nature,

00:13:04.083 --> 00:13:09.143
which is why this movement now
to green our cities is so important.

00:13:09.167 --> 00:13:11.518
And you know, they've done experiments,

00:13:11.542 --> 00:13:14.809
I think it was in Chicago,
I'm not quite sure,

00:13:14.833 --> 00:13:17.893
and there were various empty lots

00:13:17.917 --> 00:13:21.684
in a very violent part of town.

00:13:21.708 --> 00:13:24.768
So in some of those areas
they made it green,

00:13:24.792 --> 00:13:29.809
they put trees and flowers and things,
shrubs in these vacant lots.

00:13:29.833 --> 00:13:33.184
And the crime rate went right down.
