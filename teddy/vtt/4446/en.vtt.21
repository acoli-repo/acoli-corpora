00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.708
can learn human sign language of the Deaf.

00:10:32.792 --> 00:10:38.226
But we sort of grow up speaking
whatever language it is.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.893
So I can tell you about things
that you've never heard of.

00:10:41.917 --> 00:10:44.476
And a chimpanzee couldn't do that.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:49.726
And we can teach our children
about abstract things.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.559
And chimpanzees couldn't do that.

00:10:51.583 --> 00:10:55.268
So yes, chimpanzees can do
all sorts of clever things,

00:10:55.292 --> 00:10:59.893
and so can elephants and so can crows
and so can octopuses,

00:10:59.917 --> 00:11:03.518
but we design rockets
that go off to another planet
