And many environmentalists
often seem to take the stance,

00:08:01.917 --> 00:08:06.059
"Yes, nature is pure,
nature is beautiful, humans are bad,"

00:08:06.083 --> 00:08:08.726
but then you have the kind of
observations that you see,

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.601
when you actually look
at any part of nature in more detail,

00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:13.976
you see things to be
terrified by, honestly.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.393
What do you make of nature,
how do you think of it,

00:08:16.417 --> 00:08:18.851
how should we think of it?

00:08:18.875 --> 00:08:20.851
JG: Nature is, you know,

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:24.809
I mean, you think of the whole
spectrum of evolution,

00:08:24.833 --> 00:08:28.518
and there's something about going
to a pristine place,

00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:33.143
and Africa was very pristine
when I was young.
