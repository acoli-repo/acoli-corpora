I mean, despite the arguably

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:08.268

00:02:08.292 --> 00:02:11.643
and become one of the world's
leading scientists,

00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:15.184
discovering this astonishing
series of facts about chimpanzees,

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:18.268

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.393
and the most important thing was,
I had a very supportive mother.
