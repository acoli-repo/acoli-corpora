Chris Anderson: Dr. Jane Goodall, welcome.

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:06.143
Jane Goodall: Thank you,

00:00:06.167 --> 00:00:10.101
and I think, you know,
we couldn't have a complete interview

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:12.268
unless people know Mr. H is with me,

00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:14.417
because everybody knows Mr. H.

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:17.625
CA: Hello, Mr. H.

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:20.934
In your TED Talk 17 years ago,

00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:26.684
you warned us about the dangers
of humans crowding out the natural world.

00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:28.559
Is there any sense in which you feel

00:00:28.583 --> 00:00:32.476
that the current pandemic
is kind of, nature striking back?
