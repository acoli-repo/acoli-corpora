00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:31.851
we kill them, we eat them,

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:33.393
we traffic them,

00:01:33.417 --> 00:01:39.809
we send them off
to the wild-animal markets

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.101
in Asia,

00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:44.434
where they're in terrible,
cramped conditions, in tiny cages,

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:48.768
with people being contaminated
with blood and urine and feces,

00:01:48.792 --> 00:01:53.434
ideal conditions for a virus
to spill from an animal to an animal,

00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:55.184
or an animal to a person.

00:01:55.208 --> 00:01:59.476
CA: I'd love to just dip
backwards in time for a bit,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.393
because your story is so extraordinary.
