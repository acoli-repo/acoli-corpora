00:15:57.625 --> 00:16:03.351
And so we're looking for short-term
monetary gain, or power,

00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:06.018
rather than the health of the planet

00:16:06.042 --> 00:16:08.083
and the future of our children.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.101
We don't seem to care about that anymore.

00:16:12.125 --> 00:16:15.226
That's why I'll never stop fighting.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:19.059
CA: I mean, in your work
specifically on chimpanzee conservation,

00:16:19.083 --> 00:16:24.268
you've made it practice
to put people at the center of that,

00:16:24.292 --> 00:16:26.393
local people, to engage them.

00:16:26.417 --> 00:16:27.684
How has that worked

00:16:27.708 --> 00:16:29.851
and do you think that's an essential idea

00:16:29.875 --> 00:16:32.934
if we're to succeed
in protecting the planet?
