00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:30.559
and it was to find out
how chimp behavior differed, if it did,

00:14:30.583 --> 00:14:32.143
from one environment to another.

00:14:32.167 --> 00:14:34.559
There were six study sites across Africa.

00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:38.268
So we thought, let’s bring
these scientists together

00:14:38.292 --> 00:14:39.684
and explore this,

00:14:39.708 --> 00:14:41.226
which was fascinating.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.893
But we also had a session on conservation

00:14:43.917 --> 00:14:47.768
and a session on conditions
in some captive situations

00:14:47.792 --> 00:14:49.893
like medical research.

00:14:49.917 --> 00:14:54.184
And those two sessions
were so shocking to me.

00:14:54.208 --> 00:14:56.768
I went to the conference a a scientist,

00:14:56.792 --> 00:14:58.351
and I left as an activist.

00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:02.184
I didn't make the decision,
something happened inside me.
