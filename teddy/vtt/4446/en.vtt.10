00:04:56.583 --> 00:05:01.018
So a lot of scientists
didn't want to believe the tool-using.

00:05:01.042 --> 00:05:04.101
In fact, one of them said
I must have taught the chimps.

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:06.018
(Laughter)

00:05:06.042 --> 00:05:08.934
Since I couldn't get near them,
it would have been a miracle.

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.559
But anyway, once they saw Hugo's film

00:05:11.583 --> 00:05:16.018
and that with all my descriptions
of their behavior,

00:05:16.042 --> 00:05:19.351
the scientists had to start
changing their minds.

00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:22.018
CA: And since then,
numerous other discoveries

00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:26.601
that placed chimpanzees much closer
to humans than people cared to believe.

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:29.976
I think I saw you say at one point
that they have a sense of humor.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.684
How have you seen that expressed?
