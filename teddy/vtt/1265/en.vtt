00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The electricity powering the lights in this theater

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
was generated just moments ago.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Because the way things stand today,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
electricity demand must be in constant balance

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
with electricity supply.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
some tens of megawatts of wind power

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
stopped pouring into the grid,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the difference would have to be made up

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
from other generators immediately.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
But coal plants, nuclear plants
