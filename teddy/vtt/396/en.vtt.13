00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:30.288
When we play, we live.

00:06:33.913 --> 00:06:36.204
I grew up in a time

00:06:36.246 --> 00:06:38.121
when all play was forbidden.

00:06:39.371 --> 00:06:42.663
My family's lives were crushed
by a communist dictatorship.

00:06:43.913 --> 00:06:47.704
For my aunt, my grandfather, my father,

00:06:47.746 --> 00:06:50.204
we always held two funerals:

00:06:50.246 --> 00:06:51.621
one for their bodies,

00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:53.163
but, years before that,

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:54.788
one for their dreams.

00:06:55.663 --> 00:06:59.371
Some of my biggest dreams are nightmares.
