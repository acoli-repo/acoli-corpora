00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:00.579
in the context of human rights,

00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:02.954
I meet raised eyebrows,

00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:06.871
eyebrows that say, "How irresponsible,"

00:06:06.913 --> 00:06:08.913
or, "How insensitive."

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:13.288
People often mistake play for negligence.

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:14.621
It is not.

00:06:16.204 --> 00:06:21.038
Play doesn't just grow our armies stronger
or spark better ideas.

00:06:21.746 --> 00:06:24.163
In times of painful injustice,

00:06:24.204 --> 00:06:27.246
play brings the levity we need
to be able to breathe.

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:30.288
When we play, we live.
