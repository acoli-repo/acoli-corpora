but our process is.

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.204
To us, play is an act of resistance.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:10.663
For example, "Beat.,"
the project I talked about earlier,

00:04:10.663 --> 00:04:14.913
is a concept developed by a drummer
and a software engineer

00:04:14.913 --> 00:04:18.079
who didn't know each other
two days before they pitched the idea.

00:04:19.163 --> 00:04:21.829
"Beat." is the first winner
in our lab series

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.038
where we pair artists and technologists
to work on human rights issues.

00:04:26.788 --> 00:04:30.163
Other winning concepts
include a pop-up bakery
