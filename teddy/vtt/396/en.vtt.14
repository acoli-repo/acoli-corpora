00:07:00.663 --> 00:07:04.954
I have a nightmare that one day
all the past will be forgotten

00:07:04.996 --> 00:07:08.204
and new clothes will be dripping
the blood of past mistakes.

00:07:09.538 --> 00:07:11.538
I have a nightmare

00:07:11.538 --> 00:07:15.038
that one day the lighthouses
of our humanity will crumble,

00:07:15.038 --> 00:07:17.329
corroded by acid waves of hate.

00:07:18.288 --> 00:07:20.913
But way more than that,

00:07:20.913 --> 00:07:22.246
I have hope.

00:07:23.163 --> 00:07:25.496
In our fights for justice and freedom,

00:07:25.496 --> 00:07:27.163
I hope that we play,

00:07:28.204 --> 00:07:32.746
and that we see the joy
and beauty of us playing together.
