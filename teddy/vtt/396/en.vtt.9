Other winning concepts
include a pop-up bakery

00:04:30.204 --> 00:04:34.496
that teaches about fake news through
beautiful but horrible-tasting cupcakes --

00:04:34.538 --> 00:04:37.371
(Laughter)

00:04:37.413 --> 00:04:41.288
or a board game that puts you
in the shoes of a dictator

00:04:41.288 --> 00:04:45.704
so you get to really grasp the range
of tools and tactics of oppression.

00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:50.621
We did our first lab
just to test the idea,

00:04:50.663 --> 00:04:53.413
to see where it cracks
and if we can make it better.

00:04:53.454 --> 00:04:56.704
Today, we are so in love with the format
that we put it all online

00:04:56.704 --> 00:04:58.329
for anyone to implement.

00:04:59.163 --> 00:05:02.746
I cannot overstate the value
of experimentation in activism.
