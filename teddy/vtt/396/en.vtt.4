00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:01.371
the ground quietly embraces
the body of a woman

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:04.163
murdered by a partner or a relative,

00:02:04.204 --> 00:02:05.996
we were loud,

00:02:06.038 --> 00:02:07.496
and we were heard.

00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:12.704
I am an activist,

00:02:12.746 --> 00:02:15.079
passionate about human rights innovation.

00:02:15.954 --> 00:02:19.871
I lead a global organization
for socially engaged creative solutions.

00:02:19.913 --> 00:02:24.746
In my work, I think about
how to make people care and act.

00:02:25.788 --> 00:02:30.954
I am here to tell you
that creative actions can save the world,
