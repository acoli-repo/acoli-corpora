00:03:29.704 --> 00:03:32.079
So to pull out of my own burnout,

00:03:32.121 --> 00:03:37.746
I decided to turn my activism
into what I call today "play-tivism."

00:03:38.163 --> 00:03:39.913
(Laughter)

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.579
When we play, others want to join.

00:03:44.246 --> 00:03:46.704
Today, my playground
is filled with artists,

00:03:46.746 --> 00:03:48.454
techies and scientists.

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.996
We fuse disciplines
in radical collaboration.

00:03:52.663 --> 00:03:55.704
Together, we seek new ways
to empower activism.

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.038
Our outcomes are not meant to be playful,

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.121
but our process is.
