I am here to tell you
that creative actions can save the world,

00:02:30.996 --> 00:02:33.621
creative actions and play.

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:39.704
I know it is weird to talk about play
and human rights in the same sentence,

00:02:39.746 --> 00:02:41.788
but here is why it's important.

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:46.829
More and more, we fear
that we can't win this.

00:02:47.496 --> 00:02:49.246
Campaigns feel dull,

00:02:49.288 --> 00:02:50.746
messages drown,

00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:52.788
people break.

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.038
Numerous studies, including a recent one
published by Columbia University,

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.746
show that burnout and depression
are widespread amongst activists.
