In the summer of 2017,

00:00:04.413 --> 00:00:07.538
a woman was murdered
by her partner in Sofia.

00:00:08.663 --> 00:00:11.788
The woman, let's call her "V,"

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:15.121
was beaten for over 50 minutes

00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:16.454
before she died.

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:19.204
The morning after,

00:00:19.204 --> 00:00:22.913
her neighbors told the press
that they heard her screams,

00:00:22.954 --> 00:00:24.538
but they didn't intervene.

00:00:25.788 --> 00:00:29.704
You see, in Bulgaria
and many other societies,

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:33.162
domestic violence is typically seen
as a private matter.
