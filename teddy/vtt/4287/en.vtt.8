Let me give you a very recent example,

00:04:01.457 --> 00:04:02.971
as in, like, last week.

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:06.239
Here's R.J. Ellory, best-seller author in Britain.

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.259
Here's one of his bestselling books.

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.672
Here's a reviewer online, on Amazon.

00:04:11.672 --> 00:04:14.329
My favorite, by Nicodemus Jones, is,

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.137
"Whatever else it might do, it will touch your soul."

00:04:18.137 --> 00:04:19.540
And of course, you might suspect

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.167
that Nicodemus Jones is R.J. Ellory.

00:04:22.167 --> 00:04:26.854
He wrote very, very positive reviews about himself. Surprise, surprise.

00:04:26.854 --> 00:04:30.114
Now this Sock Puppet stuff isn't actually that new.
