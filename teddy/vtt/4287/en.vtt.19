00:09:27.764 --> 00:09:30.253
That really is strange. How do we explain this?

00:09:30.253 --> 00:09:33.632
Well, to do that, one thing is we can look at the deception-detection literature.

00:09:33.632 --> 00:09:37.977
It's a very old literature by now, it's coming up on 50 years.

00:09:37.977 --> 00:09:40.639
It's been reviewed many times. There's been thousands of trials,

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:44.620
hundreds of studies, and there's some really compelling findings.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.856
The first is, we're really bad at detecting deception,

00:09:47.856 --> 00:09:51.972
really bad. Fifty-four percent accuracy on average when you have to tell

00:09:51.972 --> 00:09:55.356
if somebody that just said a statement is lying or not.

00:09:55.356 --> 00:09:58.548
That's really bad. Why is it so bad?

00:09:58.548 --> 00:10:01.078
Well it has to do with Pinocchio's nose.
