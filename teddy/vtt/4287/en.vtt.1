Much of the deception is everyday. In fact, a lot of research

00:00:30.456 --> 00:00:34.787
shows that we all lie once or twice a day, as Dave suggested.

00:00:34.787 --> 00:00:37.720
So it's about 6:30 now, suggests that most of us should have lied.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.620
Let's take a look at Winnipeg. How many of you,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.547
in the last 24 hours -- think back -- have told a little fib,

00:00:42.547 --> 00:00:46.098
or a big one? How many have told a little lie out there?

00:00:46.098 --> 00:00:48.002
All right, good. These are all the liars.

00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:51.295
Make sure you pay attention to them. (Laughter)

00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:53.441
No, that looked good, it was about two thirds of you.

00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:56.293
The other third didn't lie, or perhaps forgot,

00:00:56.293 --> 00:00:58.953
or you're lying to me about your lying, which is very,

00:00:58.953 --> 00:01:03.003
very devious. (Laughter) This fits with a lot of the research,
