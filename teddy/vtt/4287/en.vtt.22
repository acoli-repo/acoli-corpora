00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:01.337
a tiny portion of the population. We lie for a reason.

00:11:01.337 --> 00:11:02.968
Just because people can't see us doesn't mean

00:11:02.968 --> 00:11:05.239
we're going to necessarily lie.

00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:06.792
But I think there's actually something much more

00:11:06.792 --> 00:11:10.066
interesting and fundamental going on here. The next big

00:11:10.066 --> 00:11:13.863
thing for me, the next big idea, we can find by going

00:11:13.863 --> 00:11:17.002
way back in history to the origins of language.

00:11:17.002 --> 00:11:20.889
Most linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:24.057
between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. That's a long time ago.

00:11:24.057 --> 00:11:26.673
A lot of humans have lived since then.

00:11:26.673 --> 00:11:29.096
We've been talking, I guess, about fires and caves

00:11:29.096 --> 00:11:32.203
and saber-toothed tigers. I don't know what they talked about,
