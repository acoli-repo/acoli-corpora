00:03:27.312 --> 00:03:30.138
to create a buffer, like the butler used to do,

00:03:30.138 --> 00:03:33.545
between us and the connections to everybody else.

00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:35.252
But they're very special. They use ambiguity

00:03:35.252 --> 00:03:37.313
that comes from using technology. You don't know

00:03:37.313 --> 00:03:40.261
where I am or what I'm doing or who I'm with.

00:03:40.261 --> 00:03:42.752
And they're aimed at protecting the relationships.

00:03:42.752 --> 00:03:45.333
These aren't just people being jerks. These are people

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:47.709
that are saying, look, I don't want to talk to you now,

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.133
or I didn't want to talk to you then, but I still care about you.

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:52.533
Our relationship is still important.

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:54.047
Now, the Sock Puppet, on the other hand,

00:03:54.047 --> 00:03:56.390
is a totally different animal. The sock puppet isn't

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.455
about ambiguity, per se. It's about identity.

00:03:59.455 --> 00:04:01.457
Let me give you a very recent example,
