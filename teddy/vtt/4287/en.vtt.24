00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:03.236
So we've been evolving to talk in a way in which

00:12:03.236 --> 00:12:09.153
there is no record. In fact, even the next big change

00:12:09.153 --> 00:12:11.621
to writing was only 500 years ago now,

00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:14.000
with the printing press, which is very recent in our past,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.242
and literacy rates remained incredibly low right up until World War II,

00:12:18.242 --> 00:12:21.626
so even the people of the last two millennia,

00:12:21.626 --> 00:12:26.658
most of the words they ever said -- poof! -- disappeared.

00:12:26.658 --> 00:12:30.249
Let's turn to now, the networked age.
