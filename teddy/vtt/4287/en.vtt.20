Well it has to do with Pinocchio's nose.

00:10:01.078 --> 00:10:03.437
If I were to ask you guys, what do you rely on

00:10:03.437 --> 00:10:05.682
when you're looking at somebody and you want to find out

00:10:05.682 --> 00:10:08.612
if they're lying? What cue do you pay attention to?

00:10:08.612 --> 00:10:11.042
Most of you would say that one of the cues you look at

00:10:11.042 --> 00:10:13.770
is the eyes. The eyes are the window to the soul.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.173
And you're not alone. Around the world, almost every culture,

00:10:16.173 --> 00:10:19.036
one of the top cues is eyes. But the research

00:10:19.036 --> 00:10:22.860
over the last 50 years says there's actually no reliable cue

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.857
to deception, which blew me away, and it's one of

00:10:25.857 --> 00:10:28.212
the hard lessons that I learned when I was customs officer.

00:10:28.212 --> 00:10:30.642
The eyes do not tell us whether somebody's lying or not.
