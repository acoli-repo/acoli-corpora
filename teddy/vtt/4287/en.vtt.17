Now, as you see, most of the little dots are below the line.

00:08:31.818 --> 00:08:34.685
What it means is all the guys were lying about their height.

00:08:34.685 --> 00:08:37.626
In fact, they lied about their height about nine tenths of an inch,

00:08:37.626 --> 00:08:43.902
what we say in the lab as "strong rounding up." (Laughter)

00:08:43.902 --> 00:08:48.405
You get to 5'8" and one tenth, and boom! 5'9".

00:08:48.405 --> 00:08:50.403
But what's really important here is, look at all those dots.

00:08:50.403 --> 00:08:52.969
They are clustering pretty close to the truth. What we found

00:08:52.969 --> 00:08:55.377
was 80 percent of our participants did indeed lie

00:08:55.377 --> 00:08:58.972
on one of those dimensions, but they always lied by a little bit.

00:08:58.972 --> 00:09:01.996
One of the reasons is pretty simple. If you go to a date,
