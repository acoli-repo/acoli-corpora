00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.214
but that you believed in what you were doing.

00:01:38.214 --> 00:01:40.220
You believed in your principles.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.151
Now my first professional encounter with deception

00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:46.614
is a little bit later than these guys, a couple thousand years.

00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:50.413
I was a customs officer for Canada back in the mid-'90s.

00:01:50.413 --> 00:01:53.239
Yeah. I was defending Canada's borders.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:57.021
You may think that's a weapon right there. In fact,

00:01:57.021 --> 00:02:02.051
that's a stamp. I used a stamp to defend Canada's borders. (Laughter)
