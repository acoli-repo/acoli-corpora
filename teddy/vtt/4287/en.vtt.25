00:12:26.658 --> 00:12:30.249
Let's turn to now, the networked age.

00:12:30.249 --> 00:12:34.961
How many of you have recorded something today?

00:12:34.961 --> 00:12:38.138
Anybody do any writing today? Did anybody write a word?

00:12:38.138 --> 00:12:42.364
It looks like almost every single person here recorded something.

00:12:42.364 --> 00:12:45.412
In this room, right now, we've probably recorded more

00:12:45.412 --> 00:12:49.954
than almost all of human pre-ancient history.

00:12:49.954 --> 00:12:53.184
That is crazy. We're entering this amazing period

00:12:53.184 --> 00:12:57.199
of flux in human evolution where we've evolved to speak

00:12:57.199 --> 00:12:59.900
in a way in which our words disappear, but we're in

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.803
an environment where we're recording everything.
