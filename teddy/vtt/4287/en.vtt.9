Now this Sock Puppet stuff isn't actually that new.

00:04:30.114 --> 00:04:33.281
Walt Whitman also did this back in the day,

00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:36.336
before there was Internet technology. Sock Puppet

00:04:36.336 --> 00:04:39.104
becomes interesting when we get to scale,

00:04:39.104 --> 00:04:41.622
which is the domain of the Chinese Water Army.

00:04:41.622 --> 00:04:44.058
Chinese Water Army refers to thousands of people

00:04:44.058 --> 00:04:47.106
in China that are paid small amounts of money

00:04:47.106 --> 00:04:50.140
to produce content. It could be reviews. It could be

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.699
propaganda. The government hires these people,

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.327
companies hire them, all over the place.

00:04:55.327 --> 00:04:58.944
In North America, we call this Astroturfing,

00:04:58.944 --> 00:05:02.382
and Astroturfing is very common now. There's a lot of concerns about it.
