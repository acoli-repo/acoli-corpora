00:05:59.516 --> 00:06:02.887
are called diary studies, in which we ask people to record

00:06:02.887 --> 00:06:06.453
all of their conversations and all of their lies for seven days,

00:06:06.453 --> 00:06:09.558
and what we can do then is calculate how many lies took place

00:06:09.558 --> 00:06:12.506
per conversation within a medium, and the finding

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:15.030
that we get that surprises people the most is that email

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.309
is the most honest of those three media.

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:20.710
And it really throws people for a loop because we think,

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.446
well, there's no nonverbal cues, so why don't you lie more?

00:06:24.446 --> 00:06:28.750
The phone, in contrast, the most lies.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.696
Again and again and again we see the phone is the device
