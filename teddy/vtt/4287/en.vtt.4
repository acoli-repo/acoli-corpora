that's a stamp. I used a stamp to defend Canada's borders. (Laughter)

00:02:02.051 --> 00:02:05.588
Very Canadian of me. I learned a lot about deception

while doing my duty here in customs,

00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:11.527
one of which was that most of what I thought I knew about deception was wrong,

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:13.279

and of course that's had an impact on deception.

00:02:29.084 --> 00:02:31.667
Let me tell you a little bit about a couple of new deceptions
