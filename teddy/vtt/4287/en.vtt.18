One of the reasons is pretty simple. If you go to a date,

00:09:01.996 --> 00:09:05.597
a coffee date, and you're completely different than what you said,

00:09:05.597 --> 00:09:09.216
game over. Right? So people lied frequently, but they lied

00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:12.685
subtly, not too much. They were constrained.

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:15.572
Well, what explains all these studies? What explains the fact

00:09:15.572 --> 00:09:20.207
that despite our intuitions, mine included,

00:09:20.207 --> 00:09:23.736
a lot of online communication, technologically-mediated

00:09:23.736 --> 00:09:27.764
communication, is more honest than face to face?

00:09:27.764 --> 00:09:30.253
That really is strange. How do we explain this?
