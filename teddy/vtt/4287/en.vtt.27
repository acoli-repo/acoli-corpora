You remember those Astroturfing reviews that we were

00:13:33.454 --> 00:13:36.957
talking about before? Well, when they write a fake review,

00:13:36.957 --> 00:13:39.661
they have to post it somewhere, and it's left behind for us.

00:13:39.661 --> 00:13:42.096
So one thing that we did, and I'll give you an example of

00:13:42.096 --> 00:13:44.591
looking at the language, is we paid people

00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:48.126
to write some fake reviews. One of these reviews is fake.

00:13:48.126 --> 00:13:50.069
The person never was at the James Hotel.

00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:52.991
The other review is real. The person stayed there.

00:13:52.991 --> 00:13:56.518
Now, your task now is to decide

00:13:56.518 --> 00:14:00.591
which review is fake?
