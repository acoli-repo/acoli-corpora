In two decades of practicing medicine,

00:00:03.396 --> 00:00:06.956
I've encountered a wide number
of medical diagnoses.

00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:11.756
You see, it turns out that there are more
than 60,000 different medical diagnoses

00:00:11.796 --> 00:00:13.876
that you can list on a patient's chart.

00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:17.476
You can actually be diagnosed
with a burn injury

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:19.756
when your water skis catch on fire.

00:00:20.836 --> 00:00:25.316

hit by a spacecraft,

00:00:28.116 --> 00:00:29.116
(Laughter)

00:00:29.116 --> 00:00:31.116
stabbed while crocheting,
