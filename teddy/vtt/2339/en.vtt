00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:05.151
When I was approximately
nine weeks pregnant with my first child,

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:08.651
I found out I'm a carrier
for a fatal genetic disorder

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.341
called Tay-Sachs disease.

00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:12.291
What this means

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:16.204
is that one of the two copies
of chromosome number 15

00:00:16.228 --> 00:00:18.141
that I have in each of my cells

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:19.807
has a genetic mutation.

00:00:20.458 --> 00:00:23.490
Because I still have
one normal copy of this gene,

00:00:23.514 --> 00:00:25.580
the mutation doesn't affect me.

00:00:26.063 --> 00:00:29.904
But if a baby inherits this mutation
from both parents,

00:00:29.928 --> 00:00:34.237
if both copies of this particular gene
don't function properly,
