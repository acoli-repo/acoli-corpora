00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:30.117
My husband isn't a carrier,

00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:33.324
and we now have two beautiful
and healthy children.

00:01:35.602 --> 00:01:36.753
As I said,

00:01:36.777 --> 00:01:38.308
because of my Jewish background,

00:01:38.332 --> 00:01:43.498
I was aware of the unusually high rate
of Tay-Sachs in the Ashkenazi population.

00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:47.141
But it wasn't until a few years
after my daughter was born

00:01:47.165 --> 00:01:51.212
when I created and taught a seminar
in evolutionary medicine at Harvard,

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:52.831
that I thought to ask,

00:01:52.855 --> 00:01:55.220
and discovered a possible answer to,

00:01:55.244 --> 00:01:56.894
the question "why?"

00:01:57.252 --> 00:01:59.743
The process of evolution
by natural selection

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:02.429
typically eliminates harmful mutations.
