in Ashkenazi populations

00:05:06.823 --> 00:05:10.755
may be another example
of heterozygote advantage.

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:14.311
In this case, increasing
resistance to tuberculosis.

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:20.478
The first hint of a possible relationship
between Tay-Sachs and tuberculosis

00:05:20.502 --> 00:05:22.458
came in the 1970s,

00:05:22.482 --> 00:05:23.973
