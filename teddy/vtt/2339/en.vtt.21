inherent in the human body,

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.170
and the fact that the evolutionary process

00:10:34.194 --> 00:10:36.932
must work with the materials
already available.

00:10:37.298 --> 00:10:38.583
In many instances,

00:10:38.607 --> 00:10:40.910
a change that improves
survival or reproduction

00:10:40.934 --> 00:10:42.101
in one sense

00:10:42.125 --> 00:10:45.449
may have cascading effects
that carry their own risk.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.290
Evolution isn't an engineer
that starts from scratch

00:10:49.314 --> 00:10:52.593
to create optimal solutions
to individual problems.

00:10:53.077 --> 00:10:55.783
Evolution is all about compromise.

00:10:57.188 --> 00:10:58.736
It's also important to remember,

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.069
when considering
our bodies' vulnerabilities,
