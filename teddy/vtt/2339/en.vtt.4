00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:02.429
typically eliminates harmful mutations.

00:02:02.776 --> 00:02:06.329
So how did this defective gene
persist at all?

00:02:06.353 --> 00:02:09.408
And why is it found
at such a high frequency

00:02:09.432 --> 00:02:11.699
within this particular population?

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:17.093
The perspective of evolutionary medicine
offers valuable insight,

00:02:17.117 --> 00:02:19.522
because it examines how and why

00:02:19.546 --> 00:02:23.442
humans' evolutionary past
has left our bodies vulnerable

00:02:23.466 --> 00:02:26.057
to diseases and other problems today.

00:02:26.716 --> 00:02:28.057
In doing so,

00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:32.272
it demonstrates that natural selection
doesn't always make our bodies better.
