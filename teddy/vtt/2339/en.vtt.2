whose ancestry isn't Eastern
European Jewish like mine,

00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:01.770
had a very low likelihood

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:05.110
of also being a carrier
for the Tay-Sachs mutation.

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:07.863
While the frequency of heterozygotes,

00:01:07.887 --> 00:01:10.656
individuals who have
one normal copy of the gene

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.347
and one mutated copy,

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:18.355
is about one out of 27 people
among Jews of Ashkenazi descent, like me,

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:20.013
in most populations,

00:01:20.037 --> 00:01:24.275
only one in about 300 people
carry the Tay-Sachs mutation.

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:28.363
Thankfully, it turned out I was right
not to worry too much.

00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:30.117
My husband isn't a carrier,
