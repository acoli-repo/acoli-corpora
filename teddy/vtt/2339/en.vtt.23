The mutation's detrimental effects

00:11:30.149 --> 00:11:34.561
usually don't appear until after
the typical age of reproduction,

00:11:34.585 --> 00:11:38.101
when affected individuals
have already passed on their genes.

00:11:38.855 --> 00:11:40.030
As a whole,

00:11:40.054 --> 00:11:43.744
the biomedical community
focuses on proximate explanations

00:11:43.768 --> 00:11:46.529
and uses them to shape
treatment approaches.

00:11:46.942 --> 00:11:49.586
Proximate explanations
for health conditions

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.751
consider the immediate factors:

00:11:51.775 --> 00:11:54.704
What's going on inside
someone's body right now

00:11:54.728 --> 00:11:56.861
that caused a particular problem.

00:11:57.196 --> 00:11:58.934
Nearsightedness, for example,

00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.268
is usually the result of changes
to the shape of the eye
