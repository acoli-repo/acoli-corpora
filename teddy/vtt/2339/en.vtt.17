00:08:29.315 --> 00:08:32.625
So heterozygote advantage can help explain

00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:36.395
why problematic versions of genes
persist at high frequencies

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:37.952
in certain populations.

00:08:38.482 --> 00:08:41.933
But this is only one of the contributions
evolutionary medicine can make

00:08:41.957 --> 00:08:44.106
in helping us understand human health.

00:08:44.686 --> 00:08:46.051
As I mentioned earlier,

00:08:46.075 --> 00:08:48.003
this field challenges the notion

00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:51.051
that our bodies should have gotten
better over time.

00:08:51.075 --> 00:08:54.173
An idea that often stems
from a misconception

00:08:54.197 --> 00:08:56.347
of how evolution works.

00:08:57.363 --> 00:08:58.537
In a nutshell,

00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:01.228
there are three basic reasons
why human bodies,
