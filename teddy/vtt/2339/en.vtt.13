00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:30.840
in an environment
where tuberculosis was prevalent.

00:06:32.135 --> 00:06:33.491
You'll notice, though,

00:06:33.515 --> 00:06:37.213
that this explanation
only fills in part of the puzzle.

00:06:37.803 --> 00:06:40.983
Even if the Tay-Sachs mutation persisted

00:06:41.007 --> 00:06:43.572
because carriers
were more likely to survive,

00:06:43.596 --> 00:06:46.771
reproduce and pass on
their genetic material,

00:06:46.795 --> 00:06:49.443
why did this resistance
mechanism proliferate

00:06:49.467 --> 00:06:52.534
among the Ashkenazi
population in particular?

00:06:53.626 --> 00:06:58.745
One possibility is that the genes
and health of Eastern European Jews

00:06:58.769 --> 00:07:01.516
were affected not simply by geography
