WEBVTT

00:07:59.522 --> 00:08:01.038
traced their descent

00:08:01.062 --> 00:08:05.098
to those European countries
where the incidence of TB was highest.

00:08:05.678 --> 00:08:09.280
The benefits of being
a Tay-Sachs carrier were highest

00:08:09.304 --> 00:08:13.090
in those places where the risk
of death due to TB was greatest.

00:08:13.561 --> 00:08:16.743
And while it was unclear
in the 1970s or '80s

00:08:16.767 --> 00:08:21.950
how exactly the Tay-Sachs mutation
offered protection against TB,

00:08:21.974 --> 00:08:23.761
recent work has identified

00:08:23.785 --> 00:08:27.816
how the mutation increases
cellular defenses against the bacterium.

00:08:29.315 --> 00:08:32.625
So heterozygote advantage can help explain
