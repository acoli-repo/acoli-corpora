it demonstrates that natural selection
doesn't always make our bodies better.

00:02:32.296 --> 00:02:34.025
It can't necessarily.

00:02:34.597 --> 00:02:37.394
But as I hope to illustrate
with my own story,

00:02:37.418 --> 00:02:40.934
understanding the implications
of your evolutionary past

00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.839
can help enrich your personal health.

00:02:45.148 --> 00:02:49.076
When I started investigating Tay-Sachs
using an evolutionary perspective,

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.012
I came across an intriguing hypothesis.

00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:55.338
The unusually high rate
of the Tay-Sachs mutation

00:02:55.362 --> 00:02:57.704
in Ashkenazi Jews today

00:02:57.728 --> 00:03:01.561
may relate to advantages
the mutation gave this population
