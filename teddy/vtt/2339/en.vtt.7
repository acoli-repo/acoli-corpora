00:03:29.028 --> 00:03:31.258
and pass on their genetic material,

00:03:31.282 --> 00:03:33.249
including that mutated gene.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:40.425
This idea that there can be circumstances
in which heterozygotes are better off

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.774
might sound familiar to some of you.

00:03:43.076 --> 00:03:45.966
Evolutionary biologists
call this phenomenon

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.260
heterozygote advantage.

00:03:48.284 --> 00:03:50.879
And it explains, for example,

00:03:50.903 --> 00:03:52.895
why carriers of sickle cell anemia

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.942
are more common among
some African and Asian populations

00:03:56.966 --> 00:04:00.101
or those with ancestry
from these tropical regions.
