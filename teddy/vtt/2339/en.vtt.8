00:03:56.966 --> 00:04:00.101
or those with ancestry
from these tropical regions.

00:04:00.768 --> 00:04:05.791
In these geographic regions,
malaria poses significant risks to health.

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:09.164
The parasite that causes malaria, though,

00:04:09.188 --> 00:04:14.688
can only complete its life cycle
in normal, round red blood cells.

00:04:15.493 --> 00:04:18.548
By changing the shape
of a person's red blood cells,

00:04:18.572 --> 00:04:22.865
the sickle cell mutation
confers protection against malaria.

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:26.521
People with the mutation
aren't less likely to get bitten

00:04:26.545 --> 00:04:29.045
by the mosquitoes
that transmit the disease,

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.704
but they are less likely to get sick
or die as a result.
