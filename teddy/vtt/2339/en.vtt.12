00:05:57.427 --> 00:06:01.149
had been equally likely
to contract TB during this time,

00:06:01.173 --> 00:06:04.791
the death rate among non-Jews
was twice as high.

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:08.831
But the hypothesis
that these Ashkenazi grandparents

00:06:08.855 --> 00:06:11.387
had been less likely to die of TB

00:06:11.411 --> 00:06:16.005
specifically because at least some of them
were Tay-Sachs carriers

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:17.949
was novel and compelling.

00:06:18.545 --> 00:06:19.696
The data hinted

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.886
that the persistence
of the Tay-Sachs mutation

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.616
among Ashkenazi Jews

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.237
might be explained by the benefits
of being a carrier

00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:30.840
in an environment
where tuberculosis was prevalent.
