00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.069
when considering
our bodies' vulnerabilities,

00:11:01.093 --> 00:11:03.276
that from an evolutionary perspective,

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.839
health isn't the most important currency.

00:11:05.863 --> 00:11:07.568
Reproduction is.

00:11:07.592 --> 00:11:11.727
Success is measured
not by how healthy an individual is,

00:11:11.751 --> 00:11:13.601
or by how long she lives,

00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:17.570
but by how many copies of her genes
she passes to the next generation.

00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:19.833
This explains why a mutation

00:11:19.857 --> 00:11:22.386
like the one that causes
Huntington's disease,

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.085
another degenerative
neurological disorder,

00:11:25.109 --> 00:11:28.338
hasn't been eliminated
by natural selection.

00:11:28.362 --> 00:11:30.125
The mutation's detrimental effects
