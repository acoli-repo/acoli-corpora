00:02:57.728 --> 00:03:01.561
may relate to advantages
the mutation gave this population

00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:02.735
in the past.

00:03:03.665 --> 00:03:05.506
Now I'm sure some of you are thinking,

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.498
"I'm sorry, did you just suggest
that this disease-causing mutation

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:11.728
had beneficial effects?"

00:03:11.752 --> 00:03:13.149
Yeah, I did.

00:03:13.173 --> 00:03:16.824
Certainly not for individuals
who inherited two copies of the mutation

00:03:16.848 --> 00:03:18.466
and had Tay-Sachs.

00:03:18.847 --> 00:03:20.769
But under certain circumstances,

00:03:20.793 --> 00:03:21.959
people like me,

00:03:21.983 --> 00:03:25.107
who had only one faulty gene copy,

00:03:25.131 --> 00:03:29.004
may have been more likely
to survive, reproduce

00:03:29.028 --> 00:03:31.258
and pass on their genetic material,
