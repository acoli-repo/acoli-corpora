00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:32.704
but they are less likely to get sick
or die as a result.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.204
Being a carrier for sickle cell anemia

00:04:36.228 --> 00:04:39.109
is therefore the best
possible genetic option

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:40.866
in a malarial environment.

00:04:41.276 --> 00:04:43.654
Carriers are less susceptible to malaria,

00:04:43.678 --> 00:04:46.640
because they make some
sickled red blood cells,

00:04:46.664 --> 00:04:49.514
but they make enough
normal red blood cells

00:04:49.538 --> 00:04:53.156
that they aren't negatively affected
by sickle cell anemia.

00:04:55.292 --> 00:04:56.450
Now in my case,

00:04:56.474 --> 00:05:00.450
the defective gene I carry
won't protect me against malaria.
