00:09:58.075 --> 00:10:00.840
so it can continue
using our bodies as a host.

00:10:02.481 --> 00:10:04.751
Now what does it mean
that there are limitations

00:10:04.775 --> 00:10:07.100
to the changes natural selection can make?

00:10:07.124 --> 00:10:09.965
Again, my examples
of heterozygote advantage

00:10:09.989 --> 00:10:11.856
offer a useful illustration.

00:10:12.506 --> 00:10:15.371
In terms of resisting TB and malaria,

00:10:15.395 --> 00:10:19.989
the physiological effects of the Tay-Sachs
and sickle cell anemia mutations

00:10:20.013 --> 00:10:21.385
are good.

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:23.434
Taken to their extremes, though,

00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:25.759
they cause significant problems.

00:10:26.339 --> 00:10:29.458
This delicate balance
highlights the constraints

00:10:29.482 --> 00:10:31.456
inherent in the human body,
