00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:01.228
there are three basic reasons
why human bodies,

00:09:01.252 --> 00:09:03.236
including yours and mine,

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.942
remain vulnerable to diseases
and other health problems today.

00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:09.561
Natural selection acts slowly,

00:09:09.585 --> 00:09:12.291
there are limitations
to the changes it can make

00:09:12.315 --> 00:09:15.450
and it optimizes for reproductive success,

00:09:15.474 --> 00:09:17.109
not health.

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:21.799
The way the pace of natural selection
affects human health

00:09:21.823 --> 00:09:23.537
is probably most obvious

00:09:23.561 --> 00:09:26.934
in people's relationship
with infectious pathogens.

00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:31.287
We're in a constant arms race
with bacteria and viruses.
