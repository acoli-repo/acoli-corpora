00:06:58.769 --> 00:07:01.516
were affected not simply by geography

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.905
but also by historical
and cultural factors.

00:07:05.588 --> 00:07:07.302
At various points in history

00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:10.910
this population was forced to live
in crowded urban ghettos

00:07:10.934 --> 00:07:12.334
with poor sanitation.

00:07:12.688 --> 00:07:16.704
Ideal conditions for the tuberculosis
bacterium to thrive.

00:07:17.284 --> 00:07:21.823
In these environments,
where TB posed an especially high threat,

00:07:21.847 --> 00:07:26.649
those individuals who were not carriers
of any genetic protection

00:07:26.673 --> 00:07:29.006
would have been more likely to die.
