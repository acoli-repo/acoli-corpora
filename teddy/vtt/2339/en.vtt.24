00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.268
is usually the result of changes
to the shape of the eye

00:12:02.292 --> 00:12:05.025
and can be easily corrected with glasses.

00:12:06.061 --> 00:12:09.188
But as with the genetic
conditions I've discussed,

00:12:09.212 --> 00:12:13.267
a proximate explanation
only provides part of the bigger picture.

00:12:13.776 --> 00:12:16.323
Adopting an evolutionary perspective

00:12:16.347 --> 00:12:20.608
to consider the broader question
of why do we have this problem

00:12:20.632 --> 00:12:22.212
to begin with --

00:12:22.236 --> 00:12:26.340
what evolutionary medicine calls
the ultimate perspective --

00:12:26.364 --> 00:12:29.277
can give us insight
into nonimmediate factors

00:12:29.301 --> 00:12:30.835
that affect our health.
