00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:31.287
We're in a constant arms race
with bacteria and viruses.

00:09:31.311 --> 00:09:36.184
Our immune system is continuously evolving
to limit their ability to infect,

00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:40.776
and they are continuously developing ways
to outmaneuver our defenses.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.815
And our species
is at a distinct disadvantage

00:09:43.839 --> 00:09:46.839
due to our long lives
and slow reproduction.

00:09:47.419 --> 00:09:52.011
In the time it takes us
to evolve one mechanism of resistance,

00:09:52.035 --> 00:09:56.138
a pathogenic species
will go through millions of generations,

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:58.051
giving it ample time to evolve,

00:09:58.075 --> 00:10:00.840
so it can continue
using our bodies as a host.
