You might have heard that light is a kind of wave

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:18.947
and that the color of an object

00:00:18.947 --> 00:00:22.133
is related to the frequency of light waves it reflects.

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.216
High-frequency light waves look violet,

00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:26.019
low-frequency light waves look red,

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:27.931
and in-between frequencies look yellow,

00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:28.383
green,

00:00:28.383 --> 00:00:29.020
orange,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.662
and so on.
