00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.662
and so on.

00:00:30.662 --> 00:00:32.988
You might call this idea physical color

00:00:32.988 --> 00:00:36.677
because it says that color is a physical property of light itself.

00:00:36.677 --> 00:00:39.085
It's not dependent on human perception.

00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:41.245
And, while this isn't wrong,

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:43.748
it isn't quite the whole story either.

00:00:43.748 --> 00:00:47.322
For instance, you might have seen this picture before.

00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:51.781
As you can see, the region where the red and green lights overlap is yellow.

00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:54.156
When you think about it, this is pretty weird.

00:00:54.156 --> 00:00:56.733
Because light is a wave, two different frequencies

00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.895
shouldn't interact with each other at all,

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:00.212
they should just co-exist
