There are infinitely many different physical colors,

00:03:02.122 --> 00:03:04.830
but, because we only have three kinds of cones,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.744
the brain can be tricked into thinking it's seeing any color

00:03:07.744 --> 00:03:10.813
by carefully adding together the right combination

00:03:10.813 --> 00:03:12.419
of just three colors:

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.065
red, green, and blue.

00:03:14.065 --> 00:03:17.789
This property of human vision is really useful in the real world.

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:20.079
For example, TV manufacturing.

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.156
Instead of having to put infinitely many colors in your TV set

00:03:23.156 --> 00:03:24.600
to simulate the real world,

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.154
TV manufacturers only have to put three:

00:03:27.154 --> 00:03:29.291
red, green, and blue,

00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:31.614
which is lucky for them, really.
