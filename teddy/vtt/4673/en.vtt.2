00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:00.212
they should just co-exist

00:01:00.212 --> 00:01:02.468
like singers singing in harmony.

00:01:02.468 --> 00:01:04.501
So, in this yellow looking region,

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:07.372
two different kinds of light waves are present:

00:01:07.372 --> 00:01:08.907
one with a red frequency,

00:01:08.907 --> 00:01:10.667
and one with a green frequency.

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:13.122
There is no yellow light present at all.

00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:14.473
So, how come this region,

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:16.620
where the red and green lights mix,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.542
looks yellow to us?

00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:22.054
To understand this, you have to understand a little bit about biology,

00:01:22.054 --> 00:01:25.131
in particular, about how humans see color.

00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:28.463
Light perception happens in a paper-thin layer of cells,

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:29.422
called the retina,

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:31.672
that covers the back of your eyeball.
