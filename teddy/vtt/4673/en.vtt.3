00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:31.672
that covers the back of your eyeball.

00:01:31.672 --> 00:01:35.532
In the retina, there are two different types of light-detecting cells:

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:37.855
rods and cones.

00:01:37.855 --> 00:01:40.437
The rods are used for seeing in low-light conditions,

00:01:40.437 --> 00:01:42.680
and there is only one kind of those.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.672
The cones, however, are a different story.

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:47.984
There three kinds of cone cells that roughly correspond

00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:49.338
to the colors red,

00:01:49.338 --> 00:01:49.824
green,

00:01:49.824 --> 00:01:51.318
and blue.

00:01:51.318 --> 00:01:52.934
When you see a color,

00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:56.758
each cone sends its own distinct signal to your brain.

00:01:56.758 --> 00:01:58.985
For example, suppose that yellow light,

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:01.548
that is real yellow light, with a yellow frequency,
