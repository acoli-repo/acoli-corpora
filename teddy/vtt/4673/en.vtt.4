00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:01.548
that is real yellow light, with a yellow frequency,

00:02:01.548 --> 00:02:03.155
is shining on your eye.

00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:06.052
You don't have a cone specifically for detecting yellow,

00:02:06.052 --> 00:02:08.088
but yellow is kind of close to green

00:02:08.088 --> 00:02:09.553
and also kind of close to red,

00:02:09.553 --> 00:02:12.152
so both the red and green cones get activated,

00:02:12.152 --> 00:02:16.179
and each sends a signal to your brain saying so.

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:18.145
Of course, there is another way to activate

00:02:18.145 --> 00:02:21.142
the red cones and the green cones simultaneously:

00:02:21.142 --> 00:02:24.742
if both red light and green light are present at the same time.

00:02:24.742 --> 00:02:28.120
The point is, your brain receives the same signal,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.642
regardless of whether you see light that has the yellow frequency
