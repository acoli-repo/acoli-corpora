00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.642
regardless of whether you see light that has the yellow frequency

00:02:31.642 --> 00:02:35.189
or light that is a mixture of the green and red frequencies.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.328
That's why, for light, red plus green equals yellow.

00:02:39.328 --> 00:02:42.781
And, how come you can't detect colors when it's dark?

00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:45.360
Well, the rod cells in your retina take over

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.987
in low-light conditions.

00:02:46.987 --> 00:02:48.989
You only have one kind of rod cell,

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.976
and so there is one type of signal

00:02:50.976 --> 00:02:52.598
that can get sent to your brain:

00:02:52.598 --> 00:02:54.591
light or no light.

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:57.059
Having only one kind of light detector

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:59.713
doesn't leave any room for seeing color.

00:02:59.713 --> 00:03:02.122
There are infinitely many different physical colors,
