00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:04.861
So, I started my first job
as a computer programmer

00:00:04.885 --> 00:00:06.841
in my very first year of college --

00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:08.372
basically, as a teenager.

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:10.621
Soon after I started working,

00:00:10.645 --> 00:00:12.255
writing software in a company,

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.434
a manager who worked at the company
came down to where I was,

00:00:16.458 --> 00:00:17.726
and he whispered to me,

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:21.090
"Can he tell if I'm lying?"

00:00:21.806 --> 00:00:23.883
There was nobody else in the room.

00:00:25.032 --> 00:00:29.421
"Can who tell if you're lying?
And why are we whispering?"
