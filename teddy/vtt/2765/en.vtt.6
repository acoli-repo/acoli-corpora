00:02:59.732 --> 00:03:04.230
There, we have agreed-upon,
fairly clear benchmarks,

00:03:04.254 --> 00:03:06.493
and we have laws of nature to guide us.

00:03:06.517 --> 00:03:09.911
We have no such anchors and benchmarks

00:03:09.935 --> 00:03:13.898
for decisions in messy human affairs.

00:03:13.922 --> 00:03:18.159
To make things more complicated,
our software is getting more powerful,

00:03:18.183 --> 00:03:21.956
but it's also getting less
transparent and more complex.

00:03:22.542 --> 00:03:24.582
Recently, in the past decade,

00:03:24.606 --> 00:03:27.335
complex algorithms
have made great strides.

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.349
They can recognize human faces.

00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:32.040
They can decipher handwriting.
