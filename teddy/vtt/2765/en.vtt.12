00:05:59.006 --> 00:06:02.068
and she'd say, "Zeynep,
let's go to lunch!"

00:06:02.724 --> 00:06:04.891
I'd be puzzled by the weird timing.

00:06:04.915 --> 00:06:07.044
It's 4pm. Lunch?

00:06:07.068 --> 00:06:10.162
I was broke, so free lunch. I always went.

00:06:10.618 --> 00:06:12.685
I later realized what was happening.

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:17.255
My immediate managers
had not confessed to their higher-ups

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:20.392
that the programmer they hired
for a serious job was a teen girl

00:06:20.416 --> 00:06:24.346
who wore jeans and sneakers to work.

00:06:25.174 --> 00:06:27.376
I was doing a good job,
I just looked wrong

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.099
and was the wrong age and gender.

00:06:29.123 --> 00:06:32.469
So hiring in a gender- and race-blind way
