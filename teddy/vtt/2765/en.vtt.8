00:03:59.584 --> 00:04:01.240
including unstructured data,

00:04:01.264 --> 00:04:03.542
like the kind we generate
in our digital lives.

00:04:03.566 --> 00:04:06.296
And the system learns
by churning through this data.

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.195
And also, crucially,

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:12.599
these systems don't operate
under a single-answer logic.

00:04:12.623 --> 00:04:15.582
They don't produce a simple answer;
it's more probabilistic:

00:04:15.606 --> 00:04:19.089
"This one is probably more like
what you're looking for."

00:04:20.023 --> 00:04:23.093
Now, the upside is:
this method is really powerful.

00:04:23.117 --> 00:04:25.193
The head of Google's AI systems called it,

00:04:25.217 --> 00:04:27.414
"the unreasonable effectiveness of data."

00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:29.144
The downside is,

00:04:29.738 --> 00:04:32.809
we don't really understand
what the system learned.
