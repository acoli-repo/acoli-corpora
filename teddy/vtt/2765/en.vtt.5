"Which update from which friend
should you be shown?"

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.145
"Which convict is more
likely to reoffend?"

00:02:33.514 --> 00:02:36.568
"Which news item or movie
should be recommended to people?"

00:02:36.592 --> 00:02:39.964
Look, yes, we've been using
computers for a while,

00:02:39.988 --> 00:02:41.505
but this is different.

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:43.596
This is a historical twist,

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.957
because we cannot anchor computation
for such subjective decisions

00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:54.401
the way we can anchor computation
for flying airplanes, building bridges,

00:02:54.425 --> 00:02:55.684
going to the moon.

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:59.708

00:02:59.732 --> 00:03:04.230
There, we have agreed-upon,
fairly clear benchmarks,
