00:04:29.738 --> 00:04:32.809
we don't really understand
what the system learned.

00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:34.420
In fact, that's its power.

00:04:34.946 --> 00:04:38.744
This is less like giving
instructions to a computer;

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.264
it's more like training
a puppy-machine-creature

00:04:43.288 --> 00:04:45.659
we don't really understand or control.

00:04:46.362 --> 00:04:47.913
So this is our problem.

00:04:48.427 --> 00:04:52.689
It's a problem when this artificial
intelligence system gets things wrong.

00:04:52.713 --> 00:04:56.253
It's also a problem
when it gets things right,

00:04:56.277 --> 00:04:59.905
because we don't even know which is which
when it's a subjective problem.

00:04:59.929 --> 00:05:02.268
We don't know what this thing is thinking.
