00:05:29.163 --> 00:05:30.369
high-level people,

00:05:30.393 --> 00:05:31.952
using such systems in hiring.

00:05:31.976 --> 00:05:33.622
They were super excited.

00:05:33.646 --> 00:05:38.299
They thought that this would make hiring
more objective, less biased,

00:05:38.323 --> 00:05:41.323
and give women
and minorities a better shot

00:05:41.347 --> 00:05:43.535
against biased human managers.

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:46.402
And look -- human hiring is biased.

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:48.284
I know.

00:05:48.308 --> 00:05:51.313
I mean, in one of my early jobs
as a programmer,

00:05:51.337 --> 00:05:55.205
my immediate manager would sometimes
come down to where I was

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.982
really early in the morning
or really late in the afternoon,

00:05:59.006 --> 00:06:02.068
and she'd say, "Zeynep,
let's go to lunch!"
