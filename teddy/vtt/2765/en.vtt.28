00:14:00.946 --> 00:14:02.174
Instead, that week,

00:14:02.198 --> 00:14:04.496
Facebook's algorithm highlighted this,

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.746
which is the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.512
Worthy cause; dump ice water,
donate to charity, fine.

00:14:10.536 --> 00:14:12.440
But it was super algorithm-friendly.

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:15.832
The machine made this decision for us.

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:19.353
A very important
but difficult conversation

00:14:19.377 --> 00:14:20.932
might have been smothered,

00:14:20.956 --> 00:14:23.652
had Facebook been the only channel.

00:14:24.117 --> 00:14:27.914
Now, finally, these systems
can also be wrong

00:14:27.938 --> 00:14:30.674
in ways that don't resemble human systems.
