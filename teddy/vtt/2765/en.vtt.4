00:01:57.707 --> 00:02:00.920
They're even building machines, weapons,

00:02:00.944 --> 00:02:03.229
that might kill human beings in war.

00:02:03.253 --> 00:02:06.024
It's ethics all the way down.

00:02:07.183 --> 00:02:09.241
Machine intelligence is here.

00:02:09.823 --> 00:02:13.297
We're now using computation
to make all sort of decisions,

00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:15.207
but also new kinds of decisions.

00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:20.403
We're asking questions to computation
that have no single right answers,

00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:21.629
that are subjective

00:02:21.653 --> 00:02:23.978
and open-ended and value-laden.

00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:25.760
We're asking questions like,

00:02:25.784 --> 00:02:27.434
"Who should the company hire?"

00:02:28.096 --> 00:02:30.855
"Which update from which friend
should you be shown?"
