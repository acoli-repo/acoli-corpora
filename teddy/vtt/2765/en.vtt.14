00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.515
They have predictive power
with high levels of accuracy.

00:07:01.362 --> 00:07:03.940
Remember -- for things
you haven't even disclosed.

00:07:03.964 --> 00:07:05.555
This is inference.

00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:08.840
I have a friend who developed
such computational systems

00:07:08.864 --> 00:07:12.505
to predict the likelihood
of clinical or postpartum depression

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:13.945
from social media data.

00:07:14.676 --> 00:07:16.103
The results are impressive.

00:07:16.492 --> 00:07:19.849
Her system can predict
the likelihood of depression

00:07:19.873 --> 00:07:23.776
months before the onset of any symptoms --

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.173
months before.

00:07:25.197 --> 00:07:27.443
No symptoms, there's prediction.

00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:32.279
She hopes it will be used
for early intervention. Great!
