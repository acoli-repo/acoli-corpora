00:00:00.843 --> 00:00:03.434
In 2007, I became the attorney general

00:00:03.434 --> 00:00:05.159
of the state of New Jersey.

00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:07.439
Before that, I'd been a criminal prosecutor,

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.120
first in the Manhattan district attorney's office,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.770
and then at the United States Department of Justice.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.971
But when I became the attorney general,

00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:18.866
two things happened that changed 
the way I see criminal justice.

00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.896
The first is that I asked what I thought

00:00:20.896 --> 00:00:23.082
were really basic questions.

00:00:23.082 --> 00:00:25.938
I wanted to understand who we were arresting,

00:00:25.938 --> 00:00:27.602
who we were charging,

00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:29.730
and who we were putting in our nation's jails

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.146
and prisons.
