This is called Hooked on a Feeling:

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The Pursuit of Happiness and Human Design.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I put up a somewhat dour Darwin,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but a very happy chimp up there.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
My first point is that the pursuit of happiness is obligatory.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Man wishes to be happy, only wishes to be happy,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and cannot wish not to be so.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We are wired to pursue happiness,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
not only to enjoy it, but to want more and more of it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So given that that's true,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
how good are we at increasing our happiness?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Well, we certainly try.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
