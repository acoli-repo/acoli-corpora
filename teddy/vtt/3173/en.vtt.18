The third wobble is authenticity,
and I find it to be the most vexing.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.104
We as a human species
can sniff out in a moment,

00:09:09.128 --> 00:09:11.116
literally in a moment,

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.164
whether or not someone
is being their authentic true self.

00:09:15.705 --> 00:09:17.990
So in many ways,
the prescription is clear.

00:09:18.948 --> 00:09:22.174
You don't want to have
an authenticity wobble? Be you.

00:09:23.675 --> 00:09:24.881
Great.

00:09:26.255 --> 00:09:28.525
And that is super easy to do

00:09:28.549 --> 00:09:31.890
when you're around people
who are like you.
