But fortunately, it's often the case
that our logic is sound,

00:07:05.782 --> 00:07:11.271
but it's our ability to communicate
the logic that is in jeopardy.

00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:14.873
Super fortunately,
there's a very easy fix to this.

00:07:15.673 --> 00:07:21.643
If we consider that there are
two ways to communicate in the world,

00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:24.810
and Harvard Business School professors
are known for two-by-twos --

00:07:24.834 --> 00:07:27.302
nonsense, it's the triangle that rocks.

00:07:27.326 --> 00:07:29.482
