00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:05.906
I want to talk to you about
how to build and rebuild trust,

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.699
because it's my belief that trust

00:00:08.723 --> 00:00:12.649
is the foundation for everything we do,

00:00:12.673 --> 00:00:17.102
and that if we can learn
to trust one another more,

00:00:17.126 --> 00:00:20.220
we can have unprecedented human progress.

00:00:23.277 --> 00:00:25.099
But what if trust is broken?

00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:31.634
What if your CEO is caught on video,
disparaging an employee?
