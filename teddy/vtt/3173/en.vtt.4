00:01:56.467 --> 00:02:00.697
I went to Uber with the hopes
that a turnaround there

00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:03.303
could give license to the rest of us

00:02:03.327 --> 00:02:06.986
who might have narrower versions
of their challenges.

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:12.776
But when I got to Uber,
I made a really big mistake.

00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:19.620
I publicly committed
to wearing an Uber T-shirt every day

00:02:19.644 --> 00:02:22.778
until every other employee
was wearing an Uber T-shirt.

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.038
I had clearly not thought that through.

00:02:27.062 --> 00:02:28.710
(Laughter)

00:02:28.734 --> 00:02:33.143
It was 250 days
of wearing an Uber T-shirt.
