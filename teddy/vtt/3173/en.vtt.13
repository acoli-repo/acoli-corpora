00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.305
and it is super difficult to create
empathy and trust in its presence.

00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:34.251
That takes care of the empathy wobblers.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.331
Logic wobbles can come in two forms.

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.223
It's either the quality of your logic

00:06:44.752 --> 00:06:47.969
or it's your ability
to communicate the logic.

00:06:48.777 --> 00:06:52.483
Now if the quality
of your logic is at risk,

00:06:52.507 --> 00:06:54.135
I can't really help you with that.

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:55.498
(Laughter)

00:06:55.522 --> 00:06:57.167
It's like, not in this much time.

00:06:57.191 --> 00:07:00.654
(Laughter)
