WEBVTT

00:10:28.345 --> 00:10:32.121
has the beautiful luxury
of representing difference

00:10:32.145 --> 00:10:33.998
in some context in your life.

00:10:35.295 --> 00:10:37.043
But with that privilege

00:10:38.154 --> 00:10:43.911
comes a very sincere temptation
to hold back who we are,

00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:46.302
and if we hold back who we are,

00:10:46.326 --> 00:10:48.395
we're less likely to be trusted.

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:50.332
And if we're less likely to be trusted,

00:10:50.356 --> 00:10:53.109
we're less likely to be given
stretch assignments.

00:10:53.133 --> 00:10:56.562
And without those stretch assignments,
we're less likely to get promoted,

00:10:56.586 --> 00:11:00.134
and so on and so on
until we are super depressed
