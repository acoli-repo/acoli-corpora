And to the leaders in the room,

it is your obligation

00:11:34.579 --> 00:11:39.745
to set the conditions that not only
make it safe for us to be authentic

00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:41.182
but make it welcome,

00:11:42.713 --> 00:11:44.356
make it celebrated,

00:11:44.975 --> 00:11:48.516
cherish it for exactly what it is,

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.902
which is the key for us
achieving greater excellence

00:11:51.926 --> 00:11:54.265
than we have ever known is possible.

00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:59.716

When I got there,
Uber was wobbling all over the place.
