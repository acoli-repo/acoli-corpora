00:07:30.837 --> 00:07:35.012
If we consider that there are
two ways to communicate in the world,

00:07:35.036 --> 00:07:39.650
and the first one is when
you take us on a journey,

00:07:39.674 --> 00:07:44.657
a magnificent journey
that has twists and turns

00:07:44.681 --> 00:07:47.813
and mystery and drama,

00:07:47.837 --> 00:07:50.324
until you ultimately get to the point,

00:07:51.536 --> 00:07:54.612
and some of the best
communicators in the world

00:07:54.636 --> 00:07:56.667
communicate just like this.

00:07:57.432 --> 00:07:59.964
But if you have a logic wobble,

00:07:59.988 --> 00:08:02.170
this can be super dangerous.
