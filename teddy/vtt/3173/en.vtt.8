literally tomorrow, than we do today.

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:09.158
And the way to do that is to understand
where trust wobbles for ourselves

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:11.864
and have a ready-made
prescription to overcome it.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.650
So that's what I would like
to do together.

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.936
Would you give me some sense
of whether or not you're here voluntarily?

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.047
(Laughter)

00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:23.435
Yeah. OK. Alright. Awesome.

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:24.969
OK. So --

00:04:24.993 --> 00:04:26.333
(Laughter)

00:04:26.357 --> 00:04:28.123
it's just super helpful feedback.

00:04:28.147 --> 00:04:30.433
(Laughter)
