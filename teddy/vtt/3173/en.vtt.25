00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:33.932
(Laughter)

00:12:33.956 --> 00:12:36.226
I had never seen anything like it.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.678
(Laughter)

00:12:38.305 --> 00:12:39.743
It may have done many things,

00:12:39.767 --> 00:12:43.241
but it did not create a safe,
empathetic environment.

00:12:43.612 --> 00:12:46.016
The solution though, super clear:

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.770
technology, off and away.

00:12:48.886 --> 00:12:51.568
And that forced people to look up,

00:12:51.592 --> 00:12:54.244
to look at the people in front of them,

00:12:54.268 --> 00:12:55.666
to listen to them,

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.769
to immerse themselves
in their perspectives

00:12:57.793 --> 00:13:01.213
and to collaborate in unprecedented ways.
