So what exactly defines our modern
understanding of cults,

00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:35.125
and why do people join them?

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:37.754
Broadly speaking, a cult is a group
or movement

00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:41.944
with a shared commitment to a usually
extreme ideology

00:01:41.944 --> 00:01:45.591
that's typically embodied
in a charismatic leader.

00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:49.155
And while few turn out as deadly
as Jonestown or Heaven's Gate,

00:01:49.155 --> 00:01:53.754

of 39 people in 1997,

00:01:53.754 --> 00:01:58.095

basic characteristics.

00:01:58.095 --> 00:02:01.592
A typical cult requires a high level
of commitment from its members
