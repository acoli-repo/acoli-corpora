That grizzly image has since been
immortalized as shorthand slang

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:11.673
Today, there are thousands of cults
around the world.

00:01:11.673 --> 00:01:14.524
It's important to note two things
about them.

00:01:14.524 --> 00:01:17.412

not all new religions are what 
we're referring to as cults.

00:01:28.563 --> 00:01:31.933
So what exactly defines our modern
understanding of cults,
