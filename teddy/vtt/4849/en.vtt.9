00:04:37.773 --> 00:04:40.981
and to attain the promised rewards.

00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:43.821
The cult environment discourages
critical thinking,

00:04:43.821 --> 00:04:45.631
making it hard to voice doubts

00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:50.103
when everyone around you is modeling
absolute faith.

00:04:50.103 --> 00:04:53.891
The resulting internal conflict,
known as cognitive dissonance,

00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:55.541
keeps you trapped,

00:04:55.541 --> 00:05:01.011
as each compromise makes it more 
painful to admit you've been deceived.
