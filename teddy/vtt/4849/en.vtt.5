with little tolerance for internal 
disagreement or external scrutiny.

00:02:33.506 --> 00:02:36.596
You might wonder whether 
some of these descriptions

00:02:36.596 --> 00:02:39.826
might also apply to established religions.

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.677
In fact, the world "cultus" 
originally described

00:02:42.677 --> 00:02:46.154
people who cultivated
the worship of certain gods

00:02:46.154 --> 00:02:49.477
by performing rituals 
and maintaining temples.

00:02:49.477 --> 00:02:53.048
But in time, it came to mean 
excessive devotion.

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:55.196
Many religions began as cults,

00:02:55.196 --> 00:02:59.846
but integrated into the fabric
of the larger society as they grew.

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:03.987
A modern cult, by contrast, separates
its members from others.
