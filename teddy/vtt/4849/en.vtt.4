00:01:58.095 --> 00:02:01.592
A typical cult requires a high level
of commitment from its members

00:02:01.592 --> 00:02:04.033
and maintains a strict hierarchy,

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:06.945
separating unsuspecting supporters
and recruits

00:02:06.945 --> 00:02:09.203
from the inner workings.

00:02:09.203 --> 00:02:12.344
It claims to provide answers
to life's biggest questions

00:02:12.344 --> 00:02:13.864
through its doctrine,

00:02:13.864 --> 00:02:16.245
along with the required recipe
for change

00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:20.076
that shapes a new member
into a true believer.

00:02:20.076 --> 00:02:24.106
And most importantly, it uses both
formal and informal systems

00:02:24.106 --> 00:02:28.106
of influence and control
to keep members obedient,

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:33.506
with little tolerance for internal 
disagreement or external scrutiny.
