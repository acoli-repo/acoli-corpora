I'm here today to talk about social change,

not a new therapy or a new intervention

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.957
or a new way of working with kids
or something like that,

00:00:09.957 --> 00:00:12.902

00:00:12.902 --> 00:00:15.809
a new way of tackling the problem.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.983

re-offend again within a year.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:28.185

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:30.568
do you think they have on average
