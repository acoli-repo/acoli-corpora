It's like searching for a needle in trillions of haystacks.

00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:35.837
We might want to focus our search on planets that we know can support life as we know it --

00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:38.770
what we call habitable worlds.

To answer that question, we don't look out there.

00:00:43.138 --> 00:00:45.621
Instead, we look at ourselves. At Earth.

00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:50.322
Because this is the one planet in the universe that we know for certain is habitable.

00:00:50.322 --> 00:00:53.870
When we look at Earth from space, we see a blue, watery world.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.754
It's no coincidence that three quarters of the surface is covered by oceans.

00:00:57.754 --> 00:01:00.688
Because of its unique chemical and physical properties,
