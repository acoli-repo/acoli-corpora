00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:02.787
Third, the planet needs to be at the right distance from its star.

00:02:02.787 --> 00:02:06.771
Too close, and the surface temperature will exceed the boiling point of water,

00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:09.203
and oceans will turn to vapor.

00:02:09.203 --> 00:02:12.989
Too far, and the surface temperature will fall below the freezing point of water,

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.903
causing the oceans to turn to ice.

00:02:15.903 --> 00:02:21.720
Fire or ice. For life as we know it, neither will suffice.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.287
You can imagine that the perfect zone where water stays liquid looks kind of like a belt around a star.

00:02:27.287 --> 00:02:30.388
We call that belt the habitable zone.
