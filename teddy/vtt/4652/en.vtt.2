00:00:57.754 --> 00:01:00.688
Because of its unique chemical and physical properties,

00:01:00.688 --> 00:01:04.353
water is absolutely essential for all life as we know it.

00:01:04.353 --> 00:01:09.354
And so we get especially excited about other worlds on which water is abundant.

00:01:09.354 --> 00:01:11.720
Fortunately, water is very common in the universe.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.354
But life needs water in the form of liquid, not ice, and not vapor,

00:01:15.354 --> 00:01:17.288
and that's a little bit less common.

00:01:17.288 --> 00:01:21.654
For a planet to have liquid water at its surface, three things are important.

00:01:21.654 --> 00:01:24.686
First, the planet needs to be large enough that the force of gravity

00:01:24.686 --> 00:01:27.970
keeps the water molecules from flying off into space.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.803
For example, Mars is smaller than Earth, and so has less gravity,
