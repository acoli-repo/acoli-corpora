00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.803
For example, Mars is smaller than Earth, and so has less gravity,

00:01:31.803 --> 00:01:34.670
and that's one important reason that Mars has a very thin atmosphere,

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.639
and no oceans at its surface.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:41.221
Second, the planet needs to have an atmosphere. Why?

00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:43.837
Because without an atmosphere, the planet is in a vacuum,

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:46.606
and liquid water isn't stable in a vacuum.

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:50.787
For example, our moon has no atmosphere, and so if you spill some water on the moon,

00:01:50.787 --> 00:01:54.787
it will either boil away as vapor, or freeze solid to make ice.

00:01:54.787 --> 00:01:59.571
Without the pressure of an atmosphere, liquid water can't survive.

00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:02.787
Third, the planet needs to be at the right distance from its star.
