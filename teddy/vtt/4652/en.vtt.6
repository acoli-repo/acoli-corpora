00:02:57.538 --> 00:03:01.937
It's the right size, it has an atmosphere, and it's in the habitable zone of our sun.

00:03:01.937 --> 00:03:05.239
An alien astronomer might see it as Earth's twin.

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.337
But Venus is not habitable, at least not at its surface.

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:11.254
Not by life as we know it. It's too hot.

00:03:11.254 --> 00:03:15.870
That's because Venus' atmosphere is full of carbon dioxide, an important greenhouse gas.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.138
In fact, its atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide,

00:03:19.138 --> 00:03:22.203
and is almost 100 times thicker than our own.

00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:25.503
As a result, the temperature on Venus is hot enough to melt lead,

00:03:25.503 --> 00:03:28.739
and the planet is dry as a bone.

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.920
So finding planets of the right size and distance from their stars is only a beginning.
