00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:03.071
Some scientists estimate that the mass of microbes living deep underground

00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:06.489
equals the mass of all the life at Earth's surface.

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.870
These subterranean microbes don't need oceans or sunshine.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.171
These discoveries suggest that Earth-like planets may be only the tip of the astrobiological iceberg.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:18.988
It's possible that life might persist in aquifers beneath the surface of Mars.

00:04:18.988 --> 00:04:21.471
Microbes may thrive on Jupiter's moon Europa,

00:04:21.471 --> 00:04:25.253
where liquid water ocean probably lies beneath the icy crust.

00:04:25.253 --> 00:04:31.220
Another ocean beneath the surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus is the source of geysers erupting into space.
