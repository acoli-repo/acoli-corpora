00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.920
So finding planets of the right size and distance from their stars is only a beginning.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.053
We also want to know about the makeup of their atmospheres.

00:03:36.053 --> 00:03:40.037
The second complication emerges when we look a little more deeply at planet Earth.

00:03:40.037 --> 00:03:45.171
In the last 30 years, we've discovered microbes living in all sorts of extreme environments.

00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:47.870
We find them in fissures of rock miles beneath our feet,

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.021
in boiling waters of the ocean floor,

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.454
in acidic waters of thermal springs,

00:03:52.454 --> 00:03:55.637
and in cloud droplets miles above our heads.

00:03:55.637 --> 00:03:58.671
These so-called extremophiles aren't rare.

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:03.071
Some scientists estimate that the mass of microbes living deep underground
