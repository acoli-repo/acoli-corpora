00:02:27.287 --> 00:02:30.388
We call that belt the habitable zone.

00:02:30.388 --> 00:02:36.087
So when we search for habitable worlds, we definitely want to look for planets in the habitable zones around their stars.

00:02:36.087 --> 00:02:40.603
Those regions are the best bets to find planets like Earth.

00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:44.937
But while habitable zones are a pretty good place to begin the search for planets with life,

00:02:44.937 --> 00:02:47.388
there are a couple of complications.

00:02:47.388 --> 00:02:51.421
First, a planet isn't necessarily habitable just because it's in the habitable zone.

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.988
Consider the planet Venus in our solar system.

00:02:53.988 --> 00:02:57.538
If you were an alien astronomer, you'd think Venus is a pretty good bet for life.

00:02:57.538 --> 00:03:01.937
It's the right size, it has an atmosphere, and it's in the habitable zone of our sun.
