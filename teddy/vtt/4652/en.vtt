00:00:14.904 --> 00:00:18.170
The universe contains about 100 billion galaxies.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.136
Each of those galaxies contains about 100 billion stars.

00:00:22.136 --> 00:00:24.753
Many of those stars have planets orbiting them.

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:27.503
So how do we look for life in all that immensity?

00:00:27.503 --> 00:00:31.603
It's like searching for a needle in trillions of haystacks.
