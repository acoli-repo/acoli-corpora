00:04:25.253 --> 00:04:31.220
Another ocean beneath the surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus is the source of geysers erupting into space.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.304
Could these geysers be raining microbes?

00:04:33.304 --> 00:04:35.837
Could we fly through them to find out?

00:04:35.837 --> 00:04:39.405
And what about life as we don't know it, using a liquid other than water?

00:04:39.405 --> 00:04:43.804
Maybe we are the crazy creatures living in an unusual and extreme environment.

00:04:43.804 --> 00:04:46.371
Maybe the real habitable zone is so large

00:04:46.371 --> 00:04:49.888
that there are billions of needles in those trillions of haystacks.

00:04:49.888 --> 00:04:55.003
Maybe in the big scheme of things, Earth is only one of many different kinds of habitable worlds.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:58.770
The only way to find out is to go out and explore.
