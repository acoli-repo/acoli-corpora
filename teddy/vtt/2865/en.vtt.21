00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.216
plus a better process is superior

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.656
to a very powerful machine alone,

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.576
but more remarkably,
is superior to a strong human player

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.560
plus machine

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.520
and an inferior process.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.480
This convinced me that we would need

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.680
better interfaces
to help us coach our machines

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.240
towards more useful intelligence.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.616
Human plus machine isn't the future,
