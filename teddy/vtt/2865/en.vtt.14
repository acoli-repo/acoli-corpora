00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.936
These were human doubts, human fears,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.640
and the only thing I knew for sure

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.296
was that my opponent Deep Blue
had no such worries at all.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.080
(Laughter)

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.320
I fought back

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.080
after this devastating blow

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.200
to win the first match,

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.600
but the writing was on the wall.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.536
I eventually lost to the machine

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.616
but I didn't suffer the fate of John Henry

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.680
who won but died
with his hammer in his hand.
