00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.416
When I first met Deep Blue
in 1996 in February,

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.040
I had been the world champion
for more than 10 years,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.096
and I had played 182
world championship games

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.216
and hundreds of games against
other top players in other competitions.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.296
I knew what to expect from my opponents

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.000
and what to expect from myself.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.856
I was used to measure their moves

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.496
and to gauge their emotional state
