00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.936
This story begins in 1985,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.936
when at age 22,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.336
I became the World Chess Champion

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.560
after beating Anatoly Karpov.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.736
Earlier that year,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.376
I played what is called
simultaneous exhibition

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.696
against 32 of the world's
best chess-playing machines

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.080
in Hamburg, Germany.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.360
I won all the games,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.736
and then it was not considered
much of a surprise

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.800
that I could beat 32 computers
at the same time.
