00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.496
I was Mt. Everest,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.120
and Deep Blue reached the summit.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.656
I should say of course,
not that Deep Blue did it,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.816
but its human creators --

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.176
Anantharaman, Campbell, Hoane, Hsu.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.400
Hats off to them.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.256
As always, machine's triumph
was a human triumph,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.040
something we tend to forget when humans
are surpassed by our own creations.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.800
Deep Blue was victorious,
