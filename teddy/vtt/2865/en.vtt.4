There are very few instances of an arena

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.616
where the human body and mind
can compete on equal terms

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.480
with a computer or a robot.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.138
Actually, I wish there were a few more.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.960
Instead,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.496
it was my blessing and my curse

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.216
to literally become the proverbial man

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.336
in the man versus machine competition

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.240
that everybody is still talking about.
