if we want to get the best
out of our humanity.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.895
While licking my wounds,

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.880
I got a lot of inspiration

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.775
from my battles against Deep Blue.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.920
As the old Russian saying goes,
if you can't beat them, join them.

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.256
Then I thought,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.616
what if I could play with a computer --

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.800
together with a computer at my side,
combining our strengths,

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.936
human intuition
plus machine's calculation,
