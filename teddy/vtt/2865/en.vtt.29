00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.320
And if we fail,

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.896
if we fail, it's not because our machines
are too intelligent,

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.320
or not intelligent enough.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.280
If we fail, it's because
we grew complacent

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.240
and limited our ambitions.

00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.560
Our humanity is not defined by any skill,

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.960
like swinging a hammer
or even playing chess.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.576
There's one thing only a human can do.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.800
That's dream.
