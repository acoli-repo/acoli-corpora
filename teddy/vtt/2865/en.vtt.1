00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.800
that I could beat 32 computers
at the same time.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.056
To me, that was the golden age.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.176
(Laughter)

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.720
Machines were weak,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.016
and my hair was strong.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.240
(Laughter)

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.776
Just 12 years later,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.416
I was fighting for my life
against just one computer

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.640
in a match

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.416
called by the cover of "Newsweek"

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.216
"The Brain's Last Stand."

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.456
No pressure.
