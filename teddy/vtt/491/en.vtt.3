Unlike Ötzi, most of us today use tattoos
for some kind of self-expression.

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:39.393
Personally, I love tattoos
because I love art

00:01:39.417 --> 00:01:41.726
and there is something so wonderful to me,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.226
almost romantic, about the way
a tattoo as an art form

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.726
cannot be commodified.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.268
Right? Your tattoo
lives and dies with you.

00:01:50.292 --> 00:01:52.976
It can't be bought or sold or traded,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.268
so its only value
is really personal to you,

00:01:55.292 --> 00:01:57.184
and I love that.

00:01:57.208 --> 00:01:59.893
Now, I tend to gravitate
towards really colorful tattoos

00:01:59.917 --> 00:02:01.643
because I'm obsessed with color.
