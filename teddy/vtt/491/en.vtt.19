00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.851
the first step would be to make a tattoo
that conducts electricity.

00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:37.268
So we've been working on
a conducting tattoo ink in my lab.

00:09:37.292 --> 00:09:43.226
And right now, we're able to increase
the conductivity of skin over 300-fold

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.125
with our conducting tattoo ink.

00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:48.768
Now, we have a long way to go
before we reach the conductivity

00:09:48.792 --> 00:09:50.518
of something like a copper wire,

00:09:50.542 --> 00:09:53.643
but we're making progress
and I'm really excited about this

00:09:53.667 --> 00:09:57.184
because I think that it could open up
a whole new world of possibility

00:09:57.208 --> 00:09:59.101
for tattoos.

00:09:59.125 --> 00:10:03.059
I envision a future
where tattoos enable us --
