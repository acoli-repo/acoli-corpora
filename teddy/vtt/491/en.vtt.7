While I'm an artist, I'm also a scientist,

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:34.851
and I direct a laboratory
that researches nanotechnology,

00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:39.143
which is the science of building things
with ultratiny building blocks,

00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:42.809
thousands of times smaller even
than the width of a human hair.

00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:44.643
And I began to ask myself,

00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:47.083
how could nanotechnology serve tattooing?

00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:51.393
If tattoos are just
a bunch of particles in the skin,

00:03:51.417 --> 00:03:55.500
could we swap those particles out for ones
that do something more interesting?

00:03:56.542 --> 00:03:58.393
Here's my big idea:

00:03:58.417 --> 00:04:01.184
I believe that tattoos
can give you superpowers.
