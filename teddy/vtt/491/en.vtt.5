00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.768
and it was a really meaningful
experience to me,

00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:34.101
so I wanted to commemorate it
with this Japanese and Chinese character

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:35.417
for "mountain."

00:02:36.708 --> 00:02:39.934
Now, here's what blows my mind.

00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:42.393
My 14-year-old tattoo

00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:45.934
and Ötzi's 5,300-year-old tattoos

00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:49.018
are made of the same exact stuff:

00:02:49.042 --> 00:02:50.601
soot,

00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:52.726
that black powdery carbon dust

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.351
that gets left behind in the fireplace
when you burn stuff.

00:02:56.375 --> 00:03:00.559
And if you zoom way, way in
on either my tattoo or Ötzi's tattoos,
