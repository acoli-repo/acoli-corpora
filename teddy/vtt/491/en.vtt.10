is that we can't see
ultraviolet, or UV, light.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.393
That's the high-energy part of sunlight

00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:07.708
that causes sunburn
and increases our risk of skin cancer.

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:12.292
Many animals and insects
can actually see UV light, but we can't.

00:05:13.292 --> 00:05:17.250
If we could, we'd be able to see sunscreen
when it was applied on our skin.

00:05:18.208 --> 00:05:21.393
Unfortunately, most of us
don't wear sunscreen,

00:05:21.417 --> 00:05:23.018
and those of us who do

00:05:23.042 --> 00:05:26.351

00:05:26.375 --> 00:05:29.018

00:05:29.042 --> 00:05:32.809
of preventable skin cancer
every year in the US alone,
