00:07:58.833 --> 00:08:01.434
Well, you could also put
heat-sensitive dyes

00:08:01.458 --> 00:08:03.226
inside of microcapsules

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.184
and you could make different tattoo inks

00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:07.559
that change color
at different temperatures.

00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:12.667
Suppose it was 96, 98,
and a hundred degrees Fahrenheit.

00:08:13.417 --> 00:08:15.684
If you place those inks side by side,

00:08:15.708 --> 00:08:17.601
now you have a temperature scale

00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:19.625
tuned to the human body.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.143
In this video, you can see
the different patches of tattoos

00:08:25.167 --> 00:08:26.518
disappearing sequentially

00:08:26.542 --> 00:08:28.726
as the pigskin we tested them on

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.476
is heated up.
