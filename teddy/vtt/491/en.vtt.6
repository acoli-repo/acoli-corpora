And if you zoom way, way in
on either my tattoo or Ötzi's tattoos,

00:03:00.583 --> 00:03:03.000
you'll find that they all

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.476
soot in this case,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.018
that get trapped in the dermis,

00:03:11.042 --> 00:03:14.893
which is the layer of tissue

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:23.559
apart from getting access to more colors

00:03:23.583 --> 00:03:26.375
and slightly more efficient
methods of installation.

While I'm an artist, I'm also a scientist,
