but as soon as I expose them
to a UV light, acting as the Sun --

00:06:33.208 --> 00:06:34.542
there they are, blue spots.

00:06:35.542 --> 00:06:38.601
Now, I'm not wearing
sunscreen in this video,

00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:41.726
but if I was, those blue spots
would not appear,

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.059
and then when my sunscreen wore off later,

00:06:44.083 --> 00:06:46.559
the solar freckles
would reappear in UV light

00:06:46.583 --> 00:06:49.809
and I would know that it was time
to reapply sunscreen.

00:06:49.833 --> 00:06:53.768
So these tattoos act
as a real-time, naked-eye indicator

00:06:53.792 --> 00:06:55.500
of your skin's UV exposure.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:57.893
And of course,

00:06:57.917 --> 00:07:02.851
I think there are lots of really cool,
artistic things you could do
