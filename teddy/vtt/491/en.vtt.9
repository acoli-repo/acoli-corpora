It's a tiny hollow particle
with a protective outer shell,

00:04:32.208 --> 00:04:34.268
about the size of a tattoo pigment,

00:04:34.292 --> 00:04:37.333
and you can fill the inside
with practically whatever you want.

00:04:38.417 --> 00:04:42.684
So what if we put interesting materials
inside of these microcapsules

00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:44.208
and made tattoo inks with them?

00:04:45.083 --> 00:04:47.583
What sorts of things
could we make a tattoo do?

00:04:48.458 --> 00:04:50.684
What problems could we solve?

00:04:50.708 --> 00:04:52.792
What human limitations could we overcome?

00:04:54.208 --> 00:04:55.500
Well, here's one idea:

00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:58.476
one of our weaknesses as humans

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.476
is that we can't see
ultraviolet, or UV, light.
