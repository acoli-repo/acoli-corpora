00:08:58.208 --> 00:09:01.476
is that our skin
doesn't conduct electricity,

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.559
and that can be a good thing,
but not necessarily --

00:09:04.583 --> 00:09:06.184
(Laughter)

00:09:06.208 --> 00:09:10.059
if you have an electronic
biomedical implant,

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:12.309
like a pacemaker for example.

00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:14.601
Right now, if you have a pacemaker,

00:09:14.625 --> 00:09:19.143
you need surgery every five or 10 years
to replace the battery when it dies.

00:09:19.167 --> 00:09:21.726
And wouldn't it be nice if, instead,

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.333
we could simply recharge the battery
through a patch of conducting skin?

00:09:26.708 --> 00:09:29.934
Well, if you were to try to tackle
that problem with a tattoo,

00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.851
the first step would be to make a tattoo
that conducts electricity.
