I'd like to introduce you
to an interesting person named Ã–tzi.

00:00:06.083 --> 00:00:07.601
He lives in Italy

00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:10.101
at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:11.792
because he's a mummy.

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:15.809
This is an artist's rendition
of what he might have looked like

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:17.458
when he was alive 5,300 years ago.

00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:20.434
You want to see what he looks like today?

00:00:20.458 --> 00:00:21.768
(Laughter)

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:24.667
OK, brace yourselves,
gross mummy pic coming at you.

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:30.309
So, he's not as handsome as he used to be,
