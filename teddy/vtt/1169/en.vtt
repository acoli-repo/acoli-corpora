00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I study how the brain processes

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
information. That is, how it takes

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
information in from the outside world, and

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
converts it into patterns of electrical activity,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and then how it uses those patterns

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to allow you to do things --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to see, hear, to reach for an object.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So I'm really a basic scientist, not

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
a clinician, but in the last year and a half

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I've started to switch over, to use what

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
we've been learning about these patterns

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
of activity to develop prosthetic devices,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and what I wanted to do today is show you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
an example of this.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's really our first foray into this.
