00:00:58.542 --> 00:01:02.202
The ocean covers roughly 71%
of our planet's surface,

00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:05.373
some 360 million square kilometers,

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:09.524
an area in excess
of the size of 36 U.S.A.'s.

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:10.617
It's such a vast spread,

00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:11.994
when viewed from space,

00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:16.621
the ocean is, by far, the dominant
feature of our planet.

00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:17.872
Speaking of space,

00:01:17.896 --> 00:01:22.010
the ocean currently
holds over 1.3 billion,

00:01:22.034 --> 00:01:23.712
that's billion with a "b",

00:01:23.736 --> 00:01:25.627
cubic kilometers of water.

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:26.673
Put another way,

00:01:26.697 --> 00:01:28.247
that's enough water to immerse

00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:30.207
the entire United States
