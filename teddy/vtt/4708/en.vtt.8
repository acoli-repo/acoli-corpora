WEBVTT

00:03:58.584 --> 00:04:00.145
is roughly the same height

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.231
that commercial airliners travel.

00:04:02.255 --> 00:04:04.877
So, pretty much however you
choose to slice it,

00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.918
the ocean is capital B

00:04:06.942 --> 00:04:07.737
capital I,

00:04:07.761 --> 00:04:08.868
capital G,

00:04:08.892 --> 00:04:10.025
BIG!

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.966
It defines our planet,

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.452
home to the greatest geological features,

00:04:14.476 --> 00:04:16.871
comprises the largest living space,

00:04:16.895 --> 00:04:19.498
and accordingly, is home
to the greatest numbers

00:04:19.522 --> 00:04:21.882
and forms of life on Earth.

00:04:21.906 --> 00:04:25.709
It is practically
incomprehensible in scope.

00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:28.628
But it is not so big,

00:04:28.652 --> 00:04:29.857
so vast,

00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:31.218
so extraordinary
