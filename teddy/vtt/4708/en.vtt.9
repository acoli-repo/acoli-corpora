00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:31.218
so extraordinary

00:04:31.242 --> 00:04:33.304
as to be untouchable.

00:04:33.328 --> 00:04:37.049
In fact, with roughly 50%
of the world's population

00:04:37.073 --> 00:04:39.698
living within 100
kilometers of the coastline

00:04:39.722 --> 00:04:41.696
and with most of the remainder

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.482
living close enough to lakes,
rivers, or swamps,

00:04:44.506 --> 00:04:46.963
all of which ultimately lead to the ocean,

00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:49.548
virtually every single
person on the planet

00:04:49.572 --> 00:04:52.970
has the opportunity
to influence the general health

00:04:52.994 --> 00:04:55.520
and nature of the world ocean.

00:04:55.544 --> 00:04:57.211
Evidence of human influence is seen

00:04:57.235 --> 00:04:59.193
in every part of the ocean,

00:04:59.217 --> 00:05:00.456
no matter how deep,
