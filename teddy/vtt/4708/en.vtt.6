00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.438
This massive cataract
carries roughly 116 times

00:03:03.462 --> 00:03:06.344
more water per second over its edge

00:03:06.368 --> 00:03:08.316
than the Congo River's Inga Falls,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.736
the largest waterfall by volume on land.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.618
The world's tallest mountain
is actually found in the ocean,

00:03:14.642 --> 00:03:16.241
hiding in plain sight.

00:03:16.265 --> 00:03:18.660
While 4200 meters of Hawaii's Mauna Kea

00:03:18.684 --> 00:03:20.619
sit above sea level,

00:03:20.643 --> 00:03:22.689
its sides plummet beneath the waves

00:03:22.713 --> 00:03:25.041
for another 5800 meters.

00:03:25.065 --> 00:03:26.459
From its snow-covered top

00:03:26.483 --> 00:03:28.630
to it's silt-covered bottom, then,

00:03:28.654 --> 00:03:31.805
this Hawaiian mountain is roughly
10,000 meters in height,
