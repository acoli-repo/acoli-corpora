00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:30.207
the entire United States

00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:31.642
under a body of salt water

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:34.506
over 132 kilometers tall,

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.477
a height well beyond the reach
of the highest clouds

00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:40.985
and extending deep
into the upper atmosphere.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.195
With all that volume,

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.954
the ocean represents 97%

00:01:44.978 --> 00:01:47.689
of Earth's total water content.

00:01:47.713 --> 00:01:49.285
On top of all that,

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.342
the ocean contains upwards of 99%

00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:54.206
of the world's biosphere,

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.756
that is, the spaces
and places where life exists.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.879
Now let that sink in for a second.

00:01:59.903 --> 00:02:02.173
The immediate world as we know it,
