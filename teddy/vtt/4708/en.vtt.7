00:03:28.654 --> 00:03:31.805
this Hawaiian mountain is roughly
10,000 meters in height,

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.098
dwarfing tiny Everest's paltry peak

00:03:34.122 --> 00:03:35.926
by well over a kilometer.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.081
Then, since we're picking on poor Everest,

00:03:38.105 --> 00:03:40.807
let's consider the world's deepest canyon,

00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:42.419
the Challenger Deep,

00:03:42.443 --> 00:03:45.354
existing 11 kilometers
below the ocean's surface,

00:03:45.378 --> 00:03:47.805
some six times deeper
than the Grand Canyon.

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.446
That's deep enough to sink
Mount Everest into

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.615
and still have over 2.1
kilometers of water

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.022
sitting atop its newly submerged peak.

00:03:56.046 --> 00:03:58.560
Put another way, the depth
of the Challenger Deep

00:03:58.584 --> 00:04:00.145
is roughly the same height
