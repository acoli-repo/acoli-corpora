00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.703
Now, ask yourself,

00:00:30.727 --> 00:00:32.677
"How big is it?

00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:35.660
How big is the ocean?"

00:00:35.684 --> 00:00:37.373
First thing, we need to understand

00:00:37.397 --> 00:00:39.331
that there really is only one ocean,

00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:42.126
consisting of five component
basins that we call

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.210
the Pacific,

00:00:43.234 --> 00:00:43.794
the Atlantic,

00:00:43.818 --> 00:00:44.461
the Indian,

00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:45.048
the Arctic,

00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:46.630
and the Southern.

00:00:46.654 --> 00:00:47.672
Each of these five,

00:00:47.696 --> 00:00:49.467
while generally referred to as oceans

00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:50.927
in and of themselves,

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:52.512
are really and truly a part of

00:00:52.536 --> 00:00:54.645
a single, massive body of water,

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:55.707
one ocean,

00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:58.518
which defines the very
face of planet Earth.

00:00:58.542 --> 00:01:02.202
The ocean covers roughly 71%
of our planet's surface,
