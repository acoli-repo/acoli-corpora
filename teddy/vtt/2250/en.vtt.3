00:01:29.805 --> 00:01:31.775
of climate breakdown,

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.434
of endless wars,

00:01:33.458 --> 00:01:34.989
of economic meltdowns,

00:01:35.013 --> 00:01:37.036
of deep political divisions,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.581
of the many crises around the world
that I don't need to list off,

00:01:40.605 --> 00:01:45.393
because they are blaring at you
every single day from your news feed.

00:01:47.342 --> 00:01:51.042
But there is something I've learned
in these 18 years of parenting

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:54.694
and in my years leading
a global women's rights organization.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.754
There is a way to face
these big crises in the world

00:01:59.778 --> 00:02:04.049
without feeling overwhelmed
and despairing.
