WEBVTT

00:07:57.656 --> 00:08:03.173
And when we remember that every policy
is an expression of social values,

00:08:03.197 --> 00:08:07.536
love stands out as that superstar value,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.922
the one best able to account
for the most vulnerable among us.

00:08:11.946 --> 00:08:15.757
And when we position love
as a kind of leading edge

00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:17.209
in policy making,

00:08:17.233 --> 00:08:21.604
we get new answers
to fundamental social questions,

00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:25.170
like, "What's the economy for?"

00:08:26.202 --> 00:08:29.955
"What is our commitment
to those in the path of the hurricane?"
