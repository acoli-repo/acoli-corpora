Now, I will admit that my brothers and I
make fun of her for this,

00:04:33.331 --> 00:04:37.327
but people ask me all the time

00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:40.806
how I deal with the suffering
that I see in my work

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.930
in refugee camps and disaster zones,

00:04:43.954 --> 00:04:47.578
and I think of my mom
and that seed of possibility

00:04:47.602 --> 00:04:49.536
that she planted in me.

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:53.795
Because, when you believe
that something good is coming

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:56.330
and you're part of making it happen,

00:04:56.354 --> 00:04:59.934
you start to be able to see
beyond the suffering

00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.814
to how things could be.
