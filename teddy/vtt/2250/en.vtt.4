It's simple, and it's powerful.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.332
It's to think like a mother.

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:12.403
Now, to be clear, you don't
have to be a woman

00:02:12.427 --> 00:02:14.182
or a parent to do this.

00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:18.116
Thinking like a mother is a lens
that's available to everybody.

00:02:19.874 --> 00:02:22.993
The poet Alexis De Veaux writes,

00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:28.346
"Motherhood is not simply
the organic process of giving birth.

00:02:29.261 --> 00:02:33.047
It's an understanding
of the needs of the world."
