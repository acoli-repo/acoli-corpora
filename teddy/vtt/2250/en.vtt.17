00:08:30.915 --> 00:08:34.829
"How do we greet those
arriving to our borders?"

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.471
When you think like a mother,

00:08:37.495 --> 00:08:39.701
you prioritize the needs of the many,

00:08:39.725 --> 00:08:41.674
not the whims of the few.

00:08:42.587 --> 00:08:44.215
When you think like a mother,

00:08:44.239 --> 00:08:47.244
you don't build a seawall
around beachfront property,

00:08:47.268 --> 00:08:49.416
because that would divert floodwaters

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.627
to communities that are still exposed.

00:08:52.795 --> 00:08:54.449
When you think like a mother,

00:08:54.473 --> 00:08:56.399
you don't try to prosecute someone

00:08:56.423 --> 00:08:59.711
for leaving water for people
crossing the desert.
