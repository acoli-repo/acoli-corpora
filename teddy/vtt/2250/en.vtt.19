00:09:27.738 --> 00:09:33.110
thinking they can see their way to safety
in some kind of armed lifeboat

00:09:33.134 --> 00:09:35.642
fueled by racism and xenophobia.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.818
Not every mother is a role model,

00:09:38.842 --> 00:09:40.524
but all of us have a choice.

00:09:41.106 --> 00:09:44.288
Are we going to jump
on that armed lifeboat

00:09:44.312 --> 00:09:49.041
or work together to build a mother ship
that can carry everyone?

00:09:50.295 --> 00:09:52.321
You know how to build that mother ship,

00:09:52.345 --> 00:09:55.787
how to repair the world
and ease the suffering.

00:09:56.479 --> 00:09:57.853
Think like a mother.

00:09:58.593 --> 00:10:01.672
Thinking like a mother
is a tool we can all use
