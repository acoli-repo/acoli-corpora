00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:00.145
marriage equality,

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.129
the fall of dictators
who ruled for decades

00:04:03.153 --> 00:04:05.063
and so much more.

00:04:05.087 --> 00:04:07.319
All of these things seemed impossible

00:04:07.343 --> 00:04:10.855
until people took action
to make them happen,

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.629
and then, like, almost right away,

00:04:14.653 --> 00:04:16.081
they seemed inevitable.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.997
When I was growing up,

00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:23.722
whether we were stuck in traffic
or dealing with a family tragedy,

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:25.473
my mother would say,

00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:28.868
"Something good is going to happen,
we just don't know what it is yet."

00:04:29.605 --> 00:04:33.307
Now, I will admit that my brothers and I
make fun of her for this,
