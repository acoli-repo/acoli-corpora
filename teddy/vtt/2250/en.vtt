One morning, 18 years ago,

00:00:03.088 --> 00:00:08.160
I stepped out of a New York City subway
on a beautiful day in September.

00:00:08.945 --> 00:00:13.480

front-facing baby carriers,

00:00:18.286 --> 00:00:20.352
you know, so he could see everything.

00:00:20.376 --> 00:00:23.862
And when I turned right on Sixth Avenue,

00:00:23.886 --> 00:00:25.465
what he saw

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:27.785
was the World Trade Center on fire.

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:32.039
As soon as I realized
that this was an attack,
