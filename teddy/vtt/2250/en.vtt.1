As soon as I realized
that this was an attack,

00:00:32.063 --> 00:00:34.970
the first thing I did, without even
really thinking about it,

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:38.506
was to take my baby
and turn him around in that carrier.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.679
I didn't want him to see
what was going on.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.752
And I just remember feeling so grateful
that he was still young enough

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:50.992
that I didn't have to tell him
that someone had done this on purpose.

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:55.532
9/11 was like crossing a border,

00:00:55.556 --> 00:01:00.472
a hostile border into dangerous,
uncharted territory.
