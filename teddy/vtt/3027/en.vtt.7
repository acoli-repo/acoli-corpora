00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:32.548
a broader solution to immobility
needs to go further.

00:03:33.304 --> 00:03:34.455
Over the last decade,

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:37.838
a transport-centric, shared economy
has connected people across Africa

00:03:37.862 --> 00:03:40.253
with minivans, auto rickshaws and sedans.

00:03:40.277 --> 00:03:43.077
It's just not operated
very effectively or efficiently.

00:03:43.712 --> 00:03:46.662
Enabling better access to transport
is all about strengthening

00:03:46.686 --> 00:03:48.059
this public transit network,

00:03:48.083 --> 00:03:51.241
empowering local entrepreneurs
who already offer similar services

00:03:51.265 --> 00:03:52.444
in their communities

00:03:52.468 --> 00:03:55.531
to operate these services
more profitably and more widely.

00:03:56.221 --> 00:03:59.436
With this aim, we're taking
human-centered design a step further

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.739
and developing a transport platform model,
