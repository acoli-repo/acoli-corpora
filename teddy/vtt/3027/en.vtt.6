00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:01.672
And to make this something customers
could actually be proud to drive in,

00:03:01.696 --> 00:03:03.854
we designed an aspirational
body aesthetic.

00:03:04.463 --> 00:03:07.942
Underpinning all of this, we simplified
or eliminated components

00:03:07.966 --> 00:03:10.011
like parking sensors and automatic windows

00:03:10.035 --> 00:03:11.195
wherever we could,

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:12.523
to keep costs low

00:03:12.547 --> 00:03:16.454
and sell this at half the price
of a five-year-old SUV in Kenya today.

00:03:18.271 --> 00:03:19.422

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.266
The new Mobius II launches in 2018.

00:03:26.793 --> 00:03:29.831
And while durable, affordable
vehicles like this are vital,

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:32.548
a broader solution to immobility
needs to go further.
