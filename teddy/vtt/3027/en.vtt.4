It's entirely possible to solve
this disconnect, though,

00:02:03.285 --> 00:02:05.959
starting with products
that people actually want.

00:02:05.983 --> 00:02:08.814
And this is what motivated me
to start Mobius,

00:02:08.838 --> 00:02:11.764
to build a vehicle in Africa, for Africa.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.764
To us, this meant reimagining the car
around the needs of the consumer,

00:02:16.788 --> 00:02:19.624
simplifying nonessential features
like interior fixtures

00:02:19.648 --> 00:02:22.622
and investing in performance-critical
systems like suspension

00:02:22.646 --> 00:02:24.917
to create durable and affordable vehicles

00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:26.506
built for purpose.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.006
And built for purpose
is exactly where we started

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.481
with our first-generation
model, Mobius II,
