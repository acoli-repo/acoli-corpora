00:05:28.355 --> 00:05:31.739
that offer a path not just to employment
but also professional growth.

00:05:32.414 --> 00:05:35.217
The first person we employed
at Mobius over six years ago

00:05:35.241 --> 00:05:36.750
was a mechanic named Kazungu.

00:05:36.774 --> 00:05:39.238
Kazungu had gone to school
up to the age of 18

00:05:39.262 --> 00:05:40.995
and worked as an odd-job mechanic.

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:44.524
Joining the company at the time
was a near-vertical learning curve.

00:05:44.548 --> 00:05:45.961
But he rose to the challenge,

00:05:45.985 --> 00:05:49.352
and with more technical guidance
from an expanding engineering team,

00:05:49.376 --> 00:05:50.597
he's grown over the years

00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:52.926
to lead a group of mechanics
in R&amp;D prototyping.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.134
A thirst for learning and the work ethic
to step up to a challenge

00:05:56.158 --> 00:05:57.740
are values we now recruit on.

00:05:57.764 --> 00:06:01.141
Pairing innate values like this
with on-the-job training and systems
