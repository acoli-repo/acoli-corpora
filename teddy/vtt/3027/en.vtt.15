00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:30.203
the potential is huge.

00:07:30.735 --> 00:07:32.261
Better products,

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:33.698
costing less,

00:07:33.722 --> 00:07:34.979
built locally,

00:07:35.003 --> 00:07:37.093
together creating millions of jobs.

00:07:37.956 --> 00:07:40.662
Frugal innovation offers a path
to economic acceleration

00:07:40.686 --> 00:07:42.177
across many industries,

00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:44.507
and the future of this continent
depends on it.

00:07:45.777 --> 00:07:49.960
The Africa 2.0 I believe in
can apply locally relevant design

00:07:49.984 --> 00:07:52.542
and a commitment to solving
its industrial challenges

00:07:52.566 --> 00:07:55.419
to create a more connected,
more prosperous future,

00:07:55.443 --> 00:07:57.471
not just for the privileged few,

00:07:57.495 --> 00:07:58.941
but for everyone.

00:07:58.965 --> 00:08:00.163
Thank you.
