00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:32.402
So most vehicles are either
too expensive or too unreliable

00:00:32.426 --> 00:00:34.120
for the average consumer.

00:00:34.144 --> 00:00:37.809
Well-designed vehicles are only part
of the transport challenge, though.

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:40.045
For every 100 adults in Africa,

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:42.413
less than five people
actually own a vehicle.

00:00:42.948 --> 00:00:44.466
Public transport is available,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.648
and in countries like Kenya,
it's often run by local entrepreneurs

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:48.913
using minivans like this.

00:00:48.937 --> 00:00:51.294
But in most rural and peri-urban areas,

00:00:51.318 --> 00:00:53.503
it's fragmented and unreliable.

00:00:54.607 --> 00:00:56.614
In more remote areas without transport,

00:00:56.638 --> 00:00:59.181
people have to walk,
typically tens of kilometers,

00:00:59.205 --> 00:01:01.838
to get to school
or collect clean drinking water
