00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.779
Imagine if your daily commute
involved tens of kilometers

00:00:04.803 --> 00:00:06.612
on these kinds of roads,

00:00:06.636 --> 00:00:08.210
driving this kind of vehicle,

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:11.116
without any nearby service stations
or breakdown assistance.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:15.382
For millions of drivers in many parts 
of Africa, this is the norm.

00:00:16.102 --> 00:00:18.950
Since over 90 percent
of passenger cars are imported,

00:00:18.974 --> 00:00:20.195
often used,

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.356
they're just not designed for local usage.

00:00:22.775 --> 00:00:25.860
High import duties
often compound the problem,

00:00:25.884 --> 00:00:27.773
sometimes doubling the price of a car.

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:32.402
So most vehicles are either
too expensive or too unreliable
