00:06:59.201 --> 00:07:02.872
And as production volumes rise,
these suppliers can employ more staff,

00:07:02.896 --> 00:07:04.427
invest in better equipment

00:07:04.451 --> 00:07:06.981
and continue to develop
new manufacturing techniques

00:07:07.005 --> 00:07:08.502
to further increase output.

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:12.637
Building up skills and suppliers
are not the only hurdles

00:07:12.661 --> 00:07:14.011
to local industrialization,

00:07:14.035 --> 00:07:17.097
but they're good examples
of how we think about the challenge.

00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:19.654
You see, we're not just
reimagining the car,

00:07:19.678 --> 00:07:22.019
we're reimagining our entire value chain.

00:07:23.171 --> 00:07:24.810
None of this has been easy,

00:07:24.834 --> 00:07:26.688
and we're only just getting started.

00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:28.817
But once African industry starts to scale,

00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:30.203
the potential is huge.
