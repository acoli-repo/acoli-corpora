00:00:59.205 --> 00:01:01.838
to get to school
or collect clean drinking water

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:03.788
or buy supplies from nearby markets.

00:01:04.348 --> 00:01:07.965
Bad roads, disparate communities,
low average income levels

00:01:07.989 --> 00:01:09.147
and inadequate vehicles

00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:10.918
all impair the transport system

00:01:10.942 --> 00:01:13.605
and ultimately constrain economic output.

00:01:14.577 --> 00:01:17.811
Despite this constraint,
the Pan-African economy is booming.

00:01:17.835 --> 00:01:20.911
Combined GDP is already
over two trillion dollars.

00:01:21.518 --> 00:01:24.804
This is a massive commercial
and social opportunity,

00:01:24.828 --> 00:01:26.386
not a helpless continent.

00:01:27.016 --> 00:01:29.333
So why isn't there already
something better?
