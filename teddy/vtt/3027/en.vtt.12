00:05:57.764 --> 00:06:01.141
Pairing innate values like this
with on-the-job training and systems

00:06:01.165 --> 00:06:02.798
has strengthened our skill base.

00:06:02.822 --> 00:06:05.111
This works really well
on the production line,

00:06:05.135 --> 00:06:08.388
where work can be systematized
around clear procedural instructions

00:06:08.412 --> 00:06:10.378
and then reinforced through training.

00:06:11.053 --> 00:06:14.337
In our experience, it is possible
to build a skilled workforce,

00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:17.504
and we plan to hire hundreds more people
using this approach.

A second challenge is a lack of suppliers.

00:06:21.092 --> 00:06:24.675
In countries like Kenya, there are only
a handful of automotive suppliers

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.803
manufacturing parts like electrical
harnesses, seats and glass.

00:06:27.827 --> 00:06:29.209
It's a burgeoning group,

00:06:29.233 --> 00:06:31.145
and without much demand from industry,
