WEBVTT

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.481
with our first-generation
model, Mobius II,

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:34.986
which was designed
as a really rugged, low-cost SUV,

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.757
able to handle heavy loads
and rough terrain reliably.

00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:40.913
This launched in 2015,

00:02:40.937 --> 00:02:43.418
and we've now developed
the next-generation version

00:02:43.442 --> 00:02:45.113
based on customer feedback.

00:02:45.137 --> 00:02:47.049
For high stress and heavy loading,

00:02:47.073 --> 00:02:49.456
we engineered a sturdy steel space frame.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.979
To handle acute vibration
from rough roads,

00:02:52.003 --> 00:02:53.759
we ruggedized the suspension.

00:02:54.521 --> 00:02:58.121
For potholes and uneven terrain,
high ground clearance was a no-brainer.

00:02:58.145 --> 00:03:01.672
And to make this something customers
could actually be proud to drive in,
