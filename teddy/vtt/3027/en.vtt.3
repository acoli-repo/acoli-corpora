Around the world, automotive
is quarter the manufacturing sector.

00:01:33.513 --> 00:01:36.435
But in Africa, it's generally
been overlooked by carmakers,

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:38.611
who are focused on larger,
established markets

00:01:38.635 --> 00:01:40.823
and emerging economies
like India and China.

00:01:41.562 --> 00:01:43.075
This lack of industrialization,

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:46.622
which itself creates a vicious-cycle
barrier to the emergence of industry,

00:01:46.646 --> 00:01:48.674
has caused the dependence on imports.

00:01:49.406 --> 00:01:51.271
There is a supply-demand disconnect,

00:01:51.295 --> 00:01:54.586
with the vast majority of automotive
spending on the continent today,

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.563
essentially funding an international
network of car exporters

00:01:57.587 --> 00:01:59.871
instead of fueling the growth
of local industry.
