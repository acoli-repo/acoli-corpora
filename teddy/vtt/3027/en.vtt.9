00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:33.098
Since the late 1700s,
the Industrial Revolution has catapulted

00:04:33.122 --> 00:04:35.252
the development of economies
around the world

00:04:35.276 --> 00:04:36.747
into thriving societies.

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.712
Today, manufacturing is still the engine
of economic growth and stability,

00:04:40.736 --> 00:04:44.043
even as new technologies have inevitably
transformed the way we live.

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.274
Making stuff is important,

00:04:46.298 --> 00:04:48.989
especially for nation-states wanting
to boost employment,

00:04:49.013 --> 00:04:51.302
increase skills and reduce
import dependence.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.633
But while few countries can skip
this industrialized stage,

00:04:54.657 --> 00:04:56.863
many have negligible manufacturing output.

00:04:57.707 --> 00:04:59.665
There are various reasons for this,

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:02.577
but one reason is universal:
hardware is hard.
