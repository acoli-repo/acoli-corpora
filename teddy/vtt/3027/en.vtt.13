00:06:29.233 --> 00:06:31.145
and without much demand from industry,

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:33.607
most of these suppliers
have no impetus to grow.

00:06:34.323 --> 00:06:37.263
We've worked hard with a few of them
to develop the capacity

00:06:37.287 --> 00:06:40.567
to consistently manufacture components
at the quality levels we need,

00:06:40.591 --> 00:06:42.155
like this supplier in Nairobi,

00:06:42.179 --> 00:06:45.260
who are helping to reduce
the production cost of metal brackets

00:06:45.284 --> 00:06:47.739
and improve their ability
to build conformant parts

00:06:47.763 --> 00:06:49.164
to our engineering drawings.

00:06:49.705 --> 00:06:52.868
Supply and development is standard
practice in automotive globally,

00:06:52.892 --> 00:06:55.010
but it needs to be applied
from the ground up

00:06:55.034 --> 00:06:56.908
with a vast majority of local suppliers

00:06:56.932 --> 00:06:58.587
to properly bolster the ecosystem.

00:06:59.201 --> 00:07:02.872
And as production volumes rise,
these suppliers can employ more staff,
