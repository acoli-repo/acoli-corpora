00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:02.577
but one reason is universal:
hardware is hard.

00:05:02.601 --> 00:05:03.990
(Laughter)

00:05:04.768 --> 00:05:08.435
So what are the challenges to industry,
and how are we approaching them?

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:11.475
The first issue many people think of
is a lack of skilled labor.

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:15.040
In areas where access to good primary
and secondary education are limited

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:17.006
and employment opportunities are scarce,

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.798
a small skill base is inevitable.

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:21.217
But that doesn't mean it's immutable.

00:05:21.634 --> 00:05:25.198
There's an abundance of smart, hardworking
and ambitious people in Africa,

00:05:25.222 --> 00:05:26.586
obviously.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.331
What's really lacking are good jobs

00:05:28.355 --> 00:05:31.739
that offer a path not just to employment
but also professional growth.
