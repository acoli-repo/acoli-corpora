00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And while I don't have any patents that I'm aware of,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
you will be meeting a few of my inventions today.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I suppose it's fair to say

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that I am interested in the invention of self or selves.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
unique developmental experiences, geographical and historical contexts.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
But then what?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
To what extent do we self-construct, do we self-invent?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
How do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Like, what if one could be anyone at any time?
