because I feel that, as an immigrant, I do not have good English skills for speaking.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
But then, I decided, just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000
I try anyway.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
(Laughter)

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
My daughter -- my daughter wrote that,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
she told me, "Always start your speech with humor."

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
But my background --

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I want to tell you story only briefly.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
My husband and I, we brought our son and daughter here in 1980s

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
to have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition, but it's very hard.
