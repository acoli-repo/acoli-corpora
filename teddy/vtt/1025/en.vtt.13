00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I'm just trying not to be nervous because this is

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
a very wonderful experience for me and everything.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And I just -- you know I'm not used to doing the public speaking.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Nobody can understand nothing I'm saying, which is very frustrating for me,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
as you can imagine.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
But then on top of that, you know, Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
So then I'm like, should I be nervous, you know, because maybe it's better.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And I'm just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like, take a deep breath.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Okay. Sorry. So anyway, what I was trying to say is that I really love TED.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Like, I love everything about this. It's amazing.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Like, it's -- I can't get over this right now.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And, like, people would not believe, seriously, where I'm from,
