Well you know, she calls herself black --

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
But anyway.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
(Laughter)

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
She has me here because she puts me in her show,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
what she calls her one-woman show.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And you know what that means, of course.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
That means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
But I don't mind.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Frankly, I'm kvelling just to be here

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
with all the luminaries you have attending something like this, you know.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Really, it's amazing.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Not only, of course, the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries
