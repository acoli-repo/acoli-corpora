00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Right now it's very exciting actually for me

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
because I'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
under the Senior Vice President for Business Development --

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
that's my new title.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So, but I think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
like something like this is so vital

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And if everybody, like all people really had access to that,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
it would be a very different world out there, as I know you know.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So, I think all people, we need that,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
but especially, I look at people like me, you know like,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I mean, Latinos -- we're about to be the majority, in like two weeks.
