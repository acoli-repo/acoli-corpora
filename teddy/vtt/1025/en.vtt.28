You know, as immigrant, I would speak Chinese to them,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and they would always answer me back in English.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
They love rock music, pop culture, American culture.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
But when they got older,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
when the time comes for them to start think about getting married,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000
that's when we expect them to realize, a little bit more, their own culture.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
But that's where we had some problems.
