00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
How do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Like, what if one could be anyone at any time?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Well my characters, like the ones in my shows,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
allow me to play with the spaces between those questions.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And so I've brought a couple of them with me.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And well, they're very excited.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What I should tell you --

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
what I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So feel free to think of this as Sarah University.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
(Laughter)

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Okay. Okay. Oh, well.
