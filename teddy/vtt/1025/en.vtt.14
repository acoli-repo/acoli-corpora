And, like, people would not believe, seriously, where I'm from,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that this even exists.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
You know, like even, I mean I love like the name, the -- TED.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I mean I know it's a real person and everything, but I'm just saying that like,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
you know, I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym, you know,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
which is like, you know, is like very high concept and everything like that.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I like that.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
At my school -- actually I was part of co-founding an organization,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
which is like a leadership thing,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
you know, like you guys, you would really like it and everything.
