So, basically like DA BOMB --

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
what Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:13.000
is, basically, we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and who also happen to be mothers like me.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I am a working mother, and I also go to school full-time.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And, you know, it's like -- it's so important to have like role models out there.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I mean, I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different, whatever.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
But like even at my job -- like, I just got promoted.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Right now it's very exciting actually for me
