00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And -- oh, I saw Goldie Hawn.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Oh, Goldie Hawn. I love her, too; she's wonderful. Yeah.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
You know, she's only half Jewish.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Did you know that about her?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Yeah. But even so, a wonderful talent. (Laughter)

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And I -- you know, when I saw her, such a wonderful feeling.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Yeah, she's lovely.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
But anyway, I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
It's such an eye-opening experience to be here.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
You're all so responsible for this world that we live in today.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
You know, I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl.
