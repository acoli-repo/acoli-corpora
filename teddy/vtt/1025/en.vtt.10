It's true. It's true.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
You know, between the environmental degradation

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And of course, we know it's all because of the -- all the ...

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Well, I don't know how else to say it to you, so I'll just say it my way:

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the, you know,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
the bankers and the Wall Street. You know it.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
The point is, I'm happy somebody has practical ideas

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
to get us out of this mess.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So I salute each of you and your stellar achievements.
