WEBVTT

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And then I thought no, no. I should just get up there and be myself

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and just talk the way I really talk

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
because, after all, this is the great unveiling.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And so I thought I'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
because I am from Queens, New York.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
(Laughter)

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But the theme of this session, of course, is invention.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And while I don't have any patents that I'm aware of,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
you will be meeting a few of my inventions today.
