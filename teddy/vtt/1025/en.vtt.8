You know, I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
You know, your parents must be very proud.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
But I -- I also appreciate the diversity that you have here.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I noticed it's very multicultural.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
You know, when you're standing up here, you can see all the different people.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
It's okay to say rainbow. Yeah.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I just -- I can't keep up with whether you can say, you know, the different things.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
What are you allowed to say or not say?
