00:07:26.561 --> 00:07:30.775
Artists who the world
has normally considered as mainstream

00:07:30.799 --> 00:07:33.450
are now realizing
they're late to the party.

00:07:33.474 --> 00:07:35.403
And they are knocking on the door,

00:07:35.427 --> 00:07:38.276
and because we are good people,
we are going to let them in.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.759
(Laughter)

00:07:39.783 --> 00:07:41.879
(Applause)

00:07:41.903 --> 00:07:45.561
When we look at an artist,
Queen B herself -- in brackets, Beyoncé --

00:07:45.585 --> 00:07:46.744
(Laughter)

00:07:46.768 --> 00:07:50.664
Beyoncé has African
influence in her music.

00:07:50.688 --> 00:07:52.855
A couple of years ago, in 2011,

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:56.466
through YouTube, she saw
these dancers called Tofo Tofo dancers,

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:57.752
from Mozambique,

00:07:57.776 --> 00:08:02.466
and she flew them all the way
from Mozambique to Los Angeles
