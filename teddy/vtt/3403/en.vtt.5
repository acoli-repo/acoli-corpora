00:02:29.117 --> 00:02:32.601
We have a couple of people paid
in the audience to make some noise for us.

00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:33.783
(Laughter)

00:02:33.807 --> 00:02:37.569
The four of us met
in high school, 15 years ago,

00:02:37.593 --> 00:02:40.546
and at the time, we were famous
for singing Boyz II Men covers,

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.315
because they were our biggest inspiration.

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:44.338
(Laughter)

00:02:44.362 --> 00:02:48.379
And I remember, in a very pervy way,
in my room, I had a Mariah Carey poster

00:02:48.403 --> 00:02:50.604
and a Britney Spears poster, too.

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:51.700
(Laughter)

00:02:51.724 --> 00:02:55.672
And I can't help but feel
that times have changed.

00:02:55.696 --> 00:02:59.283
Because what used to be
Mariah Carey in my room now,

00:02:59.307 --> 00:03:02.981
in a 15-year-old boy's room,
is Tiwa Savage.
