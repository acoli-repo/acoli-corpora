00:01:26.188 --> 00:01:32.653
In this case, since each wave takes 2 seconds,
the frequency is 0.5 waves per second.

00:01:32.653 --> 00:01:36.515
So enough about bobbing corks...
What about light and color?

00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:39.229
If light is a wave, then it must
have a frequency. Right?

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.942
Well... yes, it does.

00:01:40.942 --> 00:01:45.288
And it turns out that we already have a name for the frequency of the light that our eyes detect.

00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:46.982
It's called color.

00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:51.396
That's right. Color is nothing more than a measure
of how quickly the light waves are waving.

00:01:51.396 --> 00:01:55.731
If our eyes were quick enough, we might be able to observe this periodic motion directly,

00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:57.897
like we can with the cork and the ocean.

00:01:57.897 --> 00:02:00.161
But the frequency of the light
we see is so high,
