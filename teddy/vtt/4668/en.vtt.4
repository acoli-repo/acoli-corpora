00:01:57.897 --> 00:02:00.161
But the frequency of the light
we see is so high,

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:04.386
it waves up and down about
400 million million times a second,

00:02:04.387 --> 00:02:10.814
that we can't possibly see it as a wave. But we can tell, by looking at its color, what its frequency is.

00:02:10.814 --> 00:02:14.975
The lowest frequency light that we can see
is red and the highest frequency is purple.

00:02:14.975 --> 00:02:20.914
In between all the other frequencies form a continuous band of color, called the visible spectrum.

00:02:20.914 --> 00:02:24.139
So, what if you had a yellow pencil
sitting on your desk?

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:29.151
Well, the sun emits all colors of light,
so light of all colors is hitting your pencil.

00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:34.079
The pencil looks yellow because it reflects yellow light more than it reflects the other colors.
