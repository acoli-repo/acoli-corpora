00:00:58.234 --> 00:01:02.746
To use the physics jargon, you've measured
the period of the waves that cork is bobbing on.

00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:06.613
That is, how long it takes a wave to go
through its full range of motion once.

00:01:06.613 --> 00:01:12.530
The same information can be expressed
in a different way by calculating the wave's frequency.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.683
Frequency, as the name suggest, tells you
how frequent the waves are.

00:01:16.683 --> 00:01:19.746
That is, how many of them
go by in one second.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:22.631
If you know how many seconds
one full wave takes,

00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:26.188
then it's easy to work out
how many waves go by in one second.

00:01:26.188 --> 00:01:32.653
In this case, since each wave takes 2 seconds,
the frequency is 0.5 waves per second.
