Imagine you're sitting on a boat on the ocean
watching a cork bob up and down in the water.

00:00:33.085 --> 00:00:36.279
The first thing you notice about
the motion is that it repeats itself.

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:41.930
The cork traces the same path over and
over again... up and down, up and down.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.000
This repetitive or periodic motion
is characteristic of waves.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.430
Then you notice something else...

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.917
using a stopwatch, you measure
the time it takes for the piece of cork

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:56.381
to go over its highest position down
to its lowest and then back up again.

00:00:56.381 --> 00:00:58.234
Suppose this takes two seconds.

00:00:58.234 --> 00:01:02.746
To use the physics jargon, you've measured
the period of the waves that cork is bobbing on.
