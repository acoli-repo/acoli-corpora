and the good news has to do with what do we know

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.107
based on biomedical research

00:00:08.107 --> 00:00:11.561
that actually has changed the outcomes

00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:14.660
for many very serious diseases?

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.907
Let's start with leukemia,

00:00:16.907 --> 00:00:19.435
acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL,

00:00:19.435 --> 00:00:21.873
the most common cancer of children.

00:00:21.873 --> 00:00:23.835
When I was a student,

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:27.675
the mortality rate was about 95 percent.

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:30.808
Today, some 25, 30 years later, we're talking about
