00:00:00.538 --> 00:00:04.667
So having a sex problem
is like having a toothache.

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:08.921
By the time you get to the dentist,
or to me, a sex therapist,

00:00:08.963 --> 00:00:11.382
you just want to get out of pain.

00:00:11.424 --> 00:00:16.095
But what we just went through with COVID,
that was like a sexual root canal.

00:00:16.137 --> 00:00:20.224
I mean, we spent months
not changing out of our pajamas.

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:22.727
And sometimes not showering.

00:00:22.727 --> 00:00:26.397
No wonder so many of us lost our libidos.

00:00:26.397 --> 00:00:29.150
It's not that we're not sexual people.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.611
We want to want sex.
