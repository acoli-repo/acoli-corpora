00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:31.777
So, we in the UK are at the very early
stages in forming what will be

00:03:31.801 --> 00:03:35.548
Britain's first-ever
national disabled orchestra.

00:03:35.572 --> 00:03:37.906
We are going to call it
the British Paraorchestra,

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.820
because with the world's eyes
on London next year

00:03:40.844 --> 00:03:42.831
and particularly on the Paralympics,

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.532
we want to throw down the gauntlet

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:47.957
to every single other country
that is represented there,

00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:50.882
to say to them, "Here's our paraorchestra.

00:03:50.906 --> 00:03:52.397
Where's yours?"

00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:56.054
Every country should have
a multiplicity of paraorchestras

00:03:56.078 --> 00:03:58.099
of all shapes and sizes,

00:03:58.123 --> 00:03:59.592
no question.

00:03:59.616 --> 00:04:02.100
Now, today is a very special day for me,
