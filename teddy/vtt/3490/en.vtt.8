00:03:59.616 --> 00:04:02.100
Now, today is a very special day for me,

00:04:02.124 --> 00:04:05.717
because it is the first time
that the first four members

00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:08.526
of my little embryonic paraorchestra

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.199
are going to play in public;

00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:15.109
four extraordinary musicians
of which the number will grow and grow.

00:04:15.133 --> 00:04:19.681
I hope in the end the Paraorchestra
could even be as big as 50 musicians.

00:04:19.705 --> 00:04:22.740
We present to you today
a little sonic adventure,

00:04:22.764 --> 00:04:26.855
a little piece of improvisational
whimsy, if you like,

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.549
a piece on which, of course,
the ink is still wet,

00:04:29.573 --> 00:04:30.900
the clay is still wet.
