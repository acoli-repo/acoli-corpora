00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:01.435
the number of disabled
musicians I've encountered

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.025
in any orchestra,

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.219
anywhere.

00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:06.242
Why is this?

00:02:06.837 --> 00:02:10.511
You can't tell me that there
aren't millions upon millions

00:02:10.535 --> 00:02:16.558
of prodigiously gifted musicians
of disability around the world.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.615
Where is their platform?

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:22.218
Where is the infrastructure
that creates a space for them

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:26.019
so that they can collaborate
with other great musicians?

00:02:27.227 --> 00:02:29.625
So, ladies and gentlemen,
as you can probably tell,

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:30.892
I'm on a bit of a mission.
