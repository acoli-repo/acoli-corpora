00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:31.617
this way of speaking
to each and every one of us,

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:35.635
is that somehow it's capable
of holding up a mirror to us

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:38.966
that reveals, in some small or large way,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.690
a little bit of who or what we are.

00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:45.736
By logical extension of this,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.382
if music is this universal force,

00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:52.326
then surely groups of musicians --
let's call them orchestras --

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.214
should reflect every aspect
of the community.

00:00:56.893 --> 00:01:00.269
Logical, but not necessarily true.
