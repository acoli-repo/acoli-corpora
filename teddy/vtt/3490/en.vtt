Music is the most universal
language that we have,

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:09.165
way more so than any dialect or tongue.

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:12.646
You can play a melody to a child in China

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.552
and the same melody
to a child in South Africa.

00:00:16.072 --> 00:00:19.704
And despite the huge differences
between those two children,

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:23.946
they will still draw some of the same
truths from that melody.

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.367
Now, I think the reason why
music has this universality,

00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:31.617
this way of speaking
to each and every one of us,
