00:01:26.356 --> 00:01:30.055
Well, here we are 50 years on, in 2011,

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.232
and pretty much
every orchestra on the planet

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:35.936
has a fantastic and healthy balance
between the sexes.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.903
"Of course!" I hear you
say, "Totally logical."

00:01:40.652 --> 00:01:43.069
But how about another aspect
of the community?

00:01:43.093 --> 00:01:44.514
The disabled community.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.198
Do we find them well-represented
in the great orchestras of our world?

00:01:50.723 --> 00:01:52.715
Well, I can tell you as a conductor,

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:55.719
I work with orchestras
around the world all the time,

00:01:55.743 --> 00:01:59.087
and I can count on the fingers of one hand

00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:01.435
the number of disabled
musicians I've encountered
