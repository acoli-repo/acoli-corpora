(Laughter)

00:05:00.825 --> 00:05:02.917
Quietly melancholic.

00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:05.871
Not blackly so, just quietly so.

00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:09.452

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:17.861
So this melody, "Greensleeves,"

00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:19.047

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:22.924
(Laughter)

00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:25.461

00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:31.894
