00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:30.892
I'm on a bit of a mission.

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:32.967
And this mission has
a personal root to it.

00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:36.460

was born with cerebral palsy.

00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:39.883

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.009
and thinking what

00:02:53.568 --> 00:02:56.427
It's taken a good five decades, actually,

00:02:56.451 --> 00:02:58.066
but I can say with hand on heart

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.622
that when the Paralympics
comes to London next year,
