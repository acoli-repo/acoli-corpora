00:04:29.573 --> 00:04:30.900
the clay is still wet.

00:04:30.924 --> 00:04:33.286
After all, improvisation
is never a fixed thing.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.487
We decided what we wanted
to share with you,

00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:37.245
at the heart of our improvisation,

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:40.132
was a tune which is beloved
of British people.

00:04:40.156 --> 00:04:41.980
It's one of the only folk melodies

00:04:42.004 --> 00:04:44.341
that we still recognize in our culture.

00:04:44.865 --> 00:04:48.152
And here's an interesting thing:
folk music can tell you an awful lot

00:04:48.176 --> 00:04:51.751
about the cultural DNA of the country
from which it originates.

00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:55.689
You see, we in Britain
are quietly melancholic.

00:04:56.166 --> 00:04:58.446
You know, the rain ... it does rain.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.798
The food's not so good.

00:04:59.822 --> 00:05:00.801
