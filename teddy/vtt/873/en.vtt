00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So here it is. You can check: I am short, I'm French,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I have a pretty strong French accent,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so that's going to be clear in a moment.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Maybe a sobering thought

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and something you all know about.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And I suspect many of you gave

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
something to the people of Haiti this year.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And there is something else

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I believe in the back of your mind

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
you also know.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That is, every day,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
25,000 children die

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
of entirely preventable causes.
