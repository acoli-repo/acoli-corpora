00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Two years ago here at TED

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I reported that we had discovered

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
at Saturn, with the Cassini Spacecraft,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
an anomalously warm and geologically active region

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
at the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Enceladus, seen here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This region seen here for the first time

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in the Cassini image taken in 2005. This is the south polar region,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
with the famous tiger-stripe fractures crossing the south pole.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And seen just recently in late 2008,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
here is that region again,
