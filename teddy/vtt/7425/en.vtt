Nine years ago,

00:00:02.498 --> 00:00:05.084
I stood on a stage a lot like this one.

00:00:05.084 --> 00:00:09.839
It was at the TEDWomen conference
in Washington, DC, back in 2012.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.427
I was 22 years old,
a woman with a college degree.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.098
That's nothing too exceptional
to say here in the United States.

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.518
In Afghanistan, my homeland,

00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:25.313
women like me were the exception.

00:00:26.397 --> 00:00:30.109
It had been a little over a decade
since the fall of the Taliban regime.
