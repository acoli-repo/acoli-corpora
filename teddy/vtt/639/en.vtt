00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:03.008
I am a labor organizer,

00:00:03.032 --> 00:00:07.831
and in 2013, I cofounded
an organization called coworker.org

00:00:07.855 --> 00:00:12.104
that uses technology
to help people join with coworkers

00:00:12.128 --> 00:00:15.371
and organize for improvements
in the workplace.

00:00:15.986 --> 00:00:19.133
Now, there are two kinds
of reactions to what I do.

00:00:19.157 --> 00:00:20.977
Actually, no, there are three.

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:25.402
The first is complete confusion
about what organizing is.

00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:27.961
When my doctor asked
what I do and I told him,

00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:31.754
he thought I meant organizing,
like, Marie Kondo-style.
