So the storyline here
for both our OLED story and Star Trek

00:08:30.238 --> 00:08:33.437
is actually the basic setting
for a lot of breakthrough stories,

00:08:33.461 --> 00:08:35.182
in and out of science.

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:39.882
The main characters
are all part of a great team.

00:08:40.915 --> 00:08:45.352
All team members show a huge dedication
towards reaching their goal.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.147
They strive to seize
all the freedom they can get,

00:08:50.171 --> 00:08:53.336
and they take the responsibility
they need to take.

00:08:55.299 --> 00:08:58.617
During the time our OLED project
was nearing the end,

00:08:58.641 --> 00:09:02.029
I received one piece of advice
several times.
