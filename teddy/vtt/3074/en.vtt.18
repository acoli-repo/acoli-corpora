00:08:58.641 --> 00:09:02.029
I received one piece of advice
several times.

00:09:03.218 --> 00:09:04.869
"Don't take it to your heart.

00:09:05.591 --> 00:09:07.361
You can work on something else."

00:09:08.456 --> 00:09:09.949
If I had followed it,

00:09:09.973 --> 00:09:13.663
it would have saved me
several depressed evenings

00:09:13.687 --> 00:09:14.852
and many tears,

00:09:16.095 --> 00:09:17.508
but at the same time,

00:09:17.532 --> 00:09:23.008
I would have failed to gain a great deal
in personal development and happiness.

00:09:24.375 --> 00:09:27.710
And as the same is true
for my colleagues and our whole project,

00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:29.463
we would have achieved far less.
