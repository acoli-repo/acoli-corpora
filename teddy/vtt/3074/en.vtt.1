Mr. Spock is half-human and half-Vulcan,

00:00:31.655 --> 00:00:34.313
and Vulcans are an alien race

00:00:34.337 --> 00:00:37.052
who learn to control
and suppress their feelings

00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:39.090
and to act purely out of logic.

00:00:39.995 --> 00:00:42.710
As Mr. Spock is only half-Vulcan,

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:48.291
he sees himself constantly in conflict
in between logic and emotions,

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:50.339
and as he's part of a team,

00:00:50.363 --> 00:00:53.243
the whole crew is struggling with,

00:00:53.267 --> 00:00:55.038
is analyzing,

00:00:55.062 --> 00:00:56.887
and is making fun of this conflict.

00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.473
