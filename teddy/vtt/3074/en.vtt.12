00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:03.237
dedication, belonging and empowerment --

00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:06.706
worked together in a kind
of self-reinforcing cycle,

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.879
and the closer we got to shutdown,

00:06:08.903 --> 00:06:10.562
the better our output became.

00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:13.797
So we were working
with such personal engagement

00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:16.107
on a project already sentenced to death

00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:19.531
because we felt connected
to something meaningful.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.401
Of course, it was also a hard
and sometimes frustrating time,

00:06:26.425 --> 00:06:28.441
but we were sitting together in the lab,

00:06:28.465 --> 00:06:30.545
or occasionally in the café,
