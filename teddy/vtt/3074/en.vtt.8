which had started in 2001;

00:04:01.458 --> 00:04:07.131
and second, materials for green OLEDs,
which had started in 2014.

00:04:07.155 --> 00:04:10.472
And the results I show you here
concern the green OLED project.

00:04:11.297 --> 00:04:14.029
In the graph, you can see
how the lifetime,

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:17.840
which is a crucial measure
for the durability of our devices,

00:04:17.864 --> 00:04:19.521
developed over time.

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:24.748
In 2015, just half a year
into the project,

00:04:24.772 --> 00:04:27.178
we were told to scale down,

00:04:27.202 --> 00:04:30.377
