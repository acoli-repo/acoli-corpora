00:05:28.393 --> 00:05:32.085
our project was less and less
in the focus of the management,

00:05:32.109 --> 00:05:34.816
because they started
to think about new projects,

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.537
restructuring and so on.

00:05:37.434 --> 00:05:40.157
This resulted in additional freedom

00:05:40.181 --> 00:05:44.203
and the possibility to take
a few things into our own hands.

00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:49.747
Of course, more freedom
also means more responsibility,

00:05:49.771 --> 00:05:53.637
which we were happy to take,
because we believed in our work.

00:05:53.989 --> 00:05:55.661
We felt empowered.

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:58.385
And these three pillars --

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:03.237
dedication, belonging and empowerment --
