00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.473
And also the fans of Star Trek
watch with amusement

00:01:00.497 --> 00:01:02.728
this seemingly contradictory behavior.

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:06.268
They find it quite fascinating.

00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:09.028
And the matter is a golden thread

00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:12.715
through the whole Star Trek series
and movies from the '60s until today.

00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:15.916
And that's actually
what I want to talk about today:

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.266
the role of emotions in science.

00:01:19.353 --> 00:01:23.696
We tend to think that science
is all about facts and logic

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.029
and human feelings are often neglected
or considered an obstacle to get rid of.

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:33.300
I would like to suggest that emotions
are as important in science
