So of course, science
should be based on facts and logic.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.172
When I say we should use
our emotions in science,

00:09:39.196 --> 00:09:42.554
I do not suggest we should use
feelings instead of facts.

00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:46.659
But I say we should not be afraid
of using our feelings

00:09:46.683 --> 00:09:50.447
to implement and to catalyze
fact-based science and innovation.

00:09:51.229 --> 00:09:54.482
Emotions and logic
do not oppose each other.

00:09:54.967 --> 00:09:57.076
They complement each other,

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.949
and they reinforce each other.
