00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.392
but first let me share my experience
on the role of emotions in science,

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:07.305
and one story in particular
kept me thinking about it

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.026
for the last couple of years.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.195
I'm working in research
on organic light-emitting diodes,

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:15.742
so-called OLEDs.

00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:18.238
This is how you might know them,

00:02:18.262 --> 00:02:20.516
as new generation of displays.

00:02:21.262 --> 00:02:25.587
OLEDs are more and more used
in smartphone displays and TV screens.

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:30.318
They make them appear bright,
truly colorful and bendable.
