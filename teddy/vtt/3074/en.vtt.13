or occasionally in the café,

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:33.926
sharing our sadness
about the end of our project

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.481
as well as the joy in our work.

00:06:36.505 --> 00:06:41.954
So overall, we had a very intense
and mesmerizingly exciting time.

00:06:42.466 --> 00:06:46.370
And the lifetime we finally obtained
for our materials

00:06:46.394 --> 00:06:49.933
was on one level with already
commercialized materials

00:06:49.957 --> 00:06:52.074
for green OLEDs at the time,

00:06:52.098 --> 00:06:54.637
and we achieved this within just one year.

00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:58.479
And those results helped our employer

00:06:58.503 --> 00:07:00.796
to sell the patents for real value.
