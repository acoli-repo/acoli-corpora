They make them appear bright,
truly colorful and bendable.

00:02:31.963 --> 00:02:33.214
This is how they look like

00:02:33.238 --> 00:02:35.846
in the research lab
of my physicist colleagues.

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:39.170
And this is what I, as a chemist,

00:02:39.194 --> 00:02:41.638
have in mind when I think about them.

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:44.527
I've loved it ever since
I started to work on it.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:47.611
So I didn't really like the news

00:02:47.635 --> 00:02:49.953
when the company I had been working for --

00:02:49.977 --> 00:02:52.179
that was my previous employer --

00:02:52.203 --> 00:02:55.004
announced that they wanted
to stop OLED research.

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.090
At the time, the management
had reasons for this decision,

00:02:59.114 --> 00:03:01.532
and the company handled it
very well, actually.
