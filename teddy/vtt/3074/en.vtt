00:00:00.752 --> 00:00:02.928
I'm a scientist,

00:00:02.952 --> 00:00:06.040
and I'm a big fan of Star Trek,

00:00:06.064 --> 00:00:08.540
especially of Mr. Spock.

00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:11.807
Mr. Spock is a scientist as well,

00:00:11.831 --> 00:00:13.988
and at the same time,
he's the first [officer]

00:00:14.012 --> 00:00:16.980
of the starship Enterprise,

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:20.124
and during the adventures
of the Enterprise crew,

00:00:20.148 --> 00:00:22.274
he and his colleagues are dealing a lot

00:00:22.298 --> 00:00:26.940
with the presence or absence
of Mr. Spock's emotions.

00:00:27.924 --> 00:00:31.631
Mr. Spock is half-human and half-Vulcan,
