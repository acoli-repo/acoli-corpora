00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:33.300
I would like to suggest that emotions
are as important in science

00:01:33.324 --> 00:01:35.585
as they are in any other part
of our lives.

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:38.378
Science is made by humans,

00:01:38.402 --> 00:01:40.107
and as human beings,

00:01:40.131 --> 00:01:43.945
even if we try hard,
we cannot get rid of our emotions.

00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:46.883
So instead of fighting them,

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:50.455
I believe that even in science,
we should make use of our feelings,

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.685
because for breakthroughs and innovation,

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:55.320
they are equally important
as facts and logic.

00:01:57.256 --> 00:01:59.216
I will come back to Mr. Spock,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.392
but first let me share my experience
on the role of emotions in science,
