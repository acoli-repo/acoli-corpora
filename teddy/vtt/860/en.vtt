00:00:00.745 --> 00:00:02.974
To give me an idea of how many of you here

00:00:02.974 --> 00:00:05.096
may find what I'm about to tell you

00:00:05.096 --> 00:00:06.721
of practical value,

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:09.410
let me ask you please to raise your hands:

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.977
Who here is either over 65 years old

00:00:12.977 --> 00:00:16.746
or hopes to live past age 65

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:19.691
or has parents or grandparents who did live

00:00:19.691 --> 00:00:21.658
or have lived past 65,

00:00:21.658 --> 00:00:24.243
raise your hands please. (Laughter)

00:00:24.243 --> 00:00:26.397
Okay. You are the people to whom my talk

00:00:26.397 --> 00:00:28.831
will be of practical value. (Laughter)

00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:30.488
The rest of you
