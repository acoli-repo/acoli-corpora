all due to those sugar-loving bacteria.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.496
The more sugar our food contains,

00:02:02.496 --> 00:02:04.871
the more our teeth are put at risk.

00:02:04.871 --> 00:02:09.829
Those cavemen would hardly
have indulged in sugary treats, however,

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.954
so what caused their cavities?

00:02:11.954 --> 00:02:16.121
In meat-heavy diets, there would have
been a low-risk of cavities developing

00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:19.246
because lean meat 
contains very little sugar,

00:02:19.246 --> 00:02:22.288
but that's not all our early human
ancestors ate.

00:02:22.288 --> 00:02:27.288
Cavemen would also have consumed
root vegetables, nuts, and grains,

00:02:27.288 --> 00:02:29.829
all of which contain carbohydrates.

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.038
When exposed to enzymes in the saliva,
