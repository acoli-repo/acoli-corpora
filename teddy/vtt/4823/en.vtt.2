00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:03.287
using it as a molecular building block
and energy source.

00:01:03.287 --> 00:01:04.663
As they consume it,

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:07.954
the bacteria generate byproducts
in the form of acids,

00:01:07.954 --> 00:01:09.871
such as lactic acid.

00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:13.121
Mutans streptococci are resistant
to this acid,

00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:16.329
but unfortunately, our teeth aren't.

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:20.413
While each human tooth is coated
in a hardy, protective layer of enamel,

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.788
it's no match for acid.

00:01:22.788 --> 00:01:28.163
That degrades the armor over time,
leaching away its calcium minerals.

00:01:28.163 --> 00:01:31.579
Gradually, acid wears down a pathway
for bacteria
