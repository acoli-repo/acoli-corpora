00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.121
That strengthens teeth and encourages
the growth of enamel crystals

00:04:03.121 --> 00:04:06.454
that build up a tooth's defenses
against acid.

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:07.996
When cavities do develop,

00:04:07.996 --> 00:04:11.913
we use tooth fillings to fill 
and close off the infected area,

00:04:11.913 --> 00:04:13.996
preventing them from getting worse.

00:04:13.996 --> 00:04:18.121
The best way to avoid a cavity
is still cutting down on sugar intake

00:04:18.121 --> 00:04:20.163
and practicing good oral hygiene

00:04:20.163 --> 00:04:23.038
to get rid of the bacteria 
and their food sources.

00:04:23.038 --> 00:04:24.913
That includes regular tooth brushing,

00:04:24.913 --> 00:04:25.913
flossing,

00:04:25.913 --> 00:04:27.163
and avoiding sugary,

00:04:27.163 --> 00:04:27.996
starchy,

00:04:27.996 --> 00:04:31.663
and sticky foods that cling to your teeth
between meals.
