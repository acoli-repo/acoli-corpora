00:01:28.163 --> 00:01:31.579
Gradually, acid wears down a pathway
for bacteria

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.579
into the tooth's secondary layer
called the dentin.

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.204
Since blood vessels and nerves
in our teeth are enclosed deep within,

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:43.871
at this stage, the expanding cavity
doesn't hurt.

00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:46.038
But if the damage extends 
beyond the dentin,

00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:48.371
the bacterial invasion progresses

00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:52.871
causing excruciating pain
as the nerves become exposed.

00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:55.663
Without treatment, the whole tooth
may become infected

00:01:55.663 --> 00:01:57.329
and require removal

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.579
all due to those sugar-loving bacteria.
