00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:09.746
When a team of archaeologists
recently came across

00:00:09.746 --> 00:00:12.996
some 15,000 year-old human remains,

00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:15.288
they made an interesting discovery.

00:00:15.288 --> 00:00:19.121
The teeth of those ancient humans
were riddled with holes.

00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:23.954
Their cavities were caused by the same
thing that still plagues us today,

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:28.121
specific tiny microbes 
that live in our mouths.

00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:30.496
These microbes are with us
soon after birth.
