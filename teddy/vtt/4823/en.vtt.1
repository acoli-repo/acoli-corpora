00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:30.496
These microbes are with us
soon after birth.

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:34.329
We typically pick them up as babies
from our mothers' mouths.

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.912
And as our teeth erupt,

00:00:35.912 --> 00:00:39.954
they naturally begin to accumulate
communities of bacteria.

00:00:39.954 --> 00:00:41.204
Depending on what we eat,

00:00:41.204 --> 00:00:43.621
and specifically how much sugar
we consume,

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:48.496
certain microbes can overpopulate
and cause cavities.

00:00:48.496 --> 00:00:52.329
Diets high in sugary foods cause
an explosion of bacteria

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.996
called mutans streptococci
in our mouths.

00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:58.871
Like humans, these microorganisms
love sugar,

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:03.287
using it as a molecular building block
and energy source.
