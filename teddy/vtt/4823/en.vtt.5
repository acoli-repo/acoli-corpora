00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.038
When exposed to enzymes in the saliva,

00:02:32.038 --> 00:02:35.621
carbohydrates get broken down
into simpler sugars,

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:40.121
which can become the fodder
for those ravenous mouth bacteria.

00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:44.371
So while ancient humans did eat
less sugar compared to us,

00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:47.371
their teeth were still exposed to sugars.

00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:50.663
That doesn't mean they were unable
to treat their cavities, though.

00:02:50.663 --> 00:02:54.621
Archaeological remains show that
about 14,000 years ago,

00:02:54.621 --> 00:03:00.538
humans were already using sharpened flint
to remove bits of rotten teeth.
