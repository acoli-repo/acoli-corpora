00:02:54.621 --> 00:03:00.538
humans were already using sharpened flint
to remove bits of rotten teeth.

00:03:00.538 --> 00:03:02.913
Ancient humans even made
rudimentary drills

00:03:02.913 --> 00:03:05.996
to smooth out the rough holes left behind

00:03:05.996 --> 00:03:10.371
and beeswax to plug cavities,
like modern-day fillings.

00:03:10.371 --> 00:03:13.371
Today, we have much more sophisticated
techniques and tools,

00:03:13.371 --> 00:03:17.871
which is fortunate because we also need
to contend with our more damaging,

00:03:17.871 --> 00:03:20.163
sugar-guzzling ways.

00:03:20.163 --> 00:03:24.538
After the Industrial Revolution,
the human incidence of cavities surged

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:27.288
because suddenly 
we had technological advances

00:03:27.288 --> 00:03:31.204
that made refined sugar cheaper
and accessible.
