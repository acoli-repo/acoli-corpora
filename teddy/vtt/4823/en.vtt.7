00:03:27.288 --> 00:03:31.204
that made refined sugar cheaper
and accessible.

00:03:31.204 --> 00:03:37.038
Today, an incredible 92% of American 
adults have had cavities in their teeth.

00:03:37.038 --> 00:03:39.954
Some people are more susceptible 
to cavities due to genes

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:42.996
that may cause certain weaknesses,
like softer enamel,

00:03:42.996 --> 00:03:46.913
but for most, high sugar consumption
is to blame.

00:03:46.913 --> 00:03:50.204
However, we have developed other ways
of minimizing cavities

00:03:50.204 --> 00:03:53.746
besides reducing our intake of sugar
and starch.

00:03:53.746 --> 00:03:56.621
In most toothpastes 
and many water supplies,

00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:59.329
we use tiny amounts of fluoride.

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.121
That strengthens teeth and encourages
the growth of enamel crystals
