00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.795
The country faces enormous challenges.

00:14:00.819 --> 00:14:02.819
The social and economic problems that come

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:06.704
with wrenching change
like this are mind-boggling.

00:14:06.728 --> 00:14:10.251
Pollution is one. Food safety.
Population issues.

00:14:10.275 --> 00:14:14.198
On the political front, the worst
problem is corruption.

00:14:14.222 --> 00:14:17.030
Corruption is widespread
and undermines the system

00:14:17.054 --> 00:14:18.832
and its moral legitimacy.

00:14:18.856 --> 00:14:21.679
But most analysts misdiagnose the disease.

00:14:21.703 --> 00:14:24.588
They say that corruption is the result
of the one-party system,

00:14:24.612 --> 00:14:26.279
and therefore, in order to cure it,

00:14:26.303 --> 00:14:28.351
you have to do away
with the entire system.

00:14:28.375 --> 00:14:31.228
But a more careful look
would tell us otherwise.
