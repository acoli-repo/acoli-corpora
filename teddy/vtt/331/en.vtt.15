00:07:29.814 --> 00:07:32.213
are unrecognizable today.

00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:35.399
Now such changes are simply not possible

00:07:35.423 --> 00:07:39.119
without political reforms
of the most fundamental kind.

00:07:39.143 --> 00:07:41.312
Now I would venture to suggest the Party

00:07:41.336 --> 00:07:45.419
is the world's leading
expert in political reform.

00:07:45.443 --> 00:07:48.451
The second assumption
is that in a one-party state,

00:07:48.475 --> 00:07:51.182
power gets concentrated
in the hands of the few,

00:07:51.206 --> 00:07:53.884
and bad governance and corruption follow.

00:07:53.908 --> 00:07:56.057
Indeed, corruption is a big problem,

00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:58.191
but let's first look
at the larger context.

00:07:58.215 --> 00:08:00.319
Now, this may be counterintuitive to you.
