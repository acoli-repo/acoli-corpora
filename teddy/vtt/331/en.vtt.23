George W. Bush, remember him?

00:11:32.142 --> 00:11:34.559
This is not a put-down.

00:11:34.583 --> 00:11:35.364
(Laughter)

00:11:35.388 --> 00:11:38.463
Before becoming governor of Texas,

00:11:38.487 --> 00:11:41.082
or Barack Obama
before running for president,

00:11:41.106 --> 00:11:43.841
could not make even a small county manager

00:11:43.865 --> 00:11:45.769
in China's system.

00:11:45.793 --> 00:11:47.793
Winston Churchill once said that democracy

00:11:47.817 --> 00:11:50.110
is a terrible system
except for all the rest.

00:11:50.134 --> 00:11:54.391
Well, apparently he hadn't heard
of the Organization Department.

00:11:54.415 --> 00:11:56.735
Now, Westerners always assume that

00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:59.753
multi-party election
with universal suffrage

00:11:59.777 --> 00:12:02.895
is the only source
of political legitimacy.
