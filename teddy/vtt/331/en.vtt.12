00:05:57.413 --> 00:06:00.949
In 64 years of running the largest
country in the world,

00:06:00.973 --> 00:06:03.509
the range of the Party's policies
has been wider

00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:06.426
than any other country in recent memory,

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.397
from radical land collectivization
to the Great Leap Forward,

00:06:10.421 --> 00:06:13.049
then privatization of farmland,

00:06:13.073 --> 00:06:15.345
then the Cultural Revolution,

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:18.041
then Deng Xiaoping's market reform,

00:06:18.065 --> 00:06:21.454
then successor Jiang Zemin
took the giant political step

00:06:21.478 --> 00:06:24.602
of opening up Party membership
to private businesspeople,

00:06:24.626 --> 00:06:27.665
something unimaginable during Mao's rule.

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:31.486
So the Party self-corrects
in rather dramatic fashions.
