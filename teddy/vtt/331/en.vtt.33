00:16:28.549 --> 00:16:31.124
The significance of China's example

00:16:31.148 --> 00:16:33.091
is not that it provides an alternative,

00:16:33.115 --> 00:16:37.531
but the demonstration
that alternatives exist.

00:16:37.555 --> 00:16:41.165
Let us draw to a close this
era of meta-narratives.

00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:44.528
Communism and democracy may
both be laudable ideals,

00:16:44.552 --> 00:16:48.629
but the era of their dogmatic
universalism is over.

00:16:48.653 --> 00:16:51.116
Let us stop telling
people and our children

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.368
there's only one way to govern ourselves

00:16:53.392 --> 00:16:55.177
and a singular future towards which

00:16:55.201 --> 00:16:57.559
all societies must evolve.

00:16:57.583 --> 00:17:00.354
It is wrong. It is irresponsible.
