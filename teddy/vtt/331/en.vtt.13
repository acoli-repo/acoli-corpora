00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:31.486
So the Party self-corrects
in rather dramatic fashions.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.116
Institutionally, new rules get enacted

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.695
to correct previous dysfunctions.

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:38.569
For example, term limits.

00:06:38.593 --> 00:06:41.355
Political leaders used to retain
their positions for life,

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:43.189
and they used that to accumulate power

00:06:43.213 --> 00:06:44.758
and perpetuate their rules.

00:06:44.782 --> 00:06:46.978
Mao was the father of modern China,

00:06:47.002 --> 00:06:49.850
yet his prolonged rule led
to disastrous mistakes.

00:06:49.874 --> 00:06:52.010
So the Party instituted term limits

00:06:52.034 --> 00:06:55.763
with mandatory retirement age of 68 to 70.

00:06:55.787 --> 00:06:58.012
One thing we often hear is,

00:06:58.036 --> 00:07:01.190
"Political reforms have lagged
far behind economic reforms,"
