00:06:58.036 --> 00:07:01.190
"Political reforms have lagged
far behind economic reforms,"

00:07:01.214 --> 00:07:04.464
and "China is in dire need
of political reform."

00:07:04.488 --> 00:07:07.423
But this claim is a rhetorical trap

00:07:07.447 --> 00:07:10.039
hidden behind a political bias.

00:07:10.063 --> 00:07:12.536
See, some have decided a priori

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.418
what kinds of changes they want to see,

00:07:14.442 --> 00:07:18.025
and only such changes can
be called political reform.

00:07:18.049 --> 00:07:20.985
The truth is, political
reforms have never stopped.

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:24.218
Compared with 30 years ago,
20 years, even 10 years ago,

00:07:24.242 --> 00:07:26.608
every aspect of Chinese society,

00:07:26.632 --> 00:07:27.480
how the country is governed,

00:07:27.504 --> 00:07:29.790
from the most local level
to the highest center,

00:07:29.814 --> 00:07:32.213
are unrecognizable today.
