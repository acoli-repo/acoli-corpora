It also claims that all human societies

00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:04.660
develop in a linear progression
towards a singular end.

00:02:04.684 --> 00:02:07.185
This one went as follows:

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.541
All societies, regardless of culture,

00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:12.231
be it Christian, Muslim, Confucian,

00:02:12.255 --> 00:02:14.960
must progress from traditional societies

00:02:14.984 --> 00:02:17.506
in which groups are the basic units

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.007
to modern societies
in which atomized individuals

00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:22.470
are the sovereign units,

00:02:22.494 --> 00:02:26.213
and all these individuals
are, by definition, rational,

00:02:26.237 --> 00:02:28.279
and they all want one thing:

00:02:28.303 --> 00:02:30.779
the vote.
