00:08:27.987 --> 00:08:30.793
The vast majority
of senior Chinese leaders

00:08:30.817 --> 00:08:33.438
worked and competed their way to the top.

00:08:33.462 --> 00:08:35.570
Compare that with the ruling elites

00:08:35.594 --> 00:08:37.672
in both developed
and developing countries,

00:08:37.696 --> 00:08:40.182
I think you'll find the Party
being near the top

00:08:40.206 --> 00:08:42.816
in upward mobility.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.345
The question then is,
how could that be possible

00:08:45.369 --> 00:08:48.564
in a system run by one party?

00:08:48.588 --> 00:08:51.456
Now we come to a powerful
political institution,

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.973
little-known to Westerners:

00:08:52.997 --> 00:08:55.624
the Party's Organization Department.

00:08:55.648 --> 00:08:57.824
The department functions like a giant

00:08:57.848 --> 00:09:00.200
human resource engine
that would be the envy
