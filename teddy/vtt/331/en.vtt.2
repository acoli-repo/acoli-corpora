00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:01.166
in this paradise on Earth

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.934
and live happily ever after.

00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.221
But before we get there, we're engaged

00:01:06.245 --> 00:01:08.662
in a struggle between good and evil,

00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:11.803
the good of socialism
against the evil of capitalism,

00:01:11.827 --> 00:01:13.750
and the good shall triumph.

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:16.246
That, of course, was the meta-narrative

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.026
distilled from the theories of Karl Marx.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.628
And the Chinese bought it.

00:01:21.652 --> 00:01:24.541
We were taught that grand
story day in and day out.

00:01:24.565 --> 00:01:27.314
It became part of us,
and we believed in it.

00:01:27.338 --> 00:01:29.508
The story was a bestseller.

00:01:29.532 --> 00:01:31.818
About one third of the entire
world's population
