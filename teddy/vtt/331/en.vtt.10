00:04:59.663 --> 00:05:02.720
Middle class is expanding
in speed and scale

00:05:02.744 --> 00:05:04.721
unprecedented in human history.

00:05:04.745 --> 00:05:07.258
Yet, according to the grand story,

00:05:07.282 --> 00:05:10.193
none of this should be happening.

00:05:10.217 --> 00:05:13.399
So I went and did the only thing I could.
I studied it.

00:05:13.423 --> 00:05:15.406
Yes, China is a one-party state

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.291
run by the Chinese Communist
Party, the Party,

00:05:19.315 --> 00:05:21.243
and they don't hold elections.

00:05:21.267 --> 00:05:23.802
Three assumptions are made

00:05:23.826 --> 00:05:26.456
by the dominant political
theories of our time.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.339
Such a system is operationally rigid,

00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:33.025
politically closed,
and morally illegitimate.
