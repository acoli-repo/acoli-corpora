00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:32.409
through four increasingly elite ranks:

00:09:32.433 --> 00:09:35.721
fuke [deputy section manager], ke [section manager], fuchu
[deputy division manager], and chu [division manger].

00:09:35.745 --> 00:09:38.031
Now these are not moves
from "Karate Kid," okay?

00:09:38.055 --> 00:09:41.375
It's serious business.

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:43.712
The range of positions is wide,

00:09:43.736 --> 00:09:45.498
from running health care in a village

00:09:45.522 --> 00:09:47.559
to foreign investment in a city district

00:09:47.583 --> 00:09:49.684
to manager in a company.

00:09:49.708 --> 00:09:52.280
Once a year, the department
reviews their performance.

00:09:52.304 --> 00:09:54.615
They interview
their superiors, their peers,

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:57.396
their subordinates. They vet
their personal conduct.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.428
They conduct public opinion surveys.

00:09:59.452 --> 00:10:01.391
Then they promote the winners.
