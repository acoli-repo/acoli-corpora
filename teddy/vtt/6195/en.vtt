Paying close attention to something:

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.520
Not that easy, is it?

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.536
It's because our attention is pulled
in so many different directions at a time,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.640
and it's in fact pretty impressive
if you can stay focused.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.416
Many people think that attention
is all about what we are focusing on,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.240
but it's also about what information
our brain is trying to filter out.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.040
There are two ways
you direct your attention.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.160
First, there's overt attention.
