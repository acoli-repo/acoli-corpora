00:02:59.863 --> 00:03:03.951
Now, there are some skeptics that believe
that art just belongs in an art museum.

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.615
They believe that it has no practical
use beyond its aesthetic value.

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.180
I know who they are
in every audience I teach.

00:03:12.204 --> 00:03:14.949
Their arms are crossed,
their legs are crossed,

00:03:14.973 --> 00:03:16.625
their body language is saying,

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:19.222
"What am I going to learn
from this lady who talks fast

00:03:19.246 --> 00:03:21.187
about painting and sculpture?"

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:25.341
So how do I make it relevant for them?

00:03:27.078 --> 00:03:29.309
I ask them to look at this work of art,

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:31.594
like this portrait by Kumi Yamashita.
