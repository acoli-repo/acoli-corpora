Now that might be
interesting to some of you,

00:04:00.865 --> 00:04:03.886
but what does it have to do
with the work that these people do?

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.753
And the answer is everything.

00:04:05.777 --> 00:04:10.061
Because we all interact with people
multiple times on a daily basis,

00:04:10.085 --> 00:04:12.491
and we need to get better
at asking questions

00:04:12.515 --> 00:04:14.327
about what it is that we see.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.981
Learning to frame
the question in such a way

00:04:18.005 --> 00:04:21.056
as to elicit the information
that we need to do our jobs,

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.855
is a critical life skill.

00:04:23.664 --> 00:04:25.950
Like the radiologist who told me

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:28.474
that looking at the negative
spaces in a painting

00:04:28.498 --> 00:04:32.524
helped her discern
more discreet abnormalities in an MRI.
