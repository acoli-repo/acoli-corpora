It's a powerful tool
that engages both sight and insight

00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:07.278
and reframes our understanding
of where we are and what we see.

00:02:08.535 --> 00:02:11.576
Here's an example of a work of art

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.529
that reminded me
that visual intelligence --

00:02:14.553 --> 00:02:16.503
it's an ongoing learning process

00:02:16.527 --> 00:02:18.579
and one that really is never mastered.

00:02:19.121 --> 00:02:22.911
I came across this quiet,
seemingly abstract painting,

00:02:22.935 --> 00:02:25.238
and I had to step up to it twice,

00:02:25.262 --> 00:02:26.478
even three times,

00:02:26.502 --> 00:02:29.564
to understand why it resonated so deeply.
