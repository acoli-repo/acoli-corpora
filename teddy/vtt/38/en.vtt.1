00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:32.469
is made from one piece of sculpture.

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:34.438
There is no clock,

00:00:34.462 --> 00:00:36.002
there is no rope,

00:00:36.026 --> 00:00:37.456
and there is no sheet.

00:00:38.022 --> 00:00:41.805
It is one piece of bleached
Honduras mahogany.

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:44.659
Now let me be clear:

00:00:44.683 --> 00:00:49.201
this exercise was not
about looking at sculpture.

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:51.659
It's about looking

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.215
and understanding
that looking closely can save a life,

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.709
change your company

00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:02.996
and even help you understand
why your children behave the way they do.
