00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:02.279
Take a look at this work of art.

00:00:04.178 --> 00:00:05.697
What is it that you see?

00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:10.715
At first glance, it looks
to be a grandfather clock

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:12.482
with a sheet thrown over it

00:00:12.506 --> 00:00:14.402
and a rope tied around the center.

00:00:15.657 --> 00:00:18.705
But a first look always warrants a second.

00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:20.741
Look again.

00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:22.901
What do you see now?

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.743
If you look more closely,

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:29.917
you'll realize
that this entire work of art

00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:32.469
is made from one piece of sculpture.
