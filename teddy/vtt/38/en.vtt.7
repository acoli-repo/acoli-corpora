00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:31.594
like this portrait by Kumi Yamashita.

00:03:32.388 --> 00:03:34.406
And I ask them to step in close,

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.651
and even closer still,

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.912
and while they're looking
at the work of art,

00:03:38.936 --> 00:03:41.636
they need to be asking questions
about what they see.

00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:44.083
And if they ask the right questions,

00:03:44.107 --> 00:03:45.725
like, "What is this work of art?

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:47.524
Is it a painting? Is it a sculpture?

00:03:47.548 --> 00:03:48.698
What is it made of?" ...

00:03:48.722 --> 00:03:51.951
they will find out
that this entire work of art

00:03:51.975 --> 00:03:53.719
is made of a wooden board,

00:03:53.743 --> 00:03:55.372
10,000 nails

00:03:55.396 --> 00:03:58.002
and one unbroken piece of sewing thread.

00:03:58.663 --> 00:04:00.841
Now that might be
interesting to some of you,
