00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:03.540
is the ability to find visual connections
where they may not be apparent.

00:09:04.442 --> 00:09:07.494
Like Marie Watt's totem pole of blankets.

00:09:07.518 --> 00:09:11.602
It illustrates that finding hidden
connections in everyday objects

00:09:11.626 --> 00:09:13.357
can resonate so deeply.

00:09:13.796 --> 00:09:16.477
The artist collected blankets
from all different people

00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:17.969
in her community,

00:09:17.993 --> 00:09:21.247
and she had the owners
of the blankets write, on a tag,

00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:23.815
the significance of
the blanket to the family.

00:09:24.448 --> 00:09:27.113
Some of the blankets
had been used for baby blankets,

00:09:27.137 --> 00:09:29.337
some of them had been used
as picnic blankets,

00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:31.773
some of them had been used for the dog.
