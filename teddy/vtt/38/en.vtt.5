Now, I've seen the Washington Monument
in person thousands of times,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.454
well aware of the change in the color
of marble a third of the way up,

00:02:38.478 --> 00:02:41.678
but I had never really looked
at it out of context

00:02:41.702 --> 00:02:43.635
or truly as a work of art.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.534
And here, Georgia O'Keeffe's painting
of this architectural icon made me realize

00:02:50.558 --> 00:02:52.748
that if we put our mind to it,

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:55.934
it's possible to see everyday things

00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:58.901
in a wholly new
and eye-opening perspective.

00:02:59.863 --> 00:03:03.951
Now, there are some skeptics that believe
that art just belongs in an art museum.
