00:07:28.687 --> 00:07:31.367
You need to have contingencies
for the unforeseen,

00:07:31.391 --> 00:07:33.867
the unexpected and the unknown,

00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:36.544
whenever and however they may happen.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.747
Now, using art to increase
our visual intelligence

00:07:41.771 --> 00:07:43.832
involves planning for contingencies,

00:07:43.856 --> 00:07:46.254
understanding the big picture
and the small details

00:07:46.278 --> 00:07:47.913
and noticing what's not there.

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:50.853
So in this painting by Magritte,

00:07:50.877 --> 00:07:54.027
noticing that there are no tracks
under the train,

00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:56.215
there is no fire in the fireplace

00:07:56.239 --> 00:07:58.417
and there are no candles
in the candlesticks

00:07:58.441 --> 00:08:01.258
actually more accurately
describes the painting
