"You see that guy in the pink?" --

00:06:31.425 --> 00:06:32.655
referring to Christ --

00:06:32.679 --> 00:06:35.321
he said, "I'd collar him,
he's causing all the trouble."

00:06:35.345 --> 00:06:38.473
(Laughter)

00:06:38.497 --> 00:06:43.894
So looking at art gives us a perfect
vehicle to rethink how we solve problems

00:06:43.918 --> 00:06:45.560
without the aid of technology.

00:06:45.584 --> 00:06:48.267
Looking at the work
of Felix Gonzalez-Torres,

00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:51.378
you see two clocks
in perfect synchronicity.

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:55.966
The hour, minute and
second hand perfectly aligned.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.292
They are installed side by side
and they're touching,

00:06:59.316 --> 00:07:02.394
and they are entitled
"'Untitled' (Perfect Lovers)."
