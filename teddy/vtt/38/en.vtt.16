00:07:58.441 --> 00:08:01.258
actually more accurately
describes the painting

00:08:01.282 --> 00:08:04.797
than if you were to say, "Well,
there's a train coming out of a fireplace,

00:08:04.821 --> 00:08:06.907
and there are candlesticks on the mantle."

00:08:06.931 --> 00:08:09.594
It may sound counterintuitive
to say what isn't there,

00:08:09.618 --> 00:08:11.655
but it's really a very valuable tool.

00:08:12.398 --> 00:08:15.158
When a detective who had learned
about visual intelligence

00:08:15.182 --> 00:08:16.333
in North Carolina

00:08:16.357 --> 00:08:17.833
was called to the crime scene,

00:08:17.857 --> 00:08:19.297
it was a boating fatality,

00:08:19.321 --> 00:08:22.881
and the eyewitness told this detective
that the boat had flipped over

00:08:22.905 --> 00:08:25.616
and the occupant had drowned underneath.

00:08:26.055 --> 00:08:29.705
Now, instinctively, crime scene
investigators look for what is apparent,

00:08:29.729 --> 00:08:31.929
but this detective
did something different.
