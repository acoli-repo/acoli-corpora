00:08:29.729 --> 00:08:31.929
but this detective
did something different.

00:08:31.953 --> 00:08:34.540
He looked for what wasn't there,
which is harder to do.

00:08:35.045 --> 00:08:36.360
And he raised the question:

00:08:36.384 --> 00:08:39.296
if the boat had really
tipped flipped over --

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.538
as the eyewitness said that it did --

00:08:41.562 --> 00:08:44.317
how come the papers that were kept
at one end of the boat

00:08:44.341 --> 00:08:45.942
were completely dry?

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.288
Based on that one small
but critical observation,

00:08:50.312 --> 00:08:54.273
the investigation shifted
from accidental death to homicide.

00:08:56.257 --> 00:08:58.897
Now, equally important
to saying what isn't there

00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:03.540
is the ability to find visual connections
where they may not be apparent.
