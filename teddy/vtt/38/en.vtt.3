00:01:26.632 --> 00:01:31.061
Because we all think we get it
in a first glance and a sudden flash,

00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:35.576
but the real skill is in understanding
how to look slowly

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.475
and how to look more carefully.

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:39.871
The talent is in remembering --

00:01:39.895 --> 00:01:43.948
in the crush of the daily urgencies
that demand our attention --

00:01:43.972 --> 00:01:48.025
to step back and look through
those lenses to help us see

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.802
what we've been missing all along.

00:01:51.026 --> 00:01:54.238
So how can looking at painting
and sculpture help?

00:01:54.702 --> 00:01:56.883
Because art is a powerful tool.

00:01:58.187 --> 00:02:02.771
It's a powerful tool
that engages both sight and insight
