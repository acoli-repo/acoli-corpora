The group of counterterrorism officials
had five minutes with that painting,

00:06:01.956 --> 00:06:05.868
and in that short amount of time,
they had to assess the situation,

00:06:05.892 --> 00:06:07.582
analyze the details,

00:06:07.606 --> 00:06:09.298
articulate what, if anything,

00:06:09.322 --> 00:06:11.845
they would do if they were
in that painting.

00:06:13.329 --> 00:06:16.729
As you can imagine,
observations and insights differed.

00:06:16.753 --> 00:06:17.904
Who would they talk to?

00:06:17.928 --> 00:06:19.434
Who would be the best witness?

00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:21.044
Who was a good potential witness?

00:06:21.068 --> 00:06:22.219
Who was lurking?

00:06:22.243 --> 00:06:23.643
Who had the most information?

00:06:24.131 --> 00:06:27.603
But my favorite comment
came from a seasoned cop

00:06:27.627 --> 00:06:29.742
who looked at the central figure and said,

00:06:29.766 --> 00:06:31.401
"You see that guy in the pink?" --
