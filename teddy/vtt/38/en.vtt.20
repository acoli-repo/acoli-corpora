00:09:57.195 --> 00:10:00.892
If that patient has someone
in the outside world

00:10:00.916 --> 00:10:02.829
to assist them and help them,

00:10:02.853 --> 00:10:07.217
the doctor can implement the best care
with that connection in mind.

00:10:08.075 --> 00:10:11.261
In medicine, people
are connected as humans

00:10:11.285 --> 00:10:14.517
before they're identified
as doctor and patient.

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:18.254
But this method of enhancing perception --

00:10:18.278 --> 00:10:19.756
it need not be disruptive,

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.580
and it doesn't necessitate
an overhaul in looking.

00:10:23.173 --> 00:10:27.142
Like Jorge Méndez Blake's sculpture
of building a brick wall

00:10:27.166 --> 00:10:30.000
above Kafka's book "El Castillo"
