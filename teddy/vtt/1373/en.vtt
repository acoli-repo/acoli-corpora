00:00:01.047 --> 00:00:02.366
Over the next five minutes,

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.039
my intention is to transform
your relationship with sound.

00:00:06.063 --> 00:00:07.638
Let me start with the observation

00:00:07.662 --> 00:00:09.880
that most of the sound
around us is accidental;

00:00:09.904 --> 00:00:12.018
much of it is unpleasant. (Traffic noise)

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:14.805
We stand on street corners,
shouting over noise like this,

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:16.205
pretending it doesn't exist.

00:00:16.229 --> 00:00:18.206
This habit of suppressing sound has meant

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.578
that our relationship with sound
has become largely unconscious.

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:24.579
There are four major ways
sound is affecting you all the time,

00:00:24.603 --> 00:00:27.198
and I'd like to raise them
in your consciousness today.

00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:28.843
The first is physiological.

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:31.737
