00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:03.105
once you understand people's relationships
with these government numbers.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.465
On the one hand, there are those who say
these statistics are crucial,

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:09.119
that we need them to make sense
of society as a whole

00:01:09.143 --> 00:01:11.307
in order to move beyond
emotional anecdotes

00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:13.741

and they don't really reflect

00:01:21.086 --> 00:01:23.382
what's happening
in people's everyday lives.

00:01:23.406 --> 00:01:26.893
It kind of feels like that second group
is winning the argument right now.

00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:29.025
We're living in a world
of alternative facts,

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.984
where people don't find statistics
this kind of common ground,
