00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.227
then you spoke to 48 women
to claim that they work.

00:10:31.251 --> 00:10:32.277
(Laughter)

00:10:32.301 --> 00:10:35.857
Private companies don't have a huge
interest in getting the numbers right,

00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:37.636
they just need the right numbers.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.680
Government statisticians aren't like that.

00:10:39.704 --> 00:10:42.151
In theory, at least,
they're totally impartial,

00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:45.676
not least because most of them do
their jobs regardless of who's in power.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.862
They're civil servants.

00:10:46.886 --> 00:10:48.850
And to do their jobs properly,

00:10:48.874 --> 00:10:51.237
they don't just speak
to a couple hundred people.

00:10:51.261 --> 00:10:53.579
Those unemployment numbers
I keep on referencing

00:10:53.603 --> 00:10:55.607
come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,

00:10:55.631 --> 00:10:56.966
and to make their estimates,

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.479
they speak to over 140,000
businesses in this country.
