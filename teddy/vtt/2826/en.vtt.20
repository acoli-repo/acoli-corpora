00:09:59.805 --> 00:10:03.207
which means anyone could have found it
on the internet and completed it.

00:10:03.231 --> 00:10:06.570
There's no way of knowing
if those people even identified as Muslim.

00:10:06.594 --> 00:10:09.206
And finally, there were 600
respondents in that poll.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.884
There are roughly three million
Muslims in this country,

00:10:11.908 --> 00:10:13.515
according to Pew Research Center.

00:10:13.539 --> 00:10:16.532
That means the poll spoke to roughly
one in every 5,000 Muslims

00:10:16.556 --> 00:10:17.724
in this country.

00:10:17.748 --> 00:10:19.014
This is one of the reasons

00:10:19.038 --> 00:10:22.645
why government statistics
are often better than private statistics.

00:10:22.669 --> 00:10:25.704
A poll might speak to a couple
hundred people, maybe a thousand,

00:10:25.728 --> 00:10:28.786
or if you're L'Oreal, trying to sell
skin care products in 2005,

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.227
then you spoke to 48 women
to claim that they work.
