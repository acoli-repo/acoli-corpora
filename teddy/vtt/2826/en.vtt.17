Nowadays, male unemployment rate is higher

once you change the scale,
you can change the story.

00:08:49.503 --> 00:08:52.883
OK, so the third and final question

00:08:52.907 --> 00:08:54.726
when you're looking at statistics is:

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.623
How was the data collected?

00:08:57.667 --> 00:09:00.606
So far, I've only talked about the way
