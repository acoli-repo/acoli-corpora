00:08:57.667 --> 00:09:00.606
So far, I've only talked about the way
data is communicated,

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.906
but the way it's collected
matters just as much.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.097
I know this is tough,

00:09:04.121 --> 00:09:07.202
because methodologies can be opaque
and actually kind of boring,

00:09:07.226 --> 00:09:10.099
but there are some simple steps
you can take to check this.

00:09:10.123 --> 00:09:11.962
I'll use one last example here.

00:09:12.309 --> 00:09:16.196
One poll found that 41 percent of Muslims
in this country support jihad,

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.745
which is obviously pretty scary,

00:09:17.769 --> 00:09:20.411
and it was reported everywhere in 2015.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:23.050
When I want to check a number like that,

00:09:23.074 --> 00:09:25.575
I'll start off by finding
the original questionnaire.

00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:28.525
It turns out that journalists
who reported on that statistic

00:09:28.549 --> 00:09:30.780
ignored a question
lower down on the survey
