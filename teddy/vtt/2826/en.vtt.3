00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.984
where people don't find statistics
this kind of common ground,

00:01:32.008 --> 00:01:33.644
this starting point for debate.

00:01:33.668 --> 00:01:34.954
This is a problem.

00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:37.045
There are actually
moves in the US right now

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.930
to get rid of some government
statistics altogether.

00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:43.341
Right now there's a bill in congress
about measuring racial inequality.

00:01:43.365 --> 00:01:46.166
The draft law says that government
money should not be used

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.092
to collect data on racial segregation.

00:01:48.116 --> 00:01:50.001
This is a total disaster.

00:01:50.025 --> 00:01:51.773
If we don't have this data,

00:01:51.797 --> 00:01:53.575
how can we observe discrimination,

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:54.877
let alone fix it?

00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:56.089
In other words:

00:01:56.113 --> 00:01:58.172
How can a government create fair policies

00:01:58.196 --> 00:02:00.967
if they can't measure
current levels of unfairness?
