00:05:28.272 --> 00:05:30.944
For example, instead
of finding out the probability

00:05:30.968 --> 00:05:33.094
of getting the flu in any given month,

00:05:33.118 --> 00:05:35.910
you can see the rough
distribution of flu season.

00:05:35.934 --> 00:05:37.101
This is --

00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:38.143
(Laughter)

00:05:38.167 --> 00:05:39.653
a bad shot to show in February.

00:05:39.677 --> 00:05:42.132
But it's also more responsible
data visualization,

00:05:42.156 --> 00:05:44.611
because if you were to show
the exact probabilities,

00:05:44.635 --> 00:05:47.227
maybe that would encourage
people to get their flu jabs

00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:48.707
at the wrong time.

00:05:49.163 --> 00:05:50.856
The point of these shaky lines

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.791
is so that people remember
these imprecisions,

00:05:53.815 --> 00:05:57.042
but also so they don't necessarily
walk away with a specific number,

00:05:57.066 --> 00:05:58.932
but they can remember important facts.

00:05:58.956 --> 00:06:02.980
Facts like injustice and inequality
leave a huge mark on our lives.
