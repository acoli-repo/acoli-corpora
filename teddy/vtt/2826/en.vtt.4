00:01:58.196 --> 00:02:00.967
if they can't measure
current levels of unfairness?

00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:02.785
This isn't just about discrimination,

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:04.479
it's everything -- think about it.

00:02:04.503 --> 00:02:06.193
How can we legislate on health care

00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:08.488
if we don't have good data
on health or poverty?

00:02:08.512 --> 00:02:10.710
How can we have public debate
about immigration

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:11.984
if we can't at least agree

00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:14.651
on how many people are entering
and leaving the country?

00:02:14.675 --> 00:02:17.733
Statistics come from the state;
that's where they got their name.

00:02:17.757 --> 00:02:19.914
The point was to better
measure the population

00:02:19.938 --> 00:02:21.295
in order to better serve it.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.044
So we need these government numbers,

00:02:23.068 --> 00:02:25.715
but we also have to move
beyond either blindly accepting

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.007
or blindly rejecting them.

00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:30.028
We need to learn the skills
to be able to spot bad statistics.
