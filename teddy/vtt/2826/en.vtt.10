See, a lot of data visualizations
will overstate certainty, and it works --

00:05:00.648 --> 00:05:03.268
these charts can numb
our brains to criticism.

00:05:03.292 --> 00:05:05.850
When you hear a statistic,
you might feel skeptical.

00:05:05.874 --> 00:05:07.509
As soon as it's buried in a chart,

00:05:07.533 --> 00:05:09.662
it feels like some kind
of objective science,

00:05:09.686 --> 00:05:10.935
and it's not.

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:14.062
So I was trying to find ways
to better communicate this to people,

00:05:14.086 --> 00:05:16.590
to show people the uncertainty
in our numbers.

00:05:16.614 --> 00:05:18.860
What I did was I started taking
real data sets,

00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:21.536
and turning them into
hand-drawn visualizations,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.232
so that people can see
how imprecise the data is;

00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:26.252
so people can see that a human did this,

00:05:26.276 --> 00:05:28.248
a human found the data and visualized it.

00:05:28.272 --> 00:05:30.944
For example, instead
of finding out the probability
