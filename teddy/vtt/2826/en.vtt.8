00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.204
Let's set that aside for now and talk
about the accuracy of this endeavor.

00:04:03.228 --> 00:04:07.836
Based on national elections
in the UK, Italy, Israel

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.624
and of course, the most recent
US presidential election,

00:04:10.648 --> 00:04:12.785
using polls to predict electoral outcomes

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:16.621
is about as accurate as using the moon
to predict hospital admissions.

00:04:16.645 --> 00:04:20.845
No, seriously, I used actual data
from an academic study to draw this.

00:04:20.869 --> 00:04:24.596
There are a lot of reasons why
polling has become so inaccurate.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.590
Our societies have become really diverse,

00:04:26.614 --> 00:04:30.435
which makes it difficult for pollsters
to get a really nice representative sample
