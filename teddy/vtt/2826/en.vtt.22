00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.479
they speak to over 140,000
businesses in this country.

00:11:00.503 --> 00:11:02.228
I get it, it's frustrating.

00:11:02.252 --> 00:11:05.367
If you want to test a statistic
that comes from a private company,

00:11:05.391 --> 00:11:08.752
you can buy the face cream for you
and a bunch of friends, test it out,

00:11:08.776 --> 00:11:11.367
if it doesn't work,
you can say the numbers were wrong.

00:11:11.391 --> 00:11:13.537
But how do you question
government statistics?

00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:15.191
You just keep checking everything.

00:11:15.215 --> 00:11:17.128
Find out how they collected the numbers.

00:11:17.152 --> 00:11:20.277
Find out if you're seeing everything
on the chart you need to see.

00:11:20.301 --> 00:11:23.266
But don't give up on the numbers
altogether, because if you do,

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.729
we'll be making public policy
decisions in the dark,

00:11:25.753 --> 00:11:28.015
using nothing but private
interests to guide us.

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:29.205
Thank you.

00:11:29.229 --> 00:11:31.690
