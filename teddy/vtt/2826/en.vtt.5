We need to learn the skills
to be able to spot bad statistics.

00:02:30.052 --> 00:02:31.580
I started to learn some of these

00:02:31.604 --> 00:02:33.770
when I was working
in a statistical department

00:02:33.794 --> 00:02:35.437
that's part of the United Nations.

00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:38.867
Our job was to find out how many Iraqis
had been forced from their homes

00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:40.049
as a result of the war,

00:02:40.073 --> 00:02:41.231
and what they needed.

00:02:41.255 --> 00:02:44.433
It was really important work,
but it was also incredibly difficult.

00:02:44.457 --> 00:02:46.475
Every single day, we were making decisions

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.656
that affected the accuracy
of our numbers --

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.424
decisions like which parts
of the country we should go to,

00:02:51.448 --> 00:02:52.604
who we should speak to,

00:02:52.628 --> 00:02:54.196
which questions we should ask.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.900
And I started to feel
really disillusioned with our work,

00:02:56.924 --> 00:02:59.442
because we thought we were doing
a really good job,

00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:02.744
but the one group of people
who could really tell us were the Iraqis,
