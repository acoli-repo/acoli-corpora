00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.797
you could grab a bottle
and try it for yourself.

00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:01.829
(Laughter)

00:08:01.853 --> 00:08:03.547
The point of this isn't necessarily

00:08:03.571 --> 00:08:06.448
that every single data set
has to relate specifically to you.

00:08:06.472 --> 00:08:09.352
I'm interested in how many women
were issued fines in France

00:08:09.376 --> 00:08:11.335
for wearing the face veil, or the niqab,

00:08:11.359 --> 00:08:13.977
even if I don't live in France
or wear the face veil.

00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:17.836
The point of asking where you fit in
is to get as much context as possible.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.051
So it's about zooming out
from one data point,

00:08:20.075 --> 00:08:22.179
like the unemployment rate
is five percent,

00:08:22.203 --> 00:08:23.960
and seeing how it changes over time,

00:08:23.984 --> 00:08:26.634
or seeing how it changes
by educational status --

00:08:26.658 --> 00:08:29.762
this is why your parents always
wanted you to go to college --

00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:31.818
or seeing how it varies by gender.
