00:00:00.884 --> 00:00:03.647
I'm going to be talking
about statistics today.

00:00:03.671 --> 00:00:06.809
If that makes you immediately feel
a little bit wary, that's OK,

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:09.692
that doesn't make you some
kind of crazy conspiracy theorist,

00:00:09.716 --> 00:00:11.012
it makes you skeptical.

00:00:11.036 --> 00:00:14.922
And when it comes to numbers,
especially now, you should be skeptical.

00:00:14.946 --> 00:00:17.957
But you should also be able to tell
which numbers are reliable

00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:19.141
and which ones aren't.

00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:22.371
So today I want to try to give you
some tools to be able to do that.

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:23.564
But before I do,

00:00:23.588 --> 00:00:26.427
I just want to clarify which numbers
I'm talking about here.

00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:28.086
I'm not talking about claims like,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.559
"9 out of 10 women recommend
this anti-aging cream."
