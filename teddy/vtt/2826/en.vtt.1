00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.559
"9 out of 10 women recommend
this anti-aging cream."

00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:33.555
I think a lot of us always
roll our eyes at numbers like that.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.563
What's different now is people
are questioning statistics like,

00:00:36.587 --> 00:00:38.601
"The US unemployment
rate is five percent."

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:42.141
What makes this claim different is
it doesn't come from a private company,

00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:43.553
it comes from the government.

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:46.913
About 4 out of 10 Americans
distrust the economic data

00:00:46.937 --> 00:00:48.510
that gets reported by government.

00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:51.025
Among supporters of President Trump
it's even higher;

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:52.682
it's about 7 out of 10.

00:00:52.706 --> 00:00:54.510
I don't need to tell anyone here

00:00:54.534 --> 00:00:57.545
that there are a lot of dividing lines
in our society right now,

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:59.394
and a lot of them start to make sense,

00:00:59.418 --> 00:01:03.105
once you understand people's relationships
with these government numbers.
