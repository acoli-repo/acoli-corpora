I want to give you guys three questions

00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:34.116
that will help you be able to spot
some bad statistics.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.647
So, question number one
is: Can you see uncertainty?

00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:41.035
One of things that's really changed
people's relationship with numbers,

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:42.700
and even their trust in the media,

00:03:42.724 --> 00:03:44.982
has been the use of political polls.

00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:47.544
I personally have a lot of issues
with political polls

00:03:47.568 --> 00:03:50.944
because I think the role of journalists
is actually to report the facts

00:03:50.968 --> 00:03:52.521
and not attempt to predict them,

00:03:52.545 --> 00:03:55.541
especially when those predictions
can actually damage democracy

00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:58.297
by signaling to people:
don't bother to vote for that guy,

00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.526
he doesn't have a chance.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.204
Let's set that aside for now and talk
about the accuracy of this endeavor.
