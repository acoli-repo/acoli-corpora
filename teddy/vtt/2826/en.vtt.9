00:04:26.614 --> 00:04:30.435
which makes it difficult for pollsters
to get a really nice representative sample

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:32.086
of the population for their polls.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.116
People are really reluctant to answer
their phones to pollsters,

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.416
and also, shockingly enough,
people might lie.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.251
But you wouldn't necessarily
know that to look at the media.

00:04:40.275 --> 00:04:43.036
For one thing, the probability
of a Hillary Clinton win

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.851
was communicated with decimal places.

00:04:45.875 --> 00:04:48.496
We don't use decimal places
to describe the temperature.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.748
How on earth can predicting the behavior
of 230 million voters in this country

00:04:52.772 --> 00:04:54.601
be that precise?

00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:56.627
And then there were those sleek charts.

00:04:56.651 --> 00:05:00.624
See, a lot of data visualizations
will overstate certainty, and it works --
