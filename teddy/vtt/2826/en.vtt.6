00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:02.744
but the one group of people
who could really tell us were the Iraqis,

00:03:02.768 --> 00:03:06.308

So I started to feel really determined

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:28.996
Absolutely anyone can do this.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.087
I want to give you guys three questions
