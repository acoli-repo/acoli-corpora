00:05:58.956 --> 00:06:02.980
Facts like injustice and inequality
leave a huge mark on our lives.

00:06:03.004 --> 00:06:07.193
Facts like Black Americans and Native
Americans have shorter life expectancies

00:06:07.217 --> 00:06:08.617
than those of other races,

00:06:08.641 --> 00:06:10.779
and that isn't changing anytime soon.

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:14.704
Facts like prisoners in the US
can be kept in solitary confinement cells

00:06:14.728 --> 00:06:18.070
that are smaller than the size
of an average parking space.

00:06:18.535 --> 00:06:21.870
The point of these visualizations
is also to remind people

00:06:21.894 --> 00:06:24.244
of some really important
statistical concepts,

00:06:24.268 --> 00:06:25.904
concepts like averages.

00:06:25.928 --> 00:06:27.596
So let's say you hear a claim like,

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.054
"The average swimming pool in the US
contains 6.23 fecal accidents."
