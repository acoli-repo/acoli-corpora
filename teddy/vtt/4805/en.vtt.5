00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:30.962
it will remain open.

00:02:30.962 --> 00:02:33.953
Most of the lockers 
have an even number of factors,

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:37.713
which makes sense because factors
naturally pair up.

00:02:37.713 --> 00:02:41.475
In fact, the only lockers that have
an odd number of factors

00:02:41.475 --> 00:02:43.774
are perfect squares

00:02:43.774 --> 00:02:48.952
because those have one factor that when
multiplied by itself equals the number.

00:02:48.952 --> 00:02:51.334
For Locker 9, 1 will open it,

00:02:51.334 --> 00:02:52.818
3 will close,

00:02:52.818 --> 00:02:54.934
and 9 will open it.

00:02:54.934 --> 00:02:57.094
3 x 3 = 9,

00:02:57.094 --> 00:02:59.379
but the 3 can only be counted once.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.529
Therefore, every locker that is 
a perfect square will remain open.
