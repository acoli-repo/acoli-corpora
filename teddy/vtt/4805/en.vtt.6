00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:04.529
Therefore, every locker that is 
a perfect square will remain open.

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:07.426
You know that these ten lockers 
are the solution,

00:03:07.426 --> 00:03:11.285
so you open them immediately
and read the words inside:

00:03:11.285 --> 00:03:17.043
"The code is the first five lockers
touched only twice."

00:03:17.043 --> 00:03:21.881
You realize that the only lockers 
touched twice have to be prime numbers

00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:24.454
since each only has two factors:

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.508
1 and itself.

00:03:26.508 --> 00:03:30.835
So the code is 2-3-5-7-11.
