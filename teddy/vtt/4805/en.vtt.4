00:01:58.248 --> 00:02:02.151
The key is realizing that the number
of times a locker is touched

00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:06.427
is the same as the number of factors
in the locker number.

00:02:06.427 --> 00:02:09.064
For example, in locker #6,

00:02:09.064 --> 00:02:10.708
Person 1 will open it,

00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:12.602
Person 2 will close it,

00:02:12.602 --> 00:02:14.316
Person 3 will open it,

00:02:14.316 --> 00:02:17.212
and Person 6 will close it.

00:02:17.212 --> 00:02:22.332
The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 
are the factors of 6.

00:02:22.332 --> 00:02:25.165
So when a locker has an even number
of factors

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:26.812
it will remain closed,

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:28.833
and when it has an odd number of factors,

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:30.962
it will remain open.
