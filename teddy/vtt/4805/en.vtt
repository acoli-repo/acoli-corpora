Your rich, eccentric uncle 
just passed away,

00:00:10.354 --> 00:00:16.854
and you and your 99 nasty relatives have
been invited to the reading of his will.

00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:19.374
He wanted to leave 
all of his money to you,

00:00:19.374 --> 00:00:24.805
but he knew that if he did,
your relatives would pester you forever.

00:00:24.805 --> 00:00:27.062
So he is banking on the fact

00:00:27.062 --> 00:00:32.660
that he taught you everything 
you need to know about riddles.
