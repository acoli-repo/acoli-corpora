00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.795
that contains 100 lockers,

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.270
each hiding a single word.

He explains:

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.805
Every relative is assigned a number
from 1 to 100.

00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:12.705
Heir 1 will open every locker.

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:16.702
Heir 2 will then 
close every second locker.

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:20.879
Heir 3 will change the status
of every third locker,

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:23.775
specifically if it's open, 
she'll close it,

00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:26.580
but if it's closed, she'll open it.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.179
This pattern will continue until
all 100 of you have gone.
