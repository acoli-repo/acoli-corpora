00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:10.488
Your favorite athlete 
closes in for a victorious win.

00:00:10.488 --> 00:00:12.296
The crowd holds its breath,

00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:15.655
and, at the crucial moment,
she misses the shot.

00:00:15.655 --> 00:00:19.461
That competitor just experienced 
the phenomenon known as "choking,"

00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:22.225
where despite months, 
even years, of practice,

00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:24.960
a person fails right when it matters most.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.588
Choking is common in sports,

00:00:26.588 --> 00:00:29.706
where performance often occurs 
under intense pressure

00:00:29.706 --> 00:00:31.566
and depends on key moments.
