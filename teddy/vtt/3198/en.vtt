(Laughter)

00:00:06.752 --> 00:00:08.840
Well, because we're not monkeys,

we're fish.

00:00:10.038 --> 00:00:11.077
(Laughter)

00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:14.049

is actually really important

I teach one of the largest
evolutionary biology classes in the US,

00:00:22.285 --> 00:00:26.344

why I call them fish all the time,

00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:28.545

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:33.613
But I always have to start my classes
by dispelling some hardwired myths,
