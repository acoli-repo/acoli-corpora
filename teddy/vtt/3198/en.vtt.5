00:02:28.472 --> 00:02:30.179
"Where are we from?"

00:02:30.203 --> 00:02:33.012
without understanding
evolution the right way.

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:38.892
Misunderstanding it has led
to many convoluted and corrupted views

00:02:38.916 --> 00:02:41.963
of how we should treat
other life on earth,

00:02:41.987 --> 00:02:43.852
and how we should treat each other

00:02:43.876 --> 00:02:45.542
in terms of race and gender.

00:02:47.253 --> 00:02:50.260
So let's go back four billion years.

00:02:50.927 --> 00:02:54.051
This is the single-celled organism
we all came from.

00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:57.400
At first, it gave rise
to other single-celled life,

00:02:57.424 --> 00:02:59.916
but these are still evolving to this day,

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.130
and some would say
the Archaea and Bacteria
