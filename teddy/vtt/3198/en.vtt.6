00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.130
and some would say
the Archaea and Bacteria

00:03:02.154 --> 00:03:04.004
that make up most of this group

00:03:04.028 --> 00:03:06.151
is the most successful on the planet.

00:03:06.175 --> 00:03:08.651
They are certainly going
to be here well after us.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.180
About three billion years ago,
multicellularity evolved.

00:03:13.204 --> 00:03:16.315
This includes your fungi
and your plants and your animals.

00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:20.790
The first animals to develop
a backbone were fishes.

00:03:21.385 --> 00:03:25.306
So technically,
all vertebrates are fishes,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.693
so technically, you and I are fish.

00:03:28.717 --> 00:03:30.415
So don't say I didn't warn you.
