00:04:27.172 --> 00:04:31.489
Think of life as being this book,
an unfinished book for sure.

00:04:32.085 --> 00:04:35.418
We're just seeing the last
few pages of each chapter.

00:04:36.386 --> 00:04:38.648
If you look out
on the eight million species

00:04:38.672 --> 00:04:40.297
that we share this planet with,

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:44.839
think of them all being
four billion years of evolution.

00:04:44.863 --> 00:04:46.582
They're all the product of that.

00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:52.218
Think of us all as young leaves
on this ancient and gigantic tree of life,

00:04:52.242 --> 00:04:56.543
all of us connected by invisible branches
not just to each other,

00:04:56.567 --> 00:04:59.853
but to our extinct relatives
and our evolutionary ancestors.
