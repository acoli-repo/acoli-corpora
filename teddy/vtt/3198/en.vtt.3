They were passed down
from different ancestors

00:01:32.528 --> 00:01:34.677
to all their descendants, not just us.

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.993
But that's not really
how we learn biology early on, is it?

00:01:39.017 --> 00:01:42.436
We learn plants and bacteria
are primitive things,

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.614
and fish give rise to amphibians
followed by reptiles and mammals,

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:47.421
and then you get you,

00:01:47.445 --> 00:01:50.143
this perfectly evolved creature
at the end of the line.

00:01:51.032 --> 00:01:53.766

and it doesn't end with us.

00:01:56.591 --> 00:02:00.051
But we're always shown evolution
portrayed something like this,
