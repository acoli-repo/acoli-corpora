survive and get to reproduce,

00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:03.857
while those that are less fit
slowly die off.

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:05.874
And that's it.

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:08.842
Evolution is as simple as that,
and it's a fact.

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:13.785
Evolution is a fact
as much as the "theory of gravity."

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.181
You can prove it just as easily.

00:01:16.205 --> 00:01:18.268
You just need to look at your bellybutton

00:01:18.292 --> 00:01:20.458
that you share
with other placental mammals,

00:01:20.482 --> 00:01:23.502
or your backbone that you share
with other vertebrates,

00:01:23.526 --> 00:01:26.867
or your DNA that you share
with all other life on earth.

00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:29.724
Those traits didn't pop up in humans.

00:01:29.748 --> 00:01:32.504
They were passed down
from different ancestors
