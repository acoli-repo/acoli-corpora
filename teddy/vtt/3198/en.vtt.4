00:01:56.591 --> 00:02:00.051
But we're always shown evolution
portrayed something like this,

00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:02.463
a monkey and a chimpanzee,

00:02:02.487 --> 00:02:03.723
some extinct humans,

00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:06.999
all on a forward and steady march
to becoming us.

00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:11.216
But they don't become us
any more than we would become them.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.641
We're also not the goal of evolution.

00:02:15.298 --> 00:02:16.799
But why does it matter?

00:02:16.823 --> 00:02:19.695
Why do we need to understand
evolution the right way?

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.108
Well, misunderstanding evolution
has led to many problems,

00:02:24.132 --> 00:02:28.448
but you can't ask that age-old question,

00:02:28.472 --> 00:02:30.179
"Where are we from?"
