00:03:57.768 --> 00:04:01.710
more bacteria, more fungi,
lots of fish, fish, fish.

00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:04.321
If you couldn't tell --
yes, they're my favorite group.

00:04:04.345 --> 00:04:05.346
(Laughter)

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.307
As life evolves, it also goes extinct.

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.618
Most species just last
for a few million years.

00:04:11.642 --> 00:04:14.395
So you see, most life on earth
that we see around us today

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:16.614
are about the same age as our species.

00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:20.260
So it's hubris,
it's self-centered to think,

00:04:20.284 --> 00:04:22.855
"Oh, plants and bacteria are primitive,

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:25.117
and we've been here
for an evolutionary minute,

00:04:25.141 --> 00:04:26.584
so we're somehow special."

00:04:27.172 --> 00:04:31.489
Think of life as being this book,
an unfinished book for sure.
