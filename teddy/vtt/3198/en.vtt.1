00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:33.613
But I always have to start my classes
by dispelling some hardwired myths,

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:37.684
because without really knowing it,
many of us were taught evolution wrong.

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:42.277
For instance, we're taught
to say "the theory of evolution."

00:00:42.944 --> 00:00:46.761
There are actually many theories,
and just like the process itself,

00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:50.539
the ones that best fit the data
are the ones that survive to this day.

00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:54.384
The one we know best
is Darwinian natural selection.

00:00:54.963 --> 00:00:58.923
That's the process by which organisms
that best fit an environment

00:00:58.947 --> 00:01:01.167
survive and get to reproduce,
