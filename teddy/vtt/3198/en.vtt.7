00:03:28.717 --> 00:03:30.415
So don't say I didn't warn you.

00:03:31.526 --> 00:03:33.607
One fish lineage came onto land

00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:37.537
and gave rise to, among other things,
the mammals and reptiles.

00:03:37.561 --> 00:03:41.885
Some reptiles become birds,
some mammals become primates,

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.670
some primates become monkeys with tails,

00:03:44.694 --> 00:03:49.487
and others become the great apes,
including a variety of human species.

00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:51.887
So you see, we didn't evolve from monkeys,

00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:54.062
but we do share
a common ancestor with them.

00:03:54.824 --> 00:03:57.744
All the while, life
around us kept evolving:

00:03:57.768 --> 00:04:01.710
more bacteria, more fungi,
lots of fish, fish, fish.
