As a biologist, I'm still
trying to learn, with others,

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.075
how everyone's related to each other,
who is related to whom.

00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:11.109
Perhaps it's better still

00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:14.829
to think of us
as a little fish out of water.

00:05:14.853 --> 00:05:17.773
Yes, one that learned to walk and talk,

00:05:17.797 --> 00:05:20.146
but one that still has
a lot of learning to do

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.841
about who we are and where we came from.

00:05:23.348 --> 00:05:24.499
Thank you.
