00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:07.504
"What did you want to be when you grow up"

00:00:07.538 --> 00:00:11.842
is a question that I'm sure many of you
have heard in your childhood.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.679
But if your upbringing was
anything like mine,

00:00:15.712 --> 00:00:19.082
it is a question that you heard
over and over again.

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:23.720
And it wasn't until I became an adult
that I began to understand

00:00:23.754 --> 00:00:28.926
the significance of the asking
of the questions by our community leaders

00:00:28.959 --> 00:00:31.094
and my grandparents.
