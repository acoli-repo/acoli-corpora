Julia Gillard: Ngozi, 10 years ago
when I became prime minister of Australia,

00:00:05.331 --> 00:00:09.030
I assumed that at the start,
there would be a strong reaction

00:00:09.054 --> 00:00:10.943
to me being the first woman,

00:00:10.967 --> 00:00:12.728
but it would abide over time

00:00:12.752 --> 00:00:16.395
and then I would be treated the same
as every other Prime Minister had been.

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:18.394
I was so wrong.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:19.906
That didn't happen.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.915
The longer I governed,
the more visible the sexism became.

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.979
I don't want any other woman
to be blindsided like that.

00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:30.496
That's why I'm so excited
about working with you
