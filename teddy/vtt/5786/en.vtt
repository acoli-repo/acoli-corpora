00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.906
Think about this.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.956
Californians use more electricity
playing video games

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.825
than the entire country
of Senegal uses overall.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.296
Also, before gyms
were shut down due to COVID,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.386
New Yorkers could work out
in a 10-degree-Celsius gym

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.676
because the cold apparently
burns more calories.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.696
And yet only three percent of Nigerians
have air conditioners.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.971
As you can see, there's a mind-blowing gap

00:00:23.995 --> 00:00:26.946
between the energy haves
and the energy have-nots.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.404
And across the globe,
we have incredible energy inequality.
