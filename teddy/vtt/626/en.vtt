Between 2004 and 2008,

00:00:03.417 --> 00:00:07.351
I unsuccessfully tried to get
into the Kenyan music industry.

00:00:07.375 --> 00:00:10.059

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:16.976
I didn't sing fully in the slang
derivative of Kiswahili

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.309
and I didn't sing enough party tracks,

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:22.958

to a Kenyan who sounded like me.

00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:25.976

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.476
the exclusion of a person

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.393
based on their perceived
deviation from the norms,
