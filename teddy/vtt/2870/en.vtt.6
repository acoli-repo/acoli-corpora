She was one of over 50 students

00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:05.932
and 150 letters that I wrote during
a mentoring correspondence program

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:07.566
that I co-designed with a friend

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.920
who was a teacher
at a middle school in Brooklyn,

00:03:09.944 --> 00:03:11.100
my hometown.

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:13.180
We called it the Young Scholars Program.

00:03:13.873 --> 00:03:17.595
Every time those young people
shared their stories with me,

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:19.226
their struggles,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.023
every time they drew a picture
of their favorite cartoon character

00:03:23.047 --> 00:03:24.482
and sent it to me,

00:03:24.506 --> 00:03:28.876
every time they said they depended
on my letters or my words of advice,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.799
it boosted my sense of worthiness.
