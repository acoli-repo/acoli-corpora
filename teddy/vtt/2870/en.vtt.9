My friends Bill and Cory and Arocks,

00:04:30.466 --> 00:04:32.690
all in prison for violent crimes also,

00:04:32.714 --> 00:04:35.518
shared their words of wisdom
with the young people as well,

00:04:35.542 --> 00:04:37.803
and received the sense
of relevancy in return.

00:04:38.322 --> 00:04:41.508
We are now published writers
and youth program innovators

00:04:41.532 --> 00:04:43.281
and trauma experts

00:04:43.305 --> 00:04:45.174
and gun violence prevention advocates,

00:04:45.198 --> 00:04:46.576
and TED talkers and --

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.626
(Laughter)

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.104
and good daddies.

00:04:49.128 --> 00:04:51.943
That's what I call a positive
return of investment.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.900
Above all else,

00:04:53.924 --> 00:04:57.827
what building that program
taught me was that when we sow,

00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:01.613
when we invest in the humanity
of people no matter where they're at,
