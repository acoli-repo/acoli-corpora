Heroes rarely look like me.

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.034
In fact,

00:00:12.058 --> 00:00:13.738
I'm what garbage looks like.

No, not the most appealing
way to open a talk

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.867
or start a conversation,

00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:22.364
and perhaps you have some questions
going through your head about that.

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:24.762
Why would this man say
such a thing about himself?

00:00:24.786 --> 00:00:26.259
What does he mean?

00:00:26.283 --> 00:00:30.469
How can someone view him as a hero
when he sees himself as garbage?
