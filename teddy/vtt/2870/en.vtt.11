00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.358
When we invest in resources
that amplify the relevancy of people

00:05:31.382 --> 00:05:32.852
in communities like Laventille

00:05:32.876 --> 00:05:35.025
or parts of Brooklyn or a ghetto near you,

00:05:35.049 --> 00:05:37.721
we can literally create
the communities that we want.

00:05:38.224 --> 00:05:39.603
We can do better.

00:05:39.627 --> 00:05:43.215

00:05:58.443 --> 00:06:01.475
When we invest in the redemptive
value of relevancy,
