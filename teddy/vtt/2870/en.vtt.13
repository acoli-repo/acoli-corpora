00:06:29.454 --> 00:06:31.548
I've lost two friends to gun violence,

00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:33.839
both innocent bystanders.

00:06:34.928 --> 00:06:38.015
One was caught in a drive-by
while walking home.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.213
The other was sitting in a café
while eating breakfast,

00:06:42.237 --> 00:06:43.938
while on vacation in Miami.

00:06:45.775 --> 00:06:49.093
I'm asking myself to see
the redemptive value of relevancy

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:50.819
in the people that murdered them,

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:54.194
because of the hard work
of seeing the value in me.

00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:58.985
I'm pushing us to challenge
our own capacity

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:01.374
to fully experience our humanity,
