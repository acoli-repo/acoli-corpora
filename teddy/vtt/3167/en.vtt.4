It's a joke,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.840
because it is laughable.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.176
We know that climate change
is suppressed for all sorts of reasons.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.456
I saw it firsthand
when I was a university professor.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.016
We see it when countries pull out
of international climate agreements

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.176
like the Kyoto Protocol
and the Paris Accord,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.400
and we see it when industry fails
to meet its emissions reduction targets.
