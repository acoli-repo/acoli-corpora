How did we get here?

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.760
What lessons might we have to share?

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.976
Well, it actually goes back
to my time as a professor.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.576
I watched while agencies, governments
and industries around the world

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.136
suppressed information on climate change.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.416
It infuriated me.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.696
It kept me up at night.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:09:00.000

twist scientific fact for partisan gain?
