Let me tell you about rock snot.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.616
Since 1992, Dr. Max Bothwell,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.656
a Government of Canada scientist,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.616
has been studying a type of algae
that grows on rocks.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.216
Now, the very unscientific term
for that algae is rock snot,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.656
because as you can imagine,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.360
it looks a lot like snot.
