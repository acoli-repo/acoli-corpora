00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.376
I wanted to test our current drugs against
one of history's deadliest diseases.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.176
I hoped we could make a flu vaccine

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.456
that would be effective against the virus

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.136
and mutation of it,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.400
should it ever return.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.016
And so I led a team, a research team,

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.576
of 17 men

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.536
from Canada, Norway, the United Kingdom

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.416
and the United States

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.656
to the Svalbard Islands
in the Arctic Ocean.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.016
These islands are between
Norway and the North Pole.
