We must hold our leaders to account.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.256
Whether that is
by exercising our right to vote,

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.616
whether it is by penning
an op-ed in a newspaper

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:16.496
or by starting a conversation
on social media,

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:22.496
it is our collective voice
that will ensure the freedom of science.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.136
And after all, science is for everyone,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:33.896
and it will lead to a better,
brighter, bolder future for us all.
