00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.456
It's the early 1900s

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.480
and Claire and Vera
are roommates in southern Ontario.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.776
One evening during the height
of the Spanish flu pandemic,

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.240
the two attend a lecture together.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.336
The end of the evening,
they head for home and for bed.
