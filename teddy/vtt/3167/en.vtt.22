And then the 2015 election rolled around

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.376
and our party won.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.576
And we formed government.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.320
And that friend of mine

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.816
is now the Prime Minister
of Canada, Justin Trudeau.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:22.456
(Applause)

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.936
And he asked if I would serve
as his Minister of Science.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.776
Together, with the rest of the government,

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:35.856
we are working hard to restore
science to its rightful place.
