00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:35.856
we are working hard to restore
science to its rightful place.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:41.296
I will never forget that day
in December 2015

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.336
when I proudly stood in Parliament

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.696
and proclaimed,

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.600
"The war on science is now over."

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:56.296
(Applause)

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.576
And I have worked hard
to back up those words with actions.
