00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.536
Most don't.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.376
Truth is, we didn't find the virus,

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.576
but we did develop new techniques

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.216
to safely exhume bodies

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.320
that might contain virus.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.616
We did develop new techniques

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.216
to safely remove tissue

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.256
that might contain virus.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.536
And we developed new safety protocols

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:32.216
to protect our research team
and the nearby community.
