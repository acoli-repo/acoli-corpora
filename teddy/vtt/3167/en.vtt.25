so precious, as science.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:42.696
So, for Dr. Bothwell, for Claire and Vera,

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.296
for McPherson and all those other voices,

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:52.136
if you see that science is being stifled,
suppressed or attacked,

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.856
speak up.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:59.536
If you see that scientists
are being silenced, speak up.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.376
We must hold our leaders to account.
