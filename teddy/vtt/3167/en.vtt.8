00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.696
and they must be free

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.080
to present uncomfortable
or inconvenient truths,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.216
because that's how scientists
push boundaries

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.255
and pushing boundaries is, after all,
what science is all about.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.376
And here's another point:

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.856
scientists must be free to fail,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.736
because even a failed hypothesis
teaches us something.
