00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.496
And I did exactly
what you're not supposed to do,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.880
which is swerve to avoid it.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.920
And I discovered why
you're not supposed to do that.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:07.056
I hit the dog anyways,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.696
and that sent the car into a fishtail,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.296
and then a spin across the freeway,

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.896
until finally it wound up
in the fast lane of the freeway

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.856
faced backwards into oncoming traffic

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.240
and then the engine died.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.040
And I was sure in that moment
that I was about to die too,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.096
but I didn't

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.856
because of the actions
of that one brave man

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.376
who must have made the decision
