00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.736
The part of the brain

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.656
that's the most important
for recognizing fearful expressions

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.936
is called the amygdala.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.376
There are very rare cases of people
who lack amygdalas completely,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.256
and they're profoundly impaired
in recognizing fearful expressions.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.656
And whereas healthy adults and children

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.296
usually show big spikes
in amygdala activity

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.456
when they look at fearful expressions,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.616
psychopaths' amygdalas
are underreactive to these expressions.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.296
Sometimes they don't react at all,

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.940
which may be why they have
trouble detecting these cues.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.376
Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas
are smaller than average
