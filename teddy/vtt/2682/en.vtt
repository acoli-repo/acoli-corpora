00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.856
There's a man out there, somewhere,

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.856
who looks a little bit
like the actor Idris Elba,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.256
or at least he did 20 years ago.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.096
I don't know anything else about him,

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.016
except that he once saved my life

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.680
by putting his own life in danger.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.976
This man ran across four lanes of freeway
traffic in the middle of the night

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.776
to bring me back to safety

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.576
after a car accident
that could have killed me.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.256
And the whole thing
left me really shaken up, obviously,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.256
but it also left me with this
kind of burning, gnawing need
