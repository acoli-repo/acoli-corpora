00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.240
pretty reliably exhibit
three characteristics.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.776
First, although they're not generally
insensitive to other people's emotions,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.576
they are insensitive to signs
that other people are in distress.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.816
And in particular,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.736
they have difficulty recognizing
fearful facial expressions like this one.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.456
And fearful expressions convey
urgent need and emotional distress,

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.096
and they usually elicit
compassion and a desire to help

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.376
in people who see them,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.096
so it makes sense that people
who tend to lack compassion

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.240
also tend to be insensitive to these cues.
