00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.296
requires exploring the roots
of extraordinary acts of altruism,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.696
and what might make people
who engage in such acts

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.576
different than other people.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.680
But until recently, very little work
on this topic had been done.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.736
The actions of the man who rescued me

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.736
meet the most stringent
definition of altruism,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.376
which is a voluntary, costly behavior

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.840
motivated by the desire
to help another individual.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.760
So it's a selfless act
intended to benefit only the other.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.120
What could possibly
explain an action like that?

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.056
One answer is compassion, obviously,
