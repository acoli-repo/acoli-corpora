00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.336
And remember, this is the same part
of the brain that we found

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.696
was underreactive
in people who are psychopathic.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.616
And finally, their amygdalas
are larger than average as well,

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.856
by about eight percent.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.616
So together, what these data suggest

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.256
is the existence of something
like a caring continuum in the world

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.816
that's anchored at the one end
by people who are highly psychopathic,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.336
and at the other by people
who are very compassionate

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.280
and driven to acts of extreme altruism.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.696
But I should add that what makes
extraordinary altruists so different

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.416
is not just that they're
more compassionate than average.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.656
They are,
