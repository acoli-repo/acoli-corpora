00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.976
is to study people
in whom that desire is missing,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.120
and psychopaths are exactly such a group.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.576
Psychopathy is a developmental disorder

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.696
with strongly genetic origins,

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.616
and it results in a personality
that's cold and uncaring

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.164
and a tendency to engage in antisocial
and sometimes very violent behavior.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.296
Once my colleagues and I
at the National Institute of Mental Health

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.935
conducted some of the first ever
brain imaging research

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.096
of psychopathic adolescents,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.976
and our findings, and the findings
of other researchers now,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.296
have shown that people
who are psychopathic

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.240
pretty reliably exhibit
three characteristics.
