00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.296
These questions are really important
to understanding basic aspects

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.560
of human social nature.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.416
A lot of people,
and this includes everybody

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.336
from philosophers
and economists to ordinary people

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.616
believe that human nature
is fundamentally selfish,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.816
that we're only ever really motivated
by our own welfare.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.136
But if that's true, why do some people,
like the stranger who rescued me,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.656
do selfless things,
like helping other people

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.120
at enormous risk and cost to themselves?

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.176
Answering this question

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.296
requires exploring the roots
of extraordinary acts of altruism,
