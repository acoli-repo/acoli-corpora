00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.936
But what's clear is the kinds
of changes we're seeing show

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.416
that the roots of altruism and compassion

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.456
are just as much a part of human nature
as cruelty and violence,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.176
maybe even more so,

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.256
and while some people do seem
to be inherently more sensitive

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.376
to the suffering of distant others,

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.176
I really believe that the ability
to remove oneself

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.976
from the center of the circle

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.056
and expand the circle of compassion
outward to include even strangers

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.880
is within reach for almost everyone.
