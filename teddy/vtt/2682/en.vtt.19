It's because if there's
no center of your circle,

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.176
there can be no inner rings
or outer rings,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.096

than anybody else.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.416
And I think that this is what really

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.680
from the average person.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.976

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.256
And I think this

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:55.000
expansions of altruism and compassion
are already happening everywhere.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.376
The psychologist Steven Pinker
and others have shown

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.656
that all around the world people
are becoming less and less accepting
