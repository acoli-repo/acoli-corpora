00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.416
But all of these changes also yield

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.656
a strange and paradoxical result,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.216
which is that even as the world is
becoming a better and more humane place,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.456
which it is,

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.176
there's a very common perception
that it's becoming worse

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.240
and more cruel, which it's not.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.896
And I don't know exactly why this is,

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.496
but I think it may be
that we now just know so much more

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.696
about the suffering
of strangers in distant places,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.136
and so we now care a lot more

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.360
about the suffering
of those distant strangers.
