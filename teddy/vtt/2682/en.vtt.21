00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.896
is just as normal and ordinary

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.936
as we think donating blood
and bone marrow is today?

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.160
Maybe.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.696
So what's at the root
of all these amazing changes?

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.496

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.720
increases in wealth
and standards of living.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.336

wealthier and better off,

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.976
people seem to turn
their focus of attention outward,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.856

towards strangers increases,

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.600
from volunteering to charitable donations
and even altruistic kidney donations.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.416
But all of these changes also yield
