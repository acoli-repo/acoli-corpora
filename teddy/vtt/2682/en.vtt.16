00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.456
And I've had the opportunity now
to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.856
how it is that they manage to generate
such a wide circle of compassion

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.216
that they were willing to give
a complete stranger their kidney.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.736
And I found it's a really difficult
question for them to answer.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.816
I say, "How is it that
you're willing to do this thing

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.816
when so many other people don't?

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.256
You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.896
who has ever given a kidney to a stranger.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.760
What is it that makes you so special?"

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.680
And what do they say?
