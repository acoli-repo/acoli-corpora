00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.656
They are,

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.576
but what's even more unusual about them

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.696
is that they're compassionate
and altruistic

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.656
not just towards people
who are in their own innermost circle

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.656
of friends and family. Right?

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.936
Because to have compassion for people
that you love and identify with

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.160
is not extraordinary.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.216
Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion
extends way beyond that circle,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.456
even beyond their wider
circle of acquaintances

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.416
to people who are outside
their social circle altogether,

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.976
total strangers,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.600
just like the man who rescued me.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.456
And I've had the opportunity now
to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors
