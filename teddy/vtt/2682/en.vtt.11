00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.376
Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas
are smaller than average

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.000
by about 18 or 20 percent.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.736
So all of these findings
are reliable and robust,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.216
and they're very interesting.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.896
But remember that my main interest

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.456
is not understanding
why people don't care about others.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.040
It's understanding why they do.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.176
So the real question is,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.456
could extraordinary altruism,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.696
which is the opposite of psychopathy

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.136
in terms of compassion
and the desire to help other people,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.176
emerge from a brain that is also
the opposite of psychopathy?
