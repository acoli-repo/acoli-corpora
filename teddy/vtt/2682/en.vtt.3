00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.376
who must have made the decision

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.416
within a fraction of a second
of seeing my stranded car

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.696
to pull over and run
across four lanes of freeway traffic

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.656
in the dark

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.656
to save my life.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.576
And then after he got my car working again

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.216
and got me back to safety
and made sure I was going to be all right,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.776
he drove off again.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.136
He never even told me his name,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.320
and I'm pretty sure
I forgot to say thank you.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.376
So before I go any further,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.856
I really want to take a moment

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.680
to stop and say thank you
to that stranger.
