One answer is compassion, obviously,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.880
which is a key driver of altruism.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.136
But then the question becomes,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.920
why do some people
seem to have more of it than others?

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.016
And the answer may be that the brains
of highly altruistic people

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.240
are different in fundamental ways.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.016
But to figure out how,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.160
I actually started from the opposite end,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.360
with psychopaths.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.776
A common approach to understanding
basic aspects of human nature,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.816
like the desire to help other people,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.976
is to study people
in whom that desire is missing,
