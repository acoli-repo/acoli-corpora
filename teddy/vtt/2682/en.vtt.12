00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.176
emerge from a brain that is also
the opposite of psychopathy?

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.440
A sort of antipsychopathic brain,

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.976
better able to recognize
other people's fear,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.416
an amygdala that's more reactive
to this expression

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.280
and maybe larger than average as well?

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.936
As my research has now shown,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.416
all three things are true.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.696
And we discovered this

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.736
by testing a population
of truly extraordinary altruists.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.416
These are people who have given
one of their own kidneys

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.640
to a complete stranger.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.696
So these are people who have volunteered
to undergo major surgery

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.336
so that one of their own
healthy kidneys can be removed
