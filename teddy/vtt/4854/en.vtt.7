Until recently, no one was sure 
how strong the links were

00:03:32.862 --> 00:03:36.170
between Scythians 
and the Amazons of Greek myth.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.851
But recent archaeological discoveries 
have provided ample evidence.

00:03:40.851 --> 00:03:46.234
More than 1,000 ancient Scythian kurgans,
or burial mounds, have been excavated,

00:03:46.234 --> 00:03:48.817
containing skeletons and weapons.

00:03:48.817 --> 00:03:51.065
Archaeologists had previously assumed

00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:54.164
that weapons could only 
belong to male warriors.

00:03:54.164 --> 00:03:56.781
But modern DNA analysis so far

00:03:56.781 --> 00:03:59.825
has revealed that about 300 skeletons 
buried with weapons

00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:04.092
belong to females ranging
in age from 10 to 45,
