00:01:56.379 --> 00:02:00.507
Ancient historians located 
the Amazon homeland in Scythia,

00:02:00.507 --> 00:02:02.398
the vast territory stretching from

00:02:02.398 --> 00:02:05.901
the Black Sea across 
the steppes of Central Asia.

00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:08.695
This immense region was populated 
by nomadic tribes

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.919
whose lives centered on horses,

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:11.928
archery,

00:02:11.928 --> 00:02:13.120
and warfare.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.535
Their culture flourished for about
1,000 years beginning around 800 BC.

00:02:18.535 --> 00:02:22.916
Feared by Greeks, Persians, and
the Chinese, the Scythians left

00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:26.636
no written records.
But we can find clues in how

00:02:26.636 --> 00:02:30.486
their neighbors described them,
as well as in archaeology.
