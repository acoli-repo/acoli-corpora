00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:30.300
Jason and the Argonauts 
passed by their shores,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.998
barely avoiding their deadly arrows.

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:37.280
These formidable fighters faced off 
against the greatest champions of myth:

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.311
Heracles,

00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:39.291
Theseus,

00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:41.321
and Achilles.

00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:45.841
And every single one 
of these warriors was a woman.

00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:51.019
The war-loving Amazons,
"the equals of men" in courage and skill,

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.111
were familiar to everyone in
ancient Greece.

00:00:54.111 --> 00:00:58.101
Amazon battle scenes decorated 
the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis;

00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:03.362
paintings and statues of Amazons
adorned temples and public spaces.
