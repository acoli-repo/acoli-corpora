00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:04.092
belong to females ranging
in age from 10 to 45,

00:04:04.092 --> 00:04:07.166
and more are being found every year.

00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:09.543
The women's skeletons 
show battle injuries:

00:04:09.543 --> 00:04:11.762
ribs slashed by swords,

00:04:11.762 --> 00:04:14.211
skulls bashed by battle-axes,

00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:17.473
and arrows embedded in bones.

00:04:17.473 --> 00:04:19.744
In classical art and writings,

00:04:19.744 --> 00:04:24.654
the fearsome Amazons were always portrayed
as brave and heroic.

00:04:24.654 --> 00:04:27.295
In male-dominated classical Greece, 
however,

00:04:27.295 --> 00:04:34.162
the very idea of strong women who gloried 
in freedom and war aroused mixed feelings.
