and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
where his parents drove him from New York City to upstate New York

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to get an experimental therapy for --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
at the time -- Hodgkin's disease, which saved his life,
