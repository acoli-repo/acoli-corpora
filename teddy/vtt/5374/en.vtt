00:00:01.896 --> 00:00:05.216
Why is 1.5 degrees such a big deal?

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.146
Because to warm our entire planet up
by 1.5 degrees Celsius

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.478
requires a lot of heat.

00:00:12.502 --> 00:00:16.156
All this extra heat melts glaciers,
which raise sea levels.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.726
If the ice sheets of Antarctica
and Greenland melt completely,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.478
millions of people's homes
will be under water.

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:25.176
The extra heat also intensifies weather,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.070
making wet places wetter, dry places drier

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:30.616
and increasing the ferocity of storms.
