It's a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
because it will break your legs very, very quickly

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
if you land on it wrong.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Having said that, it works with compressed nitrogen.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And that's in the up position. When you step on it,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
either by remote control or with the pressure of your foot,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
it will fire you, depending on the gas pressure,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
anything from five feet to 30 feet.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I could, quite literally, fire myself into the gallery.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Which I'm sure you wouldn't want.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Not today.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Car stunts are another area

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
where technology and engineering

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
advances have made life easier for us, and safer.
