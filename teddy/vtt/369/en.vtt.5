fantastic materials that enable us as stunt professionals

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to burn for longer, look more spectacular, and in pure safety.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Here's a bit more.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
There's a guy with a flame thrower there, giving me what for.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
One of the things that a stuntman often does,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and you'll see it every time in the big movies,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
is be blown through the air.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Well, we used to use trampettes. In the old days, that's all they had.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And that's a ramp. Spring off the thing and fly through the air,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and hopefully you make it look good.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Now we've got technology. This thing is called an air ram.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It's a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
because it will break your legs very, very quickly
