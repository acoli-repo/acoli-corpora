A company makes a Lattix pillar, which is a network,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
a lattice-type pillar that collapses when it's hit.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
The car on the left drove into the steel pillar.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And you can't see it from there, but the engine was in the driver's lap.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
They did it by remote control.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I drove the other one at 60 miles an hour, exactly the same speed,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and clearly walked away from it.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Rolling a car over is another area where we use technology.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
We used to have to drive up a ramp, and we still do sometimes.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But now we have a compressed nitrogen cannon.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
You can just see, underneath the car, there is a black rod on the floor

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
by the wheel of the other car.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
That's the piston that was fired out of the floor.
