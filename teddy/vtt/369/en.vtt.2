We can't be killing anybody or hurting anybody on set,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
or any passerby. So, safety is everything.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But it wasn't always that way.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
In the old days of the silent movies --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Harold Lloyd here, hanging famously from the clock hands --

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
a lot of these guys did their own stunts. They were quite remarkable.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
They had no safety, no real technology.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
What safety they had was very scant.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
This is the first stunt woman,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Rosie Venger, an amazing woman.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You can see from the slide, very very strong.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
She really paved the way

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
at a time when nobody was doing stunts, let alone women.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
My favorite and a real hero of mine is Yakima Canutt.
