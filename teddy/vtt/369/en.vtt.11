00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Even then, I caught seven G

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and lost a bit of consciousness on the way in.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
That's a long way to fall, if you get it wrong. That was just about right.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So again, science helps us, and with the engineering too --

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
the modifications to the car and the wheel.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
High falls, they're old fashioned stunts.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
What's interesting about high falls

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
is that although we use airbags,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and some airbags are quite advanced,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
they're designed so you don't slip off the side like you used to,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
if you land a bit wrong. So, they're a much safer proposition.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Just basically though, it is a basic piece of equipment.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
It's a bouncy castle

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
with slats in the side to allow the air to escape.
