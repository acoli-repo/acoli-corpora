00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
It's hundreds of feet high. It's enormous.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
That's in New Mexico.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
That's the U.S. Air Force Museum.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And they've made a dummy of him. That's exactly what it looked like.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
My gondola will be more simple than that.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It's a three sided box, basically.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So I've had to do quite a lot of training.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
This is Morocco last year in the Atlas mountains,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
training in preparation for some high altitude jumps.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
This is what the view is going to be like

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
at 90,000 feet for me.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Now you may think this is just

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
a thrill-seeking trip, a pleasure ride,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
just the world's biggest stunt.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Well there's a little bit more to it than that.
