00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Above 30,000 feet up to nearly 50,000 feet,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
you need pressure breathing, which is where you're wearing a G suit.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
This is him in his old rock-and-roll jeans there,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
pushing him in, those turned up jeans.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
You need a pressure suit.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
You need a pressure breathing system

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
with a G suit that squeezes you, that helps you to breathe in

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and helps you to exhale.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Above 50,000 feet you need a space suit, a pressure suit.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Certainly at 100,000 feet no aircraft will fly.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Not even a jet engine.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
It needs to be rocket-powered or one of these things,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
a great big gas balloon.
