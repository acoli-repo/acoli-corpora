00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and put in the sky moving and the clouds whizzing by.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Decelerator rigs and wires, we use them a lot.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
We fly people on wires, like this.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
This guy is not skydiving. He's being flown like a kite,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
or moved around like a kite.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And this is a Guinness World Record attempt.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
They asked me to open their 50th anniversary show in 2004.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And again, technology meant that I could do the fastest abseil over 100 meters,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and stop within a couple of feet of the ground

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
without melting the rope with the friction,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
because of the alloys I used in the descender device.
