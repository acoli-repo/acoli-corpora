He didn't know if he would live or die. This is an extremely brave man.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I spoke with him on the phone a few months ago.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
He's a very humble and wonderful human being.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
He sent me an email, saying, "If you get this thing off the ground

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000

Now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
when you get to 30,000 feet -- it's great, isn't it? --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
When you get to 30,000 feet you can really only use oxygen.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Above 30,000 feet up to nearly 50,000 feet,
