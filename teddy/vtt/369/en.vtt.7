00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
advances have made life easier for us, and safer.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
We can do bigger car stunts than ever before now.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Being run over is never easy.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
That's an old-fashioned, hard, gritty, physical stunt.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But we have padding, and fantastic shock-absorbing things like Sorbothane --

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the materials that help us, when we're hit like this,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
not to hurt ourselves too much.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
The picture in the bottom right-hand corner there

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
is of some crash test dummy work that I was doing.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Showing how stunts work in different areas, really.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And testing breakaway signpost pillars.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
A company makes a Lattix pillar, which is a network,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
a lattice-type pillar that collapses when it's hit.
