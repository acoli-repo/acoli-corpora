00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm extremely excited to be given the opportunity

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to come and speak to you today

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
about what I consider to be

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the biggest stunt on Earth.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Or perhaps not quite on Earth.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
A parachute jump from the very edge of space.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
More about that a bit later on.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What I'd like to do first is take you through

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
a very brief helicopter ride of stunts

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and the stunts industry in the movies and in television,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and show you how technology

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
has started to interface with the physical skills

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
of the stunt performer
