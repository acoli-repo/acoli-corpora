00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I'm excited and I'm scared,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
both at the same time in equal measures.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And this is the camera that he had on him as he tumbled

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
before his drogue chute opened to stabilize him.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
A drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
You can just see them there, popping open.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Those are the drogue chutes. He had three of them.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I did quite a lot of research.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And you'll see in a second there, he comes back down to the floor.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Now just to give you some perspective of this balloon,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
the little black dots are people.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
It's hundreds of feet high. It's enormous.
