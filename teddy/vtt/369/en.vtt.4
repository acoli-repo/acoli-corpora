Talking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We couldn't do them without technology.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
These are particularly dangerous

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
because there is no mask on my face.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
They were done for a photo shoot. One for the Sun newspaper,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
one for FHM magazine.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Highly dangerous, but also you'll notice

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
it doesn't look as though I'm wearing anything underneath the suit.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The fire suits of old, the bulky suits, the thick woolen suits,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
have been replaced with modern materials

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
like Nomex or, more recently, Carbonex --

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
fantastic materials that enable us as stunt professionals

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to burn for longer, look more spectacular, and in pure safety.
