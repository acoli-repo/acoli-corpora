00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
It's a bouncy castle

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
with slats in the side to allow the air to escape.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
That's all it is, a bouncy castle.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
That's the only reason we do it. See, it's all fun, this job.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
What's interesting is we still use cardboard boxes.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
They used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And that's interesting because they are almost retrospective.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
They're great for catching you, up to certain heights.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And on the other side of the fence,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that physical art, the physical performance of the stuntman,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
has interfaced with the very highest

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
technology in I.T. and in software.
