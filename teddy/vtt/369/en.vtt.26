00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
while the aircraft is coming back down,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
in whatever emergency measures, everyone is okay.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
I would like to bring Costa on, if he's here,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
to show you the only one of its kind in the world.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I was going to wear it,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
but I thought I'd get Costa to do it, my lovely assistant.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Thank you. He's very hot. Thank you, Costa.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
This is the communication headset you'll see

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
on lots of space suits.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
It's a two-layer suit. NASA suits have got 13 layers.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
This is a very lightweight suit. It weighs about 15 pounds.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
It's next to nothing. Especially designed for me.
