00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
because of the alloys I used in the descender device.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And that's Centre Point in London.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
We brought Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road to a standstill.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Helicopter stunts are always fun,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
hanging out of them, whatever.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And aerial stunts. No aerial stunt would be the same without skydiving.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Which brings us quite nicely to why I'm really here today:

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Project Space Jump.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
In 1960, Joseph Kittenger of the United States Air Force

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
did the most spectacular thing.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
He did a jump from 100,000 feet, 102,000 to be precise,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and he did it to test high altitude systems
