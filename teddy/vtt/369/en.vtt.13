technology in I.T. and in software.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Not the cardboard box, but the green screen.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
This is a shot of "Terminator," the movie.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Two stunt guys doing what I consider to be a rather benign stunt.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
It's 30 feet. It's water. It's very simple.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
With the green screen we can put any background in the world on it,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
moving or still,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and I can assure you, nowadays you can't see the joint.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
This is a parachutist with another parachutist doing exactly the same thing.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Completely in the safety of a studio,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and yet with the green screen we can have some moving image that a skydiver took,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and put in the sky moving and the clouds whizzing by.
