WEBVTT

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and he did it to test high altitude systems

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
for military pilots

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
in the new range of aircraft that were going up to 80,000 feet or so.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And I'd just like to show you a little footage

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
of what he did back then.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And just how brave he was in 1960, bear in mind.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Project Excelsior, it was called.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
There were three jumps.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
They first dropped some dummies.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
So that's the balloon, big gas balloon.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
It's that shape because the helium has to expand.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
My balloon will expand to 500 times
