00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
The next thing that I'd like to show you is something that

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Dunlop asked me to do earlier this year

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
with our Channel Five's "Fifth Gear Show."

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
A loop-the-loop, biggest in the world.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Only one person had ever done it before.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Now, the stuntman solution to this in the old days would be,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
"Let's hit this as fast as possible. 60 miles an hour.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Let's just go for it. Foot flat to the floor."

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Well, you'd die if you did that.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
We went to Cambridge University, the other university,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and spoke to a Doctor of Mechanical Engineering there,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
a physicist who taught us that it had to be 37 miles an hour.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Even then, I caught seven G

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and lost a bit of consciousness on the way in.
