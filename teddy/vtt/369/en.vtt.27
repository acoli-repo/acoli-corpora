This is a very lightweight suit. It weighs about 15 pounds.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
It's next to nothing. Especially designed for me.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
It's a working prototype. I will use it for all the jumps.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Would you just give us a little twirl, please, Costa?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Thank you very much.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And it doesn't look far different when it's inflated,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
as you can see from the picture down there.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
I've even skydived in it in a wind tunnel,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
which means that I can practice everything I need to practice, in safety,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
before I ever jump out of anything. Thanks very much, Costa.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
(Applause)

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Ladies and gentlemen, that's just about it from me.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
The status of my mission at the moment

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
is it still needs a major sponsor.
