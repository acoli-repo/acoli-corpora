00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and the cabin depressurizes, you can have oxygen.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
If you're at 100,000 feet you die.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
In six seconds you've lost consciousness. In 10 seconds you're dead.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Your blood tries to boil. It's called vaporization.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
The body swells up. It's awful.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And so we expect -- it's not much fun.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
We expect, and others expect,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
that perhaps the FAA, the CAA

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
might say, "You need to put someone in a suit

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
that's not inflated, that's connected to the aircraft."

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Then they're comfortable, they have good vision, like this great big visor.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And then if the cabin depressurizes

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
while the aircraft is coming back down,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
in whatever emergency measures, everyone is okay.
