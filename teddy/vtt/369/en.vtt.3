at a time when nobody was doing stunts, let alone women.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
My favorite and a real hero of mine is Yakima Canutt.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Yakima Canutt really formed the stunt fight.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
He worked with John Wayne and most of those old punch-ups you see

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in the Westerns. Yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
This is a screen capture from "Stagecoach,"

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
where Yakima Canutt is doing one of the most dangerous stunts I've ever seen.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
There is no safety, no back support,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
no pads, no crash mats, no sand pits in the ground.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
That's one of the most dangerous horse stunts, certainly.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Talking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date,
