00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
has started to interface with the physical skills

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
of the stunt performer

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
in a way that makes the stunts bigger

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I've been a professional stunt man for 13 years.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I'm a stunt coordinator. And as well as perform stunts

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I often design them.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
During that time, health and safety has become everything about my job.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's critical now that when a car crash happens

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
it isn't just the stunt person we make safe, it's the crew.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We can't be killing camera men. We can't be killing stunt men.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We can't be killing anybody or hurting anybody on set,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
or any passerby. So, safety is everything.
