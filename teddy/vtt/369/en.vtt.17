00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
My balloon will expand to 500 times

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and look like a big pumpkin when it's at the top.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
These are the dummies being dropped from 100,000 feet,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and there is the camera that's strapped to them.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
You can clearly see the curvature of the Earth at that kind of altitude.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And I'm planning to go from 120,000 feet,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
which is about 22 miles.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
You're in a near vacuum in that environment,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
which is in minus 50 degrees.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So it's an extremely hostile place to be.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
This is Joe Kittenger himself.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Bear in mind, ladies and gents, this was 1960.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
He didn't know if he would live or die. This is an extremely brave man.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I spoke with him on the phone a few months ago.
