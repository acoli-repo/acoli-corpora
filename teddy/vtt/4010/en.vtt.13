00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.256
is that there's a tumor
about the size of a golf ball or so

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.600
in the right frontal lobe
of this person's brain.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.416
And that's more or less it.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.656
So you're looking down, and unfortunately
everything looks the same,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.776
because brain cancer tissue
and healthy brain tissue

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.376
really just look the same.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.296
And so you're going in with your thumb,

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.656
and you start to press
a little bit on the brain,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.096
because tumors tend to be
a little harder, stiffer,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.736
and so you go in and go
a little bit like this and say,

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.736
"It seems like the tumor is right there."

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.416
Then you take out your knife
and start cutting the tumor

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.696
piece by piece by piece.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.416
And as you're taking the tumor out,
