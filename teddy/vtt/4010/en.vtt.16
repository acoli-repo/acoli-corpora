00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.296
Remember those PET scans I told you about,
the sugar and so on.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.056
We said, hey, how about
instead of using sugar molecules,

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.216
let's maybe take tiny, tiny
little particles made of gold,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.896
and let's program them with some
interesting chemistry around them.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.336
Let's program them
to look for cancer cells.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.456
And then we will inject
these gold particles

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.736
into these patients by the billions again,

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.736
and we'll have them go all over the body,

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.736
and just like secret agents, if you will,

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.576
go and walk by
every single cell in our body

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.296
and knock on the door of that cell,

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.056
and ask, "Are you a cancer cell
or are you a healthy cell?

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.096
If you're a healthy cell, we're moving on.
