00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.456
and they're going all over the body

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.560
looking for cells
that are hungry for sugar.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.976
You'll see that the heart,
for example, lights up there.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.216
That's because the heart
needs a lot of sugar.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.576
You'll also see that the bladder
lights up there.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.216
That's because the bladder
is the thing that's clearing

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.640
the sugar away from our body.

00:04:46.096 --> 00:04:48.096
And then you'll see a few other hot spots,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.736
and these are in fact the tumors.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.896
Now, this is a really
a wonderful technology.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.056
For the first time it allowed us
to look into someone's body

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.456
without picking up
each and every one of the cells

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.336
and putting them under the microscope,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.376
but in a noninvasive way
allowing us to look into someone's body
