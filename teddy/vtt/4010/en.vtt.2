00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.016
that in order for them to tell
if a treatment is even working or not,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.536
well, that takes them
about three months or so.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.936
So they cannot try that many things.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.056
Well, Ehud is now going
into his first treatment,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.336
and during that first treatment,
just a few days into that treatment,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.696
I'm meeting with him, and he tells me,
"Adam, I think this is working.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.536
I think we really lucked out here.
Something is happening."

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.016
And I ask him, "Really?
How do you know that, Ehud?"

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.256
And he says, "Well,
I feel so terrible inside.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.136
Something's gotta be working up there.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.376
It just has to."

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.840
Well, unfortunately, three months later,
we got the news, it didn't work.
