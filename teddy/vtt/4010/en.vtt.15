00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.240
So this is not a simple decision to make,

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.776
and unfortunately this is the decision

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.136
that brain cancer surgeons
have to take every single day

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.760
as they're seeing their patients.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.256
And so I remember talking
to a few friends of mine in the lab,

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.656
and we say, "Boy,
there's got to be a better way."

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.096
But not just like you tell a friend
that there's got to be a better way.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.073
There's just got to be a better way here.

00:07:54.097 --> 00:07:55.616
This is just incredible.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.296
And so we looked back.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.296
Remember those PET scans I told you about,
the sugar and so on.
