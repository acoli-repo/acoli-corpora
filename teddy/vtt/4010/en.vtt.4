00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.536
I was just outraged that, how come
this is the best that we can offer?

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.856
And I started looking
more and more into this.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.336
As it turns out, this is not just
the best that doctors could offer Ehud.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.176
It's not just the best doctors could offer
patients with brain cancer generally.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.400
We're actually not doing that well
all across the board with cancer.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.096
I picked up one of those statistics,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.896
and I'm sure some of you
have seen those statistics before.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.376
This is going to show you here
how many patients actually died of cancer,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.416
in this case females in the United States,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.736
ever since the 1930s.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.936
You'll notice that there aren't
that many things that have changed.
