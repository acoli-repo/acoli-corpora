00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.656
and let me make sure
that this number sunk in.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.016
In each and every one
of these small little blips

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.616
that you're seeing on the image,

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.736
there needs to be
at least 100 million cancer cells

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.296
in order for it to be detected.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.776
Now, if that seemed to you
like a very large number,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.480
it is a very large number.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.696
This is in fact
an incredibly large number,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.056
because what we really need
in order to pick up something early enough

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.016
to do something about it,
to do something meaningful about it,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.176
well, we need to pick up tumors
that are a thousand cells in size,

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.336
and ideally just
a handful of cells in size.
