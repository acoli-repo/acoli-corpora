00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.856
or actually generally
to all cancer patients,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.816
take a look at this PET scan right here.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.080
Let's see. There we go.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.336
So this is a PET/CT scan,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.816
and what you'll see in this PET/CT scan

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.056
is the CT scan will show you
where the bones are,

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.480
and the PET scan will show you
where tumors are.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.176
Now, what you can see here

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.616
is essentially a sugar molecule

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.456
that was added a small little tag

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.576
that is signaling to us
outside of the body,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.896
"Hey, I'm here."

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.736
And those sugar molecules are injected
into these patients by the billions,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.456
and they're going all over the body
