00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.336
and ideally just
a handful of cells in size.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.376
So we're clearly
pretty far away from this.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.656
So we're going to play
a little experiment here.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.136
I'm going to ask each of you
to now play and imagine

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.520
that you are brain surgeons.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.016
And you guys are now at an operating room,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.056
and there's a patient in front of you,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.800
and your task is to make sure
that the tumor is out.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.776
So you're looking down at the patient,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.136
the skin and the skull
have already been removed,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.696
so you're looking at the brain.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.416
And all you know about this patient

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.256
is that there's a tumor
about the size of a golf ball or so
