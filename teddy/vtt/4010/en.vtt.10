00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.376
but in a noninvasive way
allowing us to look into someone's body

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.536
and ask, "Hey,
has the cancer metastasized?

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.776
Where is it?"

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.296
And the PET scans here
are showing you very clearly

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.600
where are these hot spots,
where is the tumor.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.776
So as miraculous as this might seem,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.680
unfortunately, well, it's not that great.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.400
You see, those
small little hot spots there.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.760
Can anyone guess how many cancer cells
are in any one of these tumors?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.936
So it's about 100 million cancer cells,

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.656
and let me make sure
that this number sunk in.
