Look, there is like 50-plus years
of good cancer research

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.736
that discovered major, major things
that taught us about cancer.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.496
But all that said,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.092
we have a lot of heavy lifting
to still do ahead of us.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.016
Again, I will argue that the primary
reason why this is the case,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.040
why we have not done that remarkably well,

00:03:48.064 --> 00:03:49.896
is really we're fighting blindly here.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.136
And this is where
medical imaging comes in.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.840
This is where my own work comes in.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.136
And so to give you a sense
of the best medical imaging

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.656
that's offered today
to brain cancer patients,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.856
or actually generally
to all cancer patients,
