00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.976
a small little tumor.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.616
And so this tumor is now
growing in this mouse's brain,

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.296
and then we've taken a doctor
and asked the doctor

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.136
to please operate on the mouse
as if that was a patient,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.576
and take out piece by piece
out of the tumor.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.376
And while he's doing that,

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.376
we're going to take images
to see where the gold particles are.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.016
And so we're going to first start

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.456
by injecting these gold particles
into this mouse,

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.376
and we're going to see
right here at the very left there

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.656
that image at the bottom

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.176
is the image that shows
where the gold particles are.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.256
The nice thing
is that these gold particles

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.296
actually made it all the way to the tumor,
