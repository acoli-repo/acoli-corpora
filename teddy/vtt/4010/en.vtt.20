00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.696
or do you want me to take
some extra margins around?"

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.376
And then we said, "Well, hang on."

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.816
We told the doctor,
"You've missed those two spots,

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.840
so rather than taking huge margins around,

00:10:06.864 --> 00:10:08.696
only take out those tiny little areas.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.736
Take them out,
and then let's take a look."

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.616
And so the doctor took them away,
and lo and behold,

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.656
the cancer is now completely gone.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.056
Now, the important thing

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.700
is that it's not just
that the cancer is completely gone

00:10:19.724 --> 00:10:21.056
from this person's brain,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.400
or from this mouse's brain.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.416
The most important thing

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.336
is that we did not have to take
huge amounts of healthy brain

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.576
in the process.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.776
And so now we can actually imagine a world
