"We're declaring war against cancer,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.360
and we will win this war by 2015."

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.176
This is what the US Congress
and the National Cancer Institute declared

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.760
just a few years ago, in 2003.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.656
Now, I don't know about you,
but I don't buy that.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.736
I don't think we quite won this war yet,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.400
and I don't think
anyone here will question that.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.296
Now, I will argue that a primary reason

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.456
why we're not winning
this war against cancer

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.776
is because we're fighting blindly.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.375
I'm going to start by sharing with you
a story about a good friend of mine.
