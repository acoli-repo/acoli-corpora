00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.160
that came to our world
that saved humanity from stomach cancer?

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.056
Was it maybe a new drug,
or a better diagnostic?

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.376
You guys are right, yeah.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.016
It's the invention of the refrigerator,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.656
and the fact that we're
no longer eating spoiled meats.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.976
So the best thing
that happened to us so far

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.936
in the medical arena in cancer research

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.151
is the fact that
the refrigerator was invented.

00:03:20.175 --> 00:03:21.376
(Laughter)

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.656
And so -- yeah, I know.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.096
We're not doing so well here.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.456
I don't want to miniaturize the progress

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.856
and everything that's been done
in cancer research.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.296
Look, there is like 50-plus years
of good cancer research
