00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.296
actually made it all the way to the tumor,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.976
and then they shine out and tell us,
"Hey, we're here. Here's the tumor."

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.376
So now we can see the tumor,

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.536
but we're not showing this
to the doctor yet.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.616
We're asking the doctor,
now please start cutting away the tumor,

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.056
and you'll see here the doctor
just took the first quadrant of the tumor

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.296
and you see that first quadrant
is now missing.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.776
The doctor then took
the second quadrant, the third,

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.536
and now it appears to be everything.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.296
And so at this stage,
the doctor came back to us and said,

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.576
"Alright, I'm done.
What do you want me to do?

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.176
Should I keep things as they are

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.696
or do you want me to take
some extra margins around?"
