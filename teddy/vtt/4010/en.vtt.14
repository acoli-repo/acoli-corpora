00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.416
And as you're taking the tumor out,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.656
then you're getting
to a stage where you think,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.816
"Alright, I'm done.
I took out everything."

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.376
And at this stage, if that's --

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.096
so far everything sounded,
like, pretty crazy --

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.816
you're now about to face the most
challenging decision of your life here.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.376
Because now you need to decide,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.096
should I stop here
and let this patient go,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.056
risking that there might be
some leftover cancer cells behind

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.936
that I just couldn't see,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.616
or should I take away some extra margins,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.496
typically about an inch or so
around the tumor

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.720
just to be sure that I removed everything?
