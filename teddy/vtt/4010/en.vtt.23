00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.656
to actually pick up tumors
way, way earlier in the process,

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.600
way before it's 100 million cells inside,
so we can actually do something about it.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.616
An ability to see each and every one
of the cells might also allow us

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.016
to ask insightful questions.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.136
So in the lab,
we are now getting to a point

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.416
where we can actually start asking
these cancer cells real questions,

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.216
like, for example, are you responding
to the treatment we are giving you or not?

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.696
So if you're not responding, we'll know
to stop the treatment right away,

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.760
days into the treatment, not three months.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.656
And so also for patients like Ehud

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.096
that are going through these
nasty, nasty chemotherapy drugs,
