00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.840
Well, unfortunately, three months later,
we got the news, it didn't work.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.576
And so Ehud goes
into his second treatment.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.856
And again, the same story.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.616
"It feels so bad, something's
gotta be working there."

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.576
And then three months later,
again we get bad news.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.536
Ehud is going into his third treatment,
and then his fourth treatment.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.080
And then, as predicted, Ehud dies.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.376
Now, when someone really close to you
is going through such a huge struggle,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.216
you get really swamped with emotions.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.336
A lot of things
are going through your head.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.816
For me, it was mostly outrage.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.536
I was just outraged that, how come
this is the best that we can offer?
