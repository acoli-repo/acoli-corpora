I'm going to start by sharing with you
a story about a good friend of mine.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.616
His name is Ehud,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.776
and a few years ago,
Ehud was diagnosed with brain cancer.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.656
And not just any type of brain cancer:

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.856
he was diagnosed with one
of the most deadly forms of brain cancer.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.096
In fact, it was so deadly

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.776
that the doctors told him
that they only have 12 months,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.216
and during those 12 months,
they have to find a treatment.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.696
They have to find a cure,

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.880
and if they cannot
find a cure, he will die.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.256
Now, the good news, they said,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.216
is that there are tons
of different treatments to choose from,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.456
but the bad news is

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.016
that in order for them to tell
if a treatment is even working or not,
