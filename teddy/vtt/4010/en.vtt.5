00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.936
You'll notice that there aren't
that many things that have changed.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.256
It's still a huge issue.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.016
You'll see a few changes, though.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.576
You'll see lung cancer,
for example, on the rise.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.800
Thank you, cigarettes.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.856
And you'll also see that,
for example, stomach cancer

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.216
once used to be one
of the biggest killers of all cancers,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.680
is essentially eliminated.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.536
Now, why is that?
Anyone knows, by the way?

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.896
Why is it that humanity is no longer
struck by stomach cancer?

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.776
What was the huge, huge
medical technology breakthrough

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.160
that came to our world
that saved humanity from stomach cancer?
