00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:03.797
In an era of extreme polarization,

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.963
it's really dangerous
to talk about right and wrong.

00:00:08.263 --> 00:00:13.563
You can be targeted, judged for something
you said 10 years ago, 10 months ago,

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:16.297
10 hours ago, 10 seconds ago.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.597
And that means that those
who think you're wrong

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.897
may burn you at the stake

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.063
or those who are on your side

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:24.297
that think you're not
sufficiently orthodox

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.630
may try and cancel you.

00:00:25.663 --> 00:00:29.330
As you're thinking about right and wrong,
I want you to consider three ideas.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:33.630
What if right and wrong
is something that changes over time.
