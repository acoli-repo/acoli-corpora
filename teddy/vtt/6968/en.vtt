The distinct forms of speech heard

00:00:09.704 --> 00:00:12.496
around Bremen, Germany 
and Interlaken, Switzerland

00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:15.871
are considered regional dialects 
of the German language.

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:19.496
And yet, when someone from Bremen 
is visiting the Swiss Alps,

00:00:19.496 --> 00:00:24.079
the conversations they hear between locals
will likely be incomprehensible to them.

00:00:24.288 --> 00:00:26.329
Similarly, outside of China,

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.204
Mandarin and Cantonese are often referred
to as Chinese dialects.
