00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is the venue

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
where, as a young man,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
some of the music that I wrote was first performed.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It was, remarkably,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a pretty good sounding room.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
With all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
it actually sounded pretty good.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This is a song that was recorded there.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
(Music)

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is not Talking Heads,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
in the picture anyway.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
(Music: "A Clean Break (Let's Work)" by Talking Heads)
