On this planet today,

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:09.351
there are about 50 cities
that are larger than five million people.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:12.059
I'm going to share with you
the story of one such city,

00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:14.476
a city of seven million people,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.559
but a city that's a temporary megacity,
an ephemeral megacity.

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:24.643
This is a city that is built
for a Hindu religious festival

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.393
called Kumbh Mela,

00:00:26.417 --> 00:00:30.851
which occurs every 12 years,
in smaller editions every four years,
