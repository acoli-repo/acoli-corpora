00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This type of habitat covers more of the Earth's surface

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
than all other habitats combined.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And yet, we know more about the surface of the Moon and about Mars

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
than we do about this habitat,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
despite the fact that we have yet to extract

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
a gram of food, a breath of oxygen or a drop of water

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
from those bodies.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And so 10 years ago,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
an international program began called the Census of Marine Life,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
which set out to try and improve our understanding

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
of life in the global oceans.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It involved 17 different projects around the world.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
As you can see, these are the footprints of the different projects.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And I hope you'll appreciate the level of global coverage
