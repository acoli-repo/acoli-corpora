00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Now what you can see

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
is we've sampled the area in the North Atlantic,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
in the North Sea in particular,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and also the east coast of North America fairly well.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
That's the warm colors which show a well-sampled region.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
The cold colors, the blue and the black,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
show areas where we have almost no data.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
So even after a 10-year census,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
there are large areas that still remain unexplored.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Now there are a group of scientists living in Texas, working in the Gulf of Mexico

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
who decided really as a labor of love

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
to pull together all the knowledge they could

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
about biodiversity in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And so they put this together, a list of all the species,
