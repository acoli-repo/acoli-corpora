00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
to study the distribution, diversity and abundance

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
of life in the global ocean.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And so what did we find?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We found spectacular new species,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
the most beautiful and visually stunning things everywhere we looked --

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
from the shoreline to the abyss,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
form microbes all the way up to fish and everything in between.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And the limiting step here wasn't the unknown diversity of life,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
but rather the taxonomic specialists

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
who can identify and catalog these species

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
that became the limiting step.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
They, in fact, are an endangered species themselves.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
There are actually four to five new species

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
described everyday for the oceans.
