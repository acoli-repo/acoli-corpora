Well, I could stand here for hours, but, of course, I'm not allowed to do that.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
But I will tell you some of my favorite discoveries

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
from the census.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Where do we find the most species of ocean life?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And what we find if we plot up the well-known species

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
is this sort of a distribution.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And what we see is that for coastal tags,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
for those organisms that live near the shoreline,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
they're most diverse in the tropics.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
This is something we've actually known for a while,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
so it's not a real breakthrough.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
What is really exciting though

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
is that the oceanic tags, or the ones that live far from the coast,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
are actually more diverse at intermediate latitudes.
