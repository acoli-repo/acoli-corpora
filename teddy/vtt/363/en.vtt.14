00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Because GPS doesn't work under water. That's why we need these tools.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And so from this we're able to identify these blue highways,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
these hot spots in the ocean,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
that should be real priority areas

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
for ocean conservation.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Now one of the other things that you may think about

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
is that, when you go to the supermarket and you buy things, they're scanned.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And so there's a barcode on that product

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
that tells the computer exactly what the product is.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And what barcoding does

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
is use a specific gene called CO1

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
that's consistent within a species, but varies among species.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And so what that means is we can unambiguously identify
