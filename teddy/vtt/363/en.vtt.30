00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
are now effectively gone.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
There were trawls taken in the deep sea in the Mediterranean,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
which collected more garbage than they did animals.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And that's the deep sea, that's the environment that we consider to be

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
among the most pristine left on Earth.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And there are a lot of other pressures.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Ocean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
as well as ocean warming, and the effects they're going to have on coral reefs.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
On the scale of decades, in our lifetimes,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
we're going to see a lot of damage to coral reefs.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And I could spend the rest of my time, which is getting very limited,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
going through this litany of concerns about the ocean,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
but I want to end on a more positive note.
