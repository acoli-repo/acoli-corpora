00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That also doesn't even get into the whole protein extraction

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that we do from the ocean.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That's about 10 percent of our global needs

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and 100 percent of some island nations.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If you were to descend

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
into the 95 percent of the biosphere that's livable,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
it would quickly become pitch black,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
interrupted only by pinpoints of light

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
from bioluminescent organisms.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And if you turn the lights on,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
you might periodically see spectacular organisms swim by,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
because those are the denizens of the deep,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the things that live in the deep ocean.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And eventually, the deep sea floor would come into view.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This type of habitat covers more of the Earth's surface
