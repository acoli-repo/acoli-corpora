00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
using every source of information they could get their hands on.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And so anything from restaurant menus

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
to monastery records to ships' logs

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
to see what the oceans looked like.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Because science data really goes back

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
to, at best, World War II, for the most part.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And so what they found, in fact,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
is that exploitation really began heavily with the Romans.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And so at that time, of course, there was no refrigeration.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So fishermen could only catch

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
what they could either eat or sell that day.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
But the Romans developed salting.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And with salting,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And so began industrial fishing.
