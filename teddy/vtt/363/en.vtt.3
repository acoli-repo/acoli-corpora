00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And I hope you'll appreciate the level of global coverage

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that it managed to achieve.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It all began when two scientists, Fred Grassle and Jesse Ausubel,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
met in Woods Hole, Massachusetts

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And Fred was lamenting the state of marine biodiversity

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and the fact that it was in trouble and nothing was being done about it.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Well, from that discussion grew this program

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that involved 2,700 scientists

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
from more than 80 countries around the world

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
who engaged in 540 ocean expeditions

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
at a combined cost of 650 million dollars

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
to study the distribution, diversity and abundance
