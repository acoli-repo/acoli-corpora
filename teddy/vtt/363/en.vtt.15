00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And so what that means is we can unambiguously identify

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
which species are which

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
even if they look similar to each other,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
but may be biologically quite different.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Now one of the nicest examples I like to cite on this

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
is the story of two young women, high school students in New York City,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
who worked with the census.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
They went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in New York City

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and they barcoded it.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Well what they found was mislabeled fish.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So for example,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
they found something which was sold as tuna, which is very valuable,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
was in fact tilapia, which is a much less valuable fish.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
They also found an endangered species

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
sold as a common one.
