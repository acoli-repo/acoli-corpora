The oceans cover some 70 percent of our planet.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And I think Arthur C. Clarke probably had it right

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
when he said that perhaps we ought to call our planet

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Planet Ocean.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And the oceans are hugely productive,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
as you can see by the satellite image

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
of photosynthesis, the production of new life.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In fact, the oceans produce half of the new life every day on Earth

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
as well as about half the oxygen that we breathe.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In addition to that, it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and much of it we don't know about.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But I'll tell you some of that today.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That also doesn't even get into the whole protein extraction
