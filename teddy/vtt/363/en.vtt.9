00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
It's from trophy fish caught off the coast of Florida.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And so this is a photograph from the 1950s.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I want you to notice the scale on the slide,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
because when you see the same picture from the 1980s,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
we see the fish are much smaller

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and we're also seeing a change

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
in terms of the composition of those fish.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
By 2007, the catch was actually laughable

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
in terms of the size for a trophy fish.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
But this is no laughing matter.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
The oceans have lost a lot of their productivity

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and we're responsible for it.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So what's left? Actually quite a lot.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
There's a lot of exciting things, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about them.
