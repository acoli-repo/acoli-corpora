If you were to go out there today, 20 years after this fishery collapsed,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
if you could catch a fish, which would be a bit of a challenge,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
it would be half that size still.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So what we're experiencing is something called shifting baselines.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Our expectations of what the oceans can produce

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
is something that we don't really appreciate

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
because we haven't seen it in our lifetimes.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Now most of us, and I would say me included,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
think that human exploitation of the oceans

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
really only became very serious

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
in the last 50 to, perhaps, 100 years or so.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
The census actually tried to look back in time,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
using every source of information they could get their hands on.
