WEBVTT

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
They also found an endangered species

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
sold as a common one.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So barcoding allows us to know what we're working with

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and also what we're eating.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
The Ocean Biogeographic Information System

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
is the database for all the census data.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
It's open access; you can all go in and download data as you wish.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And it contains all the data from the census

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
plus other data sets that people were willing to contribute.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And so what you can do with that

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
is to plot the distribution of species and where they occur in the oceans.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
What I've plotted up here is the data that we have on hand.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
This is where our sampling effort has concentrated.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Now what you can see
