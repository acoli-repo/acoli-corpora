00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
it's an opportunity to send data back to shore

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And so from that we can produce these tracks.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
For example, the dark blue

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north Pacific.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Now I realize for those of you who are colorblind, this slide is not very helpful,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
but stick with me nonetheless.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
For animals that don't surface,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
we have something called pop-up tags,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
which collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And then at some period of time

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
it pops up to the surface and, again, relays that data back to shore.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Because GPS doesn't work under water. That's why we need these tools.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And so from this we're able to identify these blue highways,
