00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
with my dog curled up at my feet, a cup of tea in my hand,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and I could tell the pilot, "I want a sample right there."

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And that's exactly what the pilot did for me.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
That's the sort of technology that's available today

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
that really wasn't available even a decade ago.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So it allows us to sample these amazing habitats

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
that are very far from the surface

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and very far from light.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
is acoustics, or sound waves.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And the advantage of sound waves

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
is that they actually pass well through water, unlike light.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And so we can send out sound waves,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
they bounce off objects like fish and are reflected back.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And so in this example, a census scientist took out two ships.
