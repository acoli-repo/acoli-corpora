00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
We actually know the fishes better than we do any other group in the ocean

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
other than marine mammals.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And so we can actually extrapolate based on rates of discovery

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
how many more species we're likely to discover.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And from that, we actually calculate

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
that we know about 16,500 marine species

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
and there are probably another 1,000 to 4,000 left to go.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So we've done pretty well.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
We've got about 75 percent of the fish,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
maybe as much as 90 percent.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
But the fishes, as I say, are the best known.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
So our level of knowledge is much less for other groups of organisms.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Now this figure is actually based on a brand new paper

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
that's going to come out in the journal PLoS Biology.
