00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and scientists realized that this was something new to science.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Similarly this Golden V kelp

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
collected in Alaska just below the low water mark

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
is probably a new species.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Even though it's three meters long,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
it actually, again, eluded science.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Now this guy, this bigfin squid, is seven meters in length.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
But to be fair, it lives in the deep waters of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
so it was a lot harder to find.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
But there's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
This particular shrimp, we've dubbed it the Jurassic shrimp,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
it's thought to have gone extinct 50 years ago --

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
at least it was, until the census discovered

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
it was living and doing just fine off the coast of Australia.
