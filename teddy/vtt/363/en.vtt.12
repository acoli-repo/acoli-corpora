00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And so in this example, a census scientist took out two ships.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
One would send out sound waves that would bounce back.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
They would be received by a second ship,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and that would give us very precise estimates, in this case,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
of 250 billion herring

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
in a period of about a minute.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And that's an area about the size of Manhattan Island.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
because knowing how many fish are there is really critical.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
We can also use satellite tags

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
to track animals as they move through the oceans.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And so for animals that come to the surface to breathe,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
such as this elephant seal,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
it's an opportunity to send data back to shore
