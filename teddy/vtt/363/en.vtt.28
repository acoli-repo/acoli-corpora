00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And these mats actually cover an area the size of Greece.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And so this particular bacterium is actually visible to the naked eye.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
But you can imagine the biomass that represents.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
But the really intriguing thing about the microbes

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
is just how diverse they are.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
A single drop of seawater

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
could contain 160 different types of microbes.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And the oceans themselves

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
are thought potentially to contain as many as a billion different types.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So that's really exciting. What are they all doing out there?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
We actually don't know.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
The most exciting thing, I would say, about this census

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
is the role of global science.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And so as we see in this image of light during the night,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
there are lots of areas of the Earth
