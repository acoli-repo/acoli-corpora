00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
We also talked about the White Shark Cafe.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
This is a location in the Pacific where white shark converge.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
We don't know why they converge there, we simply don't know.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
That's a question for the future.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
One of the things that we're taught in high school

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Now this little critter, it's only about half a millimeter in size,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
not terribly charismatic.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
But it was only discovered in the early 1980s.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
But the really interesting thing about it

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
is that, a few years ago, census scientists discovered

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
that this guy can thrive in oxygen-poor sediments

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
in the deep Mediterranean Sea.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
So now they know that, in fact,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
animals can live without oxygen, at least some of them,
