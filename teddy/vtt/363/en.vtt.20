00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
are actually more diverse at intermediate latitudes.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
This is the sort of data, again, that managers could use

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
if they want to prioritize areas of the ocean that we need to conserve.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
You can do this on a global scale, but you can also do it on a regional scale.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And that's why biodiversity data can be so valuable.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Now while a lot of the species we discovered in the census

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
are things that are small and hard to see,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that certainly wasn't always the case.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
For example, while it's hard to believe

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
that a three kilogram lobster could elude scientists,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
it did until a few years ago

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
when South African fishermen requested an export permit

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and scientists realized that this was something new to science.
