00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
There are actually four to five new species

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
described everyday for the oceans.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And as I say, it could be a much larger number.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Now, I come from Newfoundland in Canada --

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It's an island off the east coast of that continent --

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
where we experienced one of the worst fishing disasters

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
in human history.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And so this photograph shows a small boy next to a codfish.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It's around 1900.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Now, when I was a boy of about his age,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I would go out fishing with my grandfather

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and we would catch fish about half that size.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And I thought that was the norm,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
because I had never seen fish like this.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
If you were to go out there today, 20 years after this fishery collapsed,
