00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And so began industrial fishing.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And so these are the sorts of extrapolations that we have

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
of what sort of loss we've had

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
relative to pre-human impacts on the ocean.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
They range from 65 to 98 percent

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
for these major groups of organisms,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
as shown in the dark blue bars.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Now for those species the we managed to leave alone, that we protect --

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
for example, marine mammals in recent years and sea birds --

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
there is some recovery.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So it's not all hopeless.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
But for the most part, we've gone from salting to exhausting.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
It's from trophy fish caught off the coast of Florida.
