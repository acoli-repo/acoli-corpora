00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.656
but our lives can be filled
with as much intensity,

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.440
and the stakes can feel just as dramatic.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.136
We cycle through tragedy and joy

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.096
just like these characters.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.576
We cross thresholds, fight demons
and find salvation unexpectedly,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.576
and we do it again and again and again,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.336
but just like soaps,
we can flip the script,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.616
which means we can learn
from these characters

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.456
that move like bumblebees,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.056
looping and swerving through life.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.336
And we can use those lessons

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.280
to craft our own life stories.
