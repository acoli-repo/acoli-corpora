00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.616
desperate to catch the end
of Luke and Laura's wedding,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.016
the biggest moment
in "General Hospital" history.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.296
(Applause)

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.656
So you can imagine
how much I loved my eight years

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.656
as the assistant casting director
on "As the World Turns."

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.696
My job was watching soap operas,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.136
reading soap opera scripts

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.936
and auditioning actors
to be on soap operas.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.256
So I know my stuff.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.536
(Laughter)

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.856
And yes, soap operas

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.176
are larger than life,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.896
drama on a grand scale,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.656
but our lives can be filled
with as much intensity,
