00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.296
of my in-laws' home,

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.096
and that's enough
to make anyone feel dead inside.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.016
(Laughter)

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.176
But I knew my story wasn't over,

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.416
that it couldn't be over.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.600
I just had to tap into everything
I had ever learned about soap operas.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.896
I had to be brave like Erica
and refuse to surrender,

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.120
so every day, I made a decision to fight.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.576
I had to be vulnerable like Stephanie

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.136
and sacrifice my ego.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.200
I had to ask for help
a lot of times across many states.
