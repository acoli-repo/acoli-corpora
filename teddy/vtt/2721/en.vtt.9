00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.776
He maxed out 11 credit cards
and racked up six figures in personal debt

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.120
and it still wasn't enough.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.536
So every two weeks for two years on payday
he stood in front of his employees

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.280
and he asked them
to sacrifice their salaries,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.496
and it worked.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.336
More than 50 people deferred
two million dollars,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.216
and now, more than a decade later,

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.560
Pandora is worth billions.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.816
When you believe that there is a way

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.216
around or through
whatever is in front of you,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.776
that surrender is not an option,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.720
you can overcome enormous obstacles.
