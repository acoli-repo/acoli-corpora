Surprise slams us in the face.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.336
You're flat on the ground,
the air is gone,

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.159
and you need resuscitation.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.135
So thank goodness
for soap opera lesson four:

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.416
resurrection is possible.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.856
(Laughter)

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.720
(Applause)

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.136
In 1983, "Days of Our Lives"'
Stefano DiMera died of a stroke,

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.696
but not really, because in 1984

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.456
he died when his car
plunged into the harbor,

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.016
and yet he was back in 1985
with a brain tumor.
