00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.200
I had to ask for help
a lot of times across many states.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:06.216
I had to be adaptable like Carly

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.776
and evolve my skills,
my mindset, and my circumstances,

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.776
and then I had to be
resilient, like Stefano,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.456
and resurrect myself and my career

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.600
like a phoenix from the ashes.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.400
Eventually I got an interview.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.576
After 15 years in news and entertainment,

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.536
nine months of unemployment

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.640
and this one interview,

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.040
I had an offer for an entry level job.
