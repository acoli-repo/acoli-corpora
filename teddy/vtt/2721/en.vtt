In 1987, Tina Lord
found herself in quite the pickle.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.856
See, this gold digger made sure
she married sweet Cord Roberts

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.536
just before he inherited millions.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.776
But when Cord found out
Tina loved his money

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.416
as much as she loved him,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.696
he dumped her.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.616
Cord's mother Maria was thrilled

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.136
until they hooked up again.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.816
So Maria hired Max Holden to romance Tina

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.576
and then made sure Cord didn't find out
Tina was pregnant with his baby.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.496
So Tina, still married
but thinking Cord didn't love her

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.696
flew to Argentina with Max.
