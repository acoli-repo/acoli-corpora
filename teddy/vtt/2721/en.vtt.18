00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.016
and yet he was back in 1985
with a brain tumor.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.056
(Laughter)

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.696
But before the tumor could kill him,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.720
Marlena shot him, and he tumbled
off a catwalk to his death.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.736
And so it went for 30 years.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.256
(Laughter)

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.416
Even when we saw the body,

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.656
we knew better.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.280
He's called the Phoenix for a reason.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.976
And here's what that means for us.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.456
As long as the show is still on the air,

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.576
or you're still breathing,

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.256
nothing is permanent.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.600
Resurrection is possible.
