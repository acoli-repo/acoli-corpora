"All My Children"'s Erica Kane
was daytime's version of Scarlett O'Hara,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.176
a hyperbolically self-important princess

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.200
who deep down was scrappy and daring.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.416

She screamed at the bear,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.896

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.576
Do you understand me?

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.496
You may not come near me!

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.416
I am Erica Kane

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.056
and you are a filthy beast!"

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.896
(Laughter)

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.576
And of course the bear left,
