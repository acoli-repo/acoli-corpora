00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.696
"Am I too late?

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.800
Cord, I've come so far.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.880
This is your son."

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.896
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.096
is how the soap opera "One Life to Live"
introduced a love story

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.176
that lasted 25 years.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.536
(Laughter)

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.656
Now, if you've ever seen a soap opera,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.576
you know the stories and the characters
can be exaggerated, larger than life,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.856
and if you're a fan,
you find that exaggeration fun,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.080
and if you're not,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.296
maybe you find them
melodramatic or unsophisticated.
