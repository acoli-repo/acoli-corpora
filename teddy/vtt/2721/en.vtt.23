00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.040
I had an offer for an entry level job.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.896
I was 37 years old

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.600
and I was back from the dead.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.336
We will all experience
what looks like an ending,

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.440
and we can choose to make it a beginning.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.216
Kind of like Tina, who miraculously
survived that waterfall,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.936
and because I hate to leave
a cliffhanger hanging,

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.136
Tina and Cord did get divorced,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.920
but they got remarried three times
before the show went off the air in 2012.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.816
So remember,
