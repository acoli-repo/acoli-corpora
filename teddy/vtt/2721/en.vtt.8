00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.576
And of course the bear left,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.416
so what that teaches us

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.496
is obstacles are to be expected

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.240
and we can choose to surrender
or we can stand and fight.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.056
Pandora's Tim Westergren
knows this better than most.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.320
You might even call him
the Erica Kane of Silicon Valley.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.055
Tim and his cofounders
launched the company

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.815
with two million dollars in funding.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.560
They were out of cash the next year.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.080
Now, lots of companies fold at that point,
but Tim chose to fight.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.776
He maxed out 11 credit cards
and racked up six figures in personal debt
