00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.800
Characters are supposed
to grow and change.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.016
Now, on TV, those dynamic changes

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.296
can make for some rough transitions,

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.696
particularly when a character
is played by one person yesterday

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.560
and played by someone new today.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.920
Recasting happens all the time on soaps.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.376
Over the last 20 years,

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.256
four different actors
have played the same key role

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.840
of Carly Benson on "General Hospital."

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.856
Each new face triggered a change
in the character's life and personality.
