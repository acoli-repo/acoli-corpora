00:00:00.556 --> 00:00:01.876
Under our feet,

00:00:01.916 --> 00:00:03.836
there is an unseen world

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:07.916
more diverse than all
the tropical rainforests combined.

00:00:07.956 --> 00:00:12.036
Teeming with microbial life
and critters, large and small,

00:00:12.076 --> 00:00:17.196
this hidden world of soil
is on every single continent.

00:00:18.396 --> 00:00:22.596
But most of us know little to nothing
about this vast world under our feet.

00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:25.076
And for most of my life,

00:00:25.116 --> 00:00:26.836
I was no exception.

00:00:26.876 --> 00:00:31.476
I grew up [a] very curious
and adventurous kid.
