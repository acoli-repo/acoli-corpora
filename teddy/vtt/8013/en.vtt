00:00:00.288 --> 00:00:03.416
How does the human brain build itself?

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:07.086
How do circuits in the human brain

00:00:07.128 --> 00:00:08.379
wire together?

00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:13.051
For instance, how does one tiny neuron
in the outer layer of the brain

00:00:13.092 --> 00:00:15.595
send a thin axon
all the way to the spinal cord,

00:00:15.636 --> 00:00:17.388
find the right neuron

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.182
and then control muscle contraction

00:00:19.223 --> 00:00:22.143
as we extend a hand
and grasp a glass of water?

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.271
I'm here to tell you

00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:28.066
that we can finally grow
parts of the human brain

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:29.942
from any individual

00:00:29.942 --> 00:00:32.028
and then build functioning human circuits
