Or Google is quite generous, so he can have one or two years to go.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
But in China they look generation after generation

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
because they remember

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
the very embarrassing period, for 100 years,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
when they went backwards.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And then they would remember the first part

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
of last century, which was really bad,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and we could go by this so-called Great Leap Forward.

this amazing move forward.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Isn't it strange to see that the United States
