00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And on this, heath, child survival,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and it doesn't come as a surprise

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
But when I split it, when I split it

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
into country bubbles,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
the size of the bubbles here is the population.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius, completely different.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
There is such a difference within Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And I can split the others. Here is the South Asian,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Arab world.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Now all your different departments.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
East Europe, Latin America, and OECD countries.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And here were are. We have a continuum in the world.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
We cannot put it into two parts.
