00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
are mixing up with the former industrialized western world.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
We have a continuum. But we still have, of course,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Congo, up there. We still have as poor countries

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
as we have had, always, in history.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And that's the bottom billion, where we've heard today

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
about a completely new approach to do it.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And how fast has this happened?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Well, MDG 4.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
The United States has not been so eager

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
to use MDG 4.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
But you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
because it's the only child mortality that we can measure.
