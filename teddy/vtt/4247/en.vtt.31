00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Not simplistic extrapolation.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
We have to really find a way

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
of supporting those countries in a better way.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
We have to respect the middle income countries

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
on what they are doing.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And we have to fact-base the whole way we look at the world.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
This is dollar per person. This is HIV in the countries.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
The blue is Africa.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
You see the tragedy in South Africa there.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
About 20 percent of the adult population are infected.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And in spite of them having quite a high income,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
they have a huge number of HIV infected.
