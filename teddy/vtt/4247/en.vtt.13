Isn't it strange to see that the United States

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
first grew the economy, and then gradually got rich?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Whereas China could get healthy much earlier,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
because they applied the knowledge of education, nutrition,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and then also benefits of penicillin

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and vaccines and family planning.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And Asia could have social development

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
before they got the economic development.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So to me, as a public health professor,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
it's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Because what you see here, what you see here
