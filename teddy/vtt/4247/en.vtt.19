00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
We have all this at the same time.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
That's why it's so problematic to describe what has happened

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
in the developing world.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Because it's so different, what has happened there.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And that's why I suggest

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
a slightly different approach of what you would call it.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And you have huge differences within countries also.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I heard that your departments here were by regions.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Here you have Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
East Asia, Arab states,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
East Europe, Latin America, and OECD.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And on this axis, GDP.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And on this, heath, child survival,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and it doesn't come as a surprise
