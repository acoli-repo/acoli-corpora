00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
technical advice and investment.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And you see all the world moves over to a two child family,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and a life with 60 to 70 years.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
But some countries remain back in this area here.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We have Liberia. We have Congo.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So we have countries living there.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So the problem I had

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
is that the worldview that my students had

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
corresponds to reality in the world

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
the year their teachers were born.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
