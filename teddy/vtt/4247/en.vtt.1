00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
"We learned it in college."

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And what is the definition then? "The definition?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Everyone knows," they say.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But then you know, I press them like this.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So one girl said, very cleverly, "It's very easy.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Western world is a long life in a small family.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Developing world is a short life in a large family."

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And I like that definition, because it enabled me

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
to transfer their mindset

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
into the dataset.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And here you have the dataset.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So, you can see that what we have on this axis here

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
is size of family. One, two, three, four, five

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
children per woman on this axis.
