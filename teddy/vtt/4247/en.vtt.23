(Applause)

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And it is U.S. government at its best,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
without advocacy, providing facts,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
that it's useful for the society.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And providing data free of charge

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
on the internet, for the world to use. Thank you very much.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Quite the opposite of the World Bank,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
who compiled data with government money,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
tax money, and then they sell it to add a little profit,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
in a very inefficient, Gutenberg way.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
(Applause)
