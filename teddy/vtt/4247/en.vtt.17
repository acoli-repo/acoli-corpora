Can you see how it's growing? And how hundreds of millions

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and billions is coming out of poverty in Asia?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And it goes over here?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And I come now, into projections,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there, you know, because --

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
(Laughter)

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
that's where the projections are not valid any longer.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Probably the world will do this.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and then it will continue forward like this.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
But more or less, this is what will happen,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
We have the high income countries here,
