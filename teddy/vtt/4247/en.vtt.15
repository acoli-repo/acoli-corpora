00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
where you cover everything from Washington

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to Eisenhower.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Because Washington to Eisenhower,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
that is what we find in the developing world.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
We could actually go to Mayflower

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000

which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
which have great entrepreneurs,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
but also have the collapsing countries.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So, how could we make better sense about this?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Well, one way of trying is to see whether we could

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
look at income distribution.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
This is the income distribution of peoples in the world,
