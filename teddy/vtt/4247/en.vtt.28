00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
I run Sweden the same 16 year period.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Second round, it's Sweden, 1916,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
against Egypt, 1990.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Here we go. Once again the USA is part of the reason here.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
They get safe water, they get food for the poor,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and they get malaria eradicated.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
5.5 percent. They are faster than the millennium development goal.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And third chance for Sweden, against Brazil here.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Brazil here has amazing social improvement

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
over the last 16 years,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
and they go faster than Sweden.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
This means that the world is converging.
