00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And here were are. We have a continuum in the world.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
We cannot put it into two parts.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
It is Mayflower down here. It is Washington here,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
building, building countries.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
It's Lincoln here, advancing them.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
It's Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And then it's United States today, up here.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And we have countries all this way.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Now, this is the important thing

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
of understanding how the world has changed.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
At this point I decided to make a pause.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
(Laughter)
