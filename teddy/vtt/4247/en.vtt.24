00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
(Applause)

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
But the people doing that at the World Bank

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
are among the best in the world.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And they are highly skilled professionals.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
It's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
to deal with the world in the modern way, as we do.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And when it comes to free data and transparency,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
United States of America is one of the best.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
(Laughter)

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And I'm not paid to come here, no.
