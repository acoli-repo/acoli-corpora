00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I was at the Global Health Conference here in Washington last week,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and I could see the wrong concept

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000

Look here when I move them forward.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Here we go.
