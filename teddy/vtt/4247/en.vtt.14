00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Because what you see here, what you see here

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
is the flat world of Thomas Friedman,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
isn't it.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
It's not really, really flat.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
But the middle income countries --

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and this is where I suggest to my students,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
stop using the concept "developing world."

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Because after all, talking about the developing world

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
is like having two chapters in the history of the United States.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
The last chapter is about present, and president Obama,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and the other is about the past,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
where you cover everything from Washington

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to Eisenhower.
