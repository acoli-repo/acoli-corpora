00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to talk about your mindset.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Does your mindset correspond to my dataset?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
(Laughter)

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If not, one or the other needs upgrading, isn't it?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
When I talk to my students about global issues,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I listen to them in the coffee break,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
they always talk about "we" and "them."

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And when they come back into the lecture room

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I ask them, "What do you mean with "we" and "them"?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"Oh, it's very easy. It's the western world and it's the developing world," they say.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
"We learned it in college."
