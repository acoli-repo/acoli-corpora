00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
This means that the world is converging.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
The middle income countries,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
the emerging economy, they are catching up.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
They are moving to cities,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
where they also get better assistance for that.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Well the Swedish students protest at this point.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
They say, "This is not fair,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
because these countries had vaccines and antibiotics

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
that were not available for Sweden.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
We have to do real-time competition."

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Okay. I give you Singapore, the year I was born.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Singapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
It's the most tropical country in the world,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
a marshland on the equator.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And here we go. It took a little time for them to get independent.
