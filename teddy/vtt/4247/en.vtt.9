You can see how the brown bubbles, which is west Europe,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and the yellow one, which is the United States,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
they get richer and richer and also

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
start to get healthier and healthier.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And this is now 100 years ago,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
where the rest of the world remains behind.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Here we come. And that was the influenza.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
That's why we are so scared about flu, isn't it?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
It's still remembered. The fall of life expectancy.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And then we come up. Not until

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
independence started.
