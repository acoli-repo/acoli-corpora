00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Here we go.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
They catch up. There's Mexico.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
It's on par with United States in these two social dimensions.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
There was less than five percent

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
of the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
This great nation, Mexico,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
has the problem that arms are coming from North,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
across the borders, so they had to stop that,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
because they have this strange relationship to the United States, you know.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But if I would change this axis here,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I would instead put income per person.
