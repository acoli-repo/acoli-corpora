00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
children per woman on this axis.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And here, length of life, life expectancy,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
30, 40, 50.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Exactly what the students said was their concept about the world.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And really this is about the bedroom.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Whether the man and woman decide to have small family,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and take care of their kids, and how long they will live.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It's about the bathroom and the kitchen. If you have soap, water and food, you know,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
you can live long.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And the students were right. It wasn't that the world consisted --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
the world consisted here, of one set of countries over here,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
which had large families and short life. Developing world.
