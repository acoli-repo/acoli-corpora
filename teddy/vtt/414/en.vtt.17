00:08:30.663 --> 00:08:33.899
Its shape is deformed, but our planet
would be recognizable

00:08:33.923 --> 00:08:35.829
by the water on its surface.

00:08:36.692 --> 00:08:40.549
The energy from the impact
vaporizes the surface,

00:08:40.573 --> 00:08:42.095
the water, the atmosphere,

00:08:42.119 --> 00:08:46.042
and mixes all of the gases together
in just a few hours.

00:08:47.414 --> 00:08:51.033
We discovered that many
giant impacts make synestias,

00:08:51.566 --> 00:08:54.543
but these burning, bright objects
don't live very long.

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:58.103
They cool down, shrink
and turn back into planets.

00:08:59.266 --> 00:09:01.689
While rocky planets
like Earth were growing,
