00:00:59.414 --> 00:01:03.151
The leading idea for the origin
of the Earth and Moon

00:01:03.175 --> 00:01:05.130
is called the "giant impact theory."

00:01:06.011 --> 00:01:09.419
The theory states that a Mars-sized body
struck the young Earth,

00:01:09.443 --> 00:01:14.768
and the Moon formed from
the debris disk around the planet.

00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:19.272
The theory can explain
so many things about the Moon,

00:01:19.296 --> 00:01:21.317
but it has a huge flaw:

00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:26.582
it predicts that the Moon is mostly made
from the Mars-sized planet,

00:01:26.606 --> 00:01:29.950
that the Earth and the Moon
are made from different materials.
