only after cooling
for hundreds of years longer.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.794
In our new theory,

00:10:04.818 --> 00:10:07.628
the giant impact makes a synestia,

00:10:07.652 --> 00:10:11.297
and the synestia divides
into two new bodies,

00:10:11.321 --> 00:10:16.055
creating our isotopically
identical Earth and Moon.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.137
Synestias have been created
throughout the universe.

00:10:22.574 --> 00:10:28.155
And we only just realized that
by finding them in our imagination:

00:10:28.179 --> 00:10:33.082
What else am I missing
in the world around me?
