The prefix means "all together,"

00:08:02.819 --> 00:08:05.616
to emphasize the connection
between all of the material.

A synestia is what a planet becomes

00:08:09.866 --> 00:08:14.316

of a spheroidal shape.

00:08:15.691 --> 00:08:18.181
Would you like to see a synestia?

00:08:18.205 --> 00:08:20.244

the young Earth is already spinning
quickly from a previous giant impact.
