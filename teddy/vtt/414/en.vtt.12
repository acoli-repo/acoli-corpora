00:05:58.826 --> 00:06:00.739
all of the rules of the real world,

00:06:00.763 --> 00:06:03.048
and free my mind to explore.

00:06:04.711 --> 00:06:06.637
And by making a mental space

00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:10.077
where I could try out outrageous ideas

00:06:11.233 --> 00:06:14.667
and then bring them back
into the real world to test them,

00:06:15.331 --> 00:06:16.685
I could learn.

00:06:19.423 --> 00:06:22.399
And by playing, we learned so much.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.338
I combined my lab experiments
with computer models

00:06:26.362 --> 00:06:28.944
and discovered that
after most giant impacts,

00:06:28.968 --> 00:06:31.130
the Earth is so hot, there's no surface.
