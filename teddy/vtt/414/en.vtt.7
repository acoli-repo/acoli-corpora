00:03:30.871 --> 00:03:32.881
We were pretty excited.

00:03:32.905 --> 00:03:35.577
Maybe this was the way
to explain the Moon.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.254
The problem is, we also found
that that's just not very likely.

00:03:42.278 --> 00:03:45.358
Most of the time, the disk
is different from the planet,

00:03:45.382 --> 00:03:48.219
and it looked like
making our Moon this way

00:03:48.243 --> 00:03:51.400
would be an astronomical coincidence,

00:03:52.243 --> 00:03:55.227
and it was just hard
for everyone to accept the idea

00:03:55.251 --> 00:03:59.062
that the Moon's special connection
to Earth was an accident.
