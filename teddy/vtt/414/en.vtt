00:00:01.161 --> 00:00:03.492
Nobody likes to make a mistake.

00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:06.309
And I made a whopping one.

00:00:07.534 --> 00:00:12.832
And figuring out what I did wrong
led to a discovery

00:00:12.856 --> 00:00:16.353
that completely changes the way
we think about the Earth and Moon.

00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:19.451
I'm a planetary scientist,

00:00:19.475 --> 00:00:23.205
and my favorite thing to do
is smash planets together.

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:24.240
(Laughter)

00:00:24.264 --> 00:00:30.083
In my lab, I can shoot at rocks
using cannons like this one.
