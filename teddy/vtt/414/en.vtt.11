00:05:30.062 --> 00:05:32.214
I had this strange, new object
in front of me

00:05:32.238 --> 00:05:35.019
and the challenge
to try and figure it out.

00:05:36.473 --> 00:05:39.387
What do you do when faced
with the unknown?

00:05:40.054 --> 00:05:41.735
How do you even start?

00:05:43.058 --> 00:05:44.827
We questioned everything:

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.595
What is a planet?

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:48.923
When is a planet no longer
a planet anymore?

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.191
We played with new ideas.

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:55.153
We had to get rid
of our old way of thinking,

00:05:55.177 --> 00:05:58.802
and by playing, I could
throw away all of the data,

00:05:58.826 --> 00:06:00.739
all of the rules of the real world,
