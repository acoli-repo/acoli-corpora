00:06:59.941 --> 00:07:01.825
that we understood the data

00:07:02.637 --> 00:07:04.446
and knew what it meant for the Moon.

00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:10.174
I discovered a new type
of astronomical object.

00:07:11.168 --> 00:07:12.587
It's not a planet.

00:07:13.087 --> 00:07:14.582
It's made from planets.

00:07:15.733 --> 00:07:18.251
A planet is a body whose self-gravity

00:07:18.275 --> 00:07:20.845
is strong enough to give it
its rounded shape.

00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:22.663
It spins around all together.

00:07:23.415 --> 00:07:26.134
Make it hotter and spin it faster,

00:07:26.158 --> 00:07:29.971
the equator gets bigger and bigger
until it reaches a tipping point.
