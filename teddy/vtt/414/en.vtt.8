00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.970
The giant impact theory
was still in trouble,

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:08.050
and we were still trying to figure out
how to make the Moon.

00:04:09.932 --> 00:04:13.896
Then came the day
when I realized my mistake.

00:04:15.471 --> 00:04:20.410
My student and I were looking at the data
from these fast-spinning giant impacts.

00:04:20.434 --> 00:04:23.116
On that day, we weren't actually
thinking about the Moon,

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.795
we were looking at the planet.

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:27.358
The planet gets super-hot
and partially vaporized

00:04:27.382 --> 00:04:29.548
from the energy of the impact.
