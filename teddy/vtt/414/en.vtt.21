What else am I missing
in the world around me?

00:10:33.106 --> 00:10:36.878
What is hidden from my view
by my own assumptions?

00:10:39.371 --> 00:10:41.665
The next time you look at the Moon,

00:10:41.689 --> 00:10:43.348
remember:

00:10:43.372 --> 00:10:45.204
the things you think you know

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.779
may be the opportunity to discover
something truly amazing.
