00:01:59.973 --> 00:02:02.028
they all have their own genetic code.

00:02:02.695 --> 00:02:07.151
No other planetary bodies
have the same genetic relationship.

00:02:07.824 --> 00:02:10.271
Only the Earth and Moon are twins.

00:02:11.588 --> 00:02:14.163
When I started working
on the origin of the Moon,

00:02:14.187 --> 00:02:18.264
there were scientists that wanted to
reject the whole idea of the giant impact.

00:02:18.288 --> 00:02:22.469
They didn't see any way for this theory
to explain the special relationship

00:02:22.493 --> 00:02:24.229
between the Earth and the Moon.

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.283
We were all trying to think of new ideas.

00:02:28.084 --> 00:02:31.064
The problem was,
there weren't any better ideas.
