00:02:28.084 --> 00:02:31.064
The problem was,
there weren't any better ideas.

00:02:31.768 --> 00:02:35.302
All of the other ideas
had even bigger flaws.

00:02:36.437 --> 00:02:40.059
So we were trying to rescue
the giant impact theory.

00:02:41.376 --> 00:02:46.257
A young scientist in my group suggested
that we try changing the spin

00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:47.646
of the giant impact.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.064
Maybe making the Earth spin faster
could mix more material

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:53.927
and explain the Moon.

00:02:54.623 --> 00:02:57.306
The Mars-sized impactor had been chosen

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.073
because it could make the Moon

00:02:59.097 --> 00:03:02.038
and make the length of Earth's day.
