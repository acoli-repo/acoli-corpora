While rocky planets
like Earth were growing,

00:09:01.713 --> 00:09:05.239
they probably turned into synestias
one or more times.

00:09:07.338 --> 00:09:13.078
A synestia gives us a new way to solve
the problem of the origin of the Moon.

00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:21.736
We propose that the Moon formed
inside a huge, vaporous synestia.

00:09:22.285 --> 00:09:25.355
The Moon grew from magma rain

00:09:25.379 --> 00:09:27.794
that condensed out of the rock vapor.

00:09:29.198 --> 00:09:31.487
The Moon's special connection to Earth
