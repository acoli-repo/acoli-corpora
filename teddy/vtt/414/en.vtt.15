00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:32.271
Push past the tipping point,

00:07:32.295 --> 00:07:36.392
and the material at the equator
spreads into a disk.

00:07:36.953 --> 00:07:39.722
It's now broken all the rules
of being a planet.

00:07:40.215 --> 00:07:42.610
It can't spin around together anymore,

00:07:42.634 --> 00:07:45.295
its shape keeps changing
as it gets bigger and bigger;

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:47.286
the planet has become something new.

00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:51.681
We gave our discovery its name:

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:53.933
synestia.

00:07:54.402 --> 00:07:56.584
We named it after the goddess Hestia,

00:07:56.608 --> 00:07:58.914
the Greek goddess of the hearth and home,

00:07:58.938 --> 00:08:01.220
because we think the Earth became one.
