00:00:24.264 --> 00:00:30.083
In my lab, I can shoot at rocks
using cannons like this one.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.366
(Cannon shot)

00:00:32.762 --> 00:00:33.837
(Laughter)

00:00:34.278 --> 00:00:38.310
In my experiments, I can generate
the extreme conditions

00:00:38.334 --> 00:00:39.960
during planet formation.

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:44.793
And with computer models,
I can collide whole planets together

00:00:44.817 --> 00:00:46.527
to make them grow,

00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:48.138
or I can destroy them.

00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:49.239
(Laughter)

00:00:50.354 --> 00:00:54.778
I want to understand
how to make the Earth and the Moon

00:00:54.802 --> 00:00:58.042
and why the Earth is so different
from other planets.

00:00:59.414 --> 00:01:03.151
The leading idea for the origin
of the Earth and Moon
