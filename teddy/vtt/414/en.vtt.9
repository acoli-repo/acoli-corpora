00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.477
But the data didn't look like a planet.

00:04:33.501 --> 00:04:34.924
It looked really strange.

00:04:35.388 --> 00:04:37.785
The planet was weirdly
connected to the disk.

00:04:39.433 --> 00:04:42.220
I got that super-excited feeling

00:04:42.244 --> 00:04:45.945
when something really wrong
might be something really interesting.

00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:49.339
In all of my calculations,

00:04:49.363 --> 00:04:52.623
I had assumed there was a planet
with a separate disk around it.

00:04:52.647 --> 00:04:55.072
Calculating what was in the disk
as how we tested

00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:57.497
whether an impact could make the Moon.

00:04:58.828 --> 00:05:01.006
But it didn't look that simple anymore.
