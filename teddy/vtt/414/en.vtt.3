00:01:30.504 --> 00:01:32.165
But that's not what we see.

00:01:33.154 --> 00:01:36.871
The Earth and the Moon
are actually like identical twins.

00:01:37.704 --> 00:01:42.601
The genetic code of planets is written
in the isotopes of the elements.

00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:45.494
The Earth and Moon
have identical isotopes.

00:01:45.518 --> 00:01:50.159
That means that the Earth and Moon
are made from the same materials.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.703
It's really strange that the Earth
and the Moon are twins.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.796
All of the planets are made
from different materials,

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.949
so they all have different isotopes,

00:01:59.973 --> 00:02:02.028
they all have their own genetic code.
