00:09:29.198 --> 00:09:31.487
The Moon's special connection to Earth

00:09:31.511 --> 00:09:34.277
is because the Moon formed
inside the Earth

00:09:34.301 --> 00:09:36.181
when Earth was a synestia.

00:09:37.457 --> 00:09:41.743
The Moon could have orbited
inside the synestia for years,

00:09:41.767 --> 00:09:43.384
hidden from view.

00:09:44.622 --> 00:09:49.530
The Moon is revealed by the synestia
cooling and shrinking

00:09:49.554 --> 00:09:51.449
inside of its orbit.

00:09:54.652 --> 00:09:57.245
The synestia turns into planet Earth

00:09:57.269 --> 00:10:00.683
only after cooling
for hundreds of years longer.
