00:02:59.097 --> 00:03:02.038
and make the length of Earth's day.

00:03:03.227 --> 00:03:05.429
People really liked
that part of the model.

00:03:06.481 --> 00:03:09.898
But what if something else determined
the length of Earth's day?

00:03:10.484 --> 00:03:15.206
Then there would be many more possible
giant impacts that could make the Moon.

00:03:16.444 --> 00:03:19.109
I was curious about what could happen,

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:23.520
so I tried simulating
faster-spinning giant impacts,

00:03:23.544 --> 00:03:26.028
and I found that it is possible

00:03:26.052 --> 00:03:29.930
to make a disk out of the same
mixture of materials as the planet.
