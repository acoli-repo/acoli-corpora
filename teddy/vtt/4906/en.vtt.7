that a visit to the hospital can drastically
reduce an adult’s risk of dying from it.

00:03:34.477 --> 00:03:36.547
The longer it’s left 
untreated, though,

00:03:36.547 --> 00:03:39.457
the more likely it will lead
to lasting damage.

00:03:39.457 --> 00:03:43.967
If declining oxygen levels cause cell
death in extreme parts of the body

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:49.177
--like fingers, toes, arms and legs--
the risk of amputation goes up.

00:03:49.177 --> 00:03:54.067
And if bacterial toxins accumulate
in the brain and trigger cell death,

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:58.647
meningitis could also cause long-term
brain damage and memory loss.

00:03:58.647 --> 00:04:03.247
So fast treatment, or better yet, 
prevention, is critical.
