00:03:58.647 --> 00:04:03.247
So fast treatment, or better yet, 
prevention, is critical.

00:04:03.247 --> 00:04:07.367
That's why most countries have
vaccines that defend against the disease

00:04:07.367 --> 00:04:09.217
in its deadliest forms.

00:04:09.217 --> 00:04:13.507
Those are usually given to the people who
are most at risk--like young children,

00:04:13.507 --> 00:04:17.607
people with weak immune systems, 
or people who gather in large groups

00:04:17.607 --> 00:04:21.567
where an outbreak of meningitis 
could potentially happen.

00:04:21.567 --> 00:04:23.147
In addition to those gatherings,

00:04:23.147 --> 00:04:27.117
meningitis is most common in
a region called the meningitis belt

00:04:27.117 --> 00:04:32.187
that stretches across Africa, though cases
do happen all over the world.
