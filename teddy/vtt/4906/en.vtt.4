00:01:56.787 --> 00:02:01.917
This is made of a tight mesh of cells which
separate blood vessels from the brain,

00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:05.817
and block everything except
for a specific set of particles,

00:02:05.817 --> 00:02:09.097
including water molecules and some gases.

00:02:09.097 --> 00:02:12.367
But in ways that scientists are 
still trying to understand,

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:17.157
meningitis bacteria can trick
the barrier into letting them through.

00:02:17.157 --> 00:02:21.037
Inside the brain, the bacteria swiftly
infect the meninges.

00:02:21.037 --> 00:02:26.017
This triggers inflammation as the body’s 
immune response kicks into overdrive,

00:02:26.017 --> 00:02:29.207
bringing on fever
and intense headaches.

00:02:29.207 --> 00:02:33.187
As swelling in the meninges worsens,
the neck begins to stiffen.
