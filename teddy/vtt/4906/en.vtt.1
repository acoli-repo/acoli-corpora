00:00:28.098 --> 00:00:30.288
The outbreak was so fierce

00:00:30.288 --> 00:00:34.757
that it was believed to have sparked a
wave of deadly meningitis epidemics

00:00:34.757 --> 00:00:38.957
that ultimately infected tens of
thousands of people worldwide.

00:00:40.197 --> 00:00:43.337
Meningitis is the inflammation 
of the meninges,

00:00:43.337 --> 00:00:48.297
three tissue layers responsible for 
protecting the brain and spinal cord.

00:00:48.297 --> 00:00:52.027
What makes meningitis so dangerous
compared to other diseases

00:00:52.027 --> 00:00:56.087
is the sheer speed with which
it invades a person’s body.

00:00:56.087 --> 00:00:59.877
In the worst cases, it causes death 
within a day.

00:00:59.877 --> 00:01:04.777
Fortunately, that’s rare for patients
who receive early medical treatment.
