00:02:59.427 --> 00:03:03.777
letting blood seep out and form what
starts out looking like a rash,

00:03:03.777 --> 00:03:08.097
and evolves into big discoloured blots 
beneath the skin.

00:03:08.097 --> 00:03:12.237
At the same time, these toxins
burn through oxygen in the blood,

00:03:12.237 --> 00:03:17.367
reducing the amount that gets to 
major organs like the lungs and kidneys.

00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:20.597
That increases the chance 
of organ shut down

00:03:20.597 --> 00:03:24.777
--and alongside spreading 
septicemia, threatens death.

00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:29.177
That all sounds scary, but doctors are so
good at treating meningitis

00:03:29.177 --> 00:03:34.477
that a visit to the hospital can drastically
reduce an adult’s risk of dying from it.
