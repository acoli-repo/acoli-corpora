Some people can be infected 
and carry the disease

00:01:35.257 --> 00:01:38.137
without showing symptoms
or getting sick,

00:01:38.137 --> 00:01:41.977
which helps the disease
spread quickly to others.

00:01:41.977 --> 00:01:45.167
Once the bacteria enter 
the nose, mouth, and throat,

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:48.837
they cross the surrounding 
membranes and enter the bloodstream.

00:01:48.837 --> 00:01:53.197
From there, bacteria have 
rapid access to the body’s tissues

00:01:53.197 --> 00:01:56.787
--including a membrane
called the blood-brain barrier.

00:01:56.787 --> 00:02:01.917
This is made of a tight mesh of cells which
separate blood vessels from the brain,
