Fortunately, that’s rare for patients
who receive early medical treatment.

00:01:04.777 --> 00:01:07.977
The disease primarily 
comes in three forms:

00:01:07.977 --> 00:01:12.857
fungal, viral, and bacterial--
the last being the most deadly by far,

00:01:12.857 --> 00:01:15.017
and what we’ll focus on.

00:01:15.017 --> 00:01:18.497
People usually contract bacterial 
meningitis by breathing in

00:01:18.497 --> 00:01:22.797
tiny particles of mucus and 
saliva that spray into the air

00:01:22.797 --> 00:01:26.137
when an infected person 
sneezes or coughs.

00:01:26.137 --> 00:01:28.457
It can also be transmitted 
through kissing,

00:01:28.457 --> 00:01:32.477
or sharing cigarettes, 
toothbrushes or utensils.
