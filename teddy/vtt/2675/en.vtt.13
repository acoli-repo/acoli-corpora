00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.440
and turn Indonesia
into a tropical version of Iran.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.336
And that's just what seemed
to happen at first.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.456
In the country's
first free elections, in 1999,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.856
Islamist parties scored
36 percent of the vote,

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.536
and the islands burned

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.480
as riots and terror attacks
killed thousands.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.040
Since then, however,
Indonesia has taken a surprising turn.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.496
While ordinary folks have grown
more pious on a personal level --

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.696
I saw a lot more headscarves
on a recent visit

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.656
than I would have a decade ago --

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.160
the country's politics
have moved in the opposite direction.
