Indonesia is the largest
Muslim-majority country on Earth.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.216
It's also hot, huge and unruly,

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.536
made up of 17,000 islands,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.846
where people speak
close to a thousand languages.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.176
Now, Suharto had been a dictator,

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.816
and a nasty one.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.936
But he'd also been
a pretty effective tyrant,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.256
and he'd always been careful
to keep religion out of politics.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.856
So experts feared that without
him keeping a lid on things,

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.616
the country would explode,

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.536
or religious extremists would take over

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.440
and turn Indonesia
into a tropical version of Iran.
