00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.136
Canadians are not inherently
better than anyone else.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.816
The real explanation involves the man
who became Canada's leader in 1968,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.096
Pierre Trudeau, who is also
the father of the current prime minister.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.520
(Applause)

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.016
The thing to know about that first Trudeau

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.935
is that he was very different
from Canada's previous leaders.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.456
He was a French speaker in a country
long-dominated by its English elite.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.056
He was an intellectual.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.856
He was even kind of groovy.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.536
I mean, seriously, the guy did yoga.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.941
He hung out with the Beatles.
