00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.376
See, Indonesia's religious parties,
like similar parties elsewhere,

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.280
had tended to focus on things like
reducing poverty and cutting corruption.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.616
So that's what Joko
and his predecessors did too,

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.560
thereby stealing the Islamists' thunder.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.096
They also cracked down hard on terrorism,

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.696
but Indonesia's democrats
have learned a key lesson

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.656
from the dark years of dictatorship,

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.320
namely that repression
only creates more extremism.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.976
So they waged their war
with extraordinary delicacy.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.056
They used the police instead of the army.
