They even invited some of the radicals
into their governing coalition.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.720
Now, that horrified
a lot of secular Indonesians.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.696
But by forcing the radicals
to actually help govern,

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.576
it quickly exposed the fact
that they weren't any good at the job,

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.616
and it got them mixed up
in all of the grubby compromises

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.696
and petty humiliations
that are part of everyday politics.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.120
And that hurt their image so badly
that they've never recovered.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.616
Number three,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.480
please all of the people some of the time.
