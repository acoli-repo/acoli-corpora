00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.776
when Mexico finally became a democracy.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.976
Rather than use their new freedoms
to fight for reform,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.336
Mexico's politicians used them
to fight one another.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.296
Congress deadlocked,
and the country's problems --

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.376
drugs, poverty, crime, corruption --

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.976
spun out of control.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.616
Things got so bad that in 2008,

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.520
the Pentagon warned
that Mexico risked collapse.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.056
Then in 2012, this guy
named Enrique Peña Nieto

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.960
somehow got himself elected president.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.680
Now, this Peña hardly inspired
much confidence at first.
