00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.016
may not be so unsolvable after all.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.736
Not only are there theoretical fixes;

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.856
those fixes have been tried.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.616
They've worked.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.640
And they offer hope for the rest of us.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.016
I'm going to show you what I mean

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.896
by telling you about
how three of the countries I visited --

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.536
Canada, Indonesia and Mexico --

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.880
overcame three supposedly
impossible problems.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.816
Their stories matter because they contain
tools the rest of us can use,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.776
and not just for those
particular problems,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.160
but for many others, too.
