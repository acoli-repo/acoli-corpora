00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.736
Now, countries face
crises all the time. Right?

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.000
That's nothing special.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.736
But Trudeau's genius
was to realize that Canada's crisis

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.320
had swept away all the hurdles
that usually block reform.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.240
Canada had to open up. It had no choice.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.816
And it had to rethink its identity.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.536
Again, it had no choice.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:24.096
And that gave Trudeau
a once-in-a-generation opportunity

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.720
to break the old rules and write new ones.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.840
And like all our other heroes,
he was smart enough to seize it.
