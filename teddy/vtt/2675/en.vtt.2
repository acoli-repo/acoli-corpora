00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.056
So a few years ago I decided,

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.976
well, I'm a journalist,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.976
I should see if I can do any better

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.536
by going around the world
and actually asking folks

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.816
if and how they've tackled

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.320
their big economic
and political challenges.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.600
And what I found astonished me.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.200
It turns out that there are remarkable
signs of progress out there,

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.776
often in the most unexpected places,

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.976
and they've convinced me
that our great global challenges

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.016
may not be so unsolvable after all.
