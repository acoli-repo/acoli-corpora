You've got to adapt them
as circumstances change.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.496
That said, by stripping
these stories to their essence,

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.176
you absolutely can distill
a few common tools for problem-solving

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.136
that will work in other countries

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.456
and in boardrooms

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.800
and in all sorts of other contexts, too.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.936
Number one, embrace the extreme.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.896

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.840

of existential peril.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.616
And that was no coincidence.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.960
Take Canada: when Trudeau took office,
he faced two looming dangers.
