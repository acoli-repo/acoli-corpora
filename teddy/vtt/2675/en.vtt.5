00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.496
Consider, Canada today is among
the world's most welcoming nations,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.176
even compared to other
immigration-friendly countries.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.936
Its per capita immigration rate
is four times higher than France's,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.136
and its percentage
of foreign-born residents

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.056
is double that of Sweden.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.816
Meanwhile, Canada admitted

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.576
10 times more Syrian refugees
in the last year

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.296
than did the United States.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.560
