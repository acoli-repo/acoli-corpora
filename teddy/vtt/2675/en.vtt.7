00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.496
Now, here's the really interesting part.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.936
Canada wasn't always like this.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.400
Until the mid-1960s, Canada followed
an explicitly racist immigration policy.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.776
They called it "White Canada,"

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.720
and as you can see, they were not
just talking about the snow.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.280
So how did that Canada
become today's Canada?

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.736
Well, despite what my mom
in Ontario will tell you,

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.736
the answer had nothing to do with virtue.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.136
Canadians are not inherently
better than anyone else.
