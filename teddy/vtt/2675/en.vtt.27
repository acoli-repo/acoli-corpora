Take Canada: when Trudeau took office,
he faced two looming dangers.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.296
First, though his vast,
underpopulated country

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.936
badly needed more bodies,

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.576
its preferred source
for white workers, Europe,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.656
had just stopped exporting them
as it finally recovered from World War II.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.176
The other problem was
that Canada's long cold war

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.016
between its French
and its English communities

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.680
had just become a hot one.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.456
Quebec was threatening to secede,

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.256
and Canadians were actually
killing other Canadians over politics.

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.736
Now, countries face
crises all the time. Right?
