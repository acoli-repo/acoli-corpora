00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.576
The conventional wisdom
about our world today

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.720
is that this is a time
of terrible decline.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.696
And that's not surprising,
given the bad news all around us,

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.816
from ISIS to inequality,

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.256
political dysfunction, climate change,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.320
Brexit, and on and on.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.680
But here's the thing,
and this may sound a little weird.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.000
I actually don't buy
this gloomy narrative,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.736
and I don't think you should either.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.256
Look, it's not that
I don't see the problems.
