Join me now on one last trip,

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.160
this time to Mexico.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.136
Now, of our three stories,
this one probably surprised me the most,

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.576
since as you all know,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.696
the country is still struggling
with so many problems.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.376
And yet, a few years ago,
Mexico did something

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.536
that many other countries
from France to India to the United States

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.456
can still only dream of.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.040
It shattered the political paralysis
that had gripped it for years.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.176
To understand how,
we need to rewind to the year 2000,

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.776
when Mexico finally became a democracy.
