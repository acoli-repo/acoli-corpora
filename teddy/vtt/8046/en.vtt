00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.041
Chris Anderson: Our first speaker
was supposed to be

00:00:03.082 --> 00:00:06.669
the amazing creative filmmaker
from LA, Zach King.

00:00:06.711 --> 00:00:10.423
But unfortunately, he's gone missing.

00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:13.301
We've been trying to track him down.

00:00:13.342 --> 00:00:15.303
(Ringing)

00:00:15.344 --> 00:00:16.471
Ah!

00:00:17.972 --> 00:00:20.558
Zach King: Hey, I’m so sorry
I’m not at the conference.

00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:22.977
I'm not going to make it,
I'm stuck at the airport.

00:00:22.977 --> 00:00:26.189
They wouldn't let me in with this,
apparently, it's oversized.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.607
Wait, you’re onstage.

00:00:27.607 --> 00:00:29.025
Hold on, I have an idea.

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:31.527
If I just set the phone down here.
