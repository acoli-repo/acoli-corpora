00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:00.828
Einstein could write you an equation

00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:03.495
telling you where both objects are
at any point in time.

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.723
Now, with a surprising
increase in difficulty,

00:01:05.747 --> 00:01:08.199
Einstein could include
the Moon in his calculations.

00:01:08.223 --> 00:01:11.290
But as you add more and more planets,
Mars and Jupiter, say,

00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:15.078
the problem gets too tough for Einstein
to solve with a pen and paper.

00:01:15.102 --> 00:01:17.945
Now, strangely, if instead of having
a handful of planets,

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.641
you had millions of objects
or even billions,

00:01:20.665 --> 00:01:22.936
the problem actually becomes much simpler,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.882
and Einstein is back in the game.

00:01:24.906 --> 00:01:26.752
Let me explain what I mean by this,

00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:30.070
by scaling these objects back down
to a molecular level.
