00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:30.070
by scaling these objects back down
to a molecular level.

00:01:30.094 --> 00:01:33.841
If you wanted to trace the erratic path
of an individual air molecule,

00:01:33.865 --> 00:01:35.707
you'd have absolutely no hope.

00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:38.442
But when you have millions
of air molecules all together,

00:01:38.466 --> 00:01:42.343
they start to act in a way
which is quantifiable, predictable

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:43.537
and well-behaved.

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:45.446
And thank goodness air is well-behaved,

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.380
because if it wasn't,
planes would fall out of the sky.

00:01:48.404 --> 00:01:51.468
Now, on an even bigger scale,
across the whole of the world,

00:01:51.492 --> 00:01:54.614
the idea is exactly the same
with all of these air molecules.

00:01:54.638 --> 00:01:57.556
It's true that you can't take
an individual rain droplet

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.365
and say where it's come from
or where it's going to end up.
