00:04:28.997 --> 00:04:31.064
So, to give you another example:

00:04:31.088 --> 00:04:35.313
in 2008, a group in UCLA
were looking into the patterns

00:04:35.337 --> 00:04:38.049
of burglary hot spots in the city.

00:04:38.073 --> 00:04:43.592
Now, one thing about burglaries
is this idea of repeat victimization.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:47.853
So if you have a group of burglars
who manage to successfully rob an area,

00:04:47.877 --> 00:04:51.667
they'll tend to return to that area
and carry on burgling it.

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:54.547
So they learn the layout of the houses,

00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:56.265
the escape routes

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.293
and the local security measures
that are in place.

00:04:59.317 --> 00:05:01.002
And this will continue to happen
