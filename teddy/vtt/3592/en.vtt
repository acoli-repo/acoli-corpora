00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:01.181
Thanks very much.

00:00:01.205 --> 00:00:03.053
I am Hannah Fry, the badass.

00:00:03.077 --> 00:00:04.757
And today I'm asking the question:

00:00:04.781 --> 00:00:06.537
Is life really that complex?

00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:09.886
Now, I've only got nine minutes
to try and provide you with an answer,

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.626
so what I've done
is split this neatly into two parts:

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.003
part one: yes;

00:00:15.027 --> 00:00:17.555
and later on, part two: no.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.123
Or, to be more accurate: no?

00:00:20.147 --> 00:00:21.351
(Laughter)

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:24.381
So first of all, let me try and define
what I mean by "complex."

00:00:24.405 --> 00:00:26.846
Now, I could give you
a host of formal definitions,

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.123
but in the simplest terms,

00:00:28.147 --> 00:00:33.046
any problem in complexity is something
that Einstein and his peers can't do.
