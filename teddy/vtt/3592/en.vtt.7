00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:30.308
using mathematics
to model our social systems.

00:03:30.332 --> 00:03:33.816
And I'm not just talking here
about statistics and computer simulations.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.836
I'm talking about writing down
equations about our society

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.929
that will help us understand
what's going on

00:03:38.953 --> 00:03:42.168
in the same way as with the snooker balls
or the weather prediction.

00:03:42.192 --> 00:03:45.034
And this has come about
because people have begun to realize

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:47.401
that we can use and exploit analogies

00:03:47.425 --> 00:03:51.367
between our human systems
and those of the physical world around us.

00:03:51.938 --> 00:03:53.402
Now, to give you an example:

00:03:53.426 --> 00:03:56.880
the incredibly complex problem
of migration across Europe.

00:03:56.904 --> 00:04:00.236
Actually, as it turns out, when you view
all of the people together,
