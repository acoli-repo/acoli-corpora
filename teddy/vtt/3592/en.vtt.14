If you think about the bird flu epidemic
of a couple of years ago,

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.723
the more people that were infected,
the more people that got infected,

00:07:05.747 --> 00:07:07.335

The next thing he has to do
is pick a riot site.

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:23.898

00:07:25.588 --> 00:07:28.932
What you should know about rioters is,
they're not prepared to travel

00:07:28.956 --> 00:07:30.407
that far from where they live,
