00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.161
leaving out an untouched
great middle region.

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:34.884
Now, this middle region
is where complexity science lies,

00:02:34.908 --> 00:02:37.167
and this is what I mean by complex.

00:02:37.191 --> 00:02:40.716
Now, unfortunately, almost
every single problem you can think of

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.962
to do with human behavior

00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:44.055
lies in this middle region.

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.369
Einstein's got absolutely no idea
how to model the movement of a crowd.

00:02:48.393 --> 00:02:51.194
There are too many people
to look at them all individually

00:02:51.218 --> 00:02:53.090
and too few to treat them as a gas.

00:02:53.114 --> 00:02:56.470
Similarly, people are prone
to annoying things like decisions

00:02:56.494 --> 00:02:58.508
and not wanting to walk into each other,

00:02:58.532 --> 00:03:01.145
which makes the problem
all the more complicated.
