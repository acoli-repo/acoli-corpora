Actually, as it turns out, when you view
all of the people together,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.303
collectively, they behave as though
they're following the laws of gravity.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:07.455
But instead of planets
being attracted to one another,

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:11.689
it's people who are attracted
to areas with better job opportunities,

00:04:11.713 --> 00:04:15.728
higher pay, better quality of life
and lower unemployment.

00:04:15.752 --> 00:04:19.280
And in the same way as people
are more likely to go for opportunities

00:04:19.304 --> 00:04:22.339
close to where they live already --
London to Kent, for example,

00:04:22.363 --> 00:04:24.155
as opposed to London to Melbourne --

00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:28.315
the gravitational effect of planets
far away is felt much less.

00:04:28.997 --> 00:04:31.064
So, to give you another example:
