00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.365
and say where it's come from
or where it's going to end up.

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:02.423
But you can say with pretty good certainty

00:02:02.447 --> 00:02:04.260
whether it will be cloudy tomorrow.

00:02:04.284 --> 00:02:05.442
So that's it.

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:08.149
In Einstein's time,
this is how far science had got.

00:02:08.173 --> 00:02:11.786
We could do really small problems
with a few objects

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.085
with simple interactions,

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.711
or we could do huge problems
with millions of objects

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.058
and simple interactions.

00:02:17.082 --> 00:02:19.019
But what about everything in the middle?

00:02:19.043 --> 00:02:21.736
Well, just seven years
before Einstein's death,

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.418
an American scientist called
Warren Weaver made exactly this point.

00:02:25.442 --> 00:02:29.066
He said that scientific methodology
has gone from one extreme to another,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.161
leaving out an untouched
great middle region.
