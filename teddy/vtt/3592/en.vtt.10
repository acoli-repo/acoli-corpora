00:04:59.317 --> 00:05:01.002
And this will continue to happen

00:05:01.026 --> 00:05:04.207
until local residents and police
ramp up the security,

00:05:04.231 --> 00:05:07.002
at which point, the burglars
will move off elsewhere.

00:05:07.026 --> 00:05:09.834
And it's that balance
between burglars and security

00:05:09.858 --> 00:05:12.895
which creates these dynamic
hot spots of the city.

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.463
As it turns out,
this is exactly the same process

00:05:16.487 --> 00:05:18.729
as how a leopard gets its spots,

00:05:18.753 --> 00:05:21.689
except in the leopard example,
it's not burglars and security,

00:05:21.713 --> 00:05:25.178
it's the chemical process
that creates these patterns

00:05:25.202 --> 00:05:27.197
and something called "morphogenesis."

00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:31.477
We actually know an awful lot
about the morphogenesis of leopard spots.
