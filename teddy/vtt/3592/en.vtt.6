00:02:58.532 --> 00:03:01.145
which makes the problem
all the more complicated.

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:02.872
Einstein also couldn't tell you

00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:05.245
when the next stock market crash
is going to be.

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.033
Einstein couldn't tell you
how to improve unemployment.

00:03:08.057 --> 00:03:09.458
Einstein can't even tell you

00:03:09.482 --> 00:03:12.864
whether the next iPhone
is going to be a hit or a flop.

00:03:12.888 --> 00:03:15.494
So to conclude part one:
we're completely screwed.

00:03:15.518 --> 00:03:20.018
We've got no tools to deal with this,
and life is way too complex.

00:03:20.042 --> 00:03:21.838
But maybe there's hope,

00:03:21.862 --> 00:03:23.396
because in the last few years,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.257
we've begun to see the beginnings
of a new area of science

00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:30.308
using mathematics
to model our social systems.
