00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.416
of violent looting and arson

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.053
for over twenty years.

00:06:03.077 --> 00:06:06.364
It's understandable that, as a society,
we want to try and understand

00:06:06.388 --> 00:06:08.182
exactly what caused these riots,

00:06:08.206 --> 00:06:12.091
but also, perhaps, to equip our police
with better strategies

00:06:12.115 --> 00:06:15.896
to lead to a swifter
resolution in the future.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.276
Now, I don't want to upset
the sociologists here,

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.157
so I absolutely cannot talk about
the individual motivations for a rioter,

00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:25.349
but when you look at
the rioters all together,

00:06:25.373 --> 00:06:28.581
mathematically, you can separate it
into a three-stage process

00:06:28.605 --> 00:06:30.580
and draw analogies accordingly.
