00:08:28.178 --> 00:08:30.191
arrest rioters wherever possible

00:08:30.215 --> 00:08:32.256
and to create a deterrent effect.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.001
And actually, as it turns out,

00:08:37.025 --> 00:08:41.648
this mechanism between the two species,
so to speak, of rioters and police,

00:08:41.672 --> 00:08:44.321
is identical to predators
and prey in the wild.

00:08:44.345 --> 00:08:46.542
So if you can imagine rabbits and foxes,

00:08:46.566 --> 00:08:49.316
rabbits are trying to avoid
foxes at all costs,

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.027
while foxes are patrolling the space,
trying to look for rabbits.

00:08:53.051 --> 00:08:56.405
We actually know an awful lot
about the dynamics of predators and prey.

00:08:56.429 --> 00:09:01.408
We also know a lot about
consumer spending flows.
