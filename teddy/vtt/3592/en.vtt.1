00:00:28.147 --> 00:00:33.046
any problem in complexity is something
that Einstein and his peers can't do.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.310
So, let's imagine --
if the clicker works ... there we go.

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:38.437
Einstein is playing a game of snooker.

00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:41.940
He's a clever chap, so he knows
that when he hits the cue ball,

00:00:41.964 --> 00:00:43.405
he could write you an equation

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:46.557
and tell you exactly where the red ball
is going to hit the sides,

00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:49.020
how fast it's going
and where it's going to end up.

00:00:49.044 --> 00:00:52.513
Now, if you scale these snooker balls
up to the size of the solar system,

00:00:52.537 --> 00:00:54.496
Einstein can still help you.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.765
Sure, the physics changes,

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.071
but if you wanted to know about
the path of the Earth around the Sun,

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:00.828
Einstein could write you an equation
