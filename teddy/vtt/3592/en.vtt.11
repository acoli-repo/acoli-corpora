We actually know an awful lot
about the morphogenesis of leopard spots.

00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:36.145
Maybe we can use this to try and spot
some of the warning signs with burglaries

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.276
and perhaps, also to create
better crime strategies to prevent crime.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.872
There's a group here at UCL

00:05:41.896 --> 00:05:44.721
who are working with
the West Midlands police right now

00:05:44.745 --> 00:05:46.386
on this very question.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.325
I could give you
plenty of examples like this,

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.992
but I wanted to leave you
with one from my own research

00:05:52.016 --> 00:05:53.182
on the London riots.

00:05:53.206 --> 00:05:55.221
Now, you probably
don't need me to tell you

00:05:55.245 --> 00:05:56.812
about the events of last summer,

00:05:56.836 --> 00:05:59.866
where London and the UK saw
the worst sustained period

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.416
of violent looting and arson
