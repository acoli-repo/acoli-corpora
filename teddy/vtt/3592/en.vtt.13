00:06:28.605 --> 00:06:30.580
and draw analogies accordingly.

00:06:30.604 --> 00:06:33.781
So, step one: let's say
you've got a group of friends.

00:06:33.805 --> 00:06:35.680
None of them are involved in the riots,

00:06:35.704 --> 00:06:39.386
but one of them walks past
a Foot Locker which is being raided,

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.923
and goes in and bags himself
a new pair of trainers.

00:06:41.947 --> 00:06:46.036
He texts one of his friends and says,
"Come on down to the riots."

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.481
So his friend joins him,

00:06:47.505 --> 00:06:50.662
and then the two of them text
more of their friends, who join them,

00:06:50.686 --> 00:06:52.267
and text more of their friends

00:06:52.291 --> 00:06:54.665
and more and more, and so it continues.

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:59.272
This process is identical to the way
that a virus spreads through a population.

00:06:59.296 --> 00:07:02.396
If you think about the bird flu epidemic
of a couple of years ago,
