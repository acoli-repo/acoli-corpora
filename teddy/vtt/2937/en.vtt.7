00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.280
and that worn down telomere
sends a signal to the cells.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.536
"The DNA is no longer being protected."

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.576
It sends a signal. Time to die.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.056
So, end of story.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.960
Well, sorry, not so fast.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.736
It can't be the end of the story,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.256
because life hasn't died
off the face of the earth.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.896
So I was curious:

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.016
if such wear and tear is inevitable,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.256
how on earth does Mother Nature make sure

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.720
we can keep our chromosomes intact?

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.240
Now, remember that little
pond scum critter Tetrahymena?
