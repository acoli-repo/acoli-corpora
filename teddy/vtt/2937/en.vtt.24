00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:05.240
the lower was her telomerase
and the shorter were her telomeres.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.856
So we had discovered something unheard of:

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.736
the more chronic stress you are under,
the shorter your telomeres,

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:20.416
meaning the more likely you were
to fall victim to an early disease span

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.160
and perhaps untimely death.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.336
Our findings meant

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.296
and the way we respond to these events
