I was most curious about:

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.495
those bundles of DNA
in our cells called chromosomes.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.936
And it was because I was curious
about the very ends of chromosomes,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.976
known as telomeres.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.696
Now, when I started my quest,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.616
all we knew was that they helped
protect the ends of chromosomes.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.336
It was important when cells divide.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.736
It was really important,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.856
but I wanted to find out
what telomeres consisted of,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.656
and for that, I needed a lot of them.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.256
And it so happens
that cute little Tetrahymena
