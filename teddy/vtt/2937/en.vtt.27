00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.096
OK, now our initial curiosity
became infectious.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.696
Thousands of scientists
from different fields

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.216
added their expertise
to telomere research,

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.160
and the findings have poured in.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.840
It's up to over 10,000
scientific papers and counting.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.336
So several studies
rapidly confirmed our initial finding

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.120
that yes, chronic stress
is bad for telomeres.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.096
And now many are revealing

00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:00.016
that we have more control
over this particular aging process
