that we have more control
over this particular aging process

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.856
than any of us could ever have imagined.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.096
A few examples:

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.256
a study from the University
of California, Los Angeles

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:13.696
of people who are caring
for a relative with dementia, long-term,

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:19.176
and looked at their caregiver's
telomere maintenance capacity

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.416
and found that it was improved

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.256
by them practicing a form of meditation

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.160
for as little as 12 minutes
a day for two months.

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.376
Attitude matters.
