00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.216
It is just one of those facts of life.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.616
Every time the cell divides
and the DNA is copied,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.656
some of that DNA from the ends
gets worn down and shortened,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.976
some of that telomere DNA.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.176
And think about it

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.656
like the protective caps
at the ends of your shoelace.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.216
And those keep the shoelace,
or the chromosome, from fraying,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.576
and when that tip
gets too short, it falls off,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.280
and that worn down telomere
sends a signal to the cells.
