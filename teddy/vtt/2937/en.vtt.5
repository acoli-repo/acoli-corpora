00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.416
so my heart cells can keep a steady beat,

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.656
which I assure you
they're not doing right now,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.576
and my immune cells

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.496
can fight off bacteria and viruses,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.376
and our brain cells
can save the memory of our first kiss

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.880
and keep on learning throughout life.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.336
But there is a glitch
in the way DNA is copied.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.216
It is just one of those facts of life.
