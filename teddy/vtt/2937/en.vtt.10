OK, now, that's
an incredibly hopeful message

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.400
for us humans to be
receiving from pond scum,

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.656
because it turns out

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.496
that as we humans age,
our telomeres do shorten,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.536
and remarkably,
that shortening is aging us.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.736
Generally speaking,
the longer your telomeres,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.000
the better off you are.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.376
It's the overshortening of telomeres

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.800
that leads us to feel and see
signs of aging.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.296
My skin cells start to die

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.176
and I start to see fine lines, wrinkles.
