00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.296
I saw beyond the genes and the chromosomes

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.256
into the lives of the real people
we were studying.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.496
And I'm a mom myself,

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.456
and at that moment,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.296
I was struck by the image of these women

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.440
dealing with a child with a condition

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.200
very difficult to deal with,
often without help.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.096
And such women, simply,

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.910
often look worn down.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.696
So was it possible their telomeres
were worn down as well?
