00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.320
that make up our adult body.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.840
And some of those cells
have to divide thousands of times.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.496
In fact, even as I stand here before you,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.616
all throughout my body,
cells are furiously replenishing

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.160
to, well, keep me
standing here before you.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.496
So every time a cell divides,
all of its DNA has to be copied,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.136
all of the coding DNA
inside of those chromosomes,

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.696
because that carries
the vital operating instructions

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.736
that keep our cells in good working order,

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.416
so my heart cells can keep a steady beat,
