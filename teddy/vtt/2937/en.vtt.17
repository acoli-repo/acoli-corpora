00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.376
Now, health span is the number
of years of your life

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.176
when you're free of disease,
you're healthy, you're productive,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.336
you're zestfully enjoying life.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.056
Disease span, the opposite of health span,

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.816
is the time of your life
spent feeling old and sick and dying.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.416
So the real question becomes,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.200
OK, if I can't guzzle telomerase,

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.096
do I have control
over my telomeres' length

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.856
and hence my well-being, my health,

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.480
without those downsides of cancer risks?
