that they were resilient to stress.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.616
Somehow they were able
to experience their circumstances

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.136
not as a threat day in and day out

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.816
but as a challenge,

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.896
and this has led to a very important
insight for all of us:

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.696
we have control over the way we age

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.240

OK, now our initial curiosity
became infectious.
