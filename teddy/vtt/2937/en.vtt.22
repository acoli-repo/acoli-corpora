00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.696
So was it possible their telomeres
were worn down as well?

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.376
So our collective curiosity
went into overdrive.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.296
Elissa selected for our first study
a group of such caregiving mothers,

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.496
and we wanted to ask:
What's the length of their telomeres

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.096
compared with the number of years
that they have been caregiving

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.896
for their child with a chronic condition?

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.696
So four years go by

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.856
and the day comes
when all the results are in,

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.576
and Elissa looked down

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.120
and literally gasped,
