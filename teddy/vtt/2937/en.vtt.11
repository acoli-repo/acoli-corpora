and I start to see fine lines, wrinkles.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.040
Hair pigment cells die.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.000
You start to see gray.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.360
Immune system cells die.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.856
You increase your risks of getting sick.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.496
In fact, the cumulative research
from the last 20 years

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.696
has made clear that telomere attrition

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.256
is contributing to our risks
of getting cardiovascular diseases,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.096
Alzheimer's, some cancers and diabetes,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.840
the very conditions many of us die of.
