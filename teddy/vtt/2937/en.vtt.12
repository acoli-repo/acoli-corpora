00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.000
And so we have to think about this.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.296
What is going on?

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.056
This attrition,

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.056
we look and we feel older, yeah.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.616
Our telomeres are losing
the war of attrition faster.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.096
And those of us who feel youthful longer,

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.776
it turns out our telomeres
are staying longer

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.096
for longer periods of time,

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.896
extending our feelings of youthfulness

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.416
and reducing the risks
of all we most dread

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.480
as the birthdays go by.
