Attitude matters.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.776
If you're habitually a negative thinker,

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.536
you typically see a stressful situation
with a threat stress response,

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.016
meaning if your boss wants to see you,

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.376
you automatically think,
"I'm about to be fired,"

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.976
and your blood vessels constrict,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.336
and your level of the stress
hormone cortisol creeps up,

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.896
and then it stays up,

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:56.856
and over time, that persistently
high level of the cortisol

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.776
actually damps down your telomerase.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.560
Not good for your telomeres.
