00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.296
and the way we respond to these events

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.400
can change how you
maintain your telomeres.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.800
So telomere length wasn't
just a matter of age counted in years.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.936
Elissa's question to me,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.880
back when she first came to my lab,
indeed had been a life-and-death question.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.056
Now, luckily, hidden
in that data there was hope.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.696
We noticed that some mothers,

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.856
despite having been carefully caring
for their children for many years,

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.480
had been able to maintain their telomeres.
