00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.560
Not good for your telomeres.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.456
On the other hand,

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:09.456
if you typically see something stressful
as a challenge to be tackled,

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.936
then blood flows to your heart
and to your brain,

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.656
and you experience a brief
but energizing spike of cortisol.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.216
And thanks to that habitual
"bring it on" attitude,

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.280
your telomeres do just fine.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.800
So ...

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.000
What is all of this telling us?
