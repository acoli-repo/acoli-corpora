yes, nudging up telomerase
does decrease the risks of some diseases,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.616
but it also increases the risks
of certain and rather nasty cancers.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.416
So even if you could buy
that Costco-sized bottle of telomerase,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:49.176
and there are many websites
marketing such dubious products,

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.760
the problem is you could
nudge up your risks of cancers.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.840
And we don't want that.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.136
