00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.200
and we discovered
cells do have something else.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.936
It was a previously undreamed-of enzyme

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.496
that could replenish,
make longer, telomeres,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.320
and we named it telomerase.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.456
And when we removed
our pond scum's telomerase,

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.920
their telomeres ran down and they died.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.296
So it was thanks
to their plentiful telomerase

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.800
that our pond scum critters never got old.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.320
OK, now, that's
an incredibly hopeful message
