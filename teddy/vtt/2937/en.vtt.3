00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.256
And it so happens
that cute little Tetrahymena

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.296
has a lot of short linear chromosomes,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.936
around 20,000,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.320
so lots of telomeres.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.896
And I discovered that telomeres
consisted of special segments

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.616
of noncoding DNA right
at the very ends of chromosomes.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.816
But here's a problem.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.656
Now, we all start life as a single cell.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.416
It multiples to two.
Two becomes four. Four becomes eight,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.656
and on and on to form
the 200 million billion cells

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.320
that make up our adult body.
