00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.275
is one of the most easily
preventable diseases in the world.

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:33.272
An effective vaccine against it

00:00:33.272 --> 00:00:36.638
has been available for more
than half a century,

00:00:36.638 --> 00:00:39.912
but many of the kids involved
in the Disneyland outbreak

00:00:39.912 --> 00:00:41.886
had not been vaccinated

00:00:41.886 --> 00:00:44.138
because their parents were afraid

00:00:44.138 --> 00:00:47.157
of something allegedly even worse:

00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:48.875
autism.

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:52.658
But wait -- wasn't the paper
that sparked the controversy

00:00:52.658 --> 00:00:54.981
about autism and vaccines

00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:56.978
debunked, retracted,

00:00:56.978 --> 00:00:59.450
and branded a deliberate fraud

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.158
by the British Medical Journal?
