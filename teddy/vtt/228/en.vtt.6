00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.211
clinicians told one story

00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:04.763
about what autism is
and how it was discovered,

00:03:04.763 --> 00:03:07.573
but that story turned out to be wrong,

00:03:07.573 --> 00:03:09.384
and the consequences of it

00:03:09.384 --> 00:03:13.285
are having a devastating impact
on global public health.

00:03:13.285 --> 00:03:16.814
There was a second,
more accurate story of autism

00:03:16.814 --> 00:03:19.430
which had been lost and forgotten

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.410
in obscure corners
of the clinical literature.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.427
This second story tells us everything
about how we got here

00:03:26.427 --> 00:03:29.032
and where we need to go next.

00:03:29.352 --> 00:03:33.996
The first story starts with a child
psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital
