to broaden the criteria for diagnosis

00:10:01.964 --> 00:10:05.981
to reflect the diversity of what
they called "the autism spectrum."

00:10:05.981 --> 00:10:08.559
In the late '80s and early 1990s,

00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:10.857
their changes went into effect,

00:10:10.857 --> 00:10:13.226
swapping out Kanner's narrow model

00:10:13.226 --> 00:10:16.801
for Asperger's broad and inclusive one.

00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:19.472
These changes weren't
happening in a vacuum.

00:10:19.472 --> 00:10:23.326
By coincidence, as Lorna and Judith
worked behind the scenes

00:10:23.326 --> 00:10:25.160
to reform the criteria,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:30.176
people all over the world were seeing
an autistic adult for the first time.
