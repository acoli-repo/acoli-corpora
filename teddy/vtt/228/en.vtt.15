00:07:25.486 --> 00:07:30.176
In other words, these children
didn't fit into nice, neat boxes,

00:07:30.176 --> 00:07:31.871
as Judith put it,

00:07:31.871 --> 00:07:33.752
and they saw lots of them,

00:07:33.752 --> 00:07:37.537
way more than Kanner's monolithic model
would have predicted.

00:07:37.537 --> 00:07:41.252
At first, they were at a loss
to make sense of their data.

00:07:41.252 --> 00:07:44.380
How had no one noticed
these children before?

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.899
But then Lorna came upon a reference
to a paper that had been published

00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:50.554
in German in 1944,

00:07:50.554 --> 00:07:52.899
the year after Kanner's paper,

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:54.617
and then forgotten,

00:07:54.617 --> 00:07:57.194
buried with the ashes of a terrible time

00:07:57.194 --> 00:08:00.445
that no one wanted to remember
or think about.
