00:03:29.352 --> 00:03:33.996
The first story starts with a child
psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital

00:03:33.996 --> 00:03:35.946
named Leo Kanner.

00:03:35.946 --> 00:03:39.499
In 1943, Kanner published a paper

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:44.212
describing 11 young patients
who seemed to inhabit private worlds,

00:03:44.212 --> 00:03:46.302
ignoring the people around them,

00:03:46.302 --> 00:03:48.462
even their own parents.

00:03:48.462 --> 00:03:50.737
They could amuse themselves for hours

00:03:50.737 --> 00:03:53.384
by flapping their hands
in front of their faces,

00:03:53.384 --> 00:03:55.358
but they were panicked by little things

00:03:55.358 --> 00:03:58.970
like their favorite toy
being moved from its usual place

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.977
without their knowledge.
