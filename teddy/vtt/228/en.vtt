Just after Christmas last year,

00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:07.320
132 kids in California got the measles

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.333
by either visiting Disneyland

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:12.282
or being exposed to someone
who'd been there.

00:00:12.282 --> 00:00:15.486
The virus then hopped the Canadian border,

00:00:15.486 --> 00:00:18.922
infecting more than
100 children in Quebec.

00:00:18.922 --> 00:00:21.871
One of the tragic things
about this outbreak

00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:27.490
is that measles, which can be fatal
to a child with a weakened immune system,

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.275
is one of the most easily
preventable diseases in the world.
