00:01:57.696 --> 00:02:01.365
as if you could catch it
from another kid at Disneyland.

00:02:01.365 --> 00:02:02.967
So what's going on?

00:02:02.967 --> 00:02:06.194
If it isn't vaccines, what is it?

00:02:06.194 --> 00:02:10.165
If you ask the folks down at
the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta

00:02:10.165 --> 00:02:11.860
what's going on,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.370
they tend to rely on phrases like
"broadened diagnostic criteria"

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.134
and "better case finding"

00:02:18.134 --> 00:02:20.711
to explain these rising numbers.

00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:22.731
But that kind of language

00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:25.680
doesn't do much to allay
the fears of a young mother

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.324
who is searching her
two-year-old's face for eye contact.
