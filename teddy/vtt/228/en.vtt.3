00:01:27.488 --> 00:01:31.180
autism was considered
an incredibly rare condition.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.500
The few psychologists and pediatricians
who'd even heard of it

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.217
figured they would get through
their entire careers

00:01:37.217 --> 00:01:39.724
without seeing a single case.

00:01:40.364 --> 00:01:43.602
For decades, the prevalence estimates
remained stable

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:46.853
at just three or four children in 10,000.

00:01:46.853 --> 00:01:48.919
But then, in the 1990s,

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:51.380
the numbers started to skyrocket.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.608
Fundraising organizations
like Autism Speaks

00:01:54.608 --> 00:01:57.696
routinely refer to autism as an epidemic,

00:01:57.696 --> 00:02:01.365
as if you could catch it
from another kid at Disneyland.
