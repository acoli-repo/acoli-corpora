00:10:56.459 --> 00:11:01.589
the first easy-to-use clinical tests
for diagnosing autism were introduced.

00:11:01.939 --> 00:11:06.629
You no longer had to have a connection
to that tiny circle of experts

00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:09.207
to get your child evaluated.

00:11:09.207 --> 00:11:11.320
The combination of "Rain Man,"

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.499
the changes to the criteria,
and the introduction of these tests

00:11:15.499 --> 00:11:17.774
created a network effect,

00:11:17.774 --> 00:11:21.304
a perfect storm of autism awareness.

00:11:21.304 --> 00:11:24.322
The number of diagnoses started to soar,

00:11:24.322 --> 00:11:29.990
just as Lorna and Judith predicted,
indeed hoped, that it would,

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.106
enabling autistic people
and their families
