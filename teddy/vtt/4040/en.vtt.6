00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.170
on paper, that was enough thrust.

00:03:01.711 --> 00:03:04.844
And then we did what
I'm about to show you now,

00:03:04.868 --> 00:03:07.030
and I still love watching this one.

00:03:09.612 --> 00:03:14.248
This was our first six-second,
reasonably coherent flight.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.504
(Applause)

00:03:19.983 --> 00:03:23.005
That was the point where
this endeavor went from:

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:25.115
"I'm really not sure
this is going to work,"

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.640
to: "Oh my god, it does work!"

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:28.259
From there on we then refined it,

00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:30.146
but we carried on falling over a lot.
