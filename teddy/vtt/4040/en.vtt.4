00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:02.538
That bit was good.

00:02:03.014 --> 00:02:04.397
The harness --

00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:06.322
a nice idea but it didn't really work,

00:02:06.346 --> 00:02:07.802
as you'll see now.

00:02:08.112 --> 00:02:10.874
This whole journey was very much
about trying things --

00:02:10.898 --> 00:02:11.972
(Laughter)

00:02:11.996 --> 00:02:13.795
Yeah, it really didn't work, did it?

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.571
Trying things and learning
by failing at them most of the time.

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:21.956
And that included failing by falling over.

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:25.027
If you notice, we've got
five engines here --

00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:27.614
not to be put off by the fact
one was in maintenance,

00:02:27.638 --> 00:02:28.793
still had a go.

00:02:28.817 --> 00:02:29.824
(Laughter)

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:32.511
And then I pinched a fuel line.
