00:04:29.276 --> 00:04:31.296
I think I land in this one.

00:04:31.662 --> 00:04:34.586
Well, I don't think anybody's going
to go down to Walmart

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.495
or take the kids to school
in any of this stuff for a while,

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:40.385
but the team at Gravity are building
some awesome technology

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.725
that's going to make
this look like child's play.

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.098
We're working on some things

00:04:44.122 --> 00:04:46.856
that will seek to bring
this unusual experience of flight

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.922
to a wider audience, beyond the events
and displays we're doing.

00:04:49.946 --> 00:04:52.428
We're even starting to look
for pilots two and three,

00:04:52.452 --> 00:04:53.697
if there's any volunteers.

00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:54.919
I've got this vision.

00:04:54.943 --> 00:04:57.571
It sounds audacious,
but let's just stick it out there,

00:04:57.595 --> 00:04:59.873
that one day maybe we can
rise up above a beach,

00:04:59.897 --> 00:05:02.619
fly up and down the coastline
of it, rise up a bit higher,
