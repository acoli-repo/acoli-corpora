00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:30.146
but we carried on falling over a lot.

00:03:31.093 --> 00:03:34.180
Falling over, like I say, is definitely
the best way to learn.

00:03:34.204 --> 00:03:37.902
After a while, we starting
really refining the layout of all of this.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.259
And you'll see,
that's stability and control --

00:03:40.283 --> 00:03:42.113
there's no wires there or anything --

00:03:42.137 --> 00:03:44.571
that's a combination of us
refining the technology,

00:03:44.595 --> 00:03:47.798
including with a Tupperware box
on the back for the electronics

00:03:47.822 --> 00:03:50.233
and actually learning
the balance and control.

00:03:52.073 --> 00:03:54.726
I'm now going to save your ears
for the next short piece

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.909
and talk over it.

00:03:55.933 --> 00:03:58.516
After a while, the jet engine
noise is a bit annoying.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.942
This is only a few weeks ago.

00:03:59.966 --> 00:04:02.891
You can see the stability and control
is really quite nice,
