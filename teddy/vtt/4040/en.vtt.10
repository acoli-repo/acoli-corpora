00:04:59.897 --> 00:05:02.619
fly up and down the coastline
of it, rise up a bit higher,

00:05:02.643 --> 00:05:05.911
with some of the safety kit
we're working on to make this achievable.

00:05:05.935 --> 00:05:08.661
Then over the horizon comes
a Hercules with the ramp down.

00:05:08.685 --> 00:05:10.750
As it comes past,
you start picking up speed

00:05:10.774 --> 00:05:12.229
and see if we can intercept --

00:05:12.253 --> 00:05:14.903
from the rear, not the front,
that would be a mistake --

00:05:14.927 --> 00:05:16.561
and then try and land in the back.

00:05:16.585 --> 00:05:19.570
And as I say, that's a little
way off at the moment.

00:05:19.594 --> 00:05:23.514
But this is also, if I take
a big step back from this,

00:05:23.538 --> 00:05:26.125
this is also a very
personal journey for me.

00:05:27.352 --> 00:05:29.149
Back to that lovely photo,

00:05:29.173 --> 00:05:31.338
or photo in a picture.
