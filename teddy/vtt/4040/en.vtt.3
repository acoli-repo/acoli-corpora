00:01:28.258 --> 00:01:30.710
that we did probably damage quite badly.

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:32.420
You get an idea of the thrust here,

00:01:32.444 --> 00:01:35.070
when I try to hold them horizontally
and somewhat fail.

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:36.968
That's around 50 kilos of thrust there.

00:01:37.402 --> 00:01:39.071
We were quite impressed with that.

00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:40.937
We thought we were getting somewhere.

00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:43.498
So there's only one sensible way
to go from there:

00:01:44.393 --> 00:01:45.563
you get four.

00:01:45.587 --> 00:01:47.444
(Laughter)

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:53.054
I have to say, I still like
watching these back.

00:01:53.078 --> 00:01:56.083
So then we thought well, let's try
and spread the load a bit.

00:01:56.107 --> 00:01:57.999
The legs are designed to take the load,

00:01:58.023 --> 00:01:59.982
so why don't we spread it out a bit?
