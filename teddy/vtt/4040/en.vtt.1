00:00:28.783 --> 00:00:31.468
And that's the journey I'd like
to share with you now.

00:00:31.492 --> 00:00:34.710
The starting hypothesis was one
of the human mind and body,

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:37.128
which, as you've seen
for the last few days here,

00:00:37.152 --> 00:00:38.971
is an amazing construct.

00:00:38.995 --> 00:00:42.661
What if you augmented
that wonderful machine

00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:44.163
with just the right technology?

00:00:44.187 --> 00:00:46.522
If you approach flight
in that kind of real way,

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:47.798
where could you get to?

00:00:47.822 --> 00:00:51.189
So my training partner here
back in London, Denton,

00:00:51.213 --> 00:00:54.217
is doing a much better job
of that kind of stuff than me.

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:55.901
Guess what? It's London.

00:00:55.925 --> 00:00:58.589
The idea was that you augment that.

00:00:58.613 --> 00:01:00.167
And so, how do you augment that?
