Michael Browning: engineer,

00:00:03.978 --> 00:00:05.538
innovator --

00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:06.751
inventor, really --

00:00:06.775 --> 00:00:08.014
and inspiring father.

00:00:08.594 --> 00:00:11.142
He had a passion for flight,
as you can kind of sense

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:15.178
from that rather dubious
1970s office-leaving present.

00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.502
And some 40 years after that was created,

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:20.093
a small group of us got together

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.297
to have a go,

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:26.678
a run at the whole challenge of flight
that inspired people for years,

00:00:26.702 --> 00:00:28.759
and do it in a very different kind of way.

00:00:28.783 --> 00:00:31.468
And that's the journey I'd like
to share with you now.
