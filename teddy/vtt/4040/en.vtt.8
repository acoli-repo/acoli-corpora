You can see the stability and control
is really quite nice,

00:04:02.915 --> 00:04:06.365
and I'd like to think this somewhat
validates that starting hypothesis,

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:11.101
that the human mind and body,
if properly augmented in that way,

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:12.911
can achieve some pretty cool stuff.

00:04:12.935 --> 00:04:14.508
I mean, like I said:

00:04:14.532 --> 00:04:17.496
I'm not thinking about where
I'm moving my arms at that stage.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.554
I'm looking at the objective
of where I want to get to,

00:04:20.578 --> 00:04:22.377
and a bit like riding a bike,

00:04:22.401 --> 00:04:24.203
my arms are just doing their thing.

00:04:24.227 --> 00:04:25.792
It's a very strange experience.

00:04:25.816 --> 00:04:27.492
So where is all this headed?

00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:29.252
I'll talk over this landing --

00:04:29.276 --> 00:04:31.296
I think I land in this one.
