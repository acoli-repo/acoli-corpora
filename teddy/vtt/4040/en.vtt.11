00:05:31.362 --> 00:05:34.255
Sadly, my father took
his own life when I was 15,

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:37.247
and left an awful lot
of unfulfilled ambition.

00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:38.895
He was a wonderful inventor,

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.300
a maverick creator.

00:05:40.324 --> 00:05:43.266
And I'd just like to think,
if it was possible,

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.606
if he was looking down,

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.811
he would be --

00:05:45.835 --> 00:05:48.852
he'd certainly be smiling at some
of the things we've done here,

00:05:48.876 --> 00:05:50.034
I think.

00:05:50.058 --> 00:05:51.339
So, it's a tribute to him.

00:05:51.363 --> 00:05:52.536
Thank you very much.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.256

I'm probably more nervous

00:05:58.795 --> 00:06:00.333
about doing the demo after this.
