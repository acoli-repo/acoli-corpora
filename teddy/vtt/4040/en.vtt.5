00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:32.511
And then I pinched a fuel line.

00:02:32.535 --> 00:02:35.261
So again, good learning.
We learned not to do that again.

00:02:35.285 --> 00:02:36.485
This was a blind alley.

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:37.536
(Laughter)

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.121
This was three on each arm --

00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:40.311
that was ridiculous.

00:02:40.335 --> 00:02:42.296
That was 70 kilos on each arm.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.913
Again, struck that one off.

00:02:43.937 --> 00:02:45.584
(Laughter)

00:02:45.608 --> 00:02:49.070
But we were starting to make
some really quite convincing progress,

00:02:49.094 --> 00:02:51.428
just enough to make you
believe that maybe --

00:02:51.452 --> 00:02:52.757
maybe we could get there.

00:02:53.398 --> 00:02:55.107
You can see, look -- tantalizing.

00:02:55.587 --> 00:02:59.436
The model of one on each leg
and two on each arm,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.170
on paper, that was enough thrust.
