00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
All of these solutions

derive their origins from the text of the book,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
but once the book designer has read the text,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
then he has to be an interpreter

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and a translator.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
This story was a real puzzle.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
This is what it's about.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
("Intrigue and murder among 16th century Ottoman court painters.")

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
(Laughter)

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
All right, so I got a collection of the paintings together
