00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And the reason he went is because

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
he had a fear of his body image,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and he wanted to explore what was underlying that.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
For me, it was simply an excuse to design a book

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
that you could literally take the pants off of.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
But when you do,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
you don't get what you expect.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
You get something that goes much deeper than that.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And David especially loved this design

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
because at book signings, which he does a lot of,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
he could take a magic marker and do this.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
