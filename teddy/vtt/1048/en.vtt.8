00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and the Dietrich story is pictures, and so we did this.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So there you are.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Pure content and pure form, side by side.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
No fighting, ladies.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
("What's a Jurassic Park?")

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Now, what is the story here?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Someone

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
is re-engineering dinosaurs

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
by extracting their DNA

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
from prehistoric amber.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Genius!
