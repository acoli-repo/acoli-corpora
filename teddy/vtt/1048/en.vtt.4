Soon, it had occurred to me what my job was.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
My job was to ask this question:

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
"What do the stories look like?"

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Because that is what Knopf is.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It is the story factory, one of the very best in the world.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We bring stories to the public.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The stories can be anything,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and some of them are actually true.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
But they all have one thing in common:

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
They all need to look like something.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
They all need a face.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
