00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I was able to put this theory to the test

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
on two books that I was working on for Knopf.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
The first was Katharine Hepburn's memoirs,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and the second was a biography of Marlene Dietrich.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Now the Hepburn book

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
was written in a very conversational style,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
The Dietrich book was an observation

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
by her daughter; it was a biography.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So the Hepburn story is words

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and the Dietrich story is pictures, and so we did this.
