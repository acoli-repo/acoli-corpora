00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Genius!

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
(Laughter)

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Now, luckily for me,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I live and work in New York City,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
where there are plenty of dinosaurs.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
(Laughter)

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I went to the Museum of Natural History,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and I checked out the bones, and I went to the gift shop,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and I bought a book.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And I was particularly taken with this page of the book,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and more specifically the lower right-hand corner.
