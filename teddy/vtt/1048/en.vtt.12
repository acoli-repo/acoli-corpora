00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And what I ended up with was a graphic representation

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
of us seeing this animal coming into being.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
We're in the middle of the process.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And then I just threw some typography on it.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Very basic stuff,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
slightly suggestive of public park signage.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
(Laughter)

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Everybody in house loved it,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and so off it goes to the author.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And even back then,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Michael was on the cutting edge.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
("Michael Crichton responds by fax:")
