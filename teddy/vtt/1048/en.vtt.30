00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And the object itself invited exploration

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
interaction, consideration

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and touch.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
This debuted at number two

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
on the New York Times Best Seller list.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
This is unheard of,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
both for us the publisher, and the author.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
We're talking a 900-page book

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
that is as weird as it is compelling,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
and featuring a climactic scene

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
in which a horde of tiny people

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and cause a German Shepherd to explode.
