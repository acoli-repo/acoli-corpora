00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
All right, so I got a collection of the paintings together

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and I looked at them and I deconstructed them

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and I put them back together.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And so, here's the design, right?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And so here's the front and the spine, and it's flat.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
But the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Ahh! We come upon them,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
the clandestine lovers. Let's draw them out.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Huhh! They've been discovered by the sultan.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
He will not be pleased.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Huhh! And now the sultan is in danger.
