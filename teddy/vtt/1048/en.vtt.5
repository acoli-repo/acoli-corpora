00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
They all need a face.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Why? To give you a first impression

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
of what you are about to get into.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
A book designer gives form to content,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
but also

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
manages a very careful balance between the two.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Now, the first day

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
of my graphic design training at Penn State University,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the teacher, Lanny Sommese, came into the room

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and wrote the word "Apple" underneath,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and he said, "OK. Lesson one. Listen up."
