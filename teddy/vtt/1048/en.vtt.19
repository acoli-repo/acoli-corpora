but his coworkers did an intervention and they said,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
"You are going to rehab, or you will be fired and you will die."

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Now to me, this was always going to be a typographic solution,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
what I would call the opposite of Type 101.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
What does that mean?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Usually on the first day of Introduction to Typography,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
you get the assignment of, select a word

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and make it look like what it says it is. So that's Type 101, right?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Very simple stuff.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
This is going to be the opposite of that.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I want this book to look like it's lying to you,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
desperately and hopelessly, the way an alcoholic would.
