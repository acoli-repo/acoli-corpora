00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But upon arrival there,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
in the fall of 1986, and doing a lot of interviews,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I found that the only thing I was offered

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
was to be Assistant to the Art Director at Alfred A. Knopf,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
a book publisher.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Now I was stupid,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
but not so stupid that I turned it down.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I had absolutely no idea

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
what I was about to become part of,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and I was incredibly lucky.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Soon, it had occurred to me what my job was.
