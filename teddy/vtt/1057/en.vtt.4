These kids in Pakistan don't go to school.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
They are lucky. They already have a job.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And that job is that they go around and pick up syringes

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
from the back of hospitals,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
wash them, and in the course of this,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
obviously picking them up they injure themselves.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And then they repackage them and sell them out on markets

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
for literally more money

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
than a sterile syringe in the first place, which is quite bizarre.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
In an interesting photo, their father, while we were talking to him,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
picked up a syringe and pricked his finger --

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I don't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end --

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and immediately whipped out a box of matches,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
lit one, and burned the blood off the end of his finger,
