00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which are being delivered with only 2 syringes in a public hospital in India.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And over the course of half an hour, not one syringe

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
was filmed being unwrapped.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
They started with two and they ended with two.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And you'll see, just now, a nurse coming back to the tray,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
which is their sort of modular station,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and dropping the syringe she's just used

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So you can imagine the scale of this problem.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And in fact in India alone, 62 percent

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
of all injections given

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
are unsafe.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
These kids in Pakistan don't go to school.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
They are lucky. They already have a job.
