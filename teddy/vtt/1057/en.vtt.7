00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And these are used with traces of blood visible.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So we need a better product. And we need better information.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And I think, if I can just borrow this camera,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I was going to show you my invention,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
which I came up with.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So, it's a normal-looking syringe.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
You load it up in the normal way. This is made

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
You give the injection and then put it down.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
If someone then tries to reuse it,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
it locks and breaks afterwards.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
It's very, very simple. Thank you.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
