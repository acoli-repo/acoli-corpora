Twenty-five-and-a-quarter years ago I read

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
a newspaper article which said

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that one day syringes would be

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the transmission of AIDS.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I thought this was unacceptable. So I decided to do something about it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Sadly, it's come true. Malaria, as we all know,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
kills approximately one million people a year.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The reuse of syringes now exceeds that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and kills 1.3 million people a year.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
