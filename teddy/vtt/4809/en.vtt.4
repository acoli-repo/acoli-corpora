Situations involving probability are
notoriously bad for applying heuristics.

00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:09.053
For instance, say you were to roll a die
with four green faces and two red faces

00:02:09.053 --> 00:02:10.736
twenty times.

00:02:10.736 --> 00:02:13.694
You can choose one of 
the following sequences of rolls,

00:02:13.694 --> 00:02:17.018
and if it shows up, 
you'll win $25.

00:02:17.018 --> 00:02:18.909
Which would you pick?

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:23.838
In one study, 65% of the participants
who were all college students

00:02:23.838 --> 00:02:26.290
chose sequence B

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.885
even though A is shorter
and contained within B,

00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:31.884
in other words, more likely.
