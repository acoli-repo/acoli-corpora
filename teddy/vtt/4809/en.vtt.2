00:00:57.254 --> 00:01:00.113
But if you think about it,
this makes no sense.

00:01:00.113 --> 00:01:04.205
The odds and outcomes in both rounds
are exactly the same.

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:08.704
So why does the second round
seem much scarier?

00:01:08.704 --> 00:01:13.214
The answer lies in a phenomenon
known as loss aversion.

00:01:13.214 --> 00:01:15.106
Under rational economic theory,

00:01:15.106 --> 00:01:18.846
our decisions should follow a simple
mathematical equation

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:23.055
that weighs the level of risk
against the amount at stake.

00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:25.317
But studies have found 
that for many people,

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:29.120
the negative psychological impact
we feel from losing something

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.972
is about twice as strong as the positive
impact of gaining the same thing.
