to raise the prices 
that people are willing to pay.

00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:34.559
So, if heuristics lead to 
all these wrong decisions,

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:36.998
why do we even have them?

00:03:36.998 --> 00:03:39.772
Well, because they can be quite effective.

00:03:39.772 --> 00:03:41.444
For most of human history,

00:03:41.444 --> 00:03:45.724
survival depended on making quick
decisions with limited information.

00:03:45.724 --> 00:03:49.751
When there's no time to logically
analyze all the possibilities,

00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:52.775
heuristics can sometimes save our lives.

00:03:52.775 --> 00:03:56.605
But today's environment requires
far more complex decision-making,

00:03:56.605 --> 00:04:01.180
and these decisions are more biased
by unconscious factors than we think,
