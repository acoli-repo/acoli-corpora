00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.972
is about twice as strong as the positive
impact of gaining the same thing.

00:01:34.972 --> 00:01:39.765
Loss aversion is one cognitive bias
that arises from heuristics,

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:43.884
problem-solving approaches based on
previous experience and intuition

00:01:43.884 --> 00:01:46.529
rather than careful analysis.

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:50.165
And these mental shortcuts can lead
to irrational decisions,

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:51.459
not like falling in love

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.414
or bungee jumping off a cliff,

00:01:53.414 --> 00:01:57.834
but logical fallacies that can easily
be proven wrong.

00:01:57.834 --> 00:02:03.591
Situations involving probability are
notoriously bad for applying heuristics.
