00:02:54.742 --> 00:03:00.279
while the second was asked whether
he died before or after age 140.

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:02.719
Both numbers were obviously way off,

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:07.257
but when the students were then asked
to guess the actual age at which he died,

00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:09.996
the first group's answers averaged to 50

00:03:09.996 --> 00:03:13.536
while the second group's averaged to 67.

00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:16.817
Even though the clearly wrong information
in the initial questions

00:03:16.817 --> 00:03:18.848
should have been irrelevant,

00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:21.746
it still affected the students' estimates.

00:03:21.746 --> 00:03:24.615
This is an example 
of the anchoring effect,

00:03:24.615 --> 00:03:27.539
and it's often used in marketing
and negotiations

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:31.111
to raise the prices 
that people are willing to pay.
