Let's say you're on a game show.

00:00:08.873 --> 00:00:12.375
You've already earned $1000 
in the first round

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:14.851
when you land on the bonus space.

00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:16.657
Now, you have a choice.

00:00:16.657 --> 00:00:20.131
You can either take 
a $500 bonus guaranteed

00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:22.537
or you can flip a coin.

00:00:22.537 --> 00:00:25.857
If it's heads, you win $1000 bonus.

00:00:25.857 --> 00:00:29.246
If it's tails, you get no bonus at all.

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:34.269
In the second round, you've earned $2000
when you land on the penalty space.
