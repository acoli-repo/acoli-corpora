00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:31.884
in other words, more likely.

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:35.132
This is what's called 
a conjunction fallacy.

00:02:35.132 --> 00:02:37.425
Here, we expect to see more green rolls,

00:02:37.425 --> 00:02:41.607
so our brains can trick us into picking
the less likely option.

00:02:41.607 --> 00:02:45.822
Heuristics are also terrible 
at dealing with numbers in general.

00:02:45.822 --> 00:02:49.393
In one example, students were split
into two groups.

00:02:49.393 --> 00:02:54.742
The first group was asked whether
Mahatma Gandhi died before or after age 9,

00:02:54.742 --> 00:03:00.279
while the second was asked whether
he died before or after age 140.
