00:03:56.605 --> 00:04:01.180
and these decisions are more biased
by unconscious factors than we think,

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.558
affecting everything from health 
and education

00:04:03.558 --> 00:04:06.172
to finance and criminal justice.

00:04:06.172 --> 00:04:08.482
We can't just shut off 
our brain's heuristics,

00:04:08.482 --> 00:04:11.187
but we can learn to be aware of them.

00:04:11.187 --> 00:04:13.629
When you come to 
a situation involving numbers,

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:14.859
probability,

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.723
or multiple details,

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:18.040
pause for a second

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.348
and consider that the intuitive answer
might not be the right one after all.
