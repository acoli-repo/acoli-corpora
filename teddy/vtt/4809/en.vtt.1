00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:34.269
In the second round, you've earned $2000
when you land on the penalty space.

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:36.384
Now you have another choice.

00:00:36.384 --> 00:00:39.220
You can either take a $500 loss,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.171
or try your luck at the coin flip.

00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:44.372
If it's heads, you lose nothing,

00:00:44.372 --> 00:00:49.069
but if it's tails, you lose $1000 instead.

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:50.493
If you're like most people,

00:00:50.493 --> 00:00:54.284
you probably chose to take
the guaranteed bonus in the first round

00:00:54.284 --> 00:00:57.254
and flip the coin in the second round.

00:00:57.254 --> 00:01:00.113
But if you think about it,
this makes no sense.
