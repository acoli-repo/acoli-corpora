00:00:00.913 --> 00:00:02.832
When we look at the night sky,

00:00:02.874 --> 00:00:04.834
we see a vast cosmos

00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:08.963
filled with stars and galaxies and dust,

00:00:08.963 --> 00:00:11.716
a cosmos teeming with luminous phenomena.

00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:16.012
So we've all heard some version
of that famous Carl Sagan line,

00:00:16.054 --> 00:00:17.805
"We are made of star stuff."

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:20.308
And it's true, we are.

00:00:20.892 --> 00:00:24.687
And that makes it easy to believe
that what matters is what's visible --

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:27.648
us, the trees, the stars --

00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:30.860
because it helps us feel connected
to everything that we can see.
