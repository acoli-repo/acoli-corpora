Hello, how is everyone feeling?

00:00:02.756 --> 00:00:04.636
(Cheers)

00:00:04.676 --> 00:00:06.516
Are you ready to solve climate change?

00:00:06.556 --> 00:00:07.676
(Cheers)

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:09.116
Good.

00:00:09.156 --> 00:00:11.196
Do you know what a pettawat hour is?

00:00:11.956 --> 00:00:16.756
Yeah, it's a unit of energy like
kilowatt hour or megawatt hour.

00:00:17.276 --> 00:00:19.476
I've been a climate activist since age 11

00:00:19.516 --> 00:00:20.996
and I studied engineering,

00:00:21.036 --> 00:00:23.276
and so I was familiar with those terms.

00:00:23.316 --> 00:00:27.276
Kilowatt, megawatt,
even gigawatt and terawatt.

00:00:27.636 --> 00:00:29.676
But I had never heard of a petawatt hour

00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:32.156
until I wrote a book
on climate change solutions.
