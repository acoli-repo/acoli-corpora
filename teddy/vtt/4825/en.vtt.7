00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.589
That makes eleven trips total,

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:35.460
the smallest number needed
to get everyone across safely.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.062
The solution that involves sending both
lions on the first step works similarly,

00:03:40.062 --> 00:03:43.619
and also takes eleven crossings.

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:47.331
The six animals escape unharmed
from the fire just in time

00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:50.249
and begin their new lives 
across the river.

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:52.679
Of course, now that the danger's passed,

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:57.121
it remains to be seen how long their
unlikely alliance will last.
