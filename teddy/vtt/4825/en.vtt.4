00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.939
and the wildebeest go back to the right.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.987
Now we have the same five options,

00:02:03.987 --> 00:02:07.137
but with one lion 
already on the left bank.

00:02:07.137 --> 00:02:10.298
If two wildebeest go,
the one that stays will get eaten,

00:02:10.298 --> 00:02:12.417
and if one of each animal goes,

00:02:12.417 --> 00:02:14.977
the wildebeest on the raft
will be outnumbered

00:02:14.977 --> 00:02:17.728
as soon as it reaches the other side.

00:02:17.728 --> 00:02:19.078
So that's a dead end,

00:02:19.078 --> 00:02:20.978
which means that at the third crossing,

00:02:20.978 --> 00:02:23.646
only the two lions can go.

00:02:23.646 --> 00:02:25.067
One gets dropped off,

00:02:25.067 --> 00:02:27.457
leaving two lions on the left bank.

00:02:27.457 --> 00:02:30.457
The third lion takes the raft back to
the right bank
