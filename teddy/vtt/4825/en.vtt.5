00:02:27.457 --> 00:02:30.457
The third lion takes the raft back to
the right bank

00:02:30.457 --> 00:02:33.018
where the wildebeest are waiting.

00:02:33.018 --> 00:02:34.238
What now?

00:02:34.238 --> 00:02:37.297
Well, since we've got two lions waiting
on the left bank,

00:02:37.297 --> 00:02:40.877
the only option is for two wildebeest
to cross.

00:02:40.877 --> 00:02:44.767
Next, there's no sense in two wildebeest
going back,

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:47.339
since that just reverses the last step.

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:48.909
And if two lions go back,

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.919
they'll outnumber the wildebeest
on the right bank.

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:55.748
So one lion and one wildebeest
take the raft back

00:02:55.748 --> 00:02:58.800
leaving us with one of each animal
on the left bank

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.959
and two of each on the right.
