Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself.

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:02.815
Answer in: 3

00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:03.845
Answer in: 2

00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:04.796
Answer in: 1

00:01:04.796 --> 00:01:06.911
If you feel stuck on a problem like this,

00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:10.816
try listing all the decisions you can make
at each point,

00:01:10.816 --> 00:01:14.195
and the consequences each choice
leads to.

00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:18.006
For instance, there are five options
for who goes across first:

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:19.186
one wildebeest,

00:01:19.186 --> 00:01:20.186
one lion,

00:01:20.186 --> 00:01:21.286
two wildebeest,

00:01:21.286 --> 00:01:22.275
two lions,

00:01:22.275 --> 00:01:23.736
or one of each.

00:01:23.736 --> 00:01:25.245
If one animal goes alone,

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:27.587
it'll just have to come straight back.

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.475
And if two wildebeest cross first,

00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:32.456
the remaining one will immediately
get eaten.
