00:00:27.488 --> 00:00:30.995
and needs as least one lion
or wildebeest on board

00:00:30.995 --> 00:00:33.351
to row it across the river.

00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:35.674
There's just one problem.

00:00:35.674 --> 00:00:39.806
If the lions ever outnumber the
wildebeest on either side of the river,

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.444
even for a moment,

00:00:41.444 --> 00:00:45.426
their instincts will kick in,
and the results won't be pretty.

00:00:45.426 --> 00:00:50.075
That includes the animals in the boat
when it's on a given side of the river.

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:54.255
What's the fastest way for all six animals
to get across

00:00:54.255 --> 00:00:57.974
without the lions stopping for dinner?

00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:01.555
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself.
