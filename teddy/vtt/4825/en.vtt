00:00:07.234 --> 00:00:10.094
As a wildfire rages through
the grasslands,

00:00:10.094 --> 00:00:14.595
three lions and three wildebeest
flee for their lives.

00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:16.125
To escape the inferno,

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:21.224
they must cross over to the left bank
of a crocodile-infested river.

00:00:21.224 --> 00:00:24.310
Fortunately, there happens
to be a raft nearby.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.488
It can carry up to two animals at a time,

00:00:27.488 --> 00:00:30.995
and needs as least one lion
or wildebeest on board
