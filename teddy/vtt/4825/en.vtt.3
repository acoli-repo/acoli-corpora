00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:32.456
the remaining one will immediately
get eaten.

00:01:32.456 --> 00:01:34.976
So those options are all out.

00:01:34.976 --> 00:01:36.597
Sending two lions,

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:38.267
or one of each animal,

00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:42.506
can actually both lead to solutions
in the same number of moves.

00:01:42.506 --> 00:01:45.672
For the sake of time,
we'll focus on the second one.

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:47.637
One of each animal crosses.

00:01:47.637 --> 00:01:51.082
Now, if the wildebeest stays 
and the lion returns,

00:01:51.082 --> 00:01:53.537
there will be three lions
on the right bank.

00:01:53.537 --> 00:01:56.457
Bad news for the two remaining wildebeest.

00:01:56.457 --> 00:01:59.250
So we need to have the lion
stay on the left bank

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.939
and the wildebeest go back to the right.
