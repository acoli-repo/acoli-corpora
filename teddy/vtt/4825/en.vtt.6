00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.959
and two of each on the right.

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.149
Again, there's no point in sending 
the lion-wildebeest pair back,

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:07.981
so the next trip should be either
a pair of lions

00:03:07.981 --> 00:03:10.098
or a pair of wildebeest.

00:03:10.098 --> 00:03:13.889
If the lions go, they'd eat the wildebeest
on the left, so they stay,

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.760
and the two wildebeest cross instead.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.840
Now we're quite close because the
wildebeest are all where they need to be

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.770
with safety in numbers.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.677
All that's left is for that one lion
to raft back

00:03:25.677 --> 00:03:29.390
and bring his fellow lions over
one by one.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.589
That makes eleven trips total,
