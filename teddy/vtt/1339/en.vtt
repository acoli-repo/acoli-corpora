You know, my favorite part of being a dad

00:00:02.952 --> 00:00:06.211
is the movies I get to watch.

00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:08.092
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids,

00:00:08.092 --> 00:00:10.688
and when my daughter was four,

00:00:10.688 --> 00:00:13.578
we got to watch "The Wizard of Oz" together.

00:00:13.578 --> 00:00:16.977
It totally dominated her imagination for months.

00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:20.195
Her favorite character was Glinda, of course.

00:00:20.195 --> 00:00:22.255
It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:23.909
and carry a wand.

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:26.318
But you watch that movie enough times,

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:27.751
and you start to realize how unusual it is.

00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:30.603
Now we live today, and are raising our children,
