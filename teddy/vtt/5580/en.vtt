00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:11.479
The talented young herbalist named Xu Xian
was in trouble.

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:13.422
It should have been a victorious momentâ€“

00:00:13.422 --> 00:00:16.212
he had just opened his very 
own medicine shop.

00:00:16.212 --> 00:00:19.132
But he bought his supplies from 
his former employer,

00:00:19.132 --> 00:00:22.252
and the resentful man 
sold him rotten herbs.

00:00:22.252 --> 00:00:25.722
As Xu Xian wondered what to do with this 
useless inventory,

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:27.892
patients flooded into his shop.

00:00:27.892 --> 00:00:29.502
A plague had stricken the city,

00:00:29.502 --> 00:00:31.752
and he had nothing to treat them.
