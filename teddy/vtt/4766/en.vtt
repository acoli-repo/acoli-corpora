00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:08.217
"Hi, Bob."

00:00:08.217 --> 00:00:11.237
"Morning, Kelly. The tulips looks great."

00:00:11.237 --> 00:00:14.966
Have you ever wondered
how your dog experiences the world?

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.581
Here's what she sees.

00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:18.696
Not terribly interesting.

00:00:18.696 --> 00:00:22.266
But what she smells,
that's a totally different story.

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.381
And it begins at her wonderfully 
developed nose.

00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:28.400
As your dog catches 
the first hints of fresh air,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.725
her nose's moist, spongy outside helps
capture any scents the breeze carries.
