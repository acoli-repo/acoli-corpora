00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:31.386
alerting them to something or someone
approaching long before you see them.

00:03:31.386 --> 00:03:33.841
Where we see and hear something
at a single moment,

00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:38.092
a dog smells an entire story
from start to finish.

00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:41.075
In some of the best examples
of canine-human collaboration,

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:44.414
dogs help us by sharing
and reacting to those stories.

00:03:44.414 --> 00:03:47.368
They can respond with kindness
to people in distress,

00:03:47.368 --> 00:03:49.131
or with aggression to threats

00:03:49.131 --> 00:03:51.928
because stress and anger 
manifest as a cloud of hormones

00:03:51.928 --> 00:03:54.507
recognizable to the dog's nose.

00:03:54.507 --> 00:03:55.792
With the proper training,

00:03:55.792 --> 00:03:58.196
they can even alert us 
to invisible threats

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.925
ranging from bombs to cancer.
