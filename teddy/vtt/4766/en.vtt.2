00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:01.140
This second airflow enters a region

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.423
filled with highly specialized 
olfactory receptor cells,

00:01:04.423 --> 00:01:08.534
several hundred millions of them,
compaired to our five million.

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:12.391
And unlike our clumsy way of breathing 
in and out through the same passage,

00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:15.313
dogs exhale through slits 
at the side of their nose,

00:01:15.313 --> 00:01:19.491
creating swirls of air that help
draw in new odor molecules

00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:24.148
and allow odor concentration to build up
over mulitple sniffs.

00:01:24.148 --> 00:01:27.716
But all that impressive nasal architecture
wouldn't be much help

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:32.562
without something to process the loads
of information the nose scoops up.
