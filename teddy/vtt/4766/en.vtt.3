without something to process the loads
of information the nose scoops up.

00:01:32.562 --> 00:01:36.996
And it turns out that the olfactory system
dedicated to proessing smells

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:42.655
takes up many times more relative
brain area in dogs than in humans.

00:01:42.655 --> 00:01:44.487
All of this allows dogs to distinguish

00:01:44.487 --> 00:01:48.155
and remember a staggering 
variety of specific scents

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:53.416
at concentrations up to 100 million times
less than what our noses can detect.

00:01:53.416 --> 00:01:56.082
If you can smell a spritz of perfume
in a small room,

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:59.780
a dog would have no trouble smelling it
in an enclosed stadium

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.542
and distinguishing its ingredients,
to boot.
