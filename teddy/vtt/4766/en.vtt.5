00:02:27.967 --> 00:02:31.506
called the vomeronasal organ,
above the roof of the mouth,

00:02:31.506 --> 00:02:36.033
detects the hormones all animals,
Including humans, naturally release.

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:38.310
It lets dogs identify potential mates,

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.550
or distinguish between friendly 
and hostile animals.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.250
It alerts them to our various 
emotional states,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.396
and it can even tell them 
when someone is pregnant or sick.

00:02:48.396 --> 00:02:51.117
Because olfaction is more primal 
than other senses,

00:02:51.117 --> 00:02:54.400
bypassing the thalamus to connect
directly to the brain structures

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.993
involving emotion and instinct,

00:02:56.993 --> 00:03:01.625
we might even say a dog's perception 
is more immediate and visceral than ours.
