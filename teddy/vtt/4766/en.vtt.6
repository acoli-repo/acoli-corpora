00:02:56.993 --> 00:03:01.625
we might even say a dog's perception 
is more immediate and visceral than ours.

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:04.165
But the most amazing thing about 
your dog's nose

00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:06.343
is that it can traverse time.

00:03:06.343 --> 00:03:09.340
The past appears in tracks 
left by passersby,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.977
and by the warmth 
of a recently parked car

00:03:11.977 --> 00:03:16.887
where the residue of where you've been
and what you've done recently.

00:03:16.887 --> 00:03:18.807
Landmarks like fire hydrants and trees

00:03:18.807 --> 00:03:21.884
are aromatic bulletin boards 
carrying messages of who's been by,

00:03:21.884 --> 00:03:23.330
what they've been eating,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.198
and how they're feeling.

00:03:25.198 --> 00:03:26.771
And the future is in the breeze,

00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:31.386
alerting them to something or someone
approaching long before you see them.
