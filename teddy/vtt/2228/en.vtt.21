Again, I think these systems,
these microbial ecosystems,

00:10:32.955 --> 00:10:34.431
are immensely resilient.

00:10:35.126 --> 00:10:37.804
We just cannot go too far down this path.

00:10:39.087 --> 00:10:42.834
I personally believe that sustained
observation of our oceans and our planet

00:10:42.858 --> 00:10:45.977
is the moral imperative
for our generation of scientists.

00:10:46.706 --> 00:10:48.920
We are bearing witness

00:10:48.944 --> 00:10:53.564
to the changes that are being inflicted
upon our natural communities,

00:10:53.588 --> 00:10:55.008
and by doing so,

00:10:55.032 --> 00:11:00.804
it provides us the opportunity
to adapt and enact global change,
