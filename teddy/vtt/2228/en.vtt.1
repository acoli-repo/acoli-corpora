00:00:27.186 --> 00:00:30.537
they'd fit snug inside the Pacific,
with room to spare.

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:32.742
It's a massive ecosystem,

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:36.345
from the blues of the open ocean
to the green of the continental margins.

00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:38.736
In this place,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.086
I get to study the base of the food web:

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.260
plankton.

00:00:42.838 --> 00:00:45.910
Now, in my research,

00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:49.735
and really in the field
of microbial oceanography as a whole,

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:52.248
there's a theme that has emerged,

00:00:52.272 --> 00:00:53.862
and that theme is "change."

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:59.357
These microbial ecosystems
are changing in real and measurable ways,

00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:01.237
and it is not that hard to see it.
