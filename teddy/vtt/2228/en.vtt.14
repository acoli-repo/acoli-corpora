00:06:59.933 --> 00:07:02.167
It's in the middle of the Pacific Ocean,

00:07:02.191 --> 00:07:05.279
in the center of this vast,
swirling system of currents

00:07:05.303 --> 00:07:07.691
that we call the North Pacific
Subtropical Gyre.

00:07:08.638 --> 00:07:10.845
It's our largest ocean ecosystem.

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:13.913
It's four times the size
of the Amazon rain forest.

00:07:13.937 --> 00:07:16.048
It is warm, in a good way.

00:07:16.072 --> 00:07:17.287
It is blue water,

00:07:17.311 --> 00:07:20.368
it's absolutely the type of place
you want to dive in and swim.

00:07:20.392 --> 00:07:22.356
You cannot do that off of research boats,

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.436
because, you know, sharks. Google it.

00:07:24.912 --> 00:07:28.599
(Laughter)

00:07:28.623 --> 00:07:30.752
This is a beautiful place.
