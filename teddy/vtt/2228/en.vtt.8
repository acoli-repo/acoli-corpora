00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.277
Here's some poor students.

00:04:00.301 --> 00:04:01.302
(Laughter)

00:04:01.326 --> 00:04:03.966
I've hidden their faces
to protect their identities.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.636
(Laughter)

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.395
This is a challenging place.

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.649
So this is hard-won data
I'm about to talk about, OK?

00:04:11.673 --> 00:04:12.680
(Laughter)

00:04:12.704 --> 00:04:15.822
So by combining all of our data
with our collaborators,

00:04:15.846 --> 00:04:20.974
we had 20-year time series
of toxins and phytoplankton cell counts.

00:04:20.998 --> 00:04:25.038
And that allowed us to understand
the patterns of these blooms

00:04:25.062 --> 00:04:27.093
and to build models to predict them.

00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:29.422
And what we found

00:04:29.446 --> 00:04:35.266
was that the risk of harmful algal blooms
was tightly linked to aspects of climate.
