00:07:59.649 --> 00:08:01.384
It's not just a place of discovery,

00:08:01.408 --> 00:08:04.213
but the important part about time series

00:08:04.237 --> 00:08:06.342
are that they provide us
a sense of history,

00:08:06.366 --> 00:08:07.934
a sense of context.

00:08:08.586 --> 00:08:10.063
And in 30 years of data,

00:08:10.087 --> 00:08:13.766
it's allowed us to separate
the seasonal change

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.588
and see the emergence
of humanity's fingerprints

00:08:16.612 --> 00:08:17.974
on the natural world.

00:08:19.427 --> 00:08:22.300
There's another iconic
time series in Hawaii,

00:08:22.324 --> 00:08:23.801
and that is the Keeling Curve.

00:08:23.825 --> 00:08:25.971
I hope you have all seen this.

00:08:25.995 --> 00:08:29.948
This time series has documented
the rapid increase in carbon dioxide

00:08:29.972 --> 00:08:31.330
in the atmosphere.
