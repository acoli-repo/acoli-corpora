00:11:29.548 --> 00:11:32.039
(Laughter)

00:11:32.341 --> 00:11:34.001
Microbes matter.

00:11:34.025 --> 00:11:36.454
These organisms are small,

00:11:36.478 --> 00:11:38.152
abundant, ancient,

00:11:38.176 --> 00:11:41.535
and they are critical to sustaining
our population and our planet.

00:11:42.433 --> 00:11:45.568
Yet we are on track to double
our carbon dioxide emissions

00:11:45.592 --> 00:11:47.021
in the next 50 years,

00:11:47.045 --> 00:11:48.941
so the analogy that I use for that

00:11:48.965 --> 00:11:52.825
is like we are eating
like we're still in our 20s,

00:11:52.849 --> 00:11:55.078
assuming there will be no consequences --

00:11:55.102 --> 00:11:56.404
but I'm a woman in her 40s,

00:11:56.428 --> 00:12:00.407
I know there are consequences
for my fuel consumption. Right?
