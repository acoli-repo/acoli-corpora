00:11:56.428 --> 00:12:00.407
I know there are consequences
for my fuel consumption. Right?

00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:02.457
(Laughter)

00:12:02.481 --> 00:12:04.252
These oceans are very much alive.

00:12:04.276 --> 00:12:06.779
These ecosystems have not collapsed.

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:10.989
Well, except for the Arctic,
we can talk about that.

00:12:11.013 --> 00:12:12.432
(Laughter)

00:12:12.456 --> 00:12:15.878
But the sustained observations
that I've shared with you today,

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:18.510
the work of generations of scientists,

00:12:18.534 --> 00:12:21.806
are pointing us to take
better care of our oceans

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.341
and to nurture the microbes
that sustain us.

00:12:25.335 --> 00:12:26.512
And on that note,

00:12:26.536 --> 00:12:29.306
I want to end with a quote
from one of my heroes,

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.562
Jane Lubchenco.
