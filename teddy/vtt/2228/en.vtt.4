that come in a variety of shapes
and sizes and colors and metabolisms.

00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:10.801
There are hundreds of thousands
in a single milliliter of seawater.

00:02:10.825 --> 00:02:14.332
You are definitely swimming with them

00:02:14.356 --> 00:02:16.730
They produce oxygen, they consume CO2,

00:02:16.754 --> 00:02:18.586
and they form the base of the food web

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.785
on which every other form
of ocean life is reliant.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.007
Now, I've spent about 500 days
of my scientific life at sea,

00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:31.288
and a lot more in front
of a computer or in the lab,
