00:03:29.043 --> 00:03:34.607
and, much like some people in our lives,
toxicity varies among the plankton.

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:35.632
(Laughter)

00:03:35.656 --> 00:03:36.807
Alright?

00:03:36.831 --> 00:03:38.728
So, to get around these challenges,

00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:42.370
we combined satellite remote sensing

00:03:42.394 --> 00:03:44.061
with drones and gliders,

00:03:44.085 --> 00:03:46.038
regular sampling of the surf zone

00:03:46.062 --> 00:03:48.699
and a lot of time at sea

00:03:48.723 --> 00:03:51.707
in small boats off the Oregon coast.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:54.935
And I don't know if many of you
have had the opportunity to do that,

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.169
but it is not easy.

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:58.506
[Even oceanographers get seasick]

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.277
Here's some poor students.
