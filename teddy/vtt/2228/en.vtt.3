00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:30.429
and, beware, focus on the love.

00:01:30.453 --> 00:01:32.347
Right? That's where I'm coming from.

00:01:32.728 --> 00:01:36.331
So the first thing to know

00:01:36.355 --> 00:01:39.712
is that the forests
of the sea are microbial.

00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:43.037
And what I mean by that
is that, by and large,

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:46.410
plants in the open ocean are microscopic,

00:01:46.434 --> 00:01:49.450
and they are much more abundant
than we realize.

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:53.987
So I'm going to show you
some mug shots of these organisms

00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:56.011
that I've collected over the years.

00:01:56.035 --> 00:01:59.105
These are the lowest rungs
of the ocean food web.
