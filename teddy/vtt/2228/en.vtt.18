00:08:58.841 --> 00:09:02.746
It represents people's lives over 30 years
trying to make these measurements,

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.944
and it took 30 years
to be able to see this.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.374
CO2 rises in the atmosphere,

00:09:07.398 --> 00:09:08.731
CO2 rises in the ocean.

00:09:08.755 --> 00:09:09.984
That's the red line.

00:09:10.777 --> 00:09:12.428
A consequence of that

00:09:12.452 --> 00:09:15.341
is a fundamental change
in the chemistry of seawater,

00:09:15.365 --> 00:09:17.184
a decline in pH --

00:09:17.208 --> 00:09:18.439
pH is on a log scale,

00:09:18.463 --> 00:09:19.969
here's your blue line.

00:09:19.993 --> 00:09:23.666
So we've seen a 30 percent decline
in pH in the surface ocean

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.267
in this time series.

00:09:25.589 --> 00:09:29.300
Now that has impacts for organisms
that need to feed, build shells,

00:09:29.324 --> 00:09:32.345
that changes growth rates,
metabolic interactions,
