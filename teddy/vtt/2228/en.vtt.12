00:05:59.666 --> 00:06:01.997
That bodes really well
for harmful algal blooms

00:06:02.021 --> 00:06:03.983
and poorly for ecosystem health.

00:06:05.427 --> 00:06:08.429
Now, you may not care about shellfish,

00:06:08.453 --> 00:06:12.676
but these changes impact
economically important fisheries,

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.270
like crab and salmon,

00:06:14.294 --> 00:06:17.573
and they can impact the health
of marine mammals like whales.

00:06:17.597 --> 00:06:19.540
And that might matter a little bit more.

00:06:19.564 --> 00:06:20.914
That might resonate.

00:06:22.454 --> 00:06:28.001
So, there's your doomsday tale
for the margins of the Pacific.

00:06:28.854 --> 00:06:31.645
Actually, these are really
resilient ecosystems.
