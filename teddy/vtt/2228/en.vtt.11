00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.297
the frequency and severity of these events
are only going to get worse,

00:05:30.321 --> 00:05:32.423
right along with these warm anomalies.

00:05:32.883 --> 00:05:34.152
And, to illustrate that,

00:05:35.492 --> 00:05:40.405
2014 was probably one of the worst
harmful algal blooms in Oregon history.

00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:45.216
It was also the hottest year
in the modern climate record at that time,

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.184
that is until 2015,

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.843
2016,

00:05:50.867 --> 00:05:53.703
2017, 2018.

00:05:53.727 --> 00:05:57.205
In fact, the five hottest years
in the modern climate record

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:58.760
have been the last five.

00:05:59.666 --> 00:06:01.997
That bodes really well
for harmful algal blooms
