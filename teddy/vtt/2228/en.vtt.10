00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.751
These are the reds
you're seeing in this plot,

00:05:01.775 --> 00:05:02.949
warm anomalies,

00:05:02.973 --> 00:05:05.064
strong positive indices of the PDO.

00:05:05.758 --> 00:05:08.553
And when we have
these changes in circulation

00:05:08.577 --> 00:05:10.409
and changes in temperature,

00:05:10.433 --> 00:05:13.146
the risk of harmful
algal blooms is increased,

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.949
but also salmon recruitment has decreased,

00:05:15.973 --> 00:05:19.220
and we see intrusions
of invasive species like green crab.

00:05:19.805 --> 00:05:23.178
So these are ecological
and economic impacts of climate.

00:05:24.535 --> 00:05:26.826
Now, if our models are right,

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.297
the frequency and severity of these events
are only going to get worse,
