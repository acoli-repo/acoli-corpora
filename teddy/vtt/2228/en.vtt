00:00:00.844 --> 00:00:02.642
I'm a biological oceanographer.

00:00:03.698 --> 00:00:08.325
I have the absolute privilege
of studying microbial lives

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.287
in the Pacific Ocean.

00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:12.287
So we'll talk about microbes in a minute,

00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:14.485
but I first want to give you
a sense of place,

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.169
a sense of scale.

00:00:16.193 --> 00:00:19.797
The Pacific Ocean is our largest,
deepest ocean basin.

00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:23.155
It covers 60 million square miles.

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.875
If you took all the continents
and you put them together

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:27.162
in a little Pangaea 2.0,

00:00:27.186 --> 00:00:30.537
they'd fit snug inside the Pacific,
with room to spare.
