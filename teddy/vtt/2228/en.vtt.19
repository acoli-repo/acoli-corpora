00:09:29.324 --> 00:09:32.345
that changes growth rates,
metabolic interactions,

00:09:32.369 --> 00:09:34.242
and it doesn't just impact plankton --

00:09:34.266 --> 00:09:36.813
it impacts ecosystems
as large as coral reefs.

00:09:38.294 --> 00:09:41.453
Now one of the things we've been able
to show in this time series

00:09:41.477 --> 00:09:43.302
is this is just skimming the surface.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.472
Increases in CO2 and a decline in pH

00:09:47.496 --> 00:09:50.651
are measured over the top 500 meters
of the water column.

00:09:51.738 --> 00:09:54.703
I really find that to be profound.

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:58.754
This is genuinely one of the most
remote places on our planet,

00:09:58.778 --> 00:10:02.222
and we've impacted the top 500 meters
of the water column.
