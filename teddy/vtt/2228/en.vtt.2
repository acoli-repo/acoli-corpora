00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:01.237
and it is not that hard to see it.

00:01:02.586 --> 00:01:05.292
Oceans cover 70 percent of our planet,

00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:08.442
so ocean change is planetary change,

00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.006
and it all starts with microbes.

00:01:11.568 --> 00:01:16.163
Now, I have two vignettes
to share with you,

00:01:16.187 --> 00:01:21.163
and these are meant to be
love stories to microbes.

00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:24.942
But I'll be honest
that there's an aspect of it

00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:28.194
that's just a total bummer,

00:01:28.218 --> 00:01:30.429
and, beware, focus on the love.
