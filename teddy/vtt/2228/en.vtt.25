Jane Lubchenco.

00:12:31.992 --> 00:12:33.960
And this slide is appropriate.

00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:39.110
Jane has said that the oceans
are not too big to fail,

00:12:39.991 --> 00:12:41.984
nor are they too big to fix,

00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:46.142
but the oceans are too big to ignore.

00:12:47.983 --> 00:12:49.134
Thank you.

00:12:49.158 --> 00:12:52.515
(Applause)
