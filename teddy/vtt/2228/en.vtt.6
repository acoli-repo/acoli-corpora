00:02:58.331 --> 00:03:01.087
And here, for 10 years,
among other things,

00:03:01.111 --> 00:03:05.468
I studied the uplifting topic
of harmful algal blooms.

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:09.112
These are blooms
of toxin-producing phytoplankton

00:03:09.136 --> 00:03:13.674
that can contaminate food webs
and accumulate in shellfish and fish

00:03:13.698 --> 00:03:15.841
that are harvested for human consumption.

00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:20.813
We were trying to understand
why they bloom, where they bloom,

00:03:20.837 --> 00:03:22.132
when they bloom,

00:03:22.156 --> 00:03:24.132
so we could manage these harvests

00:03:24.156 --> 00:03:25.575
and protect human health.

00:03:26.178 --> 00:03:29.019
Now, the problem
is the ocean's a moving target

00:03:29.043 --> 00:03:34.607
and, much like some people in our lives,
toxicity varies among the plankton.
