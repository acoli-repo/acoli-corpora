00:07:28.623 --> 00:07:30.752
This is a beautiful place.

00:07:31.427 --> 00:07:34.241
And here, since October of 1988,

00:07:34.265 --> 00:07:38.852
generations of researchers
have made these monthly pilgrimages.

00:07:38.876 --> 00:07:42.273
We study the biology, the chemistry,
the physics of the open ocean.

00:07:42.297 --> 00:07:45.407
We've measured the temperature
from the surface to the seafloor.

00:07:45.928 --> 00:07:48.407
We've tracked the currents,
traced the waves.

00:07:49.026 --> 00:07:52.234
People have discovered new organisms here.

00:07:52.258 --> 00:07:54.959
People have created vast genomic libraries

00:07:54.983 --> 00:07:56.316
that have revolutionized

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.625
what we think about the diversity
of marine microorganisms.

00:07:59.649 --> 00:08:01.384
It's not just a place of discovery,
