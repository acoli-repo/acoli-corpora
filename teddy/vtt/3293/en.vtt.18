00:08:59.853 --> 00:09:01.306
and had an epiphany and said,

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.826
"Gosh, the teachers sold their stock.
We'd better be nice to the kids."

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.262
No. That didn't happen.

00:09:06.971 --> 00:09:10.952
And despite a decade
of several high-profile divestitures

00:09:10.976 --> 00:09:12.760
in private prison stock in the US,

00:09:12.784 --> 00:09:14.489
the stock has continued to climb.

00:09:14.513 --> 00:09:18.600
The stock over that same period
has outperformed the market.

00:09:19.941 --> 00:09:21.197
And the biggest issue is,

00:09:21.221 --> 00:09:24.818
we went from a set of conscious
investors owning the stock

00:09:24.842 --> 00:09:29.608
to it potentially being owned by investors
who don't care about these issues

00:09:29.632 --> 00:09:31.955
and don't care what you think
about these issues.
