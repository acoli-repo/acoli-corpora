but to improve
the environment and society.

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:06.612
Imagine what a greener
and better world this would be.

00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:08.588
Now, why? Why would an investor bother?

00:03:08.612 --> 00:03:11.536
And at first, blush I'm with you:
Why would an investor care?

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.903
Because if doing well on ESG issues --

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:16.712
environmental, social
and governance issues --

00:03:16.736 --> 00:03:19.401
was just an act of good
corporate citizenship,

00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:22.350
then I agree, investors would not care.

00:03:22.374 --> 00:03:23.817
But the good news,

00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:27.019
and perhaps the saving grace
for our collective futures,

00:03:27.043 --> 00:03:30.757
is that it's so much more than
an act of good corporate citizenship.
