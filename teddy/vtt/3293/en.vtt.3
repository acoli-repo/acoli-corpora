00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:32.398
and you're sitting there
with a mouthful of Doritos --

00:01:32.422 --> 00:01:33.483
(Laughter)

00:01:33.507 --> 00:01:34.661
that just moments ago,

00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:37.653
you had snuck out of the tent
to pull down from the bear hang,

00:01:37.677 --> 00:01:39.075
because you had the munchies.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:40.570
That fear.

00:01:41.245 --> 00:01:42.963
And in that moment, you are praying,

00:01:42.987 --> 00:01:46.373
"Oh Lord, please let this bear
be passing through."

00:01:46.397 --> 00:01:49.229
That bear is not passing through!

00:01:49.253 --> 00:01:52.017
That bear made a detour for you.

00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:54.042
Bears like Doritos!

00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:55.198
(Laughter)

00:01:55.222 --> 00:01:57.526
Activists like money.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.514
Some activists also like Doritos,
but they definitely want money.
