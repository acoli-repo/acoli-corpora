00:05:29.915 --> 00:05:31.527
to behave like Adidas.

00:05:31.551 --> 00:05:33.258
And herein lies the challenge.

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.863
There's a growing group of investors,
call them "conscious investors."

00:05:37.887 --> 00:05:40.657
Conscious investors care about ESG issues.

00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:45.978
And they talk a lot about
engaging management on ESG issues.

00:05:46.002 --> 00:05:48.647
But they don't actually get
management to make changes

00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:51.455
that will improve
the environment and society.

00:05:52.078 --> 00:05:55.654
And this is where conscious investors
can take a page from the playbook

00:05:55.678 --> 00:05:57.609
of the activist investors,

00:05:57.633 --> 00:06:01.550
because the activist investors have no
issues getting management to make changes.
