00:07:28.596 --> 00:07:30.496
They got to eight percent, came out,

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.276
and pushed Whole Foods
to sell itself to Amazon,

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.349
and not because Barry wanted
same-day delivery of his organic Doritos.

00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:38.404
(Laughter)

00:07:38.998 --> 00:07:40.984
He wanted to make some money.

00:07:41.008 --> 00:07:43.798
Now, the CEO of Whole Foods,
John Mackey, and the board

00:07:43.822 --> 00:07:48.030
did not want to sell themselves to Amazon,

00:07:48.054 --> 00:07:50.747
because that would be
the prime example of selling out.

00:07:51.275 --> 00:07:53.352
But in the end, they caved.

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:56.457
Why? Because Barry turned up the heat,

00:07:56.481 --> 00:07:59.328
and he made 300 million
dollars in the process.

00:07:59.777 --> 00:08:02.886
And he did not leave
a very nice impression on John.
