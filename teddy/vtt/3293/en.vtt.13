Ali vs Foreman.

00:06:33.661 --> 00:06:35.702

00:06:35.726 --> 00:06:40.473
Paul Singer started going around the world
trying to seize up Argentinian assets.

00:06:40.497 --> 00:06:45.162
At one point, he tried to seize
an Argentinian navy vessel

00:06:45.186 --> 00:06:46.440
off the coast of Ghana.

00:06:46.464 --> 00:06:49.900
He tried to take over a 350-foot ship

00:06:49.924 --> 00:06:53.842
while big navy officers
with big guns were on the ship.

00:06:53.866 --> 00:06:57.400
He got the police in Ghana
to show up with a crane

00:06:57.424 --> 00:06:58.903
and threaten to board the ship,

00:06:58.927 --> 00:07:03.439
and it wasn't until
the navy officers drew their weapons
