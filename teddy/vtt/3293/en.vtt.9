00:04:27.769 --> 00:04:30.916
but look for every opportunity
to talk about them.

00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:33.415
Like, in an Uber Pool.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.485
(Laughter)

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.120
"Hey, I noticed you looking at my feet."

00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:41.310
"What? Dude, no, I'm just making slides.
I'm a consultant. I make slides.

00:04:41.334 --> 00:04:43.684
I'm making PowerPoint slides,
I'm not looking --"

00:04:43.708 --> 00:04:44.876
"No, it's fine.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.303
I get why you'd be looking.

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:48.431
The plastic on my shoe
must be bothering you.

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.983
Well, let me talk about it
for the rest of this ride.

00:04:51.007 --> 00:04:53.417
You see, the plastic on my shoe
is from the ocean,

00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:55.592
on my feet, not in your fish,

00:04:55.616 --> 00:04:57.772
being walked on, not being munched on.

00:04:57.796 --> 00:05:00.319
Happy feet. Happy fish. Happy ocean.
