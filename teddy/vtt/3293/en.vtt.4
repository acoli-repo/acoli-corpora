Some activists also like Doritos,
but they definitely want money.

00:02:04.313 --> 00:02:08.647
And the way they make money,
the way they create value,

00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:11.269
is by getting management of corporations

00:02:11.293 --> 00:02:12.909
to make changes.

00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:17.127
Now, some will argue
that the changes they create,

00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:19.789
the value they create,
is too short-term in nature.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.106
And others will say the tactics
they use are egregious.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.544
I agree.

00:02:25.568 --> 00:02:27.280
Long, drawn-out lawsuits,

00:02:27.304 --> 00:02:28.788
public smear campaigns --

00:02:28.812 --> 00:02:31.152
there is no need for that.
