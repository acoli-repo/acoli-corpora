00:03:27.043 --> 00:03:30.757
is that it's so much more than
an act of good corporate citizenship.

00:03:31.376 --> 00:03:32.745
It's good business.

00:03:33.383 --> 00:03:36.143
There's now enough evidence
that shows a clear correlation

00:03:36.167 --> 00:03:39.373
between ESG performance
and financial performance.

00:03:39.397 --> 00:03:42.604
Companies that do good
for the environment and society

00:03:42.628 --> 00:03:44.607
also do well financially.

00:03:45.362 --> 00:03:47.807
And some of the best
companies are catching on.

00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:49.162
Like Adidas:

00:03:49.186 --> 00:03:53.108
Adidas is cleaning up the ocean
and making money in the process.

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:57.332
Adidas teamed up with an organization
called Parley for the Oceans.

00:03:57.356 --> 00:04:00.893
Parley goes out and collects
plastic waste from the ocean.
