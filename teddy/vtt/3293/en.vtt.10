00:04:57.796 --> 00:05:00.319
Happy feet. Happy fish. Happy ocean.

00:05:00.343 --> 00:05:02.686
Doing my part. I got eco-shoes.
I got eco-shoes.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.539
You need some eco-shoes?"

00:05:04.563 --> 00:05:07.027
And so on, just cornering him.
We've all been there.

00:05:07.051 --> 00:05:09.925
"Hey, pass me your cell phone.
I'll give you a discount code.

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:11.556
Let me give you a discount code."

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.731
We've all been --

00:05:12.755 --> 00:05:14.903
Folks, I have jumped out
of moving Uber Pools.

00:05:14.927 --> 00:05:16.032
(Laughter)

00:05:16.056 --> 00:05:18.678
Just, moving, highway, I'm out. I'm out.

00:05:20.567 --> 00:05:23.854
But we've got to forgive the hipsters,
we need to love the hipsters.

00:05:23.878 --> 00:05:26.367
We need hipsters,
and we need companies like Adidas,

00:05:26.391 --> 00:05:29.891
and what we need most is for investors
to convince other companies

00:05:29.915 --> 00:05:31.527
to behave like Adidas.
