00:11:57.885 --> 00:12:01.055
talking to some junior person
in the investor relations department,

00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:03.633
and nobody hears about it,
and that needs to change.

00:12:03.657 --> 00:12:05.290

The same should be true when the company
underperforms on ESG issues.

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:26.697
And yes, that requires standardization
on how we measure ESG,

00:12:26.721 --> 00:12:27.907
but we're on it.

00:12:29.201 --> 00:12:31.143
