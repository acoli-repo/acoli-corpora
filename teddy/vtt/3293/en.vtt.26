It's time to use that voice again.

00:13:01.373 --> 00:13:03.691
But this time, instead of
pushing them to divest,

00:13:03.715 --> 00:13:07.249
push them to engage, truly engage,
truly work with management

00:13:07.273 --> 00:13:10.882
to make changes that will improve
their ESG performance.

00:13:12.449 --> 00:13:14.524
You made them aware of the issues.

00:13:14.548 --> 00:13:16.476
You can now focus them on fixing them.

00:13:17.074 --> 00:13:18.637
Thank you.

00:13:18.661 --> 00:13:21.041
