00:02:28.812 --> 00:02:31.152
there is no need for that.

00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:34.894
But I must say, there's
a small handful of activists,

00:02:34.918 --> 00:02:36.214
very small,

00:02:36.238 --> 00:02:39.174
that go to great lengths
to be constructive and collaborative.

00:02:39.198 --> 00:02:41.920
And overall, we have to give credit
where credit is due.

00:02:41.944 --> 00:02:45.790
As a group, they have managed
to catalyze large-scale change

00:02:45.814 --> 00:02:47.035
in large corporations,

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:49.278
and that's no small feat.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.824
Now, imagine a world

00:02:52.888 --> 00:02:55.948
where all investors were working
with management to make change,

00:02:55.972 --> 00:02:57.816
not just to make more money,

00:02:58.981 --> 00:03:01.924
but to improve
the environment and society.
