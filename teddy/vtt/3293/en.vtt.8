Parley goes out and collects
plastic waste from the ocean.

00:04:00.917 --> 00:04:03.385
Adidas uses the plastic waste
to make shoes.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.016
Shoes made with plastic from the ocean:

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.771
good for the environment
and good for business.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.107
Because if you know that rapidly growing
consumer segment known as hipsters --

00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:15.363
and I know you know hipsters --

00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:19.000
then you know that a hipster faced with
the choice between a no-name shoe

00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:21.310
and an Adidas made with
plastic from the ocean

00:04:21.334 --> 00:04:25.308
will pick the Adidas every day
of the week and twice on Sunday,

00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:27.745
and then walk around like it's no big deal

00:04:27.769 --> 00:04:30.916
but look for every opportunity
to talk about them.
