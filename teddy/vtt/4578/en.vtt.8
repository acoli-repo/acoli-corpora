00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.536
Showmen used the same coded cylinders

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.496
to control the physical movements
of what were called automata,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.536
an early kind of robot.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.496
One of the most famous of those robots

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.896
was, you guessed it,
an automated flute player

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.816
designed by a brilliant French inventor

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.125
named Jacques de Vaucanson.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:21.776
And as de Vaucanson
was designing his robot musician,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.736
he had another idea.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.736
If you could program a machine
to make pleasing sounds,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.400
why not program it to weave
delightful patterns of color out of cloth?
