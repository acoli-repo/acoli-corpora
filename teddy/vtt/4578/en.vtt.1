00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.496
but these different creatures
dispersed across both time and space

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.696
did share one remarkable fate.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.176
After their deaths,
a bone from each of their skeletons

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.896
was crafted by human hands

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.120
into a flute.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.376
Think about that for a second.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.056

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.816
You've built simple tools for hunting.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.456
You've learned how to craft
garments from animal skins

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.536
to keep yourself warm in the winter.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.296
What would you choose to invent next?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.456
It seems preposterous
that you would invent the flute,
