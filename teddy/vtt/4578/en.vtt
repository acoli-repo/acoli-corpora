(Music)

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.416
Roughly 43,000 years ago,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.416
a young cave bear
died in the rolling hills

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.816
on the northwest border
of modern day Slovenia.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.936
A thousand years later,
a mammoth died in southern Germany.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.256
A few centuries after that,
a griffon vulture also died

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.480
in the same vicinity.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.416
And we know almost nothing
about how these animals met their deaths,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.496
but these different creatures
dispersed across both time and space
