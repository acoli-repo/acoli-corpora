00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.096
Now, the instrument
was basically a giant music box.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.456
The organ could be trained to play
various songs by using instructions

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.680
encoded by placing pins
on a rotating cylinder.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.056
And if you wanted the machine
to play a different song,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.040
you just swapped a new cylinder in
with a different code on it.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.216
This instrument was the first of its kind.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.976
It was programmable.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.056
Now, conceptually,
this was a massive leap forward.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.496
The whole idea of hardware and software

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.736
becomes thinkable for the first time
with this invention.
