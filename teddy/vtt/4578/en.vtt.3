many of those playful
but seemingly frivolous inventions

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.856
ended up sparking
momentous transformations

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.976
in science, in politics and society.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.936
Take what may be the most
important invention of modern times:

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.696
programmable computers.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.336
Now, the standard story is that computers
descend from military technology,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.216
since many of the early computers
were designed specifically

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.696
to crack wartime codes
or calculate rocket trajectories.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.216
But in fact, the origins
of the modern computer

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.896
are much more playful,
