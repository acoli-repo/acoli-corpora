00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.216
when a bunch of inventors
finally hit on the idea

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.136
of using a keyboard
to trigger not sounds but letters.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.456
In fact, the very first typewriter

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.640
was originally called
"the writing harpsichord."

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.256
Flutes and music led
to even more powerful breakthroughs.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.016
About a thousand years ago,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.256
at the height of the Islamic Renaissance,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.616
three brothers in Baghdad
designed a device

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.136
that was an automated organ.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.040
They called it "the instrument
that plays itself."

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.096
Now, the instrument
was basically a giant music box.
