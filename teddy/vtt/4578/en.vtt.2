It seems preposterous
that you would invent the flute,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.296
a tool that created
useless vibrations in air molecules.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.320
But that is exactly
what our ancestors did.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.616
Now this turns out
to be surprisingly common

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.256
in the history of innovation.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.216
Sometimes people invent things

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.176
because they want to stay alive
or feed their children

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.336
or conquer the village next door.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.776
But just as often,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.696
new ideas come into the world

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.760
simply because they're fun.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.936
And here's the really strange thing:

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.216
many of those playful
but seemingly frivolous inventions
