what really made
the modern computer possible?

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.336
Yes, the military involvement
is an important part of the story,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.096
but inventing a computer
also required other building blocks:

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.336
music boxes,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.376
toy robot flute players,

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.896
harpsichord keyboards,

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.496
colorful patterns woven into fabric,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.336
and that's just a small part of the story.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.336
There's a long list of world-changing
ideas and technologies

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.056
that came out of play:

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.056
public museums, rubber,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.416
probability theory, the insurance business

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.656
and many more.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.400
Necessity isn't always
the mother of invention.
