00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.896
are much more playful,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.216
even musical,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.496
than you might imagine.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.776
The idea behind the flute,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.896
of just pushing air through tubes
to make a sound,

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.816
was eventually modified
to create the first organ

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.576
more than 2,000 years ago.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.896
Someone came up with the brilliant idea
of triggering sounds

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.816
by pressing small levers with our fingers,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.216
inventing the first musical keyboard.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.376
Now, keyboards evolved
from organs to clavichords to harpsichords

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.736
to the piano,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.416
until the middle of the 19th century,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.216
when a bunch of inventors
finally hit on the idea
