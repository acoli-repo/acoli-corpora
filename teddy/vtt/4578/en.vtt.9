00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.400
why not program it to weave
delightful patterns of color out of cloth?

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.176
Instead of using the pins of the cylinder
to represent musical notes,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.296
they would represent
threads with different colors.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.816
If you wanted a new pattern
for your fabric,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.520
you just programmed a new cylinder.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.840
This was the first programmable loom.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.736
Now, the cylinders were too expensive
and time-consuming to make,

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.296
but a half century later,

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.936
another French inventor named Jacquard

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.656
hit upon the brilliant idea
of using paper-punched cards
