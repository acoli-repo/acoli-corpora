00:00:00.785 --> 00:00:03.258
So I am a surgeon who studies creativity,

00:00:03.282 --> 00:00:06.110
and I have never had a patient tell me,

00:00:06.134 --> 00:00:08.976
"I really want you
to be creative during surgery,"

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.119
and so I guess
there's a little bit of irony to it.

00:00:12.143 --> 00:00:15.443
I will say though that,
after having done surgery a lot,

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:17.677
it's similar to playing
a musical instrument.

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:20.531
And for me, this deep
and enduring fascination with sound

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:22.297
is what led me to both be a surgeon

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.855
and to study the science
of sound, particularly music.

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:26.928
I'm going to talk
over the next few minutes

00:00:26.952 --> 00:00:28.243
about my career

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:30.551
in terms of how I'm able to study music
