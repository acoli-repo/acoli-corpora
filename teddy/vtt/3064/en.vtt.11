00:05:29.264 --> 00:05:31.254
which is "Caught Being Awesome."

00:05:31.278 --> 00:05:32.508
(Laughter)

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:37.179
We award players ranks on the servers
based on the attributes they exhibit,

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:40.480
such as the "Buddy" rank for people
who are friendly towards others,

00:05:40.504 --> 00:05:43.488
and "Junior Helper" for people
that are helpful towards others.

00:05:43.512 --> 00:05:45.980
We have "Senior Helper" for the adults.

00:05:47.324 --> 00:05:49.501
But they're obvious, right?

00:05:49.525 --> 00:05:52.934
Like, people know what to expect
and how to earn these things

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.468
because of how they're named.

00:05:54.492 --> 00:05:56.883
As soon as somebody signs onto the server,

00:05:56.907 --> 00:05:59.805
they know that they're going
to be rewarded for who they are

00:05:59.829 --> 00:06:01.177
and not what they can do.
