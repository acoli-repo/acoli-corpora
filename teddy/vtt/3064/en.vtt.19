The one thing I would hope
that you could take away

00:09:30.666 --> 00:09:34.420
is that no matter what somebody else
is going through in life right now,

00:09:34.444 --> 00:09:37.722
whether they're being bullied
at school or at home,

00:09:37.746 --> 00:09:40.586
if they're questioning their sexuality
or even their gender,

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.075
which happens a lot
in the autism community,

00:09:43.099 --> 00:09:45.814
if they're feeling alone or even suicidal,

00:09:46.395 --> 00:09:49.600
you have to live your life in such a way

00:09:50.332 --> 00:09:53.096
that that person feels like they can
come to and tell you.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.083
They have to feel perfectly safe
in talking to you about it.

00:09:56.107 --> 00:09:58.710
If you want to see
a group of autistic children --

00:09:59.389 --> 00:10:02.378
kids who society wrongly thinks
are supposed to be antisocial
