00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.365
and posted a pretty simple message
to my friends list, not publicly.

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:04.742
I wanted to see if there
was any interest in this,

00:03:04.766 --> 00:03:06.107
and if it really could help.

00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:09.537
Turns out that I greatly underestimated
just how much this was needed,

00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:12.447
because within 48 hours, I got 750 emails.

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:15.485
I don't have that many Facebook friends.

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:17.434
(Laughter)

00:03:17.458 --> 00:03:21.071
Within eight days, I had to upgrade
the hosting package eight times,

00:03:21.095 --> 00:03:24.076
from the bottom package
to the most expensive package they had,

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.709
and now, almost four years later,

00:03:25.733 --> 00:03:28.885
I have 8,000 names on the white list
from all around the world.

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.144
But the reason I'm up here
today to talk to you
