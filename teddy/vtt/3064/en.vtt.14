For the other admins and helpers,
we document everything

00:07:00.808 --> 00:07:04.120
so that, whether it's good or bad
or a concerning conversation,

00:07:04.144 --> 00:07:05.928
it's there, so everybody is aware.

00:07:06.562 --> 00:07:08.971
I want to give you one example
of this one player.

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:11.146
He was with us for a little while,

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.295
but at some point he started
spamming dashes in the chat,

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:17.265
like a big long line of dashes
all the way across the screen.

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:19.209
A little while later, he'd do it again.

00:07:19.233 --> 00:07:22.410
The other players asked him
not to do that, and he'd say, "OK."

00:07:22.434 --> 00:07:23.785
And then he'd do it again.

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:25.814
It started to frustrate the other players.

00:07:25.838 --> 00:07:28.959
They asked me to mute him
or to punish him for breaking the rules,

00:07:28.983 --> 00:07:31.226
but I knew there had to be
something more to it.
