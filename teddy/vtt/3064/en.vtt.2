00:00:59.412 --> 00:01:00.715
and what it's about,

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:03.233
but first I have to give you
a little bit of history

00:01:03.257 --> 00:01:04.687
on how the server came to be.

00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:08.401
Back in 2013, everybody
was playing Minecraft,

00:01:08.425 --> 00:01:10.693
kids and adults alike,

00:01:10.717 --> 00:01:12.905
with and without autism, of course.

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:14.351
But it was the big thing.

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:17.422
But I saw parents on social media
reaching out to other parents,

00:01:17.446 --> 00:01:20.231
asking if their autistic children
could play together.

00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:23.357
And the reason is that when they tried
to play on public servers,

00:01:23.381 --> 00:01:25.666
they kept running into bullies and trolls.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.820
When you have autism, you behave
a little differently sometimes,

00:01:28.844 --> 00:01:30.548
sometimes a lot differently.
