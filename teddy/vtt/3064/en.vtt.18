00:08:58.377 --> 00:09:00.040
or you're a teacher or a therapist

00:09:00.064 --> 00:09:02.539
or you're a parent
who is just doing your very best,

00:09:02.563 --> 00:09:04.281
or you're an autistic, like I am,

They want to learn when they

00:09:22.212 --> 00:09:24.875
It just happens naturally;
they don't even try to learn.

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:28.208
These are words from the kids
on the server to describe the server.

00:09:28.232 --> 00:09:30.642
The one thing I would hope
that you could take away
