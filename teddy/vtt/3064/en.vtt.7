00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.144
But the reason I'm up here
today to talk to you

00:03:31.168 --> 00:03:33.725
isn't just because I gave kids
a safe place to play.

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:35.523
It's what happened while they played.

00:03:35.547 --> 00:03:36.982
I started hearing from parents

00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:39.634
who said their children
were learning to read and write

00:03:39.658 --> 00:03:40.868
by playing on the server.

00:03:40.892 --> 00:03:43.607
At first they spelled things
by sound, like most kids do,

00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:45.701
but because they were part of a community,

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:48.307
they saw other people
spelling the same words properly

00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:49.492
and just picked it up.

00:03:49.516 --> 00:03:52.782
I started hearing from parents
who said that their nonverbal children

00:03:52.806 --> 00:03:53.962
were starting to speak.

00:03:53.986 --> 00:03:56.658
They only talked about Minecraft,
but they were talking.

00:03:56.682 --> 00:03:58.006
(Laughter)

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.717
Some kids made friends at school
for the first time ever.
