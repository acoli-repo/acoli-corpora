So about four years ago,
I started a Minecraft server

00:00:31.506 --> 00:00:33.940
for children with autism
and their families,

00:00:33.964 --> 00:00:35.710
and I called it "Autcraft."

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:38.674
And since then, we've been in the news
all around the world,

00:00:38.698 --> 00:00:40.825
on television and radio and magazines.

00:00:41.212 --> 00:00:44.336
Buzzfeed called us "one of
the best places on the internet."

00:00:45.124 --> 00:00:48.822
We're also the subject
of an award-winning research paper called

00:00:48.846 --> 00:00:52.693
"Appropriating Minecraft as an Assistive
Technology for Youth with Autism."

00:00:52.717 --> 00:00:53.968
It's a bit of a mouthful.

00:00:54.507 --> 00:00:56.042
But you get the idea, I think.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.388
So I want to talk a little bit
about that research paper

00:00:59.412 --> 00:01:00.715
and what it's about,
