Plus, they can make it
asterisks or blank lines

00:08:00.709 --> 00:08:03.311
or anything they want --
whatever works best for them.

00:08:03.335 --> 00:08:06.772
We even went a little bit extra
and made it so it highlights your name,

00:08:06.796 --> 00:08:09.326
so that it's easier to see
if somebody mentions you.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.485
It's just one example of how
doing a little bit extra,

00:08:12.509 --> 00:08:13.942
a small modification,

00:08:13.966 --> 00:08:16.009
still helps everybody be on equal footing,

00:08:16.033 --> 00:08:18.872
even though you did a little extra
just for that one player.

00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:22.462
The big one is to be not afraid.

00:08:22.486 --> 00:08:24.870
The children on my server are not afraid.

00:08:24.894 --> 00:08:27.077
They are free to just be themselves,

00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:31.826
and it's because we support
and encourage and celebrate each other.
