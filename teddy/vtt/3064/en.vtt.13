00:06:28.804 --> 00:06:31.188
that everybody is considered
to be equal, even me.

00:06:31.212 --> 00:06:33.920
But we know we can't treat
people equally to do that.

00:06:33.944 --> 00:06:36.431
Some of the players get angry very easily.

00:06:36.455 --> 00:06:39.130
Some of them have additional
struggles on top of autism,

00:06:39.154 --> 00:06:40.917
such as OCD or Tourette's.

00:06:41.856 --> 00:06:45.573
So, I have this knack
of remembering all of the players.

00:06:45.597 --> 00:06:48.243
I remember their first day,
the conversations we've had,

00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:50.522
things we've talked about,
things they've built.

00:06:50.546 --> 00:06:52.609
So when somebody comes
to me with a problem,

00:06:52.633 --> 00:06:56.010
I handle that situation differently
than I would with any other player,

00:06:56.034 --> 00:06:57.673
based on what I know about them.

00:06:57.697 --> 00:07:00.784
For the other admins and helpers,
we document everything
