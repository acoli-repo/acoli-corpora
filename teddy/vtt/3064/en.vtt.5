00:02:28.455 --> 00:02:30.439
so I have to do something.

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:35.296
So I got myself a Minecraft server,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.348
and I spent some time,
built a little village with some roads

00:02:38.372 --> 00:02:41.654
and a big welcome sign and this guy
and a lodge up on a mountaintop,

00:02:41.678 --> 00:02:43.539
and tried to make it inviting.

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:44.937
The idea was pretty simple.

00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:48.368
I had a white list, so only people
that I approved could join,

00:02:48.392 --> 00:02:50.990
and I would just monitor
the server as much as I could,

00:02:51.014 --> 00:02:53.037
just to make sure that nothing went wrong.

00:02:53.061 --> 00:02:56.212
And that was it, that was the whole
promise: to keep the kids safe

00:02:56.236 --> 00:02:57.387
so they could play.

00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:59.126
When it was done, I went to Facebook

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.365
and posted a pretty simple message
to my friends list, not publicly.
