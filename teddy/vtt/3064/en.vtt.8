Some kids made friends at school
for the first time ever.

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:03.377
Some started to share,
even give things to other people.

00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:04.559
It was amazing.

00:04:04.583 --> 00:04:07.957
And every single parent came to me
and said it was because of Autcraft,

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:09.384
because of what you're doing.

00:04:09.408 --> 00:04:10.559
But why, though?

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:13.446
How could all of this be
just from a video game server?

00:04:14.074 --> 00:04:17.263
Well, it goes back to that
research paper I was talking about.

00:04:17.287 --> 00:04:20.996
In it, she covers some of the guidelines
I used when I created the server,

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.520
guidelines that I think help encourage
people to be their very best.

00:04:24.544 --> 00:04:25.740
I hope.

00:04:25.764 --> 00:04:27.060
For example, communication.

00:04:27.084 --> 00:04:28.857
It can be tough for kids with autism.

00:04:28.881 --> 00:04:31.395
It could be tough
for grown-ups without autism.
