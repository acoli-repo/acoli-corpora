It could be tough
for grown-ups without autism.

00:04:32.114 --> 00:04:34.216
But I think that kids
should not be punished,

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.686
they should be talked to.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.496
Nine times out of ten, when the kids
on the server act out,

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.866
it's because of something that's happened
in the day at school or home.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.042
Maybe a pet died.

00:04:43.066 --> 00:04:45.704
Sometimes it's just
a miscommunication between two kids.

00:04:45.728 --> 00:04:47.851
One doesn't say what they're about to do.

00:04:47.875 --> 00:04:49.283
And so we just offer to help.

00:04:49.307 --> 00:04:52.194
We always tell the children
on the server that we're not mad,

00:04:52.218 --> 00:04:53.532
and they're not in trouble;

00:04:53.556 --> 00:04:54.707
we only want to help.

00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:56.585
And it shows that not only do we care,

00:04:56.609 --> 00:04:59.806
but we respect them enough
to listen to their point of view.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.460
Respect goes a long way.
