00:01:58.288 --> 00:02:01.622
And they would tell these kids,
some as young as six years old,

00:02:01.646 --> 00:02:03.277
that society doesn't want them,

00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:05.689
and their own parents
never wanted a broken child,

00:02:05.713 --> 00:02:07.503
so they should just kill themselves.

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:10.838
And of course, these kids, you understand,

00:02:10.862 --> 00:02:13.406
they would sign off
from these servers angry and hurt.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.905
They would break their keyboards,
they'd quite literally hate themselves,

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.362
and their parents felt powerless
to do anything.

00:02:19.386 --> 00:02:21.646
So I decided I had to try and help.

00:02:22.328 --> 00:02:23.567
I have autism,

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.693
my oldest son has autism,

00:02:26.423 --> 00:02:28.431
and both my kids and I love Minecraft,

00:02:28.455 --> 00:02:30.439
so I have to do something.
