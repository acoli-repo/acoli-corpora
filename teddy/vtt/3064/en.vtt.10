Respect goes a long way.

00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:04.097
Plus, it shows them that they have
everything they need

00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:07.093
to be able to resolve these problems
on their own in the future

00:05:07.117 --> 00:05:10.178
and maybe even avoid them,
because, you know, communication.

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:14.604
On most servers, as video games are,

00:05:14.628 --> 00:05:17.418
children are rewarded,
well, players are rewarded,

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:19.602
for how well they do
in a competition, right?

00:05:19.626 --> 00:05:21.809
The better you do,
the better reward you get.

00:05:21.833 --> 00:05:25.266
That can be automated; the server
does the work, the code is there.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.766
On Autcraft, we don't do that.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.240
We have things like
"Player of the Week" and "CBAs,"

00:05:29.264 --> 00:05:31.254
which is "Caught Being Awesome."
