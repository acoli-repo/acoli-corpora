kids who society wrongly thinks
are supposed to be antisocial

00:10:02.402 --> 00:10:03.954
and lacking in empathy --

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:07.291
if you want to see them come together
and build the most compassionate

00:10:07.315 --> 00:10:09.992
and friendly and generous
community you've ever seen,

00:10:10.016 --> 00:10:12.298
the kind of place that people
would write about

00:10:12.322 --> 00:10:14.509
as one of the best places on the internet,

00:10:14.533 --> 00:10:15.684
they'll do that.

00:10:15.708 --> 00:10:16.859
I've seen it.

00:10:16.883 --> 00:10:18.235
I'm there every day.

00:10:18.853 --> 00:10:22.719
But they have some huge obstacles
that they have to overcome to do that,

00:10:22.743 --> 00:10:25.389
and it would be really helpful
to have somebody there

00:10:25.413 --> 00:10:28.876
who could help to show them that
the only thing they really have to fear

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.053
is self-doubt.
