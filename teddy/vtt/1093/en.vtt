00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
As a child,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I was raised by native Hawaiian elders --

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
three old women

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
who took care of me while my parents worked.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The year is 1963.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We're at the ocean.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's twilight.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We're watching the rising of the stars

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and the shifting of the tides.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's a stretch of beach we know so well.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The smooth stones on the sand
