00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.936
to compete at World Games.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.800
(Applause)

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.176
I am one of more than four and a half
million athletes around the globe,

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.880
and I've heard so many similar stories.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.096
Being Special Olympics athletes

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.000
restores our pride and dignity.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.960
Special Olympics also addresses
critical health needs.
