There was a time when people
with intellectual disabilities

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.440
were hidden away from society.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.056
No one thought they could
participate in sports,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.280
let alone be a valued member of society.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.616
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.935
a scientist at the University of Toronto,

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.616
was studying the effects
of regular exercise

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.640
on the fitness levels of children
with intellectual disabilities.
