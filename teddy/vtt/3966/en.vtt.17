00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.679
don't know a single person
with an intellectual disability,

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.056
and the 44 percent of Americans

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.496
who don't have personal contact
with intellectual disabilities

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.960
are significantly
less accepting and positive.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.176
Then there's the r-word,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.456
proving that people
with intellectual disabilities

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.296
are still invisible

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.200
to far too many people.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.080
People use it as a casual
term or an insult.
