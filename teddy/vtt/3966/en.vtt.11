When I got there, though,
everyone was very encouraging,

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.616

Now, I am a basketball player
and speed skater

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.936
who has competed
at provincial, national games,

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.656
and this year made it all the way
to the World Summer Games in LA,

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.496
where I was part of the first ever
Canadian basketball team

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.936
to compete at World Games.
