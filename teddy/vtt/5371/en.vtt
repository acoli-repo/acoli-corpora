Why is the world warming up?

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.093
Let's think of Earth
for just a moment as a greenhouse.

00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:15.593
Every second, a huge amount of energy
smashes into our greenhouse.

00:00:16.904 --> 00:00:20.466
Our atmosphere, the glass roof and walls,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.512
reflects some of that energy,

00:00:22.536 --> 00:00:26.066
but most of it passes right through
and heats everything up.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.856
Much of that heat
used to escape back into space,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.556
keeping us at a stable, warm temperature.
