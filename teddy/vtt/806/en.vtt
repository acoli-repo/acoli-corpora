Someone once said that politics is, of course, "showbiz for ugly people."

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So, on that basis, I feel like I've really arrived.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The other thing to think of is what an honor it is, as a politician,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to give a TED talk, particularly here in the U.K.,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
where the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has sunk so low.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians.
