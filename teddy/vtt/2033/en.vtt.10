00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
You can have a succession of changes.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
At the end you want to sustain

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
miserable leftovers.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
We want to sustain things that are gone

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
or things that are not the way they were.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Now one should think

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
this problem affected people

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
certainly when in predatory societies,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
they killed animals

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and they didn't know they had done so

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
after a few generations.
