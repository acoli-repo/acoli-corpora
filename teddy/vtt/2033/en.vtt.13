00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
presented in an earlier mode

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
is not in the way

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
they would like the evidence presented.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
For example,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
the anecdote that some present,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
as Captain so-and-so

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
observed lots of fish in this area

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
cannot be used

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
because it's not "scientific."

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So you have a situation

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
where people don't know the past,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
even though we live in literate societies,
