00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
after a few generations.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Because, obviously,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
an animal that is very abundant,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
before it gets extinct,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
it becomes rare.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So you don't lose abundant animals.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
You always lose rare animals.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And therefore they're not perceived

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
as a big loss.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Over time,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
we concentrate on large animals,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and in a sea that means the big fish.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
They become rarer because we fish them.
