00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
because this transition is very rapid.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Within a year, you do a survey

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and then commercial fishing begins.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
The bottom is transformed

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
from, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coral

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
into a muddy mess.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
This is a dead turtle.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
They were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And one time we caught a live one.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
It was not drowned yet.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
This mountain of debris

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
is actually collected by fishers
