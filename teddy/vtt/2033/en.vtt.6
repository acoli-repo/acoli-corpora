00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And what we caught,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
we didn't have words for it.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
What we caught, I know now,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
is the bottom of the sea.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And 90 percent of our catch

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
were sponges,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
other animals that are fixed on the bottom.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And actually most of the fish,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
they are a little spot on the debris,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
the piles of debris, were coral reef fish.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and then was thrown down.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And these pictures are extraordinary

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
because this transition is very rapid.
