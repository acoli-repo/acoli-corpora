00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but he wasn't.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
He was actually collecting fish.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And he described one of them

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
as very "common."

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This was the sailfin grouper.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
A big fishery was run on it

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
until the '80s.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now this story,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
we have heard it lots of times

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
on Galapagos and other places,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
so there is nothing particular about it.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But the point is, we still come to Galapagos.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We still think it is pristine.
