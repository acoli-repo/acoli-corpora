00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
biodiversity, numbers of orca,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
the greenness of your country, the water supply.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And over time it changes --

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
it changes

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
because people do things, or naturally.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Every generation

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
will use the images

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
as a standard

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and will extrapolate forward.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And the difference then,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
they perceive as a loss.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
You can have a succession of changes.
