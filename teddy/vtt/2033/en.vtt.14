00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
even though we live in literate societies,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
because they don't trust

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
the sources of the past.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And hence, the enormous role

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
that a marine protected area can play.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Because with marine protected areas,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
we actually recreate the past.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
We recreate the past that people cannot conceive

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
because the baseline has shifted

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and is extremely low.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
That is for people

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
who can see a marine protected area
