00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and in a sea that means the big fish.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
They become rarer because we fish them.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Over time we have a few fish left

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and we think this is the baseline.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And the question is,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
why do people accept this?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Well because they don't know that it was different.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And in fact, lots of people, scientists,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
will contest that it was really different.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And they will contest this

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
because the evidence

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
presented in an earlier mode
