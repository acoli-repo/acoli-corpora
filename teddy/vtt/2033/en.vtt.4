When I went there 27 years later,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the fish had shrunk to half of their size.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
They were maturing at five centimeters.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
My third little story

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
is that I was an accomplice

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
in the introduction of trawling

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
in Southeast Asia.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
In the '70s -- well, beginning in the '60s --
