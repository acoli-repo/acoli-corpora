00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And I got a big sunburn,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and I was convinced that I was really not from there.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This was my first sunburn.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And the lagoon

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
was surrounded by palm trees,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
as you can see, and a few mangrove.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And it had tilapia

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And the fisheries for this tilapia

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and they earned more than average

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
in Ghana.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
When I went there 27 years later,
