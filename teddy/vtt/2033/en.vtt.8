00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
This mountain of debris

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
is actually collected by fishers

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
every time they go

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
into an area that's never been fished.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
But it's not documented.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
We transform the world,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
but we don't remember it.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
We adjust our baseline

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
to the new level,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and we don't recall what was there.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
If you generalize this,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
something like this happens.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
You have on the y axis some good thing:

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
biodiversity, numbers of orca,
