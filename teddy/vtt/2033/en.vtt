00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm going to speak

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about a tiny, little idea.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And this is about shifting baseline.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And because the idea can be explained in one minute,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I will tell you three stories before

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to fill in the time.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And the first story

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And he was here, as you well know, in '35.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And you'd think he was chasing finches,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but he wasn't.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
He was actually collecting fish.
