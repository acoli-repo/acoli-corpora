Was it here or here or here?

00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:05.853
And so he comes out
and gives a looking political speech,

00:16:05.877 --> 00:16:09.265
and everyone goes, "Wow! He can do it."

00:16:09.289 --> 00:16:11.311
It just depends
on which direction he goes.

00:16:11.335 --> 00:16:13.700
DB: Yeah, and we're trying
to build bridges here,

00:16:13.724 --> 00:16:16.761
and especially for an audience
that may have contempt for Trump,

00:16:16.785 --> 00:16:19.034
it's important to say,
no, this is a real thing.

00:16:19.058 --> 00:16:22.912
But as I try my best to go an hour
showing respect for him,

00:16:22.936 --> 00:16:24.927
my thyroid is surging,

00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:28.323
because I think the oddities
of his character

00:16:28.347 --> 00:16:30.828
really are condemnatory
and are going to doom him.
