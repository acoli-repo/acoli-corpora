00:13:26.529 --> 00:13:30.229
that people who loved what his message
was during the campaign,

00:13:30.253 --> 00:13:32.855
I'm not sure -- how do you
think they'll react to that?

00:13:32.879 --> 00:13:35.065
DB: I should say I grew up
in Lower Manhattan,

00:13:35.089 --> 00:13:37.820
in the triangle between ABC Carpets,
the Strand Bookstore

00:13:37.844 --> 00:13:39.158
and The Odeon restaurant.

00:13:39.182 --> 00:13:40.813
(Laughter)

00:13:40.837 --> 00:13:42.691
GC: Come to Minnesota sometime!

00:13:42.715 --> 00:13:43.948
(Laughter)

00:13:43.972 --> 00:13:49.622
CA: You are a card-carrying member
of the coastal elite, my man.

00:13:49.646 --> 00:13:51.898
But what did you make
of the speech last night?

00:13:51.922 --> 00:13:55.369
It seemed to be a move
to a more moderate position,

00:13:55.393 --> 00:13:56.544
on the face of it.

00:13:56.568 --> 00:13:58.595
DB: Yeah, I thought it
was his best speech,

00:13:58.619 --> 00:14:00.657
and it took away the freakishness of him.
