00:14:27.402 --> 00:14:30.265
I'm going to secure the world
for you, for my people."

00:14:30.289 --> 00:14:33.337
But then if you actually look
at a lot of his economic policies,

00:14:33.361 --> 00:14:37.142
like health care reform, which is about
private health care accounts,

00:14:37.166 --> 00:14:40.031
that's not security, that's risk.

00:14:40.055 --> 00:14:43.751
Educational vouchers: that's risk.
Deregulation: that's risk.

00:14:43.775 --> 00:14:47.752
There's really a contradiction
between the security of the mindset

00:14:47.776 --> 00:14:50.560
and a lot of the policies,
which are very risk-oriented.

00:14:50.584 --> 00:14:54.085
And what I would say, especially
having spent this year,

00:14:54.109 --> 00:14:57.974
the people in rural Minnesota,
in New Mexico --

00:14:57.998 --> 00:15:00.063
they've got enough risk in their lives.
