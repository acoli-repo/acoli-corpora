00:02:29.474 --> 00:02:33.529
Sixty-three million Americans
voted for Donald Trump.

00:02:34.505 --> 00:02:36.219
Why did they do this?

00:02:36.243 --> 00:02:39.763
Gretchen Carlson: There are a lot
of reasons, in my mind, why it happened.

00:02:39.787 --> 00:02:43.062
I mean, I think it was a movement
of sorts, but it started long ago.

00:02:43.086 --> 00:02:44.894
It didn't just happen overnight.

00:02:44.918 --> 00:02:47.829
"Anger" would be the first word
that I would think of --

00:02:47.853 --> 00:02:52.116
anger with nothing
being done in Washington,

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.204
anger about not being heard.

00:02:55.976 --> 00:02:58.371
I think there was a huge swath
of the population

00:02:58.395 --> 00:03:01.144
that feels like Washington
never listens to them,
