00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:00.909
was simplifying the message,

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:03.721
simplifying down to phrases

00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:05.794
and to a populist message.

00:05:05.818 --> 00:05:08.543
Even if he can't achieve it,
it sounded good.

00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:12.805
And many people latched on
to that simplicity again.

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:14.774
It's something they could grasp onto:

00:05:14.798 --> 00:05:18.195

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.503
and he'd say it was the number
one show on TV.

00:05:26.527 --> 00:05:28.284
I'd say back to him, "No, it's not."

00:05:28.308 --> 00:05:30.218
And he would say, "Yes it is, Gretchen."
