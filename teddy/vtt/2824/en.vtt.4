00:01:57.339 --> 00:02:00.273
and more recently, perhaps,
some of the right-leaning readers

00:02:00.297 --> 00:02:03.564
because of his criticism
of some aspects of Trump.

00:02:04.348 --> 00:02:06.724
Yet, his columns are usually

00:02:06.748 --> 00:02:11.144
the top one, two or three
most-read content of the day

00:02:11.168 --> 00:02:12.408
because they're brilliant,

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:14.731
because they bring psychology
and social science

00:02:14.755 --> 00:02:18.208
to providing understanding
for what's going on.

00:02:18.232 --> 00:02:21.505
So without further ado, a huge welcome
to Gretchen and David.

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:22.687
Come and join me.

00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:26.424
(Applause)

00:02:26.448 --> 00:02:28.814
So, Gretchen.

00:02:29.474 --> 00:02:33.529
Sixty-three million Americans
voted for Donald Trump.
