00:11:59.704 --> 00:12:02.151
and, to the extent
that it's a different category,

00:12:02.175 --> 00:12:03.456
a lot of Trump supporters,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.406
are infuriated by the coastal elites
and the globalists

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:11.416
because they see them
as, sort of, not cheering for America,

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.102
not embracing fully American values.

00:12:14.126 --> 00:12:17.678
I mean, have you seen that
in your conversations with people,

00:12:17.702 --> 00:12:19.606
in your understanding of their mindset?

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.831
GC: I do think that there's
a huge difference between --

00:12:22.855 --> 00:12:24.837
I hate to put people in categories, but,

00:12:24.861 --> 00:12:28.822
Middle America versus
people who live on the coasts.

00:12:28.846 --> 00:12:30.912
It's an entirely different existence.
