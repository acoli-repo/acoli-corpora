00:03:27.648 --> 00:03:31.722
In 2015 and early 2016,
I wrote about 30 columns

00:03:31.746 --> 00:03:33.097
with the following theme:

00:03:33.121 --> 00:03:36.108
don't worry, Donald Trump will never
be the Republican nominee.

00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:37.292
(Laughter)

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:39.514
And having done that
and gotten that so wrong,

00:03:39.538 --> 00:03:42.722
I decided to spend the ensuing year
just out in Trumpworld,

00:03:42.746 --> 00:03:45.616
and I found a lot of economic dislocation.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.210
I ran into a woman in West Virginia
who was going to a funeral for her mom.

00:03:49.234 --> 00:03:52.702
She said, "The nice thing about
being Catholic is we don't have to speak,

00:03:52.726 --> 00:03:54.998
and that's good,
because we're not word people."

00:03:55.022 --> 00:03:57.004
That phrase rung in my head: word people.

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:59.804
A lot of us in the TED community
are word people,

00:03:59.828 --> 00:04:02.955
but if you're not, the economy
has not been angled toward you,
