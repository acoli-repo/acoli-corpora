00:07:27.003 --> 00:07:30.268
And even though Bernie Sanders
has been in Congress for a long time,

00:07:30.292 --> 00:07:32.505
he was deemed an outsider this time.

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:34.871
And so there was anger
on the left as well,

00:07:34.895 --> 00:07:38.346
and so many people were in favor
of Bernie Sanders.

00:07:38.854 --> 00:07:42.742
So I see it as a commonality.

00:07:42.766 --> 00:07:45.345
People who like Trump,
people who like Bernie Sanders,

00:07:45.369 --> 00:07:49.172
they were liking different policies,
but the underpinning was anger.

00:07:49.196 --> 00:07:53.766
CA: David, there's often
this narrative, then,

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:58.981
that the sole explanation
for Trump's victory and his rise

00:07:59.005 --> 00:08:03.957
is his tapping into anger
in a very visceral way.
