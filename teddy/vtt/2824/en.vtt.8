00:03:59.828 --> 00:04:02.955
but if you're not, the economy
has not been angled toward you,

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:06.616
and so 11 million men, for example,
are out of the labor force

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.249
because those jobs are done away.

00:04:08.273 --> 00:04:09.813
A lot of social injury.

00:04:09.837 --> 00:04:13.134
You used to be able to say,
"I'm not the richest person in the world,

00:04:13.158 --> 00:04:14.376

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.705
but my neighbors can count on me
and I get some dignity out of that."

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.283
And because of celebritification
or whatever, if you're not rich or famous,

00:04:21.307 --> 00:04:22.465
you feel invisible.

00:04:22.489 --> 00:04:25.801
And a lot of moral injury,
sense of feeling betrayed,

00:04:25.825 --> 00:04:29.680
and frankly, in this country,
we almost have one success story,

00:04:29.704 --> 00:04:33.274
which is you go to college, get
a white-collar job, and you're a success,
