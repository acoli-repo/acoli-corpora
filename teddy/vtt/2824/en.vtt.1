00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:32.097
People almost feel...

00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:33.767
disgusted with each other.

00:00:34.648 --> 00:00:37.872
Some families can't even speak
to each other right now.

00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:44.229
Our purpose in this dialogue today
is to try to do something about that,

00:00:44.253 --> 00:00:46.913
to try to have a different kind
of conversation,

00:00:46.937 --> 00:00:51.178
to do some listening, some thinking,
some understanding.

00:00:51.202 --> 00:00:54.630
And I have two people with us
to help us do that.

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:57.893
They're not going to come at this
hammer and tong against each other.

00:00:57.917 --> 00:00:59.681
This is not like cable news.

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:05.198
This is two people who have both spent
a lot of their working life
