00:09:59.106 --> 00:10:01.121
And then guys like Steve Bannon come in

00:10:01.145 --> 00:10:03.172
and give him substance to his impulses.

00:10:04.207 --> 00:10:05.976
CA: And so take that a bit further,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.755
and maybe expand a bit more
on your insights

00:10:09.779 --> 00:10:12.042
into Steve Bannon's worldview.

00:10:12.066 --> 00:10:14.798
Because he's sometimes tarred
in very simple terms

00:10:14.822 --> 00:10:21.433
as this dangerous, racist,
xenophobic, anger-sparking person.

that is perhaps an unfair simplification.

00:10:25.997 --> 00:10:27.433
DB: I think that part is true,

00:10:27.457 --> 00:10:29.927
but there's another part
that's probably true, too.

00:10:29.951 --> 00:10:32.111
He's part of a global movement.
