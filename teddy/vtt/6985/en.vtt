00:00:06.724 --> 00:00:08.920
When the next general election rolls around,

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.881
who will be eligible to show up at the polls

00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:13.271
and vote for the President of the United States?

00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:14.459
It's really pretty simple.

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.107
If you are at least 18 years old,

00:00:16.107 --> 00:00:17.319
a citizen of the U.S.,

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:18.645
and a resident of a state,

00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:19.822
you can vote,

00:00:19.822 --> 00:00:21.732
assuming, that is, you are not a felon.

00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:23.119
Seems about right.

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.041
After all, the United States prides itself

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:26.548
on being a democracy,

00:00:26.548 --> 00:00:28.334
or a government in which the ultimate authority

00:00:28.334 --> 00:00:30.322
lies with the citizens of the nation.
