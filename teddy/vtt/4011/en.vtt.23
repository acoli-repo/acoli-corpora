00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.760
One the best examples of this
came in game four of the 2015 finals.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.720
The Warriors were down two games to one

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.040
when Kerr made the decision
to change the starting lineup;

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.000
a bold move by any measure.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.280
The Warriors won the game
and went on to win the championship.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.216
And it is widely viewed

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.920
that that move was
the pivotal move in their victory.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.120
Interestingly, it wasn't
actually Kerr's idea.
