00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.338
Which, of course, tends to be exhausting.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.456
Or, given the urgency,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.400
what they'll do is they'll just focus
on the short-term results,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.480
but that doesn't give
any hope for the future.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.280
Or they'll just take
a superficial, one-off approach,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.136
hoping that they can return
back to business as usual

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.760
as soon as the crisis is over.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.816
This kind of approach

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.920
is kind of the way some students
approach preparing for standardized tests.
