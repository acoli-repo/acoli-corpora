00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.920
is kind of the way some students
approach preparing for standardized tests.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.736
In order to get test scores to go up,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.360
teachers will end up teaching to the test.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.536
Now, that approach can work;

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.496
test results often do go up.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.296
But it fails the fundamental
goal of education:

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.440
to prepare students
to succeed over the long term.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.200
So given these obstacles,

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.976
what can we do

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.456
to transform the way
