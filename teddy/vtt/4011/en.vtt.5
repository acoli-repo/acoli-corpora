00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.416
First of all,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.576
let's acknowledge that change is hard.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.616
People naturally resist change,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.280
especially when it's imposed on them.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.776
But there are things that organizations do
that make change even harder

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.640
and more exhausting
for people than it needs to be.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.936
First of all,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.400
leaders often wait too long to act.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.256
As a result,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.720
everything is happening in crisis mode.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.338
Which, of course, tends to be exhausting.
