I mean just take a look
at some of the titles of self-help books:

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.056
"Awaken the Giant Within,"

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.576
"Practicing the Power of Now,"

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.056
or here's a great one
we can all relate to,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.296
"You are a Badass:

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.416
How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness
and Start Living an Awesome Life."

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.640
(Laughter)

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.560
When it comes to self-transformation,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.800
you can't help but get
a sense of the excitement.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.016
But there's another type of transformation
