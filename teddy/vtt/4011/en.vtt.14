00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.520
Over the years I've competed
in a number of triathlons.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.456
You know, frankly, I'm not that good,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.496
but I do have one distinct capability;

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.200
I am remarkably fast at finding my bike.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.536
(Laughter)

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.376
By the time I finish the swim,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.256
almost all the bikes are already gone.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.760
(Laughter)

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.216
Real triathletes know that each leg --

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.976
the swim, the bike, the run --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.496
really requires different capabilities,
