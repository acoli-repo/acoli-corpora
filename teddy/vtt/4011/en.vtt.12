00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.016
In the face of relentless competition,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.976
it may well be that you will
have to take the painful decision

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.856
to downsize the organization,

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.560
just as you may have to lose some weight
in order to run a marathon.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.216
But losing weight alone

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.080
will not get you across
the finish line with a winning time.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.760
To win

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.640
you need to go all in.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.920
You need to go all in.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.000
Rather than just cutting costs,

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.176
you need to think about initiatives
