00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.016
But there's another type of transformation

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.120
that occupies a very different
emotional space.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.680
The transformation of organizations.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.216
If you're like most people,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.616
when you hear the words "Our organization
is going to start a transformation,"

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.040
you're thinking, "Uh-oh."

00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:16.576
(Laughter)

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.800
"Layoffs."

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.736
The blood drains from your face,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.616
your mind goes into overdrive,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.880
frantically searching
for some place to run and hide.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.616
Well, you can run,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.920
but you really can't hide.
