My fifth and final imperative
is specifically for leaders.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.856
In a transformation,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.440
a leader needs to have a vision,

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.800
a clear road map with milestones,

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.056
and then you need to hold people
accountable for results.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.033
In other words, you need to be directive.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.376
But in order to capture
the hearts and minds of people,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.800
you also need to be inclusive.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.440
Inclusive leadership
is critical to putting people first.
