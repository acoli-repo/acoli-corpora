Priya Vulchi: Four years ago,
we really thought we understood racism.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.736
Just like many of you here today,
we had experienced and heard stories

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.336
about race, about prejudice,
discrimination and stereotyping

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.400
and we were like, "We get it,
racism, we got it, we got it."

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.176
But we weren't even close.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.256
Winona Guo: So we decided
that we had to listen and learn more.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.456
We talked to as many
random people as we could

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.656
and collected hundreds
of personal stories about race,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.976
stories that revealed how racial injustice
is a nationwide epidemic
