Where did they make a few mistakes
before they found the right answer?

00:06:03.976 --> 00:06:08.335
My team wanted to take that tool set
and apply it to academic learning.

00:06:09.414 --> 00:06:12.415
Our producer in Boston, WGBH,

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:15.162
created a series of Curious George games

00:06:15.186 --> 00:06:16.735
focused on math.

00:06:17.608 --> 00:06:23.391
And researchers came in and had
80 preschoolers play these games.

00:06:23.415 --> 00:06:25.979
They then gave all 80
of those preschoolers

00:06:26.003 --> 00:06:27.946
a standardized math test.

00:06:28.613 --> 00:06:29.784
We could see early on

00:06:29.808 --> 00:06:31.936
that these games
were actually helping kids
