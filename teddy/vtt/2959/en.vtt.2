These screens can get kids
up and moving even more.

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.244
They have the power to tell us more
about what a child is learning

00:01:05.268 --> 00:01:07.115
than a standardized test can.

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:09.095
And here's the really crazy thought:

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.928
I believe that these screens
have the power

00:01:11.952 --> 00:01:14.661
to prompt more real-life conversations

00:01:14.685 --> 00:01:16.943
between kids and their parents.

00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:21.768
Now, I was perhaps
an unlikely champion for this cause.

00:01:21.792 --> 00:01:23.753
I studied children's literature

00:01:23.777 --> 00:01:26.311
because I was going to work
with kids and books.

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:28.935
But about 20 years ago,

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:32.127
I had an experience that shifted my focus.
