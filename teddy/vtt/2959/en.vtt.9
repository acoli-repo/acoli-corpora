00:04:27.432 --> 00:04:30.364
who host a show about animals
called "Wild Kratts."

00:04:30.887 --> 00:04:33.250
And they approached the PBS team to say,

00:04:33.274 --> 00:04:35.437
"Can we do something with those cameras

00:04:35.461 --> 00:04:37.762
that are built into every device now?

00:04:37.786 --> 00:04:42.471
Could those cameras capture
a very natural kid play pattern --

00:04:42.495 --> 00:04:44.495
pretending to be animals?"

00:04:45.264 --> 00:04:47.264
So we started with bats.

00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:50.683
And when kids came in to play this game,

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:53.668
they loved seeing themselves
on-screen with wings.

00:04:54.246 --> 00:04:55.889
But my favorite part of this,

00:04:55.913 --> 00:04:59.205
when the game was over
and we turned off the screens?

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.142
The kids kept being bats.
