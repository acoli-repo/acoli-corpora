00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:32.127
I had an experience that shifted my focus.

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:36.738
I was helping lead a research study
about preschoolers and websites.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.521
And I walked in and was assigned
a three-year-old named Maria.

00:01:40.973 --> 00:01:44.868
Maria had actually never seen
a computer before.

00:01:44.892 --> 00:01:48.038
So the first thing I had to do
was teach her how to use the mouse,

00:01:48.062 --> 00:01:53.492
and when I opened up the screen,
she moved it across the screen,

00:01:53.516 --> 00:01:56.751
and she stopped on a character
named X the Owl.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.529
And when she did that,

00:01:58.553 --> 00:02:02.345
the owl lifted his wing and waved at her.
