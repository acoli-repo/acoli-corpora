00:06:29.808 --> 00:06:31.936
that these games
were actually helping kids

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.960
understand some key skills.

00:06:34.388 --> 00:06:37.813
But our partners at UCLA
wanted us to dig deeper.

00:06:38.344 --> 00:06:41.831
They focus on data analysis
and student assessment.

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:45.847
And they wanted to take
that back-end game-play data

00:06:45.871 --> 00:06:50.044
and see if they could use it
to predict a child's math scores.

00:06:50.068 --> 00:06:53.718
So they made a neural net --
they essentially trained the computer

00:06:53.742 --> 00:06:55.264
to use this data,

00:06:55.288 --> 00:06:56.788
and here are the results.

00:06:56.812 --> 00:07:00.742
This is a subset of the children's
standardized math scores.
