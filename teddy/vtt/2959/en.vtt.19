00:09:29.242 --> 00:09:31.500
it was the combination that was key.

00:09:33.214 --> 00:09:34.667
So when I read this study,

00:09:34.691 --> 00:09:36.095
I started thinking about

00:09:36.119 --> 00:09:41.372
how rarely parents of preschoolers
actually talk to kids about the content

00:09:41.396 --> 00:09:43.782
of what they're playing
and what they're watching.

00:09:43.806 --> 00:09:46.269
And so I decided to try it
with my four-year-old.

00:09:46.293 --> 00:09:47.451
I said,

00:09:48.077 --> 00:09:50.906
"Were you playing a car game
earlier today?"

00:09:51.352 --> 00:09:53.334
And Benjamin perked up and said,

00:09:53.358 --> 00:09:57.203
"Yes! And did you see
that I made my car out of a pickle?

00:09:57.227 --> 00:09:59.314
It was really hard to open the trunk."

00:09:59.338 --> 00:10:00.996
