00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.975
What if games could reduce
testing time in the classroom?

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:35.672
What if they could reduce testing anxiety?

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.025
How could they give teachers
snapshots of insight

00:07:40.049 --> 00:07:43.155
to help them better focus
their individualized learning?

00:07:46.147 --> 00:07:49.052
So the third fear I want to address

00:07:49.076 --> 00:07:52.060
is the one that I think
is often the biggest.

00:07:52.084 --> 00:07:53.266
And that's this:

00:07:54.091 --> 00:07:57.749
"These screens are isolating me
from my child."

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:01.122
Let's play out a scenario.
