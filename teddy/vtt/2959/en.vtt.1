00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.566
and as a society, we get anxious.

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:32.343
Parents are very worried

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.846
that this device is going to stunt
their children's social growth;

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.535
that it's going to keep them
from getting up and moving;

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:39.931
that somehow,

00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:42.846
this is going to disrupt childhood.

00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:47.619
So, I want to challenge this attitude.

00:00:48.404 --> 00:00:50.475
I can envision a future

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:55.400
where we would be excited to see
a preschooler interacting with a screen.

00:00:56.527 --> 00:01:01.002
These screens can get kids
up and moving even more.
