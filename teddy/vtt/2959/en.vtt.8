And I'm also a parent -- I understand
this feeling of anxiety.

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.085
But I want us to look
at three common fears

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.622
that parents have,

00:04:08.646 --> 00:04:11.490
and see if we can shift our focus

00:04:11.514 --> 00:04:14.145
to the opportunity that's in each of them.

00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:16.024
So.

00:04:16.048 --> 00:04:17.399
Fear number one:

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.608
"Screens are passive.

00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:22.667
This is going to keep our kids
from getting up and moving."

00:04:23.905 --> 00:04:27.408
Chris Kratt and Martin Kratt
are zoologist brothers

00:04:27.432 --> 00:04:30.364
who host a show about animals
called "Wild Kratts."
