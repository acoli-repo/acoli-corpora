Just the act of talking to kids
about their media

00:09:03.131 --> 00:09:05.131
can be incredibly powerful.

00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:09.154
Last summer, Texas Tech University
published a study

00:09:09.178 --> 00:09:12.540
that the show "Daniel Tiger's
Neighborhood" could promote

00:09:12.564 --> 00:09:15.956
the development of empathy among children.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.779
But there was a really important
catch to this study:

00:09:18.803 --> 00:09:23.260
the greatest benefit was only
when parents talked to kids

00:09:23.284 --> 00:09:25.170
about what they watched.

00:09:25.194 --> 00:09:27.194
Neither just watching

00:09:27.218 --> 00:09:29.218
nor just talking about it was enough;

00:09:29.242 --> 00:09:31.500
it was the combination that was key.
