00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.086
I want us to start
by thinking about this device,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.164
the phone that's very likely
in your pockets right now.

00:00:07.743 --> 00:00:10.860
Over 40 percent of Americans 
check their phones

00:00:10.884 --> 00:00:14.114
within five minutes
of waking up every morning.

00:00:14.138 --> 00:00:17.863
And then they look at it
another 50 times during the day.

00:00:17.887 --> 00:00:21.724
Grownups consider this device
to be a necessity.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.888
But now I want you to imagine it
in the hands of a three-year-old,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.566
and as a society, we get anxious.
