We're letting our fear and our skepticism

00:02:42.083 --> 00:02:43.516

hold us back from realizing
their potential

00:02:46.076 --> 00:02:47.501
in our children's lives.

is nothing new;

00:02:53.568 --> 00:02:58.285
Over 50 years ago, the debate was raging
about the newly dominant media:

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:59.984
the television.
