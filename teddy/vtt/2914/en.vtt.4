00:01:58.524 --> 00:02:01.701
helps him have relationships
with genuine human beings.

00:02:02.805 --> 00:02:05.935
And this is humanistic AI.

00:02:07.404 --> 00:02:09.802
Another example with
life-changing consequences

00:02:09.826 --> 00:02:11.083
is diagnosing cancer.

00:02:12.795 --> 00:02:14.950
When a doctor suspects cancer,

00:02:14.974 --> 00:02:17.677
they take a sample
and send it to a pathologist,

00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:19.653
who looks at it under a microscope.

00:02:20.145 --> 00:02:22.670
Now, pathologists look at
hundreds of slides

00:02:22.694 --> 00:02:25.018
and millions of cells every day.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.017
So to support this task,

00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:30.483
some researchers made an AI classifier.
