00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.044
and you enter the form and the materials,
and then you analyze performance.

00:04:00.068 --> 00:04:01.412
That gives you one design.

00:04:02.162 --> 00:04:05.839
If you give those same tools to an AI,

00:04:05.863 --> 00:04:08.987
it can generate thousands of designs.

00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:12.127
This video by Autodesk is amazing.

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:13.451
This is real stuff.

00:04:14.092 --> 00:04:17.163
So this transforms how we do design.

00:04:17.187 --> 00:04:18.615
The human engineer now

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.954
says what the design should achieve,

00:04:21.978 --> 00:04:23.134
and the machine says,

00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:24.528
"Here's the possibilities."

00:04:25.758 --> 00:04:28.698
Now in her job, the engineer's job

00:04:28.722 --> 00:04:31.822
is to pick the one that best meets
the goals of the design,
