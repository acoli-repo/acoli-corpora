Now, today I'm happy to see

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:32.260
that the idea of an intelligent assistant

00:00:32.284 --> 00:00:33.753
is mainstream.

00:00:33.777 --> 00:00:38.837
It's the well-accepted metaphor
for the interface between humans and AI.

00:00:39.556 --> 00:00:42.253
And the one I helped create
is called Siri.

00:00:42.957 --> 00:00:44.109
You know Siri.

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.778
Siri is the thing that knows your intent

00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:48.844
and helps you do it for you,

00:00:48.868 --> 00:00:50.369
helps you get things done.

00:00:50.393 --> 00:00:52.867
But what you might not know
is that we designed Siri

00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:55.611
as humanistic AI,

00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:58.806
to augment people
with a conversational interface

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.283
that made it possible for them
to use mobile computing,
