00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:30.483
some researchers made an AI classifier.

00:02:31.548 --> 00:02:36.101
Now, the classifier says,
"Is this cancer or is this not cancer?"

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:37.430
looking at the pictures.

00:02:38.355 --> 00:02:39.919
The classifier was pretty good,

00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:42.652
but not as good as the person,

00:02:43.945 --> 00:02:45.713
who got it right most of the time.

00:02:46.427 --> 00:02:52.607
But when they combine the ability
of the machine and the human together,

00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:55.626
accuracy went to 99.5 percent.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.151
Adding that AI to a partnership
eliminated 85 percent of the errors
