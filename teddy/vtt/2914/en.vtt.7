00:03:29.343 --> 00:03:32.703
is that by combining the abilities
of the human and machine,

00:03:32.727 --> 00:03:37.678
it created a partnership
that had superhuman performance.

00:03:38.543 --> 00:03:41.483
And that is humanistic AI.

00:03:42.787 --> 00:03:44.773
Now let's look at another example

00:03:44.797 --> 00:03:47.084
with turbocharging performance.

00:03:47.108 --> 00:03:48.511
This is design.

00:03:48.535 --> 00:03:50.576
Now, let's say you're an engineer.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.717
You want to design
a new frame for a drone.

00:03:52.741 --> 00:03:55.805
You get out your favorite
software tools, CAD tools,

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.044
and you enter the form and the materials,
and then you analyze performance.
