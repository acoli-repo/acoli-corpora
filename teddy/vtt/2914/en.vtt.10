00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:02.435
Well, how about cognitive enhancement?

00:05:03.904 --> 00:05:05.383
Instead of asking,

00:05:05.407 --> 00:05:07.468
"How smart can we make our machines?"

00:05:07.492 --> 00:05:08.665
let's ask

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:11.394
"How smart can our machines make us?"

00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:14.885
I mean, take memory for example.

00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:18.457
Memory is the foundation
of human intelligence.

00:05:19.767 --> 00:05:22.738
But human memory is famously flawed.

00:05:23.541 --> 00:05:25.615
We're great at telling stories,

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.590
but not getting the details right.

00:05:27.614 --> 00:05:30.820
And our memories -- they decay over time.
