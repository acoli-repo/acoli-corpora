WEBVTT

00:04:28.722 --> 00:04:31.822
is to pick the one that best meets
the goals of the design,

00:04:31.846 --> 00:04:35.185
which she knows as a human
better than anyone else,

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:37.003
using human judgment and expertise.

00:04:37.414 --> 00:04:38.994
In this case, the winning form

00:04:39.018 --> 00:04:41.729
looks kind of like something
nature would have designed,

00:04:41.753 --> 00:04:43.868
minus a few million years of evolution

00:04:43.892 --> 00:04:46.273
and all that unnecessary fur.

00:04:48.424 --> 00:04:53.096
Now let's see where this idea
of humanistic AI might lead us

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.513
if we follow it into
the speculative beyond.

00:04:56.118 --> 00:04:59.122
What's a kind of augmentation
that we would all like to have?

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:02.435
Well, how about cognitive enhancement?
