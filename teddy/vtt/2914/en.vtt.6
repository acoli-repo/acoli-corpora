00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.151
Adding that AI to a partnership
eliminated 85 percent of the errors

00:03:02.175 --> 00:03:05.861
that the human pathologist
would have made working alone.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.979
That's a lot of cancer
that would have otherwise gone untreated.

00:03:11.097 --> 00:03:13.027
Now, for the curious, it turns out

00:03:13.051 --> 00:03:16.525
that the human was better
at rejecting false positives,

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.121
and the machine was better
at recognizing those hard-to-spot cases.

00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:23.382
But the lesson here isn't about
which agent is better

00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:25.484
at this image-classification task.

00:03:25.888 --> 00:03:27.727
Those things are changing every day.

00:03:27.751 --> 00:03:29.319
The lesson here

00:03:29.343 --> 00:03:32.703
is that by combining the abilities
of the human and machine,
