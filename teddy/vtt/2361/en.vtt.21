00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.480
(Laughter)

00:10:30.504 --> 00:10:35.507
it's nuts to believe
that the reasons given to you

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:40.982
dictated that you had
most reason to pursue

00:10:41.006 --> 00:10:42.904
the exact hobbies you do,

00:10:43.952 --> 00:10:46.149
to live in the exact house you do,

00:10:46.173 --> 00:10:48.074
to work at the exact job you do.

00:10:49.471 --> 00:10:53.372
Instead, you faced alternatives
that were on a par --

00:10:53.959 --> 00:10:55.125
hard choices --

00:10:55.149 --> 00:10:58.162
and you made reasons for yourself

00:10:58.186 --> 00:11:01.766
to choose that hobby,
that house and that job.
