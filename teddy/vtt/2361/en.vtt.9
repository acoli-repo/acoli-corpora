00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:31.155
Now, if there's no best option,

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:35.600
if the scales don't tip in favor
of one alternative over another,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.746
then surely the alternatives
must be equally good.

00:04:39.797 --> 00:04:42.068
So maybe the right thing
to say in hard choices

00:04:42.092 --> 00:04:44.315
is that they're
between equally good options.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.931
But that can't be right.

00:04:45.955 --> 00:04:49.509
If alternatives are equally good,
you should just flip a coin between them,

00:04:49.898 --> 00:04:52.309
and it seems a mistake to think,

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:54.883
here's how you should
decide between careers,

00:04:54.907 --> 00:04:56.477
places to live, people to marry:

00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:57.680
Flip a coin.

00:04:59.156 --> 00:05:00.867
There's another reason for thinking
