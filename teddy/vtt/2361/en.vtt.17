The stuff of the other world can't.

00:08:31.712 --> 00:08:35.984
We shouldn't assume that the world of is,
of lengths and weights,

00:08:36.008 --> 00:08:38.915
has the same structure
as the world of ought,

00:08:38.939 --> 00:08:40.166
of what we should do.

00:08:40.904 --> 00:08:42.985
So if what matters to us --

00:08:43.009 --> 00:08:46.523
a child's delight, the love
you have for your partner —

00:08:46.547 --> 00:08:49.351
can't be represented by real numbers,

00:08:49.375 --> 00:08:51.317
then there's no reason to believe

00:08:51.341 --> 00:08:55.157
that in choice, there are only
three possibilities --

00:08:55.181 --> 00:08:59.124
that one alternative is better,
worse or equal to the other.
