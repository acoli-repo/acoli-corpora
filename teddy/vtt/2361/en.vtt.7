00:03:28.843 --> 00:03:31.556
I did what many of us do in hard choices:

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.569
I took the safest option.

00:03:34.466 --> 00:03:38.731
Fear of being an unemployed philosopher
led me to become a lawyer,

00:03:40.256 --> 00:03:43.586
and as I discovered,
lawyering didn't quite fit.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.239
It wasn't who I was.

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.503
So now I'm a philosopher,

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:49.465
and I study hard choices,

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.814
and I can tell you,
that fear of the unknown,

00:03:52.838 --> 00:03:57.264
while a common motivational default
in dealing with hard choices,

00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:00.011
rests on a misconception of them.
