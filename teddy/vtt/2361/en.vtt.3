00:01:29.368 --> 00:01:32.650
We shouldn't think
that all hard choices are big.

00:01:33.023 --> 00:01:35.630
Let's say you're deciding
what to have for breakfast.

00:01:35.654 --> 00:01:38.510
You could have high fiber bran cereal

00:01:38.534 --> 00:01:39.886
or a chocolate donut.

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:43.769
Suppose what matters in the choice
is tastiness and healthfulness.

00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:46.805
The cereal is better for you,

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.986
the donut tastes way better,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.212
but neither is better
than the other overall,

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:52.650
a hard choice.

00:01:53.348 --> 00:01:57.348
Realizing that small choices
can also be hard,

00:01:57.372 --> 00:02:00.698
may make big hard choices
seem less intractable.
