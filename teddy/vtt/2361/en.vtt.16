00:07:57.765 --> 00:08:00.504
and there are only
three possible comparisons

00:08:00.847 --> 00:08:02.693
between any two real numbers.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.765
One number is greater, lesser,
or equal to the other.

00:08:08.475 --> 00:08:10.197
Not so with values.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.267
As post-Enlightenment creatures,

00:08:13.291 --> 00:08:15.241
we tend to assume

00:08:15.265 --> 00:08:20.169
that scientific thinking holds the key
to everything of importance in our world,

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.616
but the world of value
is different from the world of science.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.228
The stuff of the one world
can be quantified by real numbers.

00:08:28.252 --> 00:08:30.572
The stuff of the other world can't.
