00:09:00.464 --> 00:09:04.706
We need to introduce
a new, fourth relation

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.345
beyond being better, worse or equal,

00:09:08.369 --> 00:09:11.519
that describes what's going on
in hard choices.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.769
I like to say that
the alternatives are "on a par."

00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:17.051
When alternatives are on a par,

00:09:17.075 --> 00:09:20.441
it may matter very much which you choose,

00:09:20.465 --> 00:09:23.380
but one alternative
isn't better than the other.

00:09:23.404 --> 00:09:27.782
Rather, the alternatives are
in the same neighborhood of value,

00:09:27.806 --> 00:09:29.853
in the same league of value,

00:09:29.877 --> 00:09:34.034
while at the same time
being very different in kind of value.
