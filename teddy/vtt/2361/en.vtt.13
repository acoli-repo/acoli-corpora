00:06:28.653 --> 00:06:31.593
That's not the case
with options in hard choices.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:34.953
So now we've got a puzzle.

00:06:35.755 --> 00:06:37.363
We've got two jobs.

00:06:37.387 --> 00:06:40.875
Neither is better than the other,
nor are they equally good.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.560
So how are we supposed to choose?

00:06:43.955 --> 00:06:46.527
Something seems to have gone wrong here.

00:06:48.303 --> 00:06:52.915
Maybe the choice itself is problematic,
and comparison is impossible.

00:06:54.184 --> 00:06:55.724
But that can't be right.

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:59.703
It's not like we're trying to choose
between two things that can't be compared.
