00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.557
Not necessarily.

00:06:03.049 --> 00:06:07.156
A higher salary makes the banking job
better than it was before,

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.798
but it might not be enough

00:06:08.822 --> 00:06:12.410
to make being a banker
better than being an artist.

00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:17.766
But if an improvement in one of the jobs
doesn't make it better than the other,

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.073
then the two original jobs
could not have been equally good.

00:06:21.812 --> 00:06:24.209
If you start with two things
that are equally good,

00:06:24.233 --> 00:06:25.574
and you improve one of them,

00:06:25.598 --> 00:06:27.684
it now must be better than the other.

00:06:28.653 --> 00:06:31.593
That's not the case
with options in hard choices.
