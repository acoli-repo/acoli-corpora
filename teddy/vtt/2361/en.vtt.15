00:07:30.006 --> 00:07:35.093
are akin to scientific quantities,
like length, mass and weight.

00:07:37.247 --> 00:07:40.338
Take any comparative question
not involving value,

00:07:40.362 --> 00:07:43.169
such as which of two suitcases is heavier.

00:07:43.907 --> 00:07:46.140
There are only three possibilities.

00:07:46.648 --> 00:07:51.690
The weight of one is greater, lesser
or equal to the weight of the other.

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:55.779
Properties like weight can be
represented by real numbers --

00:07:55.803 --> 00:07:57.741
one, two, three and so on --

00:07:57.765 --> 00:08:00.504
and there are only
three possible comparisons
