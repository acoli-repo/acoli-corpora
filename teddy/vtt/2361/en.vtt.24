but it's not dictated
by reasons given to us.

00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:05.854
Rather, it's supported
by reasons created by us.

00:12:07.765 --> 00:12:10.332
When we create reasons for ourselves

00:12:10.356 --> 00:12:13.622
to become this kind
of person rather than that,

00:12:13.646 --> 00:12:16.826
we wholeheartedly become
the people that we are.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.048
You might say that we become
the authors of our own lives.

00:12:23.047 --> 00:12:27.644
So when we face hard choices,
we shouldn't beat our head against a wall

00:12:27.668 --> 00:12:30.021
trying to figure out
which alternative is better.
