00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:04.031
Think of a hard choice
you'll face in the near future.

00:00:04.391 --> 00:00:06.212
It might be between two careers --

00:00:06.236 --> 00:00:07.683
artist and accountant --

00:00:08.286 --> 00:00:10.734
or places to live --
the city or the country --

00:00:11.123 --> 00:00:12.997
or even between two people to marry --

00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:15.969
you could marry Betty
or you could marry Lolita.

00:00:16.572 --> 00:00:19.565
Or it might be a choice
about whether to have children,

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:21.936
to have an ailing parent move in with you,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.177
to raise your child in a religion
that your partner lives by

00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:26.593
but leaves you cold.

00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:30.073
Or whether to donate
your life savings to charity.
