There are amazing things
you can learn as a philosopher,

00:02:30.576 --> 00:02:33.051
and all from the comfort of an armchair.

00:02:34.106 --> 00:02:36.984
But I came from a modest immigrant family

00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:38.457
where my idea of luxury

00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:40.966
was having a pork tongue
and jelly sandwich

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.533
in my school lunchbox,

00:02:43.232 --> 00:02:45.597
so the thought of spending my whole life

00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:48.580
sitting around in armchairs
just thinking ...

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:52.516
Well, that struck me as the height
of extravagance and frivolity.

00:02:53.357 --> 00:02:55.103
So I got out my yellow pad,

00:02:55.127 --> 00:02:57.010
I drew a line down the middle,

00:02:57.034 --> 00:02:59.431
and I tried my best
to think of the reasons

00:02:59.455 --> 00:03:02.128
for and against each alternative.
