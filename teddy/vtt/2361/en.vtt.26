00:13:00.887 --> 00:13:05.712
Now, people who don't exercise
their normative powers in hard choices

00:13:05.736 --> 00:13:07.062
are drifters.

00:13:07.513 --> 00:13:09.101
We all know people like that.

00:13:09.125 --> 00:13:11.421
I drifted into being a lawyer.

00:13:11.445 --> 00:13:13.579
I didn't put my agency behind lawyering.

00:13:13.603 --> 00:13:15.201
I wasn't for lawyering.

00:13:16.542 --> 00:13:21.415
Drifters allow the world
to write the story of their lives.

00:13:21.439 --> 00:13:25.267
They let mechanisms
of reward and punishment --

00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:29.206
pats on the head, fear,
the easiness of an option --

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:30.920
to determine what they do.
