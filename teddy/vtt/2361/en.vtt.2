00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.359
In any easy choice,

00:01:00.383 --> 00:01:02.521
one alternative is better than the other.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.379
In a hard choice,

00:01:04.403 --> 00:01:06.931
one alternative is better in some ways,

00:01:06.955 --> 00:01:09.156
the other alternative
is better in other ways,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.851
and neither is better
than the other overall.

00:01:12.732 --> 00:01:16.979
You agonize over whether to stay
in your current job in the city

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:21.352
or uproot your life
for more challenging work in the country,

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.681
because staying is better in some ways,

00:01:23.705 --> 00:01:25.305
moving is better in others,

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.067
and neither is better
than the other overall.

00:01:29.368 --> 00:01:32.650
We shouldn't think
that all hard choices are big.
