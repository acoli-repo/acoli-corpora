00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Now what would that look like?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
What does it mean to say that there's an Islamic democracy?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Well, one thing is, it's not going to look identical

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
to democracy as we know it in the United States.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
That may be a good thing, in light of some of the criticisms we've heard today --

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
for example, in the regulatory context -- of what democracy produces.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
or Muslims out in the rest of the world --

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here, there probably are --

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
conceptualize Islam.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
It will be transformative of Islam as well.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And as a result of this convergence,
