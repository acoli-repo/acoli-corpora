00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Within the sphere of people who have that view,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and it's a large number of people in the Muslim world

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
who disagree with bin Laden in his application,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
but agree that Islam is the answer.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Islam represents a way of engaging the world

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
through which one can achieve certain desirable goals.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And the goals from the perspective of Muslims are, in principle,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
peace, justice and equality,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
but on terms that correspond to traditional Muslim teachings.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Now, I don't want to leave a misimpression

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
by identifying either of these propositions --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
rather, either of these phenomena, democracy or Islam -- as technologies.
