00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I want to argue to you that in fact, politics and religion,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
which are the two primary factors --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
not the sole, but overwhelmingly, the primary factors --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which are driving towards a war which looks extremely likely --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
bordering on the inevitable at this point,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
whether one is in favor of that or not --

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that politics and religion are, in fact, themselves

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
better conceptualized as kinds of technology,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and subject to kinds of questions that we regularly consider

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in the space of conceptual design.
