In other words, unlike the word hope,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
which one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and, perhaps, reach some kind of a consensual use analysis,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
these are essentially contested concepts.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
They're ideas about which people disagree in the deepest possible sense.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And as a consequence of this disagreement,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
it's very, very difficult for anyone to say,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
"I have the right version of Islam."

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
You know, post-9/11, we were treated to the amazing phenomenon

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
of George W. Bush saying, "Islam means peace."

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Well, so says George W. Bush.
