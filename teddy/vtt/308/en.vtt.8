00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
rather, either of these phenomena, democracy or Islam -- as technologies.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I don't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And I think a good way to prove this

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
is simply to demonstrate to you what my thought process was

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
when deciding what to put on the wall behind me when I spoke.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And I ran immediately into a conceptual problem:

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
you can't show a picture of democracy.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
You can show a slogan, or a symbol, or a sign that stands for democracy.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
You can show the Capitol --

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I had the same problem when I was designing the cover

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
of my forthcoming book, in fact --

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
what do you put on the cover to show democracy?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And the same problem with respect to Islam.
