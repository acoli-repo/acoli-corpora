00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And the hopeful response derives from recognizing

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
that Islam and democracy are technologies.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And by virtue of being technologies, they're manipulable.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And they're manipulable in ways

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
that can produce some extremely positive outcomes.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
What do I have in mind?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Well, all over the Muslim world there are people

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
who take Islam deeply seriously, people who care about Islam,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
for whom it's a source either of faith, or of civilization, or of deep values,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
or just a source of powerful personal identity,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
are in fact not in conflict, but are in fact deeply compatible.
