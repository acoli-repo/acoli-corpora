00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And that's a transformation in which many sincerely believing Muslims --

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
who care very, very deeply about their traditions,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
who do not want to compromise those values --

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
believe, through the malleability of the technology of democracy

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of Islam,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
that these two ideas can work together.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Now what would that look like?
