00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
in the Muslim world do not want,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
many, many people in the American democracy do not want,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
many people elsewhere in the world do not want,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
but which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people --

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
at least in the relevant space, which is the United States --

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
to actually go forward. So fear is not a crazy response at all.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And I think that that's, in fact, probably the first appropriate response.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
What I want to suggest to you, though, in the next couple of minutes

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
is that there's also a hopeful response to this.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And the hopeful response derives from recognizing

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
that Islam and democracy are technologies.
