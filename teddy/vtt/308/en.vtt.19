00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Now, you may say, but surely, what we've seen on television about Saudi Islam

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
convinces us that it can't possibly be compatible

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
with what we consider the core of democracy --

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
namely, free political choice, basic liberty and basic equality.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But I'm here to tell you that technologies

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
are more malleable than that.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I'm here to tell you that many, many Muslims believe --

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
the vast majority, in fact -- in fact I think I would go so far as to say

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
that many Muslims in Saudi Arabia believe that the core values of Islam,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
namely acknowledgement of God's sovereignty

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
and basic human equality before God,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
are themselves compatible with liberty, equality and free political choice.
