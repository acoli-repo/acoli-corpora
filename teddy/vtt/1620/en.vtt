I grew up

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
in a very small village in Canada,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000

dyslexic.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I had a really hard time in school.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that I was the little kid in the village

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
who cried all the way to school.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I ran away.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and there I met my incredible wife, Cynthia,
