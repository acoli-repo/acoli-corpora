you're going to find them
in that barber shop.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.216
And so what we did was just
organize what was already going on.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.976
And so what I started doing
was mining these alternative viewpoints

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.296
from these alternative digital universes,

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.856
dissecting them, breaking them down
into controversial talking points.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.456
Then, with my cell phone,

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.536
I flipped the internet against itself

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.296
and began to broadcast
these live conversations

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.016
to my online followers.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.056
This made them want to leave
the safety of their laptops

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.416
and meet us in person
to have real conversations
