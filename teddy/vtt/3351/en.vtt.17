the fact is that millennials
get a lifetime of diet brand history.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:34.496
I mean, America seems to be hellbent
on filling its textbooks

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.816
with CliffsNotes versions
of its dark past.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:44.135
This severely, severely decontextualizes
race and the anger associated with it,

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.336
and that is fertile ground
for alt-facts to grow.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.376
Add in the wild landscape of the internet

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.696
and it's easy to sell
rebranded "Mein Kampf" ideas

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.440
to a generation who has been
failed by public schools.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.056
A lot of these ideas, easily debunked.
