"Um, these guys are highly misinformed,

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.440
at least according to my knowledge."

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.536
Where are these guys
getting these arguments from?

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.896
Like, was there some kind
of alternative universe

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.176
with alternative facts?

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.176
(Laughter)

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.160
(Applause)

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.816
Was history and gravity
optional over there?

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.040
I don't know.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.856
But I needed to know.
Like, I wanted to know.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.256
And as it turns out, I had no idea
about digital echo chambers.
