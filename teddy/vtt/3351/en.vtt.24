00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.616
you have to let go of that fear

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.336
and embrace your curiosity,

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.816
and sadly, too many people
will not take that journey

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.856
to see the world from the other side.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.456
And, I mean, let's be honest,

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.616
that doesn't just go for progressives,

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.896
but also to the right wing

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.136
You know, as fair
as some of their points were,

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.576

in their own echo chambers,

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.976
recycling old, outdated points of view,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.536
never getting a diversity in perspective,

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.296
not making them well-rounded
in their worldview.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:32.136
So they're not hearing
certain anti-racist and political voices,
