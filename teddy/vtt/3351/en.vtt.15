00:07:28.124 --> 00:07:31.416
(Laughter)

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.536
But when I went undercover,
I found a lovely plethora of characters,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.576
luminaries like Milo Yiannopoulos,
Richard Spencer and David Duke.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.936
All of these guys were
thought leaders in their own right,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.696
but over time, the alt-right movement
ended up using their information

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.376
to fuel their momentum.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.856
And I'm going to tell you what else
led to the momentum of the alt-right:

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:01.616
the left wing's wholesale demonization
of everything white and male.
