00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.176
about how the World Wide Web

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.200
was going to span the reaches
of people across the globe.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.656
But as it turns out, people are people.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.296
(Laughter)

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.176
And this magical superhighway

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.096
also took the demons of our nature

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.736
and gave them Ferraris.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.296
(Laughter)

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.016
You see, technology, y'all,
is a lot like money.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.616
It just brings out what's already
inside you and amplifies it.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.920
And so I soon became familiar
with the phenomenon of the internet troll.
