00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.256
And as it turns out, I had no idea
about digital echo chambers.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.296
That same target marketing algorithm

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.976
that feeds you more
of the products you like to buy

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.096
also feeds you more
of the news that you like to hear.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.896
I had been living in an online universe

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.495
that just reflected
my worldview back to me.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.336
So my timeline was pretty liberal.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.216
I had no Breitbart
or Infowars or Fox News.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.680
No, no, I was all MSNBC
and The Daily Show,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.496
CNN and theGrio, right?
