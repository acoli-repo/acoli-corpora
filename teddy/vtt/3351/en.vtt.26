00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.896
And this whole experience
taught me something:

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.760
our gadgets ain't going to save us.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.336
All these technological devices

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.056
are only mastery of the universe
out there, not the one in here.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.336
And so that's all IQ, not EQ.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.176
That's a dangerous imbalance.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.016
Where do you get
the emotional intelligence,

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.896
the character development,

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.616
the virtues of patience,
forbearance, compassion,

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.816
you know, the things that make sure
that these devices, however advanced,

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.760
become a blessing and not a curse?
