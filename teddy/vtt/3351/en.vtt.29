00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.456
and when the chips are down,

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.136
conversations are the last tools
that humans use

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.640
before they pick up their guns.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.096
And I ain't talking
about online safe conversations

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:40.736
from the security of your laptop.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.176
No.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.896
I'm talking about in-your-face
conversations with real, breathing people.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.136
And for me, this looks
like running a community forum

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.056
called Shop Talk Live.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.680
Now, in Shop Talk Live --
somebody's been there, right?

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.616
In Shop Talk Live,

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.096
we have the conversations
that change lives.
