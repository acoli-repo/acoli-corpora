00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:31.210
it's called free fall.

00:00:31.234 --> 00:00:33.240
You're actually falling towards the Earth.

00:00:33.264 --> 00:00:35.952
Think about this for a moment:
that's the feeling you get

00:00:35.976 --> 00:00:40.265
if you're going over the top
of a roller coaster, going, like, "Whoa!"

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:41.442
Only you're doing this

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.466
the whole time you're orbiting the Earth,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.587
for two, three, four hours, days.

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:46.826
Whatever it takes, right?

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.540
So, how does orbiting work?

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:50.481
Let's take a page from Isaac Newton.

00:00:50.505 --> 00:00:52.616
He had this idea,
a little mental experiment:

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.882
You take a cannon,

00:00:53.906 --> 00:00:55.265
you put it on top of a hill.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.647
If you shoot the cannonball,

00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:57.956
it goes a little bit away.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.275
But if you shoot it harder,

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.899
it goes far enough so that it lands
