00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.899
it goes far enough so that it lands

00:01:01.923 --> 00:01:04.117
a little bit past the curvature of Earth.

00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:06.889
Well, you can imagine if you shot
it really, really, hard,

00:01:06.913 --> 00:01:08.891
it would go all the way around the Earth

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:12.146
and come back -- boom! -- and hit you
in the backside or something.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.664
Let's zoom way back
and put you in a little satellite

00:01:14.688 --> 00:01:16.268
over the North Pole of the Earth

00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:17.892
and consider north to be up.

00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:19.991
You're going to fall down
and hit the Earth.

00:01:20.015 --> 00:01:23.923
But you are actually moving
sideways really fast.

00:01:23.947 --> 00:01:25.272
So when you fall down,

00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:26.589
you're going to miss.

00:01:26.613 --> 00:01:29.853
You're going to end up on the side
of the Earth, falling down,

00:01:29.877 --> 00:01:32.600
and now the Earth is pulling
you back in sideways.
