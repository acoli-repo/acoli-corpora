00:01:58.032 --> 00:02:01.035
You'll keep missing
because you're moving so fast.

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:03.459
In this way, astronauts orbit the Earth.

00:02:03.483 --> 00:02:05.894
They're always falling towards the Earth,

00:02:05.918 --> 00:02:09.475
but they're always missing, and therefore,
they're falling all the time.

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:12.534
They feel like they're falling,
so you just have to get over it.

00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:16.729
So technically, if you ran
fast enough and tripped,

00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:18.991
you could miss the Earth.

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:20.375
But there's a big problem.

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:24.208
First, you have to be going
eight kilometers a second.

00:02:24.232 --> 00:02:26.431
That's 18,000 miles an hour,

00:02:26.455 --> 00:02:28.217
just over Mach 23!

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:30.031
The second problem:
