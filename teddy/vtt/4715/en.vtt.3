00:01:29.877 --> 00:01:32.600
and now the Earth is pulling
you back in sideways.

00:01:32.624 --> 00:01:34.781
So it's pulling you back in
and you fall down,

00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:38.130
and so you miss the Earth again,
and now you're under the Earth.

00:01:38.154 --> 00:01:41.346
The Earth is going to pull you up,
but you're moving sideways still.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.292
So you're going to miss the Earth again.

00:01:43.316 --> 00:01:46.054
Now you're on the other side
of the Earth, moving upward,

00:01:46.078 --> 00:01:47.843
and the Earth's pulling you sideways.

00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:49.446
So you're going to fall sideways,

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.978
but you're going to be moving up
and so you'll miss.

00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:54.968
Now you're back on top of the Earth
again, over the North Pole,

00:01:54.992 --> 00:01:56.713
going sideways and falling down,

00:01:56.737 --> 00:01:58.008
and yep -- you guessed it.

00:01:58.032 --> 00:02:01.035
You'll keep missing
because you're moving so fast.
