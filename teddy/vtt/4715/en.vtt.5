00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:30.031
The second problem:

00:02:30.055 --> 00:02:31.316
If you're going that fast,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.733
yes, you would orbit the Earth
and come back where you came from,

00:02:34.757 --> 00:02:36.536
but there's a lot of air in the way,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.901
much less people and things.

00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:40.219
So you would burn up
due to atmospheric friction.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:42.845
So, I do not recommend this.
