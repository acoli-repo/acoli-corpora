Have you ever been floating
in a swimming pool,

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.525
all comfy and warm, thinking,

00:00:18.549 --> 00:00:20.371
"Man, it'd be cool to be an astronaut!

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:23.900
You could float out in outer space,
look down at the Earth and everything.

00:00:23.924 --> 00:00:25.082
It'd be so neat!"

00:00:25.106 --> 00:00:26.689
Only that's not how it is at all.

00:00:26.713 --> 00:00:29.252
If you are in outer space,
you are orbiting the Earth:

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:31.210
it's called free fall.
