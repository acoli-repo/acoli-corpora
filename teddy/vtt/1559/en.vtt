00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I don't speak English.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I start speaking English, learning English, about a year ago.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I speak French and I grew up with French, so my English is Franglais.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm born in the Western Congo, in an area around here,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and then went to university in Kisangani.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And after I finished, I went to this area, the Ituri Forest.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But what I've been doing --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
when I was about 14, I grew in my uncle's house.
