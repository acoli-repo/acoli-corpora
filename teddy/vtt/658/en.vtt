00:00:01.413 --> 00:00:05.627
It was a Sunday afternoon
back in April of this year.

00:00:05.651 --> 00:00:07.500
My phone was ringing,

00:00:07.524 --> 00:00:08.868
I picked it up.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.394
The voice said, "It's Rebecca.

00:00:12.847 --> 00:00:15.395
I'm just calling to invite you

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:16.722
to my funeral."

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.569
I said, "Rebecca,
what are you talking about?"

00:00:21.593 --> 00:00:26.721
She said, "Joy, as my friend,
you have to let me go.

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:28.385
It's my time."

00:00:29.854 --> 00:00:32.179
The next day, she was dead.
