This is my favorite protest shirt.

00:00:03.897 --> 00:00:06.103
It says, "Protect your people."

00:00:06.127 --> 00:00:09.047
We made it in the basement
of our community center.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.744
I've worn it at rallies,

00:00:11.768 --> 00:00:14.800
at protests and marches,

00:00:14.824 --> 00:00:16.641
at candlelight vigils

00:00:16.665 --> 00:00:19.919
with families who have lost loved ones
to police violence.

00:00:20.674 --> 00:00:24.388
I've seen how this ethic
of community organizing

00:00:24.412 --> 00:00:27.308
has been able to change
arresting practices,

00:00:27.332 --> 00:00:30.434
hold individual officers accountable
