00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.736
"Oh, well, now that
I'm getting credit for my good deed,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.096
now it's totally worth it."

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.576
And you're right.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.840
Usually, people don't.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.816
Rather, when they're making
decisions in private,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.576
they worry about their own problems,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.736
about what to put on the table for dinner
or how to pay their bills on time.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.856
But, when we make
their decision more observable,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.960
they start to attend more
to the opportunity to do good.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.576
In other words, what's
so powerful about our approach

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.456
is that it could turn on
people's existing desire to do good,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.560
in this case, to help
to prevent a blackout.
