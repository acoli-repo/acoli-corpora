and it asked them to call
into a hotline if they were interested.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.376
Those letters went out,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.160
but the phones, they were silent.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.840
So when we got involved,
we suggested one small change.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.256
Instead of that hotline,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.896
we suggested that they use sign-up sheets
that they'd post near the mailboxes

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.160
in people's buildings.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.880
This tripled participation.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.360
Why?

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.896
Well, we all know people care deeply
about what others think of them,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.576
that we try to be seen
as generous and kind,
