That antibiotic is so strong
that it will make you feel sick.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.256
It will make you feel nauseous and dizzy.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.200
It will make your pee turn funny colors.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.616
It's also a problem because
you have to go back to the clinic

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.056
about every week
in order to get more pills,

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.536
and in sub-Saharan Africa
or other places where TB is common,

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.016

about going someplace pretty far,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.056
taking tough and slow public transport,

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.136
maybe the clinic is inefficient.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.376
So now you're talking about taking
a half day off of work every week

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.280
from a job you desperately
can't afford to lose.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.416
It's even worse when you consider the fact
that there's a terrible stigma,
