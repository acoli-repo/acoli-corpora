How can we get people to do more good,

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.856
to go to the polls,
give to charity, conserve resources,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.216
or even to do something as simple
as washing their mugs at work

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.621
so that the sink isn't
always full of dirty dishes?

00:00:14.645 --> 00:00:16.656
(Laughter)

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.016
(Applause)

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.176
When I first started
working on this problem,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.096
I collaborated with a power company

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.656
to recruit customers for a program
that prevents blackouts

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.680
by reducing energy demand during peaks.
