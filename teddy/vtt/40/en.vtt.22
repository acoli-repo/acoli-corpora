00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.440
What about this one?

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.736
Here's another way
to communicate expectations;

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.840
simply do it by saying, "Do the good deed"
just at the right time.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.040
What about this one?

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.936
This ticker reframes

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.776
the kind of mundane task
of turning off the lights

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.640
and turns it instead
into an environmental contribution.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.136
The bottom line is,
lots of different ways to do this,

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.216
lots of ways to communicate expectations.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.526
Just don't forget to do it.
