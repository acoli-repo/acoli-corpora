What about this example?

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.616
Toyota got hundreds of thousands of people
to buy a more fuel-efficient car

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.256
by making the Prius so unique ...

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.880
(Laughter)

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.480
that their good deed
was observable from a mile away.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.856
(Laughter)

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.255

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.816
but we all know, we've all seen

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.000
people walk by an opportunity to do good.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.376
They'll see somebody
asking for money on the sidewalk
