00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.736
Like the blackout prevention program,
we've got the solution.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.000
The problem is people.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.736
People need to take their medication

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.656
so that they're cured,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.840
and so that they don't
get other people sick.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.656
For a few years now,
we've been collaborating

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.976
with a mobile health startup
called Keheala

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.680
to support TB patients
as they undergo treatment.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.376
Now, you have to understand,
TB treatment, it's really tough.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.976
We're talking about taking
a really strong antibiotic

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.336
every single day for six months or more.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.256
That antibiotic is so strong
that it will make you feel sick.
