00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.176
Every day, we text patients
to remind them to take their medication,

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.736
but if we stopped there,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.816
there'd be lots of excuses.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.296
"Well, I didn't see the text."

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.015
Or, "You know, I saw the text,
but then I totally forgot,

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:44.256
put the phone down
and I just forgot about it."

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.080
Or, "I lent the phone out to my mom."

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.616
We have to eliminate these excuses

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.656
and we do that by asking patients

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.640
to log in and verify
that they've taken their medication.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.936
If they don't log in, we text them again.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.056
If they don't log in,
we text them yet again.
