00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.680
by reducing energy demand during peaks.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.216
The program is based
on a tried-and-true technology.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.616
It's one the Obama
administration even called

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.760
"the cornerstone to modernizing
America's electrical grid."

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.376
But, like so many
great technological solutions,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.840
it has a key weakness:

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.960
people.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.960
People need to sign up.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.536
To try to get people to sign up,
the power company sent them a nice letter,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.576
told them about
all the program's benefits,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.656
and it asked them to call
into a hotline if they were interested.
