00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.456
This one is from a collaboration

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.856
with a nonprofit that gets out the vote,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.456
and it does this by sending hundreds
of thousands of letters every election

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.800
in order to remind people and try
to motivate them to go to the polls.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.920
We suggested adding

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.840
"Someone may call you to find out
about your experience at the polls."

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.920
This sentence makes it feel
more observable when you go to the polls,
