00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.656
Obviously, it's better for others

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.976
when we stand on the right
and let them go by,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.720
but we're only expected
to do that some places.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.136
This is a general phenomenon.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.216
Sometimes we're expected to do good

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.056
and sometimes not,

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.456
and it means that people
are really sensitive to cues

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.440
that they're expected to do good
in a particular situation,

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.296
which brings us to the third
and final item on our checklist:

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.096
to communicate expectations,

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.536
to tell people,

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.640
"Do the good deed right now."
