that we try to be seen
as generous and kind,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.320
and we try to avoid
being seen as selfish or a mooch.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.536
Whether we are aware of it or not,
this is a big part of why people do good,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.776
and so small changes that give people
more credit for doing good,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.136
those changes can make
a really big difference.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.056
Small changes like
switching from a hotline,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.096
where nobody will ever find out
about your good deed,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.856
to a sign-up sheet

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.000
where anyone who walks by
can see your name.
