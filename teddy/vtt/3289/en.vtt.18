00:08:57.438 --> 00:09:00.288
but it did lead to some
later research that I did at MIT

00:09:00.312 --> 00:09:02.540
with Palash Nandy and Cynthia Breazeal,

00:09:02.564 --> 00:09:06.191
where we had people come into the lab
and smash these HEXBUGs

00:09:06.215 --> 00:09:09.302
that move around in a really
lifelike way, like insects.

00:09:09.326 --> 00:09:12.460
So instead of choosing something cute
that people are drawn to,

00:09:12.484 --> 00:09:14.577
we chose something more basic,

00:09:14.601 --> 00:09:18.081
and what we found
was that high-empathy people

00:09:18.105 --> 00:09:20.248
would hesitate more to hit the HEXBUGS.

00:09:21.575 --> 00:09:23.139
Now this is just a little study,

00:09:23.163 --> 00:09:25.552
but it's part of a larger body of research

00:09:25.576 --> 00:09:28.520
that is starting to indicate
that there may be a connection

00:09:28.544 --> 00:09:30.917
between people's tendencies for empathy
