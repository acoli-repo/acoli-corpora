There was a day, about 10 years ago,

00:00:03.579 --> 00:00:07.523
when I asked a friend to hold
a baby dinosaur robot upside down.

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.335
It was this toy called a Pleo
that I had ordered,

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:17.760
and I was really excited about it
because I've always loved robots.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:20.063
And this one has really cool
technical features.

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:22.206
It had motors and touch sensors

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.474
and it had an infrared camera.

00:00:24.498 --> 00:00:27.261
And one of the things it had
was a tilt sensor,

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:29.603
so it knew what direction it was facing.
