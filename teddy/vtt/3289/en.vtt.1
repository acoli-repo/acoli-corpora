And when you held it upside down,

00:00:32.253 --> 00:00:33.825
it would start to cry.

00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:38.023
And I thought this was super cool,
so I was showing it off to my friend,

00:00:38.047 --> 00:00:40.852
and I said, "Oh, hold it up by the tail.
See what it does."

00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:46.893
So we're watching
the theatrics of this robot

00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:49.116
struggle and cry out.

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:52.814
And after a few seconds,

00:00:52.838 --> 00:00:54.810
it starts to bother me a little,

00:00:55.744 --> 00:00:59.168
and I said, "OK, that's enough now.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.235
Let's put him back down."
