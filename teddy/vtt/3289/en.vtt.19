00:09:28.544 --> 00:09:30.917
between people's tendencies for empathy

00:09:30.941 --> 00:09:32.917
and their behavior around robots.

00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:37.348
But my question for the coming era
of human-robot interaction

00:09:37.372 --> 00:09:40.427
is not: "Do we empathize with robots?"

00:09:41.211 --> 00:09:44.131
It's: "Can robots change
people's empathy?"

00:09:45.489 --> 00:09:47.776
Is there reason to, for example,

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.133
prevent your child
from kicking a robotic dog,

00:09:51.228 --> 00:09:54.142
not just out of respect for property,

00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:57.119
but because the child might be
more likely to kick a real dog?

00:09:58.507 --> 00:10:00.390
And again, it's not just kids.
