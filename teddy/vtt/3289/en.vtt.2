Let's put him back down."

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:04.814
And then I pet the robot
to make it stop crying.

00:01:06.973 --> 00:01:09.425
And that was kind of
a weird experience for me.

00:01:10.084 --> 00:01:14.653
For one thing, I wasn't the most
maternal person at the time.

00:01:14.677 --> 00:01:17.408
Although since then I've become
a mother, nine months ago,

00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:20.865
and I've learned that babies also squirm
when you hold them upside down.

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:22.452
(Laughter)

00:01:23.023 --> 00:01:25.381
But my response to this robot
was also interesting

00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:29.506
because I knew exactly
how this machine worked,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.792
and yet I still felt
compelled to be kind to it.
