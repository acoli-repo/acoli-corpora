It's just a disc that roams
around your floor to clean it,

00:03:32.824 --> 00:03:35.130
but just the fact it's moving
around on its own

00:03:35.154 --> 00:03:37.321
will cause people to name the Roomba

00:03:37.345 --> 00:03:40.527
and feel bad for the Roomba
when it gets stuck under the couch.

00:03:40.551 --> 00:03:42.416
(Laughter)

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.780
And we can design robots
specifically to evoke this response,

00:03:45.804 --> 00:03:49.265
using eyes and faces or movements

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:52.548
that people automatically,
subconsciously associate

00:03:52.572 --> 00:03:54.592
with states of mind.

00:03:54.616 --> 00:03:57.909
And there's an entire body of research
called human-robot interaction

00:03:57.933 --> 00:03:59.759
that really shows how well this works.

00:03:59.783 --> 00:04:02.909
So for example, researchers
at Stanford University found out
