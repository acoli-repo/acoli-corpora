but it goes a little bit deeper than that.

00:03:00.287 --> 00:03:05.596
It turns out that we're biologically
hardwired to project intent and life

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.386
onto any movement in our physical space
that seems autonomous to us.

00:03:11.214 --> 00:03:14.679
So people will treat all sorts
of robots like they're alive.

00:03:14.703 --> 00:03:17.386
These bomb-disposal units get names.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.092
They get medals of honor.

00:03:19.116 --> 00:03:21.441
They've had funerals for them
with gun salutes.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.213
And research shows that we do this
even with very simple household robots,

00:03:26.237 --> 00:03:28.372
like the Roomba vacuum cleaner.

00:03:28.396 --> 00:03:29.687

00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:32.800
It's just a disc that roams
around your floor to clean it,
