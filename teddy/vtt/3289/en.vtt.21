00:10:30.622 --> 00:10:34.567
But the answer to this question has
the potential to impact human behavior,

00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:37.359
it has the potential
to impact social norms,

00:10:37.383 --> 00:10:41.232
it has the potential to inspire rules
around what we can and can't do

00:10:41.256 --> 00:10:42.407
with certain robots,

00:10:42.431 --> 00:10:44.279
similar to our animal cruelty laws.

00:10:45.228 --> 00:10:48.092
Because even if robots can't feel,

00:10:48.116 --> 00:10:51.196
our behavior towards them
might matter for us.

00:10:52.889 --> 00:10:55.744
And regardless of whether
we end up changing our rules,

00:10:56.926 --> 00:11:00.482
robots might be able to help us
come to a new understanding of ourselves.
