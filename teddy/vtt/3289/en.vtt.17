"We're going to destroy all of the robots

00:08:30.289 --> 00:08:32.574
unless someone takes
a hatchet to one of them."

00:08:33.586 --> 00:08:37.165
And this guy stood up,
and he took the hatchet,

00:08:37.189 --> 00:08:39.895
and the whole room winced
as he brought the hatchet down

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.699
on the robot's neck,

00:08:41.723 --> 00:08:48.061
and there was this half-joking,
half-serious moment of silence in the room

00:08:48.085 --> 00:08:49.783
for this fallen robot.

00:08:49.807 --> 00:08:51.213
(Laughter)

00:08:51.237 --> 00:08:54.931
So that was a really
interesting experience.

00:08:54.955 --> 00:08:57.414
Now, it wasn't a controlled
study, obviously,

00:08:57.438 --> 00:09:00.288
but it did lead to some
later research that I did at MIT
