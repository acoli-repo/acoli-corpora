00:07:30.549 --> 00:07:32.161
And those aren't the only reasons

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:34.755
that our behavior around
these machines could matter.

00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:40.017
A few years after that first
initial experience I had

00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:42.352
with this baby dinosaur robot,

00:07:42.376 --> 00:07:44.877
I did a workshop
with my friend Hannes Gassert.

00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:47.798
And we took five
of these baby dinosaur robots

00:07:47.822 --> 00:07:50.275
and we gave them to five teams of people.

00:07:50.299 --> 00:07:51.996
And we had them name them

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.829
and play with them and interact with them
for about an hour.

00:07:56.707 --> 00:07:58.913
And then we unveiled
a hammer and a hatchet

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:01.215
and we told them to torture
and kill the robots.
