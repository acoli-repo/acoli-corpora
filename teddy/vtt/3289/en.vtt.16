00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:04.246
(Laughter)

00:08:04.857 --> 00:08:07.151

than we expected it to be,

00:08:08.477 --> 00:08:11.549

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:27.034
And even that didn't work.
They couldn't do it.

00:08:27.058 --> 00:08:28.209
So finally, we said,

00:08:28.233 --> 00:08:30.265
"We're going to destroy all of the robots
