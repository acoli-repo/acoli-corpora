00:05:27.066 --> 00:05:30.693
because if we're trying to integrate
robots into these shared spaces,

00:05:30.717 --> 00:05:35.345
we need to understand that people will
treat them differently than other devices,

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:37.213
and that in some cases,

00:05:37.237 --> 00:05:40.409
for example, the case of a soldier
who becomes emotionally attached

00:05:40.433 --> 00:05:42.480
to the robot that they work with,

00:05:42.504 --> 00:05:45.008
that can be anything
from inefficient to dangerous.

00:05:46.551 --> 00:05:48.689
But in other cases,
it can actually be useful

00:05:48.713 --> 00:05:51.336
to foster this emotional
connection to robots.

00:05:52.184 --> 00:05:54.318
We're already seeing some great use cases,

00:05:54.342 --> 00:05:56.946
for example, robots working
with autistic children

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.604
to engage them in ways
that we haven't seen previously,
