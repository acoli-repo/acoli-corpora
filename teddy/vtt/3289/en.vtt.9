It's entering workplaces, households.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.069
And as these machines that can sense
and make autonomous decisions and learn

00:04:38.093 --> 00:04:40.645
enter into these shared spaces,

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.165
I think that maybe the best
analogy we have for this

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:45.124
is our relationship with animals.

00:04:45.523 --> 00:04:49.411
Thousands of years ago,
we started to domesticate animals,

00:04:49.435 --> 00:04:53.480
and we trained them for work
and weaponry and companionship.

00:04:53.504 --> 00:04:58.489
And throughout history, we've treated
some animals like tools or like products,

00:04:58.513 --> 00:05:00.687
and other animals,
we've treated with kindness
