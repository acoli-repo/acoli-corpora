00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:31.037
And the colonel who was in charge
of this testing exercise

00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:33.179
ends up calling it off,

00:02:33.203 --> 00:02:35.638
because, he says, it's too inhumane

00:02:35.662 --> 00:02:40.178
to watch this damaged robot
drag itself along the minefield.

00:02:42.978 --> 00:02:46.875
Now, what would cause
a hardened military officer

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:48.942
and someone like myself

00:02:48.966 --> 00:02:50.823
to have this response to robots?

00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:54.847
Well, of course, we're primed
by science fiction and pop culture

00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:57.450
to really want to personify these things,

00:02:57.474 --> 00:03:00.263
but it goes a little bit deeper than that.
