them more like an animal than a device.

00:07:03.502 --> 00:07:05.882
Acknowledging this emotional
connection to robots

00:07:05.906 --> 00:07:07.875
can also help us anticipate challenges

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:11.350
as these devices move into more intimate
areas of people's lives.

00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:15.515
For example, is it OK
if your child's teddy bear robot

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:17.776
records private conversations?

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.863
Is it OK if your sex robot
has compelling in-app purchases?

00:07:21.887 --> 00:07:23.283
(Laughter)

00:07:23.307 --> 00:07:25.808
Because robots plus capitalism

00:07:25.832 --> 00:07:29.537
equals questions around
consumer protection and privacy.
