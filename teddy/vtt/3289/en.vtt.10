and other animals,
we've treated with kindness

00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:03.789
and we've given a place in society
as our companions.

00:05:03.813 --> 00:05:07.662
I think it's plausible we might start
to integrate robots in similar ways.

00:05:09.484 --> 00:05:12.580
And sure, animals are alive.

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:13.754
Robots are not.

00:05:15.626 --> 00:05:18.206
And I can tell you,
from working with roboticists,

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.752
that we're pretty far away from developing
robots that can feel anything.

00:05:23.072 --> 00:05:24.532
But we feel for them,

00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:27.042
and that matters,

00:05:27.066 --> 00:05:30.693
because if we're trying to integrate
robots into these shared spaces,
