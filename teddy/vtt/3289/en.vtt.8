00:03:59.783 --> 00:04:02.909
So for example, researchers
at Stanford University found out

00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:04.934
that it makes people really uncomfortable

00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.430
when you ask them to touch
a robot's private parts.

00:04:07.454 --> 00:04:09.574
(Laughter)

00:04:09.598 --> 00:04:11.621
So from this, but from many other studies,

00:04:11.645 --> 00:04:15.868
we know, we know that people
respond to the cues given to them

00:04:15.892 --> 00:04:17.914
by these lifelike machines,

00:04:17.938 --> 00:04:19.955
even if they know that they're not real.

00:04:21.654 --> 00:04:25.710
Now, we're headed towards a world
where robots are everywhere.

00:04:25.734 --> 00:04:28.799
Robotic technology is moving out
from behind factory walls.

00:04:28.823 --> 00:04:31.836
It's entering workplaces, households.
