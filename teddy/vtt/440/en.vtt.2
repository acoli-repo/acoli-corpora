00:00:57.674 --> 00:01:01.084
We're going to remember those moments
when our kid took their first step

00:01:01.108 --> 00:01:03.476
or when we got picked
for the football team

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.388
or when we fell in love.

00:01:05.412 --> 00:01:09.699
So Artichoke exists to create
moving, ephemeral moments

00:01:09.723 --> 00:01:13.905
that transform the physical world
using the imagination of the artist

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:17.291
to show us what is possible.

00:01:17.716 --> 00:01:20.076
We create beauty amongst ruins.

00:01:20.474 --> 00:01:22.396
We reexamine our history.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.101
We create moments to which
everyone is invited,

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:27.549
either to witness or to take part.

00:01:29.246 --> 00:01:31.649
It all started for me
way back in the 1990s,
