WEBVTT

00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:00.736
or a triumphant cricket team coming home.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.392
We close the streets. Everybody claps.

00:04:03.416 --> 00:04:05.845
But for theater? Not possible.

00:04:06.408 --> 00:04:10.379
Except a story told by a French company:

00:04:10.403 --> 00:04:13.941
a saga about a little girl
and a giant elephant

00:04:13.965 --> 00:04:16.264
that came to visit

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:17.644
for four days.

00:04:17.668 --> 00:04:20.681
And all I had to do was persuade
the public authorities

00:04:20.705 --> 00:04:24.302
that shutting the city for four days
was something completely normal.

00:04:24.326 --> 00:04:25.717
(Laughter)

00:04:25.741 --> 00:04:29.479
No traffic, just people
enjoying themselves,

00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:33.403
coming out to marvel and witness
this extraordinary artistic endeavor
