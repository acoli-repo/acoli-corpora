00:08:58.709 --> 00:09:02.519
And out of their extraordinary
work rose a temple

00:09:02.543 --> 00:09:05.861
to rival the two cathedrals
that exist in the town,

00:09:05.885 --> 00:09:08.011
one Catholic and one Protestant.

00:09:08.035 --> 00:09:11.212
But this was a temple to no religion,

00:09:11.236 --> 00:09:12.617
for everyone,

00:09:12.641 --> 00:09:15.601
for no community, but for everyone.

00:09:15.625 --> 00:09:18.885
And we put it in this place
where everyone told me nobody would come.

00:09:18.909 --> 00:09:21.442
It was too dangerous.
It sat between two communities.

00:09:21.466 --> 00:09:23.952
I just kept saying,
"But it's got such a great view."

00:09:23.976 --> 00:09:25.976
(Laughter)

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.664
And again, that same old question:

00:09:27.688 --> 00:09:29.410
Why wouldn't we do this?

00:09:29.434 --> 00:09:30.747
What you see in the picture
