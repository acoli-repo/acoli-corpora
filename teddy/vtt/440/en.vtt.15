00:07:28.829 --> 00:07:31.625
For generations,
it's been a place of conflict,

00:07:31.649 --> 00:07:34.682
the largely Catholic republic in the south

00:07:34.706 --> 00:07:38.359
and the largely Protestant
loyalist community --

00:07:38.383 --> 00:07:40.705
hundreds of years of conflict,

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.494
British troops on the streets
for over 30 years.

00:07:44.518 --> 00:07:47.506
And now, although
there is a peace process,

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.598
this is today in this city, called
Londonderry if you're a loyalist,

00:07:51.622 --> 00:07:53.927
called Derry if you're a Catholic.

00:07:55.753 --> 00:07:57.755
But everybody calls it home.

00:07:57.779 --> 00:07:58.962
And I began to wonder

00:07:58.986 --> 00:08:03.514
whether there was a way in which
the community tribalism could be addressed
