It was our first show, and it changed
the nature of the appreciation of culture,

00:06:34.247 --> 00:06:37.497
not in a gallery, not in a theater,
not in an opera house,

00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:39.523
but live and on the streets,

00:06:39.547 --> 00:06:43.102
transforming public space
for the broadest possible audience,

00:06:43.126 --> 00:06:45.598
people who would never
buy a ticket to see anything.

00:06:45.995 --> 00:06:47.176
So there we were.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.660
We'd finished, and we've continued
to produce work of this kind.

00:06:52.644 --> 00:06:55.916
As you can see, the company's
work is astonishing,

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.661
but what's also astonishing is the fact
that permission was granted.
