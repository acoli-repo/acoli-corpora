00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:31.065
we can transform both
our physical surroundings,

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.140
but in doing so, we can change
forever how we feel

00:00:35.164 --> 00:00:38.459
and how we feel about the people
that we share the planet with.

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:44.312
My company, Artichoke,
which I cofounded in 2006,

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:46.829
was set up to create moments.

00:00:46.853 --> 00:00:50.091
We all have moments in our lives,
and when we're on our deathbeds,

00:00:50.115 --> 00:00:52.639
we're not going to remember
the daily commute to work

00:00:52.663 --> 00:00:53.818
on the number 38 bus

00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:57.650
or our struggle to find a parking space
every day when we go to the shop.

00:00:57.674 --> 00:01:01.084
We're going to remember those moments
when our kid took their first step
