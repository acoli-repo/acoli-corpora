00:01:29.246 --> 00:01:31.649
It all started for me
way back in the 1990s,

00:01:31.673 --> 00:01:36.424
when I was appointed as festival director
in the tiny British city of Salisbury.

00:01:36.448 --> 00:01:38.349
You'll probably have heard of it.

00:01:38.373 --> 00:01:42.316
Here's the Salisbury Cathedral,
and here's the nearby Stonehenge Monument,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.090
which is world-famous.

00:01:44.114 --> 00:01:48.408
Salisbury is a city that's been dominated
for hundreds of years by the Church,

00:01:48.432 --> 00:01:49.716
the Conservative Party

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.924
and the army.

00:01:51.852 --> 00:01:55.528
It's a place where people
really love to observe the rules.

00:01:55.552 --> 00:01:58.512
So picture me on my first
year in the city,

00:01:58.536 --> 00:02:01.711
cycling the wrong way
down a one-way street, late.
