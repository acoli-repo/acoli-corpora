00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.506
Not a classical concert in a church
or a poetry reading,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.723
but the work of a French
street theater company

00:02:35.747 --> 00:02:37.502
who were telling the story of Faust,

00:02:37.526 --> 00:02:42.027
"Mephistomania," on stilts,
complete with handheld pyrotechnics.

00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:45.940
The day after, the same little old lady
stopped me in the street and said,

00:02:45.964 --> 00:02:49.437
"Were you responsible for last night?"

00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:50.944
I backed away.

00:02:50.968 --> 00:02:52.785
(Laughter)

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:54.142
"Yes."

00:02:54.963 --> 00:02:58.141
"When I heard about it," she said,
"I knew it wasn't for me.

00:02:58.165 --> 00:03:00.932
But Helen, my dear, it was."
