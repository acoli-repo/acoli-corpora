00:01:58.536 --> 00:02:01.711
cycling the wrong way
down a one-way street, late.

00:02:01.735 --> 00:02:02.892
I'm always late.

00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:05.067
It's a wonder I've even turned up today.

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:06.625
(Laughter)

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.552
A little old lady on the sidewalk
helpfully shouted at me,

00:02:09.576 --> 00:02:11.839
"My dear, you're going the wrong way!"

00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:14.578
Charmingly -- I thought --
I said, "Yeah, I know."

00:02:14.602 --> 00:02:16.584
"I hope you die!" she screamed.

00:02:16.608 --> 00:02:17.808
(Laughter)

00:02:17.832 --> 00:02:21.140
And I realized that this was a place
where I was in trouble.

00:02:21.164 --> 00:02:23.993
And yet, a year later,

00:02:24.017 --> 00:02:27.947
persuasion, negotiation --
everything I could deploy --

00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:29.916
saw me producing the work.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.506
Not a classical concert in a church
or a poetry reading,
