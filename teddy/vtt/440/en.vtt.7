00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:32.781
and we're all complicit in wanting
the routines to be fixed

00:03:32.805 --> 00:03:36.816
and for everybody to be able to know
what's going to happen next.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.338
And yet, what if this amazing city
could be turned into a stage,

00:03:41.362 --> 00:03:44.371
a platform for something so unimaginable

00:03:44.395 --> 00:03:47.628
that would somehow
transform people's lives?

00:03:47.652 --> 00:03:49.400
We do these things often in Britain.

00:03:49.424 --> 00:03:51.471
I'm sure you do them wherever you're from.

00:03:51.495 --> 00:03:53.174
Here's Horse Guards Parade.

00:03:53.198 --> 00:03:56.603
And here's something that we do often.
It's always about winning things.

00:03:56.627 --> 00:03:58.680
It's about the marathon or winning a war

00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:00.736
or a triumphant cricket team coming home.
