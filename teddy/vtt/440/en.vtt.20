00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:01.605
They live in a post-conflict society:

00:10:01.629 --> 00:10:03.759
lots of post-traumatic stress,

00:10:03.783 --> 00:10:04.968
high suicide.

00:10:04.992 --> 00:10:07.077
And yet, for this brief moment --

00:10:07.101 --> 00:10:10.272
and it would be ridiculous to assume
that it was more than that --

00:10:10.296 --> 00:10:14.782
somebody like Kevin -- a Catholic
whose father was shot when he was nine,

00:10:14.806 --> 00:10:16.316
upstairs in bed --

00:10:17.189 --> 00:10:19.144
Kevin came to work as a volunteer.

00:10:19.168 --> 00:10:22.837
And he was the first person to embrace
the elderly Protestant lady

00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:27.436
who came through the door on the day
we opened the temple to the public.

00:10:28.185 --> 00:10:31.197
It rose up. It sat there for five days.
