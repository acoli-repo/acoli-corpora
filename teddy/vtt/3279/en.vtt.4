00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.736
And what made me angry
was when I came to the fact and realized

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.416
that the employees
that tried to whistle-blow

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.136
were actually fired.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.496
And it really made me think

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.256
about the message
that I was sharing with my students.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.096
And it made me think: What if my students
had been Wells Fargo employees?

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.256
On the one hand, if they whistle-blew,
they would have gotten fired.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.616
But on the other hand,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.336
if they didn't report
the frauds that they knew,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.696
the way current regulation is written,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.296
employees are held responsible
