00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.056
This is known to us today
as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.296
And Peter was the whistle-blower.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.376
What happened to the 600 men,
you may wonder, the 600 original men?

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.376
Twenty eight men died from syphilis.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.536
One hundred died
from syphilis complications,

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.416
forty wives were infected

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.296
and 10 children were born
with congenital syphilis.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.656
Who's to say what these numbers would be

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.776
if it wasn't for the brave,
courageous act of Peter?

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.296
We're all connected to Peter, actually.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.896
If you know anybody
that's in a clinical trial,

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.096
the reason why we have
informed consent today
