but through strategic stalking,
she ended up doing the interview.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.256
(Laughter)

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.496
But she was seeking fairness, not fame.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.136
And if it wasn't for Kathe,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.800
who's to say this fraud
would have ever been discovered?

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.736

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.576
And as I was receiving these emails
and responding back to them,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.256
there was a common theme
in the message that I received,

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.496
and this is what it was:

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.896
they all said this, "I blew the whistle,
people really hate me now.
