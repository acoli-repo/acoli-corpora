And so as I kept reading this message,
all these messages,

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.576
I wanted to think,
what could I share with my students?

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.176
And so, I pulled it all together

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.256

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.016
they're not all disgruntled employees
that have a beef with the company.
