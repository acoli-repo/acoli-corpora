00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.296
But if I'm being completely
honest with myself,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.936
I am really conflicted with this message
that I'm sending to my students.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.160
And here's why.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.800
Whistle-blowers are under attack.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.760
Headline after headline shows us this.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.336
Many people choose
not to become whistle-blowers

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.616
due to the fear of retaliation.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.336
From demotions to death threats,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.256
to job loss --

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.136
perpetual job loss.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.536
Choosing to become a whistle-blower
is an uphill battle.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.976
Their loyalty becomes into question.
