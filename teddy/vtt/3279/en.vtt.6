00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.096
it always is around a whistle-blower.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.856
Think Watergate --
discovered by a whistle-blower.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.776
Think Enron -- discovered
by a whistle-blower.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.376
And who can forget about Bernard Madoff,
discovered by a whistle-blower?

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.856
It takes a tremendous amount of courage
to come forward in the name of the truth.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.576
But when we think
about the term whistle-blower,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.256
we often think of some
very descriptive words:

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.480
rat,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.560
snake,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.816
traitor,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.216
tattletale, weasel.
