This message of if you see something
to say something

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.256
is really all around us.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.976

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.216
Or in other words, encouraging
my students to become whistle-blowers.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.296
But if I'm being completely
honest with myself,
