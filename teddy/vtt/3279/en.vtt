How many of us have ever seen something,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.880
thought that we should report it,
but decided not to?

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.136
And not that I need
to see a show of hands,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.216
but I'm sure this has happened
to someone in this room before.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.416
In fact, when this question
was asked to a group of employees,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.936
46 percent of them responded
by saying that they had seen something

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.576
and decided not to report it.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.736
So if you raised your hand,
or quietly raised your hand,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.056
don't feel bad, you're not alone.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.456
This message of if you see something
to say something
