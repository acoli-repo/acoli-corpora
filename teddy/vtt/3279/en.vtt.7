tattletale, weasel.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.816
And those are the nice words,
the ones I can say from the stage.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.256
And so when I'm not in class,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.176
I go around the country
and I interview white-collar felons,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.216
whistle-blowers and victims of fraud.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.176
Because really I'm trying to understand
what makes them tick

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.800
and to bring those experiences
back into the classroom.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.536
But it's my interviews with
whistle-blowers that really stick with me.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.776
And they stick with me,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.096
because they make me question
my own courage.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.976
When given the opportunity,
would I actually speak up?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.976
And so, this is a couple stories
that I want to share with you.
