00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.976
And so, this is a couple stories
that I want to share with you.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.216
This is Mary.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.936
Mary Willingham is the whistle-blower
from the University of North Carolina

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.136
at Chapel Hill, academic fraud case.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.616
And Mary was a learning specialist
at the university,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.656
and she worked with students,
primarily student athletes.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.375
And what she noticed,
when she was working with students,

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:22.136
is they were turning in term papers

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.256
that seemed well beyond
their reading levels.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.216
She started to ask a couple of questions

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.256
and she found out
that there was a database

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.656
where the student athletes
could retrieve papers and turn them in.
