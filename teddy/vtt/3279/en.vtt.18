00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.056
the impact whistle-blowing
had on their family,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.000
but what they continue to comment on
is how hard it is to withhold the truth.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.776
With that, I want to leave you
with one additional name:

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.120
Peter Buxtun.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:17.336
Peter Buxtun was a 27-year-old
employee for the US Public Health Service.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.296
And he was hired to interview people

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.696
that had sexually transmitted diseases.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.776
And through the course of his work,

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:29.736
he noticed a clinical study
that was going on within the organization.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.856
And it was a study that was looking
at the progression of untreated syphilis.
