00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.720
Her trustworthiness and her motives.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.856
Now, whistle-blowing
doesn't always have to end

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.576
in demotions or death threats.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.536
Actually, in 2002, this was
the cover of "Time" magazine,

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.896
where we were actually honoring
three brave whistle-blowers

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.856
for their decision to come forward
in the name of the truth.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.536
And when you look at the research,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.136
22 percent of whistle-blowers
actually report retaliation.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.616
So there is a huge population of people
that report and are not retaliated against

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.160
and that gives me hope.
