00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.296
employees are held responsible

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.616
if they knew something
and didn't report it.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.616
So criminal prosecution is a real option.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.816
What's a person supposed to do
with those type of odds?

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.776
I of all people know
the valuable contributions

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.336
that whistle-blowers make.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.896
In fact, most frauds
are discovered by them.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.856
Forty two percent of frauds
are discovered by a whistle-blower

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.736
in comparison to other methods,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.336
like measurement review
and external audit.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.696
And when you think
about some of the more classic

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.336
or historical fraud cases,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.096
it always is around a whistle-blower.
