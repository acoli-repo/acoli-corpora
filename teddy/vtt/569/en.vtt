00:00:01.722 --> 00:00:04.532
For all that's ever been said
about climate change,

00:00:04.556 --> 00:00:08.436
we haven't heard nearly enough
about the psychological impacts

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.584
of living in a warming world.

00:00:10.608 --> 00:00:12.569
If you've heard the grim climate research

00:00:12.593 --> 00:00:16.077
that science communicators like me
weave into our books and documentaries,

00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:20.092
you've probably felt bouts of fear,
fatalism or hopelessness.

00:00:20.617 --> 00:00:22.672
If you've been impacted
by climate disaster,

00:00:22.696 --> 00:00:24.974
these feelings can set in much deeper,

00:00:24.998 --> 00:00:27.394
leading to shock, trauma,

00:00:27.418 --> 00:00:29.299
strained relationships, substance abuse

00:00:29.323 --> 00:00:31.816
and the loss of personal
identity and control.
