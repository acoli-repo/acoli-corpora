00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:30.803
by Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi.

00:00:30.803 --> 00:00:35.031
"The Four Seasons" are famous in part
because they are a delight to the ear.

00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:36.542
However, even more notable

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:39.572
is the fact that 
they have stories to tell.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:43.352
At the time of their publication
in Amsterdam in 1725,

00:00:43.352 --> 00:00:44.883
they were accompanied by poems

00:00:44.883 --> 00:00:47.522
describing exactly what feature
of that season

00:00:47.522 --> 00:00:50.982
Vivaldi intended to capture 
in musical terms.

00:00:50.982 --> 00:00:53.963
In providing specific plot content
for instrumental music,

00:00:53.963 --> 00:00:57.877
Vivaldi was generations ahead of his time.

00:00:57.877 --> 00:01:01.483
If one were to read the poems
simultaneously to hearing the music,
