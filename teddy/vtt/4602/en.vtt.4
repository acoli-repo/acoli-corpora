00:01:53.777 --> 00:02:00.504
The "Winter" concerto begins with teeth
chattering in the cold

00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:07.283
before one takes refuge by
a crackling fire.

00:02:07.283 --> 00:02:09.264
Then it's back out into the storm

00:02:09.264 --> 00:02:15.165
where there'll be slips 
and falls on the ice.

00:02:15.165 --> 00:02:18.315
In these first weeks of winter,
the old year is coming to a close,

00:02:18.315 --> 00:02:23.175
and so does Vivaldi's musical exploration
of the seasons.

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:24.905
Not until the early 19th century

00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:28.305
would such expressive instrumental
program music, as it was known,

00:02:28.305 --> 00:02:30.386
become popular.
