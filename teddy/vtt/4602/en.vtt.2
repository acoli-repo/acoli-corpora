If one were to read the poems
simultaneously to hearing the music,

00:01:01.483 --> 00:01:03.773
one would find the poetic scenes

00:01:03.773 --> 00:01:07.362
synchronizing nicely 
with the musical imagery.

00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:11.142
We are told that the birds welcome
spring with happy song,

00:01:11.142 --> 00:01:15.962
and here they are doing exactly that.

00:01:15.962 --> 00:01:21.032
Soon, however, 
a thunderstorm breaks out.

00:01:21.032 --> 00:01:23.393
Not only is there musical thunder
and lightning,

00:01:23.393 --> 00:01:25.083
there are also more birds,

00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:30.584
wet, frightened, and unhappy.
