00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.150
Others presented the young musicians
of the Pietà,

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.680
a Venetian girls' school
where Vivaldi was Director of Music.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.387
Most of the students were orphans.

00:03:36.387 --> 00:03:40.677
Music training was intended not only
as social skills suitable for young ladies

00:03:40.677 --> 00:03:42.658
but also as potential careers

00:03:42.658 --> 00:03:46.498
for those who might fail
to make good marriages.

00:03:46.498 --> 00:03:48.459
Even in the composer's own time,

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.919
Vivaldi's music served 
as diversion for all,

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.708
not just for the wealthy aristocrats.

00:03:53.708 --> 00:03:56.768
300 years later, it's an approach
that still works,

00:03:56.768 --> 00:04:00.328
and Vivaldi's music still sounds
like trotting horses on the move.
