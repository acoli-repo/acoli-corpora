00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My journey to become a polar specialist,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
photographing, specializing
in the polar regions,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
began when I was four years old,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
when my family moved from southern Canada

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to Northern Baffin Island,
up by Greenland.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There we lived with the Inuit

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in the tiny Inuit community
of 200 Inuit people,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
where [we] were one
of three non-Inuit families.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And in this community,
we didn't have a television;

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we didn't have computers,
obviously, radio.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We didn't even have a telephone.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
All of my time was spent outside
