00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:30.769
which is totally crazy.

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:33.287
We've been at it for 15 years already,

00:01:33.287 --> 00:01:36.862

00:01:53.216 --> 00:01:54.898
it doesn't know what you know,

00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:57.474
and a lot we've been trying to do recently

00:01:57.474 --> 00:02:00.769
is just make your devices work,
