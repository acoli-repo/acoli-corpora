00:11:59.999 --> 00:12:01.614
CR: Never coming to Google

00:12:01.614 --> 00:12:03.139
to ask for anything.

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:05.169
LP: Not Google, but the public.

00:12:05.169 --> 00:12:08.942
I think we need to 
have a debate about that,

00:12:08.942 --> 00:12:11.441
or we can't have a functioning democracy.

00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:12.847
It's just not possible.

00:12:12.847 --> 00:12:15.091
So I'm sad that Google's

00:12:15.091 --> 00:12:17.707
in the position of protecting you and our users

00:12:17.707 --> 00:12:19.241
from the government

00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:21.485
doing secret thing that nobody knows about.

00:12:21.485 --> 00:12:23.232
It doesn't make any sense.

00:12:23.232 --> 00:12:26.222
CR: Yeah. And then there's a privacy side of it.

00:12:26.222 --> 00:12:28.649
LP: Yes. The privacy side,

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:30.618
I think it's -- the world is changing.
