00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.504
First, let me tell you the way we got there,

00:02:32.504 --> 00:02:34.732
which was looking at search

00:02:34.732 --> 00:02:36.355
and really understanding,

00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:38.588
trying to understand everything,

00:02:38.588 --> 00:02:40.193
and also make the computers not clunky

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:42.394
and really understand you --

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:44.506
like, voice was really important.

00:02:44.506 --> 00:02:47.367
So what's the state of the art 
on speech recognition?

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.027
It's not very good.

00:02:49.027 --> 00:02:51.093
It doesn't really understand you.

00:02:51.093 --> 00:02:53.096
So we started doing machine learning research

00:02:53.096 --> 00:02:54.633
to improve that.

00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:56.336
That helped a lot.

00:02:56.336 --> 00:02:58.703
And we started just looking at things like YouTube.

00:02:58.703 --> 00:03:00.671
Can we understand YouTube?
