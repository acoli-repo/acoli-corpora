00:03:29.837 --> 00:03:32.330
and really just, maybe I can show the video,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.534
just playing video games,

00:03:34.534 --> 00:03:36.549
and learning how to do that automatically.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.401
CR: Take a look at the video games

00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:40.811
and how machines are coming to be able

00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:43.267
to do some remarkable things.

00:03:43.267 --> 00:03:44.596
LP: The amazing thing about this

00:03:44.596 --> 00:03:46.276
is this is, I mean, obviously,

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:47.750
these are old games,

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.548
but the system just sees what you see, the pixels,

00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:54.979
and it has the controls and it has the score,

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:57.190
and it's learned to play all of these games,

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.769
same program.

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.806
It's learned to play all of these games
