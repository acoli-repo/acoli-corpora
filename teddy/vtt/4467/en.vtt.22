00:10:58.863 --> 00:11:02.034
But I think, for me, I guess,

00:11:02.034 --> 00:11:05.696
privacy and security are a really important thing.

00:11:05.696 --> 00:11:07.941
We think about it in terms of both things,

00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:10.844
and I think you can't have privacy without security,

00:11:10.844 --> 00:11:13.215
so let me just talk about security first,

00:11:13.215 --> 00:11:15.811
because you asked about Snowden and all of that,

00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:18.252
and then I'll say a little bit about privacy.

00:11:18.252 --> 00:11:22.052
I think for me, it's tremendously disappointing

00:11:22.052 --> 00:11:23.491
that the government

00:11:23.491 --> 00:11:25.821
secretly did all this stuff and didn't tell us.

00:11:25.821 --> 00:11:29.124
I don't think we can have a democracy

00:11:29.124 --> 00:11:32.554
if we're having to protect you and our users
