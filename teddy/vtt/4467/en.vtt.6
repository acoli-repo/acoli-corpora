00:02:58.703 --> 00:03:00.671
Can we understand YouTube?

00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:03.357
But we actually ran machine learning on YouTube

00:03:03.357 --> 00:03:07.442
and it discovered cats, just by itself.

00:03:07.442 --> 00:03:09.533
Now, that's an important concept.

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:12.524
And we realized there's really something here.

00:03:12.524 --> 00:03:14.641
If we can learn what cats are,

00:03:14.641 --> 00:03:16.716
that must be really important.

00:03:16.716 --> 00:03:19.345
So I think Deep Mind,

00:03:19.345 --> 00:03:21.709
what's really amazing about Deep Mind

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.713
is that it can actually --

00:03:23.713 --> 00:03:27.270
they're learning things in this unsupervised way.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.837
They started with video games,

00:03:29.837 --> 00:03:32.330
and really just, maybe I can show the video,
