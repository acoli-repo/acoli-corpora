So many people have access to information,

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.681
but there's no follow-up to that.

00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:06.189
I think the follow-up to that is our knowledge.

00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:07.795
When people have the knowledge,

00:08:07.795 --> 00:08:09.425
they can find solutions

00:08:09.425 --> 00:08:11.409
without having to helped out.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.561
Information is powerful,

00:08:13.561 --> 00:08:18.163
but it is how we use it that will define us.

00:08:18.163 --> 00:08:22.544
(Applause)

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:25.090
LP: Now, the amazing thing about that video,

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:26.556
actually, was we just read about it in the news,

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:29.061
and we found this gentlemen,

00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:31.376
and made that little clip.
