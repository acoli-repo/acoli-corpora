00:09:58.168 --> 00:10:00.472
and I found, 30, 40 years ago,

00:10:00.472 --> 00:10:02.361
someone had put up a balloon

00:10:02.361 --> 00:10:05.166
and it had gone around the Earth multiple times.

00:10:05.166 --> 00:10:08.001
And I thought, why can't we do that today?

00:10:08.001 --> 00:10:10.368
And that's how this project got going.

00:10:10.368 --> 00:10:12.698
CR: But are you at the mercy of the wind?

00:10:12.698 --> 00:10:14.820
LP: Yeah, but it turns out,

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.313
we did some weather simulations

00:10:16.313 --> 00:10:18.860
which probably hadn't really been done before,

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.970
and if you control the altitude of the balloons,

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:23.251
which you can do by pumping air into them

00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:25.073
and other ways,

00:10:25.073 --> 00:10:28.002
you can actually control roughly where they go,

00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:30.207
and so I think we can build a worldwide mesh
