00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.806
It's learned to play all of these games

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:02.592
with superhuman performance.

00:04:02.592 --> 00:04:04.447
We've not been able to do things like this

00:04:04.447 --> 00:04:05.965
with computers before.

00:04:05.965 --> 00:04:08.260
And maybe I'll just narrate this one quickly.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.065
This is boxing, and it figures out it can

00:04:11.065 --> 00:04:13.699
sort of pin the opponent down.

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:15.438
The computer's on the left,

00:04:15.438 --> 00:04:18.523
and it's just racking up points.

00:04:18.523 --> 00:04:20.609
So imagine if this kind

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.736
of intelligence were thrown at your schedule,

00:04:22.736 --> 00:04:27.373
or your information needs, or things like that.

00:04:27.373 --> 00:04:29.991
We're really just at the beginning of that,

00:04:29.991 --> 00:04:32.356
and that's what I'm really excited about.
