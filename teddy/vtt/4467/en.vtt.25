00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:30.618
I think it's -- the world is changing.

00:12:30.618 --> 00:12:34.523
You carry a phone. It knows where you are.

00:12:34.523 --> 00:12:37.608
There's so much more information about you,

00:12:37.608 --> 00:12:40.454
and that's an important thing,

00:12:40.454 --> 00:12:42.726
and it makes sense why people are asking

00:12:42.726 --> 00:12:44.762
difficult questions.

00:12:44.762 --> 00:12:48.129
We spend a lot of time thinking about this

00:12:48.129 --> 00:12:50.840
and what the issues are.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.569
I'm a little bit --

00:12:52.569 --> 00:12:53.829
I think the main thing that we need to do

00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:56.191
is just provide people choice,

00:12:56.191 --> 00:12:58.703
show them what data's being collected --

00:12:58.703 --> 00:13:03.454
search history, location data.
