Larry Page: Well, thank you.

00:00:30.893 --> 00:00:33.873
CR: So we'll have a conversation about

00:00:33.873 --> 00:00:36.571
the Internet, and we'll have a conversation Google,

00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:38.005
and we'll have a conversation about search

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.372
and privacy,

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.927
and also about your philosophy

00:00:40.927 --> 00:00:43.383
and a sense of how you've connected the dots

00:00:43.383 --> 00:00:45.474
and how this journey that began

00:00:45.474 --> 00:00:46.758
some time ago

00:00:46.758 --> 00:00:48.653
has such interesting prospects.

00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:51.249
Mainly we want to talk about the future.

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:52.838
So my first question: Where is Google

00:00:52.838 --> 00:00:54.884
and where is it going?

00:00:54.884 --> 00:00:56.343
LP: Well, this is something we think about a lot,

00:00:56.343 --> 00:00:59.918
and our mission we defined a long time ago

00:00:59.918 --> 00:01:02.181
is to organize the world's information
