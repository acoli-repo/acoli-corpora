00:04:29.991 --> 00:04:32.356
and that's what I'm really excited about.

00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:34.826
CR: When you look at all that's taken place

00:04:34.826 --> 00:04:37.410
with Deep Mind and the boxing,

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.750
also a part of where we're going

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.639
is artificial intelligence.

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.438
Where are we, when you look at that?

00:04:45.438 --> 00:04:47.223
LP: Well, I think for me,

00:04:47.223 --> 00:04:48.726
this is kind of one of the most exciting things

00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:50.638
I've seen in a long time.

00:04:50.638 --> 00:04:53.051
The guy who started this company, Demis,

00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:55.829
has a neuroscience and a
computer science background.

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:57.459
He went back to school

00:04:57.459 --> 00:05:00.585
to get his Ph.D. to study the brain.
