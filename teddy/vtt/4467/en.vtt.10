00:04:57.459 --> 00:05:00.585
to get his Ph.D. to study the brain.

00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:03.205
And so I think we're seeing a lot of exciting work

00:05:03.205 --> 00:05:06.286
going on that sort of crosses computer science

00:05:06.286 --> 00:05:08.036
and neuroscience

00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:10.361
in terms of really understanding

00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:12.815
what it takes to make something smart

00:05:12.815 --> 00:05:14.530
and do really interesting things.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.668
CR: But where's the level of it now?

00:05:16.668 --> 00:05:19.374
And how fast do you think we are moving?

00:05:19.374 --> 00:05:22.643
LP: Well, this is the state of the art right now,

00:05:22.643 --> 00:05:24.774
understanding cats on YouTube

00:05:24.774 --> 00:05:26.057
and things like that,

00:05:26.057 --> 00:05:28.204
improving voice recognition.

00:05:28.204 --> 00:05:30.622
We used a lot of machine learning
