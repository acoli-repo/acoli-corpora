no notion of a cat,

00:06:00.935 --> 00:06:03.496
but this concept of a cat

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:06.304
is something important that you would understand,

00:06:06.304 --> 00:06:08.827
and now that the machines can kind of understand.

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:09.999
Maybe just finishing

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:12.221
also on the search part,

00:06:12.221 --> 00:06:15.007
it started with search, really understanding

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:17.571
people's context and their information.

00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:19.431
I did have a video

00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:21.441
I wanted to show quickly on that

00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:23.088
that we actually found.

00:06:23.088 --> 00:06:28.200
