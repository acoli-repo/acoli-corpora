00:00:59.918 --> 00:01:02.181
is to organize the world's information

00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:05.619
and make it universally accessible and useful.

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.661
And people always say,

00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:09.876
is that really what you guys are still doing?

00:01:09.876 --> 00:01:11.994
And I always kind of think about that myself,

00:01:11.994 --> 00:01:14.190
and I'm not quite sure.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.197
But actually, when I think about search,

00:01:18.197 --> 00:01:20.813
it's such a deep thing for all of us,

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:23.056
to really understand what you want,

00:01:23.056 --> 00:01:25.424
to understand the world's information,

00:01:25.424 --> 00:01:28.956
and we're still very much in the early stages of that,

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:30.769
which is totally crazy.
