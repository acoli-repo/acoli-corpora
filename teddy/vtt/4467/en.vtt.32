00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:01.695
and making life better.

00:16:01.695 --> 00:16:05.940
Los Angeles is half parking lots and roads,

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.673
half of the area,

00:16:07.673 --> 00:16:10.500
and most cities are not far behind, actually.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:12.064
It's just crazy

00:16:12.064 --> 00:16:13.657
that that's what we use our space for.

00:16:13.657 --> 00:16:16.000
CR: And how soon will we be there?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.926
LP: I think we can be there very, very soon.

00:16:17.926 --> 00:16:21.427
We've driven well over 100,000 miles

00:16:21.427 --> 00:16:25.520
now totally automated.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.172
I'm super excited about getting that out quickly.

00:16:29.172 --> 00:16:31.577
CR: But it's not only you're
talking about automated cars.
