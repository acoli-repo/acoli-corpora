When I was middle school science teacher,

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.751
I would often ask my students
to kiss their brain.

00:00:05.376 --> 00:00:08.671
I got this idea from visiting
my friend's kindergarten classroom.

00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:11.049
She would ask her students
to kiss their brain,

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:12.675
and they would take their fingers,

00:00:12.717 --> 00:00:15.428
tap them to their mouth
and then to the top of their head.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.514
And it truly was as cute
as you can picture it to be.

00:00:18.806 --> 00:00:22.143
So I decided to bring it back
to my middle school classroom,

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:25.772
which could have gone one of two ways,

00:00:25.813 --> 00:00:28.524
but it ended up being a really
fun ritual for us, too.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.445
And I would ask them to kiss their brain
for all the work they did in class
