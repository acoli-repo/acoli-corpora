00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.126
I have one of the biggest honors

00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:07.545
that I think any politician could have,

00:00:07.587 --> 00:00:11.299
in that I was elected the mayor
of the place in which I was born

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.508
and brought up.

00:00:12.508 --> 00:00:14.552
So that's Bristol in the UK.

00:00:14.552 --> 00:00:15.720
Well, thank you.

00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:18.014
(Applause)

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:19.640
And it's a big job.

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:22.268
From education to housing,

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.729
to budgets to trash collection

00:00:24.771 --> 00:00:27.982
to protests to counterprotests,

00:00:28.024 --> 00:00:30.651
cities are complicated organisms.
