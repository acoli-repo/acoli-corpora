Chris has been so nice.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I don't know how you keep it up, Chris, I really don't.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So nice, all week. He's the kind of man you could say to,

"Chris, I'm really sorry, I've crashed your car.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"Thank you for taking me to a place that I didn't know existed. Thank you."

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
