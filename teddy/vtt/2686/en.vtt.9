00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.416
That's a tough mindset to penetrate,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.720
and it leads sometimes
to very conspiratorial places.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.176
So let's just take one
political issue that's pretty hot,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.696
affirmative action.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.016
So depending on your politics,
you might think that affirmative action

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.416
is either a wise or an unwise way
to promote diversity in the workplace

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.736
or the classroom.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.776
But if you grow up in an area like this,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.536
you see affirmative action
as a tool to hold people like you back.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.816
That's especially true if you're
a member of the white working class.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.256
You see it as something
that isn't just about good or bad policy.
