00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.056
and it's a town that's really
struggling in a lot of ways,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.536
ways that are indicative
of the broader struggles

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.000
of America's working class.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.056
Heroin has moved in,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.120
killing a lot of people, people I know.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.640
Family violence, domestic violence,
and divorce have torn apart families.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.576
And there's a very unique
sense of pessimism that's moved in.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.216
Think about rising mortality rates
in these communities

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.416
and recognize that
for a lot of these folks,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.016
the problems that they're seeing

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.736
are actually causing rising death rates
in their own communities,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.160
so there's a very real sense of struggle.
