00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.160
so there's a very real sense of struggle.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.696
I had a very front-row seat
to that struggle.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.840
My family has been part of that struggle
for a very long time.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.416
I come from a family
that doesn't have a whole lot of money.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.856
The addiction that plagued my community

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.000
also plagued my family,
and even, sadly, my own mom.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.896
There were a lot of problems
that I saw in my own family,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.776
problems caused sometimes
by a lack of money,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.136
problems caused sometimes by a lack
of access to resources and social capital
