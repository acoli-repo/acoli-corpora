00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.136
problems caused sometimes by a lack
of access to resources and social capital

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.200
that really affected my life.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.176
If you had looked at my life
when I was 14 years old

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.256
and said, "Well, what's going
to happen to this kid?"

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.136
you would have concluded
that I would have struggled

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.680
with what academics call upward mobility.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.536
So upward mobility is an abstract term,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.296
but it strikes at something
that's very core

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.016
at the heart of the American Dream.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.256
It's the sense,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.056
and it measures whether kids like me

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.096
who grow up in poor communities
are going to live a better life,
