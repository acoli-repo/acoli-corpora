00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.496
and ensured that they filled
that social capital gap

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.920
that it was pretty obvious,
apparently, that I had.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.040
That comes from good fortune,

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.136
but a lot of children
aren't going to have that good fortune,

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.856
and I think that raises
really important questions for all of us

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.642
about how we're going to change that.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.576
We need to ask questions about
how we're going to give low-income kids

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.136
who come from a broken home
access to a loving home.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.416
We need to ask questions

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.776
about how we're going
to teach low-income parents

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.936
how to better interact
with their children,

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.456
with their partners.
