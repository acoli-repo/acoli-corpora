She recognized the message
that my community had for me,

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.256
that my choices didn't matter,

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.096
that the deck was stacked against me.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.336
She once told me,

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.336
"JD, never be like those losers who think
the deck is stacked against them.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.696
You can do anything you want to."

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:15.936
And yet she recognized
that life wasn't fair.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.576
It's hard to strike that balance,

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.616
to tell a kid that life isn't fair,

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:24.896
but also recognize and enforce in them
the reality that their choices matter.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.040
But mamaw was able
to strike that balance.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.336
The other thing that really helped
was the United States Marine Corps.
