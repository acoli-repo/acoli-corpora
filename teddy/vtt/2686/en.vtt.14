00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.856
because the social networks around me
didn't have access to that information.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.536
I learned from my community
how to shoot a gun, how to shoot it well.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.016
I learned how to make
a damn good biscuit recipe.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.200
The trick, by the way,
is frozen butter, not warm butter.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.976
But I didn't learn how to get ahead.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.576
I didn't learn how to make
the good decisions

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.456
about education and opportunity

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.176
that you need to make

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.376
to actually have a chance
in this 21st century knowledge economy.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.536
Economists call the value
that we gain from our informal networks,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.176
from our friends and colleagues
and family "social capital."
