00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.336
in southern Ohio right now,

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.136
there's a kid who is
anxiously awaiting their dad,

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.536
wondering whether,
when he comes through the door,

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.960
he'll walk calmly or stumble drunkly.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.200
There's a kid

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.896
whose mom sticks a needle in her arm

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.416
and passes out,

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.336
and he doesn't know
why she doesn't cook him dinner,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.160
and he goes to bed hungry that night.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.336
There's a kid who has
no hope for the future

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.616
but desperately
wants to live a better life.
