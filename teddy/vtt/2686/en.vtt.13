I didn't know that elite universities,
as research consistently tells us,

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.096
are cheaper for low-income kids

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.696
because these universities
have bigger endowments,

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.896
can offer more generous financial aid.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.176
I remember I learned this

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.016
when I got the financial aid letter
from Yale for myself,

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.736
tens of thousands of dollars
in need-based aid,

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.896
which is a term I had never heard before.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.576
But I turned to my aunt
when I got that letter and said,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.896
"You know, I think this just means
that for the first time in my life,

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.520
being poor has paid really well."

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.176
So I didn't have access
to that information

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.856
because the social networks around me
didn't have access to that information.
