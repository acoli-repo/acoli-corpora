00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.296
watching someone hit or beat your parent,

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.696
watching someone do drugs
or abuse alcohol.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.256
These are all instances
of childhood trauma,

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.360
and they're pretty
commonplace in my family.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.376
Importantly, they're not just
commonplace in my family right now.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.416
They're also multigenerational.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.000
So my grandparents,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.416
the very first time that they had kids,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.136
they expected that they
were going to raise them in a way

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.776
that was uniquely good.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.056
They were middle class,

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.461
they were able to earn
a good wage in a steel mill.

00:08:27.485 --> 00:08:28.816
But what ended up happening

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.856
is that they exposed their kids
to a lot of the childhood trauma
