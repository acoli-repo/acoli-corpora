Another thing you might do is say,

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.056
"Well, I'm not going to go
after the traditional markers of success,

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.416
like a university education
or a prestigious job,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.336
because the people who care
about those things are unlike me.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.980
They're never going to let me in."

00:05:41.004 --> 00:05:43.481
When I got admitted to Yale,
a family member asked me

00:05:43.505 --> 00:05:46.816

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.616
Seriously.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.656
And it's obviously not the case
that there was a liberal box to check

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.176
on the application,

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.856
but it speaks to a very real
insecurity in these places

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.256
that you have to pretend
to be somebody you're not
