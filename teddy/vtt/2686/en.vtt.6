00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.536
very likely to live their share
and their part in the American Dream.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.416
But if you think of where I'm from,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.376
in the South, in Appalachia,
in southern Ohio,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.616
it's very unlikely
that kids like that will rise.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.896
The American Dream
in those parts of the country

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.960
is in a very real sense just a dream.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.160
So why is that happening?

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.936
So one reason is obviously
economic or structural.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.496
So you think of these areas.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.136
They're beset by these
terrible economic trends,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.776
built around industries
like coal and steel

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.840
that make it harder
for folks to get ahead.
