00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.576
because I went and took it to my officer

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.736
who told me, "Stop being an idiot,

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.256
go to the local credit union,
and get a better deal."

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.736
And so that's what I did.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.176
But without the Marine Corps,

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.456
I would have never had access
to that knowledge.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.680
I would have had
a financial calamity, frankly.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.856
The last thing I want to say
is that I had a lot of good fortune

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.456
in the mentors and people

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.616
who have played
an important role in my life.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.696
From the Marines,
from Ohio State, from Yale,

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.976
from other places,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.656
people have really stepped in

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.496
and ensured that they filled
that social capital gap
