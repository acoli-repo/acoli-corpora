00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.695
I remember the very first time
I went to a nice restaurant,

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:05.336
a really nice restaurant.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.496
It was for a law firm recruitment dinner,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.976
and I remember beforehand
the waitress walked around

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.856
and asked whether we wanted some wine,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.000
so I said, "Sure,
I'll take some white wine."

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.536
And she immediately said,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.000
"Would you like sauvignon blanc
or chardonnay?"

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.616
And I remember thinking,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.496
"Come on, lady,
stop with the fancy French words

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.240
and just give me some white wine."

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.016
But I used my powers of deduction

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.456
and recognized that chardonnay
and sauvignon blanc
