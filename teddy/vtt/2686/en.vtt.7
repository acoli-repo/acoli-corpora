00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.896
That's certainly one problem.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.416
There's also the problem of brain drain,
where the really talented people,

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.816
because they can't find
high-skilled work at home,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.096
end up moving elsewhere,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.136
so they don't build a business
or non-profit where they're from,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.136
they end up going elsewhere
and taking their talents with them.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.816
There are failing schools
in a lot of these communities,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.896
failing to give kids
the educational leg up

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.456
that really makes it possible for kids
to have opportunities later in life.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.016
These things are all important.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.456
I don't mean to discount
these structural barriers.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.816
But when I look back at my life
and my community,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.720
something else was going on,
something else mattered.
