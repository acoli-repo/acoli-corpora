The other thing that really helped
was the United States Marine Corps.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.856
So we think of the Marine Corps
as a military outfit, and of course it is,

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.736
but for me, the US Marine Corps
was a four-year crash course

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.976
in character education.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.376
It taught me how to make a bed,
how to do laundry,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.656
how to wake up early,

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.800
and I was ready
to sign on the dotted line.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.536
But I didn't take that deal,

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.576
because I went and took it to my officer
