00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.096
who grow up in poor communities
are going to live a better life,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.496
whether they're going to have a chance
to live a materially better existence,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.056
or whether they're going to stay
in the circumstances where they came from.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.496
And one of the things
we've learned, unfortunately,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.456
is that upward mobility isn't as high
as we'd like it to be in this country,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.480
and interestingly,
it's very geographically distributed.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.040
So take Utah, for instance.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.376
In Utah a poor kid is actually doing OK,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.536
very likely to live their share
and their part in the American Dream.
