00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.040
I am holding something remarkably old.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.416
It is older than any human artifact,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.736
older than life on Earth,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.840
older than the continents
and the oceans between them.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.616
This was formed
over four billion years ago

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.776
in the earliest days of the solar system

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.600
while the planets were still forming.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.496
This rusty lump of nickel and iron
may not appear special,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.960
but when it is cut open ...

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.000
you can see that it is different
from earthly metals.
