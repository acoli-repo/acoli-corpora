00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:01.014
The community, together, discovered
over 90 percent of asteroids

00:05:01.038 --> 00:05:02.894
bigger than one kilometer across --

00:05:02.918 --> 00:05:05.894
objects capable
of massive destruction to Earth.

00:05:05.918 --> 00:05:07.494
But the job's not done yet.

00:05:07.518 --> 00:05:12.454
An object 140 meters or bigger
could decimate a medium-sized country.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:15.678
So far, we've only found
25 percent of those.

00:05:16.238 --> 00:05:19.654
We must keep searching the sky
for near-Earth asteroids.

00:05:19.678 --> 00:05:22.414
We are the only species
able to understand calculus

00:05:22.438 --> 00:05:24.094
or build telescopes.

00:05:24.118 --> 00:05:26.094
We know how to find these objects.

00:05:26.118 --> 00:05:28.254
This is our responsibility.

00:05:28.278 --> 00:05:32.054
If we found a hazardous asteroid
with significant early warning,
