If we found a hazardous asteroid
with significant early warning,

00:05:32.078 --> 00:05:33.774
we could nudge it out of the way.

00:05:33.798 --> 00:05:36.854
Unlike earthquakes, hurricanes
or volcanic eruptions,

00:05:36.878 --> 00:05:39.774
an asteroid impact
can be precisely predicted

00:05:39.798 --> 00:05:41.254
and prevented.

00:05:41.278 --> 00:05:44.414
What we need to do now
is map near-Earth space.

00:05:44.438 --> 00:05:46.294
We must keep searching the sky.

00:05:46.318 --> 00:05:47.534
Thank you.

00:05:47.558 --> 00:05:53.129
