00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:32.134
And since then, there's been
a focused effort underway

00:03:32.158 --> 00:03:33.998
to discover and catalog these objects.

00:03:35.238 --> 00:03:37.334
I am lucky enough
to be part of this effort.

00:03:37.358 --> 00:03:41.014
I'm part of a team of scientists
that use NASA's NEOWISE telescope.

00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:43.734
Now, NEOWISE was not
designed to find asteroids.

00:03:43.758 --> 00:03:47.974
It was designed to orbit the earth
and look far beyond our solar system

00:03:47.998 --> 00:03:51.414
to seek out the coldest stars
and the most luminous galaxies.

00:03:51.438 --> 00:03:54.878
And it did that very well
for its designed lifetime of seven months.

00:03:55.518 --> 00:03:58.774
But today, six years later,
it's still going.

00:03:58.798 --> 00:04:01.534
We've repurposed it
to discover and study asteroids.
