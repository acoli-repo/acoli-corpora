00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.856
predicted where the asteroid Toutatis
was going to be four years in advance

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.976
to within 30 kilometers.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.296
In those four years,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.136
Toutatis traveled 8.5 billion kilometers.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.735
That's a fractional precision

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:19.560
of 0.000000004.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.840
(Laughter)

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.136
Now, the reason I have
this beautiful asteroid fragment

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.696
is because, like all neighbors,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.920
asteroids sometimes drop by unexpectedly.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.120
(Laughter)
