00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.016
That object was
about 10 kilometers across,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.216
and 10 kilometers is roughly
the cruising altitude of a 747 jet.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.136
So the next time you're in an airplane,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.976
snag a window seat, look out
and imagine a rock so enormous

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.096
that resting on the ground,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.000
it just grazes your wingtip.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.157
It's so wide that it takes your plane
one full minute to fly past it.

00:03:21.278 --> 00:03:23.678
That's the size of the asteroid
that hit the Earth.

00:03:24.518 --> 00:03:26.294
It has only been within my lifetime

00:03:26.318 --> 00:03:29.534
that asteroids have been considered
a credible threat to our planet.

00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:32.134
And since then, there's been
a focused effort underway
