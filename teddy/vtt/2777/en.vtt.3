00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.760
These are the 1,556 near-Earth asteroids
discovered just last year.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.336
And these are all of the known
near-Earth asteroids,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.376
which at last count was 13,733.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.536
Each one has been imaged, cataloged

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.936
and had its path
around the Sun determined.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.056
Although it varies
from asteroid to asteroid,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.336
the paths of most asteroids
can be predicted for dozens of years.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.136
And the paths of some asteroids can be
predicted with incredible precision.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.816
For example, scientists
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.856
predicted where the asteroid Toutatis
was going to be four years in advance
