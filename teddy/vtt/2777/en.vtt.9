00:04:28.318 --> 00:04:30.934
is that it sees the sky
in the thermal infrared.

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.294
That means that instead of seeing
the sunlight that asteroids reflect,

00:04:34.318 --> 00:04:36.134
NEOWISE sees the heat that they emit.

00:04:36.158 --> 00:04:39.894
This is a vital capability
since some asteroids are as dark as coal

00:04:39.918 --> 00:04:43.374
and can be difficult or impossible
to spot with other telescopes.

00:04:43.398 --> 00:04:46.478
But all asteroids, light or dark,
shine brightly for NEOWISE.

00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.734
Astronomers are using
every technique at their disposal

00:04:51.758 --> 00:04:54.054
to discover and study asteroids.

00:04:54.078 --> 00:04:56.934
In 2010, a historic milestone was reached.

00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:01.014
The community, together, discovered
over 90 percent of asteroids
