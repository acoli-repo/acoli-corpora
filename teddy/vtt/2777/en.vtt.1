00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.000
you can see that it is different
from earthly metals.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.336
This pattern reveals metallic crystals
that can only form out in space

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.936
where molten metal
can cool extremely slowly,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.280
a few degrees every million years.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.256
This was once part
of a much larger object,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.856
one of millions left over
after the planets formed.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.880
We call these objects asteroids.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.936
Asteroids are our oldest
and most numerous cosmic neighbors.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.016
This graphic shows near-Earth asteroids
orbiting around the Sun,

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.296
shown in yellow,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.256
and swinging close to the Earth's orbit,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.496
shown in blue.
