We've repurposed it
to discover and study asteroids.

00:04:01.558 --> 00:04:03.894
And although it's
a wonderful little space robot,

00:04:03.918 --> 00:04:05.998
these days it's kind of like a used car.

00:04:06.518 --> 00:04:09.774
The cryogen that used to refrigerate
its sensors is long gone,

00:04:09.798 --> 00:04:11.998
so we joke that
its air-conditioning is broken.

00:04:12.478 --> 00:04:16.894
It's got 920 million miles
on the odometer,

00:04:16.918 --> 00:04:18.174
but it still runs great

00:04:18.198 --> 00:04:21.774
and reliably takes a photograph
of the sky every 11 seconds.

00:04:21.798 --> 00:04:24.638
It's taken 23 photos
since I began speaking to you.

00:04:26.118 --> 00:04:28.294
One of the reasons NEOWISE is so valuable

00:04:28.318 --> 00:04:30.934
is that it sees the sky
in the thermal infrared.
