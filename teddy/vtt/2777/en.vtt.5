(Laughter)

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.136
Three years ago today,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.816
a small asteroid exploded
over the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.136
That object was about 19 meters across,

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.080
or about as big as a convenience store.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.920
Objects of this size hit the Earth
every 50 years or so.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.576
66 million years ago,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.536
a much larger object hit the Earth,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.336
causing a massive extinction.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.576
75 percent of plant
and animal species were lost,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.800
including, sadly, the dinosaurs.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.016
That object was
about 10 kilometers across,
