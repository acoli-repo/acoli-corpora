00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.496
shown in blue.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.856
The sizes of the Earth, Sun and asteroids
have been greatly exaggerated

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.256
so you can see them clearly.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.656
Teams of scientists across the globe
are searching for these objects,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.616
discovering new ones every day,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.760
steadily mapping near-Earth space.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.240
Much of this work is funded by NASA.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.536
I think of the search for these asteroids
as a giant public works project,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.816
but instead of building a highway,
we're charting outer space,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.816
building an archive
that will last for generations.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.760
These are the 1,556 near-Earth asteroids
discovered just last year.
