00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.305
they've improved macroeconomic policies,

00:06:30.305 --> 00:06:32.240
and we are seeing for the first time

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.580
Africa's growing, and in 
fact it's the second fastest

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.425
growing economic region in the world.

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:38.591
So these leaders are by no means perfect,

00:06:38.591 --> 00:06:39.923
but they are by and large

00:06:39.923 --> 00:06:44.749
the best leaders we've seen in the last 50 years.

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:47.628
So where to from here?

00:06:47.628 --> 00:06:49.844
I believe that the next generation

00:06:49.844 --> 00:06:52.476
to come after this, generation four,

00:06:52.476 --> 00:06:55.009
has a unique opportunity

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:57.564
to transform the continent.

00:06:57.564 --> 00:06:59.408
Specifically, they can do two things

00:06:59.408 --> 00:07:01.534
that previous generations have not done.
