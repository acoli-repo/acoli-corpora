parts of Africa growing up

00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:33.497
did two things to me.

00:02:33.497 --> 00:02:37.776
The first is it made me fall in love with Africa.

00:02:37.776 --> 00:02:39.699

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.377
I experienced the wonderful beauty of our continent

00:02:42.377 --> 00:02:45.534
