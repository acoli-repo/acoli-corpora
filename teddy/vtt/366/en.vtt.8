00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:01.973
the difference that one good
leader can make is limited,

00:04:01.973 --> 00:04:04.180
but when you have weak institutions,

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.910
then just one good leader

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.058
can make or break that country.

00:04:08.058 --> 00:04:11.366
Let me make it a bit more concrete.

00:04:11.366 --> 00:04:14.415
You become the president of the United States.

00:04:14.415 --> 00:04:16.687
You think, "Wow, I've arrived.

00:04:16.687 --> 00:04:19.750
I'm the most powerful man in the world."

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.436
So you decide, perhaps let me pass a law.

00:04:23.436 --> 00:04:24.978
All of a sudden, Congress taps you on the shoulder

00:04:24.978 --> 00:04:28.111
and says, "No, no, no, no, no, you can't do that."

00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:30.820
You say, "Let me try this way."
