00:00:59.349 --> 00:01:00.679
is that they didn't have

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.329
their own national television station,

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.220
and so I remember watching

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.705
TV from neighboring South Africa,

00:01:07.705 --> 00:01:10.326
and watching Nelson Mandela in jail

00:01:10.326 --> 00:01:12.621
being offered a chance to come out

00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:15.501
if he would give up the apartheid struggle.

00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:16.616
But he didn't. He refused to do that

00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:18.464
until he actually achieved his objective

00:01:18.464 --> 00:01:21.676
of freeing South Africa from apartheid.

00:01:21.676 --> 00:01:25.709
And I remember feeling how just one good leader

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:30.557
could make such a big difference in Africa.
