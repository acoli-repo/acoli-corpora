00:00:28.343 --> 00:00:31.175
For a week, we slept under our beds

00:00:31.175 --> 00:00:35.956
because we were worried that bullets
might fly through the window.

00:00:35.956 --> 00:00:38.138
Then, at the age of eight,

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:40.265
we moved to Botswana.

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:42.458
This time, it was different.

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:44.292
There were no coups.

00:00:44.292 --> 00:00:47.335
Everything worked. Great education.

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:50.310
They had such good infrastructure
that even at the time they had

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.211
a fiber-optic telephone system,

00:00:52.211 --> 00:00:55.260
long before it had reached Western countries.

00:00:57.466 --> 00:00:59.349
The only thing they didn't have

00:00:59.349 --> 00:01:00.679
is that they didn't have
