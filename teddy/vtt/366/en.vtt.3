00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:30.557
could make such a big difference in Africa.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:32.830
Then at the age of 12,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.170
my family sent me to high school in Zimbabwe.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.747
Initially, this too was amazing:

00:01:39.747 --> 00:01:44.933
growing economy, excellent infrastructure,

00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.969
and it seemed like it was a model

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.658
for economic development in Africa.

00:01:49.658 --> 00:01:51.649
I graduated from high school in Zimbabwe

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.070
and I went off to college.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.161
Six years later, I returned to the country.

00:01:57.161 --> 00:01:59.145
Everything was different.

00:01:59.145 --> 00:02:02.396
It had shattered into pieces.
