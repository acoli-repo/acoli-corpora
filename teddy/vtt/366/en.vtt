00:00:00.874 --> 00:00:05.125
I experienced my first coup d'état at the age of four.

00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:06.835
Because of the coup d'état,

00:00:06.835 --> 00:00:09.962
my family had to leave my native home of Ghana

00:00:09.962 --> 00:00:12.178
and move to the Gambia.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.899
As luck would have it,

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:15.632
six months after we arrived,

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:18.703
they too had a military coup.

00:00:18.703 --> 00:00:21.121
I vividly remember being woken
up in the middle of the night

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.348
and gathering the few belongings we could

00:00:23.348 --> 00:00:26.297
and walking for about two hours

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:28.343
to a safe house.

00:00:28.343 --> 00:00:31.175
For a week, we slept under our beds
