00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.720
for the African continent,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.795
and over the next 50 years,

00:10:31.795 --> 00:10:34.789
we expect to create 6,000 of them.

00:10:34.789 --> 00:10:37.408
But one thing has been troubling me.

00:10:37.408 --> 00:10:39.500
We would get about 4,000 applications a year

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.569
for 100 young leaders that we could take

00:10:41.569 --> 00:10:42.883
into this academy,

00:10:42.883 --> 00:10:44.944
and so I saw the tremendous hunger that existed

00:10:44.944 --> 00:10:47.835
for this leadership training that we're offering.

00:10:47.835 --> 00:10:50.951
But we couldn't satisfy it.

00:10:50.951 --> 00:10:54.973
So today, I'm announcing for the first time in public

00:10:54.973 --> 00:10:59.611
an extension to this vision for
the African Leadership Academy.

00:10:59.611 --> 00:11:04.718
We're building 25 brand new universities in Africa
