00:11:28.346 --> 00:11:30.379
for the continent.

00:11:30.379 --> 00:11:32.620
My hope is that half of them

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.172
will become the entrepreneurs that we need,

00:11:34.172 --> 00:11:35.995
who will create these jobs that we need,

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:37.502
and the other half

00:11:37.502 --> 00:11:39.189
will go into government

00:11:39.189 --> 00:11:40.388
and the nonprofit sector,

00:11:40.388 --> 00:11:44.010
and they will build the institutions that we need.

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.400
But they won't just learn academics.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.190
They will also learn how to become leaders,

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.074
and they will develop their skills as entrepreneurs.

00:11:52.074 --> 00:11:55.938
So think of this as Africa's Ivy League,

00:11:55.938 --> 00:11:59.220
but instead of getting admitted
because of your SAT scores

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.101
or because of how much money you have
