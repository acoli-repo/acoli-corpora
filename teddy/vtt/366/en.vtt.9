00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:30.820
You say, "Let me try this way."

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.273
The Senate comes and says, "Uh-uh,

00:04:32.273 --> 00:04:35.101
we don't think you can do that."

00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:37.744
You say, perhaps, "Let me print some money.

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:40.399
I think the economy needs a stimulus."

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:41.894
The central bank governor will think you're crazy.

00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:45.000
You might get impeached for that.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.307
But if you become the president of Zimbabwe,

00:04:47.307 --> 00:04:50.440
and you say, "You know, I really like this job.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.225
I think I'd like to stay in it forever."
(Laughter)

00:04:55.225 --> 00:04:58.070
Well, you just can.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.550
You decide you want to print money.
