00:05:29.434 --> 00:05:30.976
in the '50s and '60s.

00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:33.414
These are people like Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana

00:05:33.414 --> 00:05:35.827
and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.

00:05:35.827 --> 00:05:38.432
The legacy they left is that they
brought independence to Africa.

00:05:38.432 --> 00:05:39.737
They freed us from colonialism,

00:05:39.737 --> 00:05:42.121
and let's give them credit for that.

00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:45.133
They were followed by generation two.

00:05:45.133 --> 00:05:47.183
These are people that brought nothing

00:05:47.183 --> 00:05:49.320
but havoc to Africa.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.750
Think warfare, corruption, human rights abuses.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.783
This is the stereotype of 
the typical African leader

00:05:54.783 --> 00:05:56.178
that we typically think of:

00:05:56.178 --> 00:05:58.184
Mobutu Sese Seko from Zaire,

00:05:58.184 --> 00:06:00.565
Sani Abacha from Nigeria.
