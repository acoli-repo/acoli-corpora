00:07:29.252 --> 00:07:31.626
so if we don't grow our economies fast enough,

00:07:31.626 --> 00:07:34.073
we're sitting on a ticking time bomb,

00:07:34.073 --> 00:07:37.605
not just for Africa but for the entire world.

00:07:37.605 --> 00:07:39.743
Let me show you an example

00:07:39.743 --> 00:07:41.449
of one person who is living up to this legacy

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:44.212
of creating prosperity: Laetitia.

00:07:44.212 --> 00:07:47.203
Laetitia's a young woman from Kenya

00:07:47.203 --> 00:07:49.000
who at the age of 13 had to drop out of school

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.910
because her family couldn't 
afford to pay fees for her.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.111
So she started her own business rearing rabbits,

00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:55.710
which happen to be a delicacy in this part of Kenya

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.308
that she's from.

00:07:57.308 --> 00:07:59.292
This business did so well that within a year,

00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:01.448
she was employing 15 women
