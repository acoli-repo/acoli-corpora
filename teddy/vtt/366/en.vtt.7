But if there's one thing you take
away from my talk today, it is this:

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:36.550
In Africa, more than anywhere else in the world,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.876
the difference that just one good leader can make

00:03:39.876 --> 00:03:43.435
is much greater than anywhere 
else, and here's why.

00:03:43.435 --> 00:03:46.225
It's because in Africa, we have weak institutions,

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:48.903
like the judiciary, the constitution,

00:03:48.903 --> 00:03:52.094
civil society and so forth.

00:03:52.094 --> 00:03:55.944
So here's a general rule of thumb that I believe in:

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:58.711
When societies have strong institutions,

00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:01.973
the difference that one good
leader can make is limited,
