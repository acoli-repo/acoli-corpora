Sani Abacha from Nigeria.

00:06:00.565 --> 00:06:03.741
The good news is that most of
these leaders have moved on,

00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:05.845
and they were replaced by generation three.

00:06:05.845 --> 00:06:08.161
These are people like the late Nelson Mandela

00:06:08.161 --> 00:06:10.175
and most of the leaders that we see in Africa today,

00:06:10.175 --> 00:06:12.852
like Paul Kagame and so forth.

00:06:12.852 --> 00:06:15.960
Now these leaders are by no means perfect,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.605
but the one thing they have done is that they have

00:06:17.605 --> 00:06:20.603
cleaned up much of the mess of generation two.

00:06:20.603 --> 00:06:22.061
They've stopped the fighting,

00:06:22.061 --> 00:06:25.160
and I call them the stabilizer generation.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.110
They're much more accountable to their people,

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.305
they've improved macroeconomic policies,
