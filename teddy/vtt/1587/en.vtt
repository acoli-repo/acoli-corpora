Thank you for putting up these pictures of my colleagues over here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
(Laughter) We'll be talking about them.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now, I'm going try an experiment. I don't do experiments, normally. I'm a theorist.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But I'm going see what happens if I press this button.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Sure enough. OK. I used to work in this field of elementary particles.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What happens to matter if you chop it up very fine?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What is it made of?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And the laws of these particles are valid throughout the universe,
