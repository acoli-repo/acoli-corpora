00:02:59.803 --> 00:03:02.535
Cervantes’ story deeply investigates

00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:04.808
the protagonist’s inner life.

00:03:04.808 --> 00:03:08.351
Don Quixote matures as the narrative develops,

00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:12.047
undergoing a noticeable transformation.

00:03:12.047 --> 00:03:13.813
This literary revelation

00:03:13.813 --> 00:03:16.868
has led many scholars to call Don Quixote

00:03:16.868 --> 00:03:19.448
the first modern novel.

00:03:19.448 --> 00:03:21.345
And this character development

00:03:21.345 --> 00:03:23.756
doesn’t happen in isolation.

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:26.077
Early on, Don Quixote is joined

00:03:26.077 --> 00:03:28.136
by a villager-turned-squire

00:03:28.136 --> 00:03:30.274
named Sancho Panza.
