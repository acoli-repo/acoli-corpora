00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.029

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:09.809

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:12.627
readers clamored for more.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:15.508

00:04:15.508 --> 00:04:18.722
on a fake follow-up, Cervantes released

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.576
as a completed text, this second volume picks up

00:04:27.576 --> 00:04:29.890
where the original left off,

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.020
only now Don Quixote and Sancho have become folk heroes.
