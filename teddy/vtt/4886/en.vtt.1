00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:31.102
As his squire Sancho Panza explains to him

00:00:31.102 --> 00:00:34.386
time and again, these aren’t giants;

00:00:34.386 --> 00:00:36.790
they are merely windmills.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.471
Don Quixote is undeterred,

00:00:38.483 --> 00:00:39.938
but his piercing lance

00:00:39.938 --> 00:00:42.807
is soon caught in their sails.

00:00:42.807 --> 00:00:44.006
Never discouraged,

00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:46.828
the knight stands proudly, and becomes

00:00:46.828 --> 00:00:50.367
even more convinced of his mission.

00:00:50.336 --> 00:00:52.039
This sequence encapsulates

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.362
much of what is loved about Don Quixote,

00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:58.868
the epic, illogical, and soulful tale of

00:00:58.868 --> 00:01:00.236
Alonso Quijano,
