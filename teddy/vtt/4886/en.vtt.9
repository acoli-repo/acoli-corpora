00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.020
only now Don Quixote and Sancho have become folk heroes.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.835
Just as in real-life, Cervantes included

00:04:37.835 --> 00:04:42.206
his novel’s success in the world of his characters.

00:04:42.206 --> 00:04:45.214
This unconventional meta-awareness

00:04:45.214 --> 00:04:48.145
created philosophical complexity,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.227
as the knight and his squire ponder

00:04:50.227 --> 00:04:52.692
the meaning of their story.

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:55.279
Unfortunately, Cervantes had sold

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:57.836
the book’s publishing rights for very little.

00:04:57.836 --> 00:05:00.361
He died rich in fame alone.
