00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and the bacteria started to read this genetic code,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
made the viral particles.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
The viral particles then were released from the cells

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and came back and killed the E. coli.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I was talking to the oil industry recently

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and I said they clearly understood that model.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
(Laughter)

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
They laughed more than you guys are. (Laughter)

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And so, we think this is a situation

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
where the software can actually build its own hardware

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
in a biological system.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
But we wanted to go much larger:
