00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
We're trying to get to the point of automation.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So, this looks like a basketball playoff.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
When we get into these really large pieces

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
over 100,000 base pairs,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
they won't any longer grow readily in E. coli --

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
it exhausts all the modern tools of molecular biology --

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and so we turned to other mechanisms.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
We knew there's a mechanism called homologous recombination

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that biology uses to repair DNA

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
that can put pieces together.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Here's an example of it:

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
there's an organism called
