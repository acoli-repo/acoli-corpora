00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
or can we create new life

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
out of this digital universe?"

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This is the map of a small organism,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Mycoplasma genitalium,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that has the smallest genome for a species

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that can self-replicate in the laboratory,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and we've been trying to just see if

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
we can come up with an even smaller genome.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We're able to knock out on the order of 100 genes

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
out of the 500 or so that are here.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
When we look at its metabolic map,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
it's relatively simple

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
compared to ours --
