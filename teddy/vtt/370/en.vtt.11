00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
we can just chew back with enzymes;

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
there are enzymes that repair them and put them together.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And we started making pieces,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7,000 letters,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
put those together to make 24,000-letter pieces,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
then put sets of those going up to 72,000.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
At each stage, we grew up these pieces in abundance

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
so we could sequence them

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
because we're trying to create a process that's extremely robust

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
that you can see in a minute.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
We're trying to get to the point of automation.
