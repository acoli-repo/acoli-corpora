00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
"What is life?" is something that I think many biologists

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
have been trying to understand

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
at various levels.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We've tried various approaches,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
paring it down to minimal components.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We've been digitizing it now for almost 20 years;

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
when we sequenced the human genome,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
it was going from the analog world of biology

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
into the digital world of the computer.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now we're trying to ask, "Can we regenerate life

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
or can we create new life

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
out of this digital universe?"
