00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You know, I've talked about some of these projects before --

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
about the human genome and what that might mean,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and discovering new sets of genes.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We're actually starting at a new point:

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
we've been digitizing biology,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and now we're trying to go from that digital code

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
into a new phase of biology

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
with designing and synthesizing life.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, we've always been trying to ask big questions.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
"What is life?" is something that I think many biologists
