You may have read that we put watermarks in.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Think of this:

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
we have a four-letter genetic code -- A, C, G and T.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Triplets of those letters

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
code for roughly 20 amino acids,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
such that there's a single letter designation

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
for each of the amino acids.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So we can use the genetic code to write out words,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
sentences, thoughts.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Initially, all we did was autograph it.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Some people were disappointed there was not poetry.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
We designed these pieces so

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
we can just chew back with enzymes;
