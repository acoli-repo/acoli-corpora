So, this is the publication we had just a short while ago.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
This is over 580,000 letters of genetic code;

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
it's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
It's over 300 million molecular weight.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
If we printed it out at a 10 font with no spacing,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
it takes 142 pages

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
just to print this genetic code.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Well, how do we boot up a chromosome? How do we activate this?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Obviously, with a virus it's pretty simple;

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria.
