00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
We have the ability now to build a large robot

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
that can make a million chromosomes a day.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
When you think of processing these 20 million different genes

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
or trying to optimize processes

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
new vaccines,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
we can just with a small team,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
do more molecular biology

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
than the last 20 years of all science.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And it's just standard selection:

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
we can select for viability,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
chemical or fuel production,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
vaccine production, etc.
