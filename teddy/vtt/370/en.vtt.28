00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
using molecular hydrogen as its energy source.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
We're looking to see if we can take

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
captured CO2,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
which can easily be piped to sites,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
convert that CO2 back into fuel

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
to drive this process.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
So, in a short period of time,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
we think that we might be able to increase

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
what the basic question is of "What is life?"

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
We truly, you know,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
have modest goals

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
of replacing the whole petrol-chemical industry --

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
