(Laughter) (Applause)

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Yeah. If you can't do that at TED, where can you? --

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
(Laughter)

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
become a major source of energy ...

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
But also, we're now working on using these same tools

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
to come up with instant sets of vaccines.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
You've seen this year with flu;

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
we're always a year behind and a dollar short

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
when it comes to the right vaccine.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
I think that can be changed

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
by building combinatorial vaccines in advance.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Here's what the future may begin to look like
