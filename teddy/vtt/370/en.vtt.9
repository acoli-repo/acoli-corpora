When we first sequenced this genome in 1995,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
We actually found, on resequencing it,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
30 errors; had we used that original sequence,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
it never would have been able to be booted up.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Part of the design is designing pieces

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that are 50 letters long

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
that have to overlap with all the other 50-letter pieces

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
to build smaller subunits

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
we have to design so they can go together.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We design unique elements into this.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
You may have read that we put watermarks in.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
