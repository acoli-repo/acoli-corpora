00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
compared to ours --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
trust me, this is simple --

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but when we look at all the genes

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that we can knock out one at a time,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
it's very unlikely that this would yield

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
a living cell.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So we decided the only way forward

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
was to actually synthesize this chromosome

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
so we could vary the components

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
to ask some of these most fundamental questions.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And so we started down the road of:

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
can we synthesize a chromosome?
