00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
can we synthesize a chromosome?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Can chemistry permit making

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
these really large molecules

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
where we've never been before?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And if we do, can we boot up a chromosome?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of inert chemical material.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So, our pace of digitizing life has been increasing

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
at an exponential pace.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Our ability to write the genetic code

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
has been moving pretty slowly

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
but has been increasing,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve.
