00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Why do this?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
We're about to go from six and a half

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
to nine billion people over the next 40 years.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
To put it in context for myself:

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I was born in 1946.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
There are now three people on the planet

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
for every one of us that existed in 1946;

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
within 40 years, there'll be four.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
We have trouble feeding, providing fresh, clean water,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
medicines, fuel

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
for the six and a half billion.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
It's going to be a stretch to do it for nine.
