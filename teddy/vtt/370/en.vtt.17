00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
We purified a chromosome from one microbial species --

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
roughly, these two are as distant as human and mice --

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
we added a few extra genes

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
so we could select for this chromosome,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
we digested it with enzymes

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
to kill all the proteins,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and it was pretty stunning when we put this in the cell --

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
and you'll appreciate

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
our very sophisticated graphics here.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
The new chromosome went into the cell.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
In fact, we thought this might be as far as it went,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
but we tried to design the process a little bit further.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
This is a major mechanism of evolution right here.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
We find all kinds of species
