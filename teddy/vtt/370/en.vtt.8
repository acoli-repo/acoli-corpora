00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
But we wanted to go much larger:

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
we wanted to build the entire bacterial chromosome --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
it's over 580,000 letters of genetic code --

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
so we thought we'd build them in cassettes the size of the viruses

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
so we could actually vary the cassettes

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
to understand

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
what the actual components of a living cell are.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Design is critical,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and if you're starting with digital information in the computer,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that digital information has to be really accurate.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
When we first sequenced this genome in 1995,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
the standard of accuracy was one error per 10,000 base pairs.
