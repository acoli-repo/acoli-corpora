00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
the other chromosome as foreign material,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
chewed it up, and so we ended up

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
just with a cell with the new chromosome.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
It turned blue because of the genes we put in it.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And with a very short period of time,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
all the characteristics of one species were lost

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and it converted totally into the new species

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
based on the new software that we put in the cell.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
All the proteins changed,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
the membranes changed;

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
when we read the genetic code, it's exactly what we had transferred in.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
So, this may sound like genomic alchemy,
