In fact, NASA has shown a lot of this is out there.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Here's an actual micrograph of the molecule we built

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
using these processes, actually just using yeast mechanisms

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
with the right design of the pieces we put them in;

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
yeast puts them together automatically.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
This is not an electron micrograph;

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
this is just a regular photomicrograph.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
It's such a large molecule

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
we can see it with a light microscope.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
These are pictures over about a six-second period.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
So, this is the publication we had just a short while ago.
