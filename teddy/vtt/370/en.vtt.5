00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and our latest point would put it on, now, an exponential curve.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We started this over 15 years ago.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It took several stages, in fact,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
But it turns out synthesizing DNA

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
is very difficult.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
There are tens of thousands of machines around the world

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that make small pieces of DNA --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
30 to 50 letters in length --

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and it's a degenerate process, so the longer you make the piece,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
the more errors there are.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So we had to create a new method
