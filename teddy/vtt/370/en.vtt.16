00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
it's much more complicated dealing with bacteria.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
It's also simpler when you go

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
into eukaryotes like ourselves:

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
you can just pop out the nucleus

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and pop in another one,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and that's what you've all heard about with cloning.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
With bacteria and Archaea, the chromosome is integrated into the cell,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
but we recently showed that we can do a complete transplant

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
of a chromosome from one cell to another

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and activate it.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
We purified a chromosome from one microbial species --

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
roughly, these two are as distant as human and mice --
