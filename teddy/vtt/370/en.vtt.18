00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
This is a major mechanism of evolution right here.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
We find all kinds of species

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that have taken up a second chromosome

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
or a third one from somewhere,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
adding thousands of new traits

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
in a second to that species.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So, people who think of evolution

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
as just one gene changing at a time

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
have missed much of biology.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
There are enzymes called restriction enzymes

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
that actually digest DNA.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
The chromosome that was in the cell

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
doesn't have one;

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
the chromosome we put in does.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
It got expressed and it recognized

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
the other chromosome as foreign material,
