00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
is just a bad experiment.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
We have second- and third-generation fuels

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
that will be coming out relatively soon

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
that are sugar, to much higher-value fuels

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
like octane or different types of butanol.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
But the only way we think that biology

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
can have a major impact without

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
is if we start with CO2 as its feedstock,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and so we're working with designing cells to go down this road.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And we think we'll have the first fourth-generation fuels
