00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Here's what the future may begin to look like

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
with changing, now, the evolutionary tree,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
speeding up evolution

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
with synthetic bacteria, Archaea

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
and, eventually, eukaryotes.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
We're a ways away from improving people:

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
to survive long enough to maybe do that. Thank you very much.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:29.000
