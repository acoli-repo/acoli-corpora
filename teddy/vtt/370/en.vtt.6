00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So we had to create a new method

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And this was our first attempt, starting with the digital information

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
of the genome of phi X174.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It's a small virus that kills bacteria.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
We designed the pieces, went through our error correction

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and had a DNA molecule

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
of about 5,000 letters.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and put it in the bacteria,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and the bacteria started to read this genetic code,
