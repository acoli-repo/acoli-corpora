00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And we think we'll have the first fourth-generation fuels

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
in about 18 months.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Sunlight and CO2 is one method ...

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
(Applause)

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
but in our discovery around the world,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
we have all kinds of other methods.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
This is an organism we described in 1996.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
It lives in the deep ocean,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
about a mile and a half deep,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
almost at boiling-water temperatures.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
It takes CO2 to methane

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
using molecular hydrogen as its energy source.
