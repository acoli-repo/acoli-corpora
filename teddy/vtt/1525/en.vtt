00:00:00.685 --> 00:00:03.727
The urban explosion

00:00:03.727 --> 00:00:07.952
of the last years of economic boom

00:00:07.952 --> 00:00:11.463
also produced dramatic marginalization,

00:00:11.463 --> 00:00:13.737
resulting in the explosion of slums

00:00:13.737 --> 00:00:16.352
in many parts of the world.

00:00:16.352 --> 00:00:19.599
This polarization of enclaves of mega-wealth

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.434
surrounded by sectors of poverty

00:00:22.434 --> 00:00:25.816
and the socioeconomic inequalities
they have engendered

00:00:25.816 --> 00:00:29.378
is really at the center of today's urban crisis.

00:00:29.378 --> 00:00:31.736
But I want to begin tonight
