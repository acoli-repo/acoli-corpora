00:00:06.688 --> 00:00:10.568
At the age of 21, Simone de Beauvoir 
became the youngest person

00:00:10.568 --> 00:00:15.038
to take the philosophy exams
at France’s most esteemed university.

00:00:15.038 --> 00:00:17.048
She passed with flying colors.

00:00:17.048 --> 00:00:19.580
But as soon as she mastered 
the rules of philosophy,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.350
she wanted to break them.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.380
She’d been schooled 
on Plato’s Theory of Forms,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.280
which dismissed the physical world 
as a flawed reflection

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.220
of higher truths and unchanging ideals.
