I wanted to know how his
suicidal thinking became homicidal.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.080
But research is sparse
and there are no simple answers.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.159
Yes, he probably had ongoing depression.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:46.240
He had a personality
that was perfectionistic and self-reliant,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.880
and that made him less likely
to seek help from others.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.336
He had experienced
triggering events at the school

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.760
that left him feeling
debased and humiliated and mad.
