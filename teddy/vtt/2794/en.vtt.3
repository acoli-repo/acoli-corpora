00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.896
The cruel behavior
that defined the end of his life

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.480
showed me that he was a completely
different person from the one I knew.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.976
Afterwards people asked,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.760
"How could you not know?

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.120
What kind of a mother were you?"

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.880
I still ask myself those same questions.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.960
Before the shootings,
I thought of myself as a good mom.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.216
Helping my children become caring,

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.576
healthy, responsible adults

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.080
was the most important role of my life.
