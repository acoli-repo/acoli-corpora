00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.816
I'm trying to understand

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.936
how his suicidal thinking

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.400
led to murder.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.296
After a lot of reading
and talking with experts,

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.976
I have come to believe

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.720
that his involvement in the shootings
was rooted not in his desire to kill

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.160
but in his desire to die.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.616
The third challenge I have
when I talk about my son's murder-suicide

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.560
is that I'm talking about mental health --

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.896
excuse me --

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.536
is that I'm talking about mental health,
