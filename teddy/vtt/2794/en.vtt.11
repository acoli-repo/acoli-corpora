Too often, they get our attention
only if they reach a behavioral crisis.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.456
If estimates are correct

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.416
that about one
to two percent of all suicides

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.520
involves the murder of another person,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.000
when suicide rates rise,
as they are rising for some populations,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.400
the murder-suicide rates
will rise as well.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.016
I wanted to understand what was going on
in Dylan's mind prior to his death,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.760
so I looked for answers
from other survivors of suicide loss.
