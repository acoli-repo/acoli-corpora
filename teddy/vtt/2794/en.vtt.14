She assured me that a mother's love
was the strongest bond on Earth,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.000
and that she loved her children
more than anything in the world,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.856
but because of her illness,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.720
she was sure that they
would be better off without her.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.056
What she said and what
I've learned from others

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.816
is that we do not make
the so-called decision or choice

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.416
to die by suicide

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.296
in the same way
that we choose what car to drive

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.440
or where to go on a Saturday night.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.456
When someone is
in an extremely suicidal state,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.000
they are in a stage four
medical health emergency.
