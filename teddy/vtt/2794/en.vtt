00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.576
The last time I heard my son's voice

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.936
was when he walked out the front door

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.240
on his way to school.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.680
He called out one word in the darkness:

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.520
"Bye."

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It was April 20, 1999.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.936
Later that morning,
at Columbine High School,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.896
my son Dylan and his friend Eric

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.240
killed 12 students and a teacher

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.960
and wounded more than 20 others
before taking their own lives.
