00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.216
Thirteen innocent people were killed,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.440
leaving their loved ones
in a state of grief and trauma.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.176
Others sustained injuries,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.240
some resulting in disfigurement
and permanent disability.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.656
But the enormity of the tragedy

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.800
can't be measured only by the number
of deaths and injuries that took place.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.136
There's no way to quantify
the psychological damage

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.096
of those who were in the school,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.480
or who took part
in rescue or cleanup efforts.
