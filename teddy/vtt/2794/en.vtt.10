00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.176
it's estimated that about 75
to maybe more than 90 percent

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.600
have a diagnosable
mental health condition of some kind.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.936
As you all know very well,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.920
our mental health care system
is not equipped to help everyone,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.496
and not everyone with destructive thoughts

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.256
fits the criteria

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.440
for a specific diagnosis.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.216
Many who have ongoing feelings

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.976
of fear or anger or hopelessness

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.880
are never assessed or treated.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.280
Too often, they get our attention
only if they reach a behavioral crisis.
