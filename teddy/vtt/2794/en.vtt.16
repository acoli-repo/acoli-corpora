00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.016
Many of us have
suicidal thoughts at some point,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.536
but persistent,
ongoing thoughts of suicide

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.776
and devising a means to die

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.136
are symptoms of pathology,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.056
and like many illnesses,

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.840
the condition has to be
recognized and treated

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.040
before a life is lost.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.440
But my son's death
was not purely a suicide.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.960
It involved mass murder.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:30.960
I wanted to know how his
suicidal thinking became homicidal.
