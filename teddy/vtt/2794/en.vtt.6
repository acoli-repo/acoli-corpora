00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.840
First, when I walk into a room like this,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.056
I never know if someone there
has experienced loss

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.800
because of what my son did.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.216
I feel a need to acknowledge the suffering
caused by a member of my family

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.440
who isn't here to do it for himself.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.640
So first, with all of my heart,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.560
I'm sorry if my son has caused you pain.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.400
The second challenge I have

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.760
is that I must ask for understanding
and even compassion
