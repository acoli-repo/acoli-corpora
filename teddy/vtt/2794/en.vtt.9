is that I'm talking about mental health,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.736
or brain health, as I prefer to call it,
because it's more concrete.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.496
And in the same breath,
I'm talking about violence.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.096
The last thing I want to do
is to contribute to the misunderstanding

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.336
that already exists around mental illness.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.136
Only a very small percent of those
who have a mental illness

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.400
are violent toward other people,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.936
but of those who die by suicide,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.176
it's estimated that about 75
to maybe more than 90 percent
