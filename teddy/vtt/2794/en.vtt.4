00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.080
was the most important role of my life.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.080
But the tragedy convinced me
that I failed as a parent,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.560
and it's partially this sense of failure
that brings me here today.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.496
Aside from his father,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.080
I was the one person
who knew and loved Dylan the most.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.056
If anyone could have known
what was happening,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.800
it should have been me, right?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.200
But I didn't know.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.336
Today, I'm here to share the experience

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.080
of what it's like to be the mother
of someone who kills and hurts.
