00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.800
Two years after the shootings,
I got breast cancer,

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.560
and two years after that,
I began to have mental health problems.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.896
On top of the constant, perpetual grief

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.496
I was terrified that I would run
into a family member

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.576
of someone Dylan had killed,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.976
or be accosted by the press

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.480
or by an angry citizen.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.496
I was afraid to turn on the news,

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.480
afraid to hear myself being called
a terrible parent or a disgusting person.
