00:00:28.902 --> 00:00:31.307
focused on people who are not her:

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:35.710
people not her in her neighborhood,
her state, nor even in her country --

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:37.967
people she'd likely never meet.

00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:39.931
Davinia's impact started a few years ago

00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:42.699
when she reached out
to all of her friends on Facebook,

00:00:42.723 --> 00:00:44.906
and asked them to donate their pennies

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.373
so she could fund girls' education.

00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:49.804
She wasn't expecting a huge response,

00:00:49.828 --> 00:00:52.611
but 700,000 pennies later,

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.951
she's now sent over 120 girls to school.

00:00:55.975 --> 00:00:57.162
When we spoke last week,

00:00:57.186 --> 00:01:00.224
she told me she's become
a little infamous at the local bank
