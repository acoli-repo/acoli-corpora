00:06:56.144 --> 00:07:00.049
otherwise, every individual government
would have this built-in excuse mechanism

00:07:00.073 --> 00:07:04.182
that they couldn't possibly carry
the burden of global action alone.

00:07:05.405 --> 00:07:07.500
And so this is what we embarked upon.

00:07:08.103 --> 00:07:11.080
And as we embarked upon
this challenge, we asked ourselves,

00:07:11.104 --> 00:07:14.601
how do we gain enough pressure
and build a broad enough army

00:07:14.625 --> 00:07:16.713
to win these fights for the long term?

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:19.386
We could only think of one way.

00:07:20.034 --> 00:07:22.745
We needed to somehow turn
that short-term excitement

00:07:22.769 --> 00:07:25.666
of people involved with
the Make Poverty History campaign

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.292
into long-term passion.

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:29.819
It had to be part of their identity.
