00:03:56.651 --> 00:04:00.398
we simply laid down on this concrete
slab the size of half my bedroom

00:04:00.422 --> 00:04:03.328
with myself, Sonny Boy,
and the rest of his family,

00:04:03.352 --> 00:04:04.963
seven of us in this long line,

00:04:04.987 --> 00:04:07.381
with the smell of rubbish all around us

00:04:07.405 --> 00:04:09.539
and cockroaches crawling all around.

00:04:09.952 --> 00:04:11.231
And I didn't sleep a wink,

00:04:11.255 --> 00:04:12.964
but I lay awake thinking to myself,

00:04:12.988 --> 00:04:15.470
"Why should anyone have to live like this

00:04:15.494 --> 00:04:16.846
when I have so much?

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.036
Why should Sonny Boy's ability
to live out his dreams

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.106
be determined by where he's born,

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.891
or what Warren Buffett called
'the ovarian lottery?'"

00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:26.954
I just didn't get it,

00:04:26.978 --> 00:04:28.844
and I needed to understand why.

00:04:29.656 --> 00:04:32.002
Now, I only later came to understand
