human rights, gender equality,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.706
even conflict.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.322
We found ourselves shoulder to shoulder

00:08:35.346 --> 00:08:38.991
with people who are passionate about
targeting all these interrelated issues.

00:08:39.316 --> 00:08:41.353
But how did we actually
go about recruiting

00:08:41.377 --> 00:08:43.303
and engaging those global citizens?

00:08:43.327 --> 00:08:46.598
Well, we used the universal language:

00:08:47.034 --> 00:08:48.263
music.

00:08:48.287 --> 00:08:50.550
We launched the Global Citizen Festival

00:08:50.574 --> 00:08:53.424
in the heart of New York City
in Central Park,

00:08:53.448 --> 00:08:57.216
and we persuaded some of the world's
biggest artists to participate.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.556
We made sure that
these festivals coincided

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.721
with the UN General Assembly meeting,
