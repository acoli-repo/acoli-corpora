00:13:59.237 --> 00:14:01.055
more access to information,

00:14:01.079 --> 00:14:03.530
more capacity to influence
than ever before.

00:14:04.151 --> 00:14:07.893
Both the problems and the tools
to solve them are right before us.

00:14:08.377 --> 00:14:10.443
The world has changed,

00:14:10.467 --> 00:14:12.864
and those of us who look
beyond our borders

00:14:12.888 --> 00:14:14.928
are on the right side of history.

00:14:16.063 --> 00:14:17.309
So where are we?

00:14:17.898 --> 00:14:20.265
So we run this amazing festival,

00:14:20.289 --> 00:14:22.604
we've scored some big policy wins,

00:14:22.628 --> 00:14:25.127
and citizens are signing up
all over the world.

00:14:25.817 --> 00:14:27.873
But have we achieved our mission?

00:14:28.651 --> 00:14:29.809
No.
