wherever he is,

00:16:01.312 --> 00:16:05.390
and share with him how much the time
I spent on Smoky Mountain inspired me.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.429
Thanks to him and so many others,

00:16:08.453 --> 00:16:12.124
I came to understand the importance
of being part of a movement of people --

00:16:12.752 --> 00:16:16.219
the kids willing to look up
from their screens and out to the world,

00:16:16.743 --> 00:16:18.211
the global citizens.

00:16:19.104 --> 00:16:21.227
Global citizens who stand together,

00:16:21.973 --> 00:16:23.775
who ask the question "Why?,"

00:16:24.663 --> 00:16:26.415
who reject the naysayers,

00:16:26.938 --> 00:16:30.161
and embrace the amazing possibilities
of the world we share.
