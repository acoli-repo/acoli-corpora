00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.721
with the UN General Assembly meeting,

00:09:01.745 --> 00:09:04.199
so that leaders who need
to hear our voices

00:09:04.223 --> 00:09:05.952
couldn't possible ignore them.

00:09:06.828 --> 00:09:08.169
But there was a twist:

00:09:08.884 --> 00:09:10.539
you couldn't buy a ticket.

00:09:10.563 --> 00:09:11.753
You had to earn it.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.197
You had to take action
on behalf of a global cause,

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:18.813
and only once you'd done that
could you earn enough points to qualify.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.463
Activism is the currency.

00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:26.479
I had no interest in citizenship
purely as some sort of feel-good thing.

00:09:26.503 --> 00:09:30.780
For me, citizenship means you have to act,
and that's what we required.
