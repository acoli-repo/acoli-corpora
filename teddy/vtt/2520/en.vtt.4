from poverty, climate change,

00:02:00.603 --> 00:02:02.787
these issues become solvable.

00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:05.407
They are ultimately global issues,

00:02:05.431 --> 00:02:07.312
and they can ultimately only be solved

00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:11.731
by global citizens demanding
global solutions from their leaders.

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:15.232
Now, some people's immediate
reaction to this idea

00:02:15.256 --> 00:02:19.124

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.351
how I ended up here,

00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:26.163
how it connects with Davinia

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:27.628
and, hopefully, with you.
