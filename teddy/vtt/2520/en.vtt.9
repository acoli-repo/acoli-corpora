00:04:29.656 --> 00:04:32.002
Now, I only later came to understand

00:04:32.026 --> 00:04:34.454
that the poverty I'd seen
in the Philippines

00:04:34.478 --> 00:04:38.787
was the result of decisions made
or not made, man-made,

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:42.216
by a succession of colonial powers
and corrupt governments

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.405
who had anything but the interests
of Sonny Boy at heart.

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:49.229
Sure, they didn't create Smoky Mountain,
but they may as well have.

00:04:49.253 --> 00:04:51.854
And if we're to try to help
kids like Sonny Boy,

00:04:51.878 --> 00:04:54.570
it wouldn't work just to try
to send him a few dollars

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:57.682
or to try to clean up
the garbage dump on which he lived,

00:04:57.706 --> 00:05:00.190
because the core
of the problem lay elsewhere.
