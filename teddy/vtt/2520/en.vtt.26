00:12:59.872 --> 00:13:01.035
This is, I believe,

00:13:01.059 --> 00:13:03.526
outdated, even dangerous thinking.

00:13:04.059 --> 00:13:05.932
Or as my late grandfather would say,

00:13:05.956 --> 00:13:07.301
complete BS.

00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.947
Parochialism offers this false dichotomy

00:13:10.971 --> 00:13:14.477
because it pits the poor in one country
against the poor in another.

00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:18.350
It pretends we can isolate ourselves
and our nations from one another.

00:13:18.699 --> 00:13:20.766
The whole world is our backyard,

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:22.671
and we ignore it at our peril.

00:13:22.695 --> 00:13:24.893
See, look what happened
when we ignored Rwanda,

00:13:24.917 --> 00:13:26.385
when we ignore Syria,

00:13:26.409 --> 00:13:28.312
when we ignore climate change.

00:13:28.336 --> 00:13:30.519
Political leaders ought to give a "funk"
