00:04:57.706 --> 00:05:00.190
because the core
of the problem lay elsewhere.

00:05:00.214 --> 00:05:03.873
And as I worked on community
development projects over the coming years

00:05:03.897 --> 00:05:05.739
trying to help build schools,

00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:08.804
train teachers, and tackle HIV and AIDS,

00:05:08.828 --> 00:05:11.265
I came to see that community development

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:13.845
should be driven
by communities themselves,

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:17.622
and that although charity is necessary,
it's not sufficient.

00:05:17.646 --> 00:05:19.507
We need to confront these challenges

00:05:19.531 --> 00:05:22.197
on a global scale and in a systemic way.

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:23.666
And the best thing I could do

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.197
is try to mobilize a large group
of citizens back home

00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:30.784
to insist that our leaders engage
in that systemic change.
