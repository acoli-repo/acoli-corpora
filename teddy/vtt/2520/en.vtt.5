Growing up in Melbourne, Australia,

00:02:30.096 --> 00:02:33.435
I was one of those seriously
irritating little kids

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.783
that never, ever stopped asking, "Why?"

00:02:35.807 --> 00:02:37.402
You might have been one yourself.

00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:40.798
I used to ask my mum
the most annoying questions.

00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:43.621
I'd ask her questions like,
"Mum, why I can't I dress up

00:02:43.645 --> 00:02:45.572
and play with puppets all day?"

00:02:45.596 --> 00:02:47.596
"Why do you want fries with that?"

00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:49.126
"What is a shrimp,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.822
and why do we have to keep
throwing them on the barbie?"

00:02:51.846 --> 00:02:52.847
(Laughter)

00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:54.679
"And mum -- this haircut.

00:02:54.703 --> 00:02:55.876
Why?"

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.328
(Laughter)

00:02:58.126 --> 00:02:59.880
The worst haircut, I think.
