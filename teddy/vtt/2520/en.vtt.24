00:11:57.474 --> 00:12:02.557
Indeed, the powerful American
politician Tip O'Neill once said,

00:12:02.581 --> 00:12:04.580
"All politics is local."

00:12:05.762 --> 00:12:08.535
That's what always
got politicians elected:

00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:11.581
to seek, gain and hold onto power

00:12:11.605 --> 00:12:15.478
through the pursuit of local
or at very best national interests.

00:12:16.185 --> 00:12:20.497
I experienced this for the first time
when I was 21 years old.

00:12:21.113 --> 00:12:22.495
I took a meeting

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:26.958
with a then-Australian Foreign Minister
who shall remain nameless --

00:12:27.655 --> 00:12:28.946
[Alexander Downer]

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.728
