00:03:28.626 --> 00:03:32.356
It was there I became friends
with Sonny Boy,

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.919
who lived on what was literally
a pile of steaming garbage.

00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:38.626
"Smoky Mountain" was what they called it.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.935
But don't let the romance
of that name fool you,

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.320
because it was nothing more
than a rancid landfill

00:03:43.344 --> 00:03:47.685
that kids like Sonny Boy spent hours
rummaging through every single day

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.645
to find something, anything of value.

00:03:51.304 --> 00:03:54.580
That night with Sonny Boy and his family
changed my life forever,

00:03:54.604 --> 00:03:56.627
because when it came time to go to sleep,

00:03:56.651 --> 00:04:00.398
we simply laid down on this concrete
slab the size of half my bedroom
