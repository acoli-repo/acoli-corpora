WEBVTT

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:35.241
So in 2012, we cofounded an organization
that had exactly that as its goal.

00:07:35.836 --> 00:07:37.725
And there was only one name for it:

00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:39.558
Global Citizen.

00:07:40.241 --> 00:07:42.748
But this is not about
any one organization.

00:07:43.295 --> 00:07:45.618
This is about citizens taking action.

00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:47.802
And research data tells us

00:07:47.826 --> 00:07:52.057
that of the total population
who even care about global issues,

00:07:52.081 --> 00:07:55.586
only 18 percent have done
anything about it.

00:07:56.237 --> 00:07:58.571
It's not that people don't want to act.

00:07:58.595 --> 00:08:01.026
It's often that they don't
know how to take action,
