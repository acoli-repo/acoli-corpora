00:06:28.965 --> 00:06:30.267
But here's the thing:

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:32.457
it didn't last.

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:34.895
See, there was a change in government,

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.607
and six years later, all that new money

00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:38.797
disappeared.

00:06:39.542 --> 00:06:40.774
What did we learn?

00:06:41.703 --> 00:06:44.780
We learned that one-off spikes
are not enough.

00:06:45.225 --> 00:06:47.685
We needed a sustainable movement,

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:51.693
not one that is susceptible
to the fluctuating moods of a politician

00:06:51.717 --> 00:06:53.994
or the hint of an economic downturn.

00:06:54.018 --> 00:06:56.120
And it needed to happen everywhere;

00:06:56.144 --> 00:07:00.049
otherwise, every individual government
would have this built-in excuse mechanism
