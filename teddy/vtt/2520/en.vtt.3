00:01:27.467 --> 00:01:32.307
and someone who is prepared
to act on that belief,

00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:35.226
to tackle our world's greatest challenges.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.703
Our work is focused on finding,

00:01:37.727 --> 00:01:40.610
supporting and activating global citizens.

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:42.532
They exist in every country

00:01:42.556 --> 00:01:44.459
and among every demographic.

00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:46.770
I want to make the case to you today

00:01:46.794 --> 00:01:49.872
that the world's future depends
on global citizens.

00:01:49.896 --> 00:01:54.198
I'm convinced that if we had
more global citizens active in our world,

00:01:54.222 --> 00:01:56.957
then every single one
of the major challenges we face --

00:01:56.981 --> 00:02:00.579
from poverty, climate change,
gender inequality --
