This is not going to be easy for Africa.

00:13:01.357 --> 00:13:04.821
It is not going to be easy for a people
used to being told how to think,

00:13:04.845 --> 00:13:07.210
what to do, how to go about it,

00:13:07.234 --> 00:13:10.388
a people long subjected
to the intellectual guidance

00:13:10.412 --> 00:13:12.154
and direction of others,

00:13:12.178 --> 00:13:13.845
be they the colonial masters,

00:13:13.869 --> 00:13:16.841
aid industry or international news media.

00:13:16.865 --> 00:13:20.099
But it is a task that we have to do
to make progress.

00:13:20.123 --> 00:13:23.023
I am strengthened by the words
of Joseph Shabalala,

00:13:23.047 --> 00:13:26.521
founder of the South African choral group
Ladysmith Black Mambazo.

00:13:26.545 --> 00:13:32.232
He said that the task ahead of us
can never, ever be greater
