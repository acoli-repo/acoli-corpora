00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:30.765
As I grew up and I advanced academically,

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:35.853
my reality was further separated
from my education.

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.485
In history, I was taught

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:42.760
that the Scottish explorer Mungo Park
discovered the Niger River.

00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:45.424
And so it bothered me.

00:03:45.448 --> 00:03:47.463
My great-great-grandparents grew up

00:03:47.487 --> 00:03:49.490
quite close to the edge
of the Niger River.

00:03:49.514 --> 00:03:51.933
(Laughter)

00:03:51.957 --> 00:03:58.434
And it took someone to travel
thousands of miles from Europe

00:03:58.458 --> 00:04:00.905
to discover a river
right under their nose?
