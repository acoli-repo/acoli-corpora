00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:00.449
Some decades back, I was taught
out of a similar alphabet sheet.

00:01:01.312 --> 00:01:03.569
And because of that,
I struggled for years.

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:08.960
I struggled to reconcile my reality
with the formal education I received

00:01:08.984 --> 00:01:11.131
in school, in the schools I attended.

00:01:12.592 --> 00:01:14.602
I had identity crises.

00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:17.535
I looked down on my reality.

00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:21.805
I looked at my ancestry,
I looked at my lineage with disrespect.

00:01:22.205 --> 00:01:27.258
I had very little patience
for what my life had to offer around me.

00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:30.444
Why?
