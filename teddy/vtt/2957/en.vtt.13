00:06:28.299 --> 00:06:30.992
so this is something
that is a life-or-death situation,

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:32.824
and it has been used for centuries.

00:06:33.384 --> 00:06:35.486
In an experiment that was conducted,

00:06:36.233 --> 00:06:41.646
two similar plots of land
were used in the experiment,

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.301
and one plot of land

00:06:44.325 --> 00:06:46.267
did not have the Tassa technique on it.

00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:47.458
Similar plots.

00:06:47.482 --> 00:06:50.640
The other one had Tassa technique
constructed on it.

00:06:51.332 --> 00:06:55.087
Then similar grains of millet
also were planted on both plots.

00:06:56.045 --> 00:06:58.252
During harvest time,

00:06:58.276 --> 00:07:01.428
the plot of land without Tassa technique
