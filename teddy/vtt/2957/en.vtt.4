00:01:58.962 --> 00:02:01.084
with an alphabet sheet like this

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.131
fulfills one of the major
functions of education,

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:08.317
which is to introduce the learner

00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:11.714
to an appreciation
of the learner's environment

00:02:11.738 --> 00:02:16.380
and a curiosity to explore more
in order to add value.

00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:18.992
In my own case,

00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:22.326
when and where I grew up in Africa,

00:02:23.613 --> 00:02:25.443
apple was an exotic fruit.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.104
Two or three times a year,

00:02:28.128 --> 00:02:33.495
I could get some yellowish apples
with brown dots, you know,
