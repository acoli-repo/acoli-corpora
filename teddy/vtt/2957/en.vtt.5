00:02:28.128 --> 00:02:33.495
I could get some yellowish apples
with brown dots, you know,

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.416
signifying thousands of miles traveled --
warehouses storing --

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.614
to get to me.

00:02:39.575 --> 00:02:41.486
I grew up in the city

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.510
to very financially comfortable parents,

00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:46.476
so it was my dignified reality,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.811
exactly the same way

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:52.997
cassava fufu or ugali
would not regularly feature

00:02:53.021 --> 00:02:55.922
in an American, Chinese or Indian diet,

00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:59.280
apples didn't count as part of my reality.
