00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:04.662
I had mostly Euro-Americans, you know,
with me from Washington, DC.

00:10:04.686 --> 00:10:09.536
And I looked across the table
at my African brothers and sisters.

00:10:09.993 --> 00:10:12.327
I could see intimidation on their faces.

00:10:12.771 --> 00:10:15.034
They didn't believe
they had anything to offer

00:10:15.058 --> 00:10:17.346
the great-great-grandchildren
of Mungo Park --

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.987
the owners of "apple" in "A is for apple."

00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:22.787
They just sat and watched:
"Oh, just give us, let us sign.

00:10:22.811 --> 00:10:24.724
You own the knowledge. You know it all.

00:10:24.748 --> 00:10:26.957
Just, where do we sign?
Show us, let us sign."

00:10:26.981 --> 00:10:30.017
They had no voice.
They didn't believe in themselves.
