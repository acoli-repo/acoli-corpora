00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.765
So the traffic moved a bit,
and I quickly grabbed a copy,

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.788
and we moved on.

00:00:34.165 --> 00:00:37.266
When I had time to fully open
the alphabet sheet

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.619
and take a more detailed look at it,

00:00:39.643 --> 00:00:42.666
I knew I was not going to use that
to teach my daughter.

00:00:43.267 --> 00:00:44.784
I regretted my purchase.

00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:47.673
Why so?

00:00:48.338 --> 00:00:51.124
Looking at the alphabet sheet
reminded me of the fact

00:00:51.148 --> 00:00:53.524
that not much has changed

00:00:53.548 --> 00:00:55.971
in the education curricula in Africa.

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:00.449
Some decades back, I was taught
out of a similar alphabet sheet.
