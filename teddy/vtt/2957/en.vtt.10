00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:04.163
my boss -- we were having
a conversation on some project,

00:05:04.187 --> 00:05:07.228
and he mentioned a particular
World Bank project,

00:05:07.252 --> 00:05:12.224
a large-scale irrigation project
that cost millions of dollars

00:05:12.248 --> 00:05:13.579
in Niger Republic

00:05:13.603 --> 00:05:16.877
that was faltering sustainably.

00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:19.244
He said this project
wasn't so sustainable,

00:05:19.268 --> 00:05:23.491
and it bothered those
that instituted the whole package.

00:05:24.035 --> 00:05:26.824
But then he mentioned
a particular project,

00:05:27.517 --> 00:05:32.434
a particular traditional irrigation method
that was hugely successful
