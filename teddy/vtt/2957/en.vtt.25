I agree with Mwalimu.

00:12:38.487 --> 00:12:39.875
I am convinced

00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:43.522
that Africa's further transformation,
Africa's advancement,

00:12:43.546 --> 00:12:48.325
rests simply in the acknowledgment,
validation and mainstreaming

00:12:48.349 --> 00:12:53.338
of Africa's own traditional, authentic,
original, indigenous knowledge

00:12:53.362 --> 00:12:58.233
in education, in research,
in policy making and across sectors.

00:12:58.816 --> 00:13:01.333
This is not going to be easy for Africa.
