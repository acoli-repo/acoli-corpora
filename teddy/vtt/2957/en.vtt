Some months back,
I was visiting this East African city,

00:00:06.558 --> 00:00:09.547
and we were stuck in traffic.

00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:12.613
And this vendor suddenly
approaches my window

00:00:12.637 --> 00:00:15.180
with a half-opened alphabet sheet.

00:00:16.505 --> 00:00:19.324
I took a quick look at the alphabet sheet,

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:20.783
and I thought of my daughter,

00:00:20.807 --> 00:00:23.369
how it would be nice
to spread it on the floor

00:00:23.393 --> 00:00:25.233
and just play all over it with her

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:27.446
while getting her to learn the alphabet.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.765
So the traffic moved a bit,
and I quickly grabbed a copy,
