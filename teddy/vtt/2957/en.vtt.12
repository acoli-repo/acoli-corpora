00:06:04.296 --> 00:06:07.922
and then crops are planted
across the surface area.

00:06:07.946 --> 00:06:11.250
What happens is that when rain falls,

00:06:11.274 --> 00:06:14.258
the holes are able to store the water

00:06:14.282 --> 00:06:18.100
and appropriate it to the extent
that the plant needs the water.

00:06:18.124 --> 00:06:21.390
The plant can only assimilate
as much water as needed

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:22.984
until harvest time.

00:06:24.582 --> 00:06:28.275
Niger is 75 percent scorched desert,

00:06:28.299 --> 00:06:30.992
so this is something
that is a life-or-death situation,
