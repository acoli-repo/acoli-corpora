00:11:58.438 --> 00:12:04.038
Most importantly is that Gacaca emphasized
Rwanda's traditional philosophy

00:12:04.062 --> 00:12:07.155
of reconciliation and reintegration,

00:12:07.179 --> 00:12:11.057
as against the whole
punitive and banishment idea

00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:14.803
that undergirds present-day Western style.

00:12:15.481 --> 00:12:19.376
And not to compare, but just to say
that it really emphasized

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.754
Rwanda's traditional method of philosophy.

00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:25.866
And so it was Mwalimu Julius Nyerere,

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.631
former president of Tanzania --

00:12:27.655 --> 00:12:29.131
(Applause)

00:12:29.155 --> 00:12:32.331
who said that you cannot develop people.
