00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:03.277
The writer George Eliot cautioned us that,

00:00:03.277 --> 00:00:05.344
among all forms of mistake,

00:00:05.344 --> 00:00:07.707
prophesy is the most gratuitous.

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:09.555
The person that we would all acknowledge

00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:13.857
as her 20th-century counterpart, Yogi Berra, agreed.

00:00:13.857 --> 00:00:15.722
He said, "It's tough to make predictions,

00:00:15.722 --> 00:00:18.458
especially about the future."

00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:20.269
I'm going to ignore their cautions

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.242
and make one very specific forecast.

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:24.882
In the world that we are creating very quickly,

00:00:24.882 --> 00:00:26.595
we're going to see more and more things

00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:28.320
that look like science fiction,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.436
and fewer and fewer things that look like jobs.
