00:13:28.417 --> 00:13:31.518
that we used to make maps of the universe.

00:13:31.542 --> 00:13:33.768
These really small galaxies,

00:13:33.792 --> 00:13:35.750
some of them are extremely small.

00:13:36.458 --> 00:13:39.393
Some of them have as few
as a few hundred stars,

00:13:39.417 --> 00:13:43.059
compared to the few hundred
billion stars in our Milky Way.

00:13:43.083 --> 00:13:45.893
So that makes them really hard to find.

00:13:45.917 --> 00:13:47.809
But in the last decade,

00:13:47.833 --> 00:13:50.518
we've actually found
a whole bunch more of these.

00:13:50.542 --> 00:13:53.268
We now know of 60 of these tiny galaxies

00:13:53.292 --> 00:13:56.309
that are orbiting our own Milky Way.

00:13:56.333 --> 00:13:59.917
And these little guys
are a big clue to dark matter.
