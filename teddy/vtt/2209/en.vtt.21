Now, another way to get a clue
to what dark matter is

00:10:30.292 --> 00:10:32.559
is to study galaxies.

00:10:32.583 --> 00:10:34.018
We already talked about

00:10:34.042 --> 00:10:37.601
how our galaxy and many other galaxies
wouldn't even be here

00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:39.476
without dark matter.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.851
Those models also make predictions

00:10:41.875 --> 00:10:43.934
for many other things about galaxies:

00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.863
How they're distributed in the universe,

00:10:45.887 --> 00:10:47.143
how they move,

00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:49.184
how they evolve over time.

00:10:49.208 --> 00:10:54.018
And we can test those predictions
with observations of the sky.

00:10:54.042 --> 00:10:56.851
So let me just give you two examples

00:10:56.875 --> 00:11:00.125
of these kinds of measurements
we can make with galaxies.
