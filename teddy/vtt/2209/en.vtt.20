using the Large Hadron
Collider in Switzerland.

00:10:03.083 --> 00:10:05.268
Now, so far,

00:10:05.292 --> 00:10:08.559
all of these experiments
have taught us a lot

00:10:08.583 --> 00:10:10.226
about what dark matter isn't

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.434
(Laughter)

00:10:11.458 --> 00:10:13.000
but not yet what it is.

00:10:13.875 --> 00:10:17.018
There were really good ideas

00:10:17.042 --> 00:10:19.101
that these experiments would have seen.

00:10:19.125 --> 00:10:20.518
And they didn't see them yet,

00:10:20.542 --> 00:10:23.333
so we have to keep looking
and thinking harder.

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:30.268
Now, another way to get a clue
to what dark matter is
