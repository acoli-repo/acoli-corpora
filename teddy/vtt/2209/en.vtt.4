00:01:59.708 --> 00:02:02.184
You get some clues
from where the light is,

00:02:02.208 --> 00:02:04.018
but there's a lot that you can't see,

00:02:04.042 --> 00:02:07.684
everything from people
to mountain ranges.

00:02:07.708 --> 00:02:12.167
And you have to infer what is there
from these limited clues.

00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.875
We call this unseen stuff "dark matter."

00:02:17.708 --> 00:02:20.601
Now, a lot of people
have heard of dark matter,

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:22.934
but even if you have heard of it,

00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:25.976
it probably seems abstract,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.958
far away, probably even irrelevant.
