00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.393
Everything else, 85 percent of it,

00:01:30.417 --> 00:01:32.750
doesn't emit or absorb light.

00:01:33.708 --> 00:01:36.059
We can't see it with our eyes,

00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:39.601
we can't detect it with radio waves

00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:42.042
or microwaves or any other kind of light.

00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:45.018
But we know it is there

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:47.417
because of its influence
on what we can see.

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:50.476
It's a little bit like,

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.684
if you wanted to map
the surface of our planet

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:54.684
and everything on it

00:01:54.708 --> 00:01:58.375
using this picture of the Earth
from space at night.

00:01:59.708 --> 00:02:02.184
You get some clues
from where the light is,
