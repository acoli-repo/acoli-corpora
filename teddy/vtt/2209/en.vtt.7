00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.351
What about the stories

00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:33.018
of the hundreds of millions
of other galaxies

00:03:33.042 --> 00:03:37.184
that we've already mapped out
with large surveys of the sky?

00:03:37.208 --> 00:03:39.434
How would their histories be different

00:03:39.458 --> 00:03:42.351
if the universe was made of something else

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:45.476
or if there was more or less matter in it?

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.351
So the interesting thing
about these model universes

00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:52.167
is that they allow us
to test these possibilities.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.667
Let's go back to the first
moment of the universe --

00:03:59.542 --> 00:04:04.333
just a fraction of a second
after the big bang.
