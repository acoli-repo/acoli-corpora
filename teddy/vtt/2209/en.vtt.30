00:14:58.333 --> 00:15:01.268
But it's going to be
a lot of fun to find out.

00:15:01.292 --> 00:15:03.684
We have a lot of possibilities
for discovery,

00:15:03.708 --> 00:15:07.184
and we definitely will learn more
about what it is doing

00:15:07.208 --> 00:15:08.792
and about what it isn't.

00:15:09.833 --> 00:15:12.893
Regardless of whether we find
that particle anytime soon,

00:15:12.917 --> 00:15:14.643
I hope I have convinced you

00:15:14.667 --> 00:15:18.726
that this mystery is actually
really close to home.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:20.268
The search for dark matter

00:15:20.292 --> 00:15:23.601
may just be the key to a whole new
understanding of physics

00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:25.476
and our place in the universe.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.768
Thank you.

00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:30.542
