00:06:58.208 --> 00:07:01.167
those spots never get clumpy enough.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.143
It turns out, you need at least
a million times the mass of the Sun

00:07:07.167 --> 00:07:08.809
in one dense region,

00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:11.351
before you can start forming stars.

00:07:11.375 --> 00:07:13.018
And without dark matter,

00:07:13.042 --> 00:07:16.809
you never get enough stuff in one place.

00:07:16.833 --> 00:07:21.434
So here, we're looking
at two universes, side by side.

00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:23.934
In one of them you can see

00:07:23.958 --> 00:07:26.976
that things get clumpy quickly.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.268
In that universe,

00:07:28.292 --> 00:07:30.625
it's really easy to form galaxies.
