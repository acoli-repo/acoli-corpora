00:03:59.542 --> 00:04:04.333
just a fraction of a second
after the big bang.

00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:07.809
In this first moment,

00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:09.934
there was no matter at all.

00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.434
The universe was expanding very fast.

00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:16.226
And quantum mechanics tells us

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.976
that matter is being created and destroyed

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
all the time, in every moment.

00:04:22.357 --> 00:04:24.643
At this time, the universe
was expanding so fast

00:04:24.667 --> 00:04:27.917
that the matter that got created
couldn't get destroyed.

00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:33.643
And thus we think that all of the matter
was created during this time.
