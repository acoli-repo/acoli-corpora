00:07:28.292 --> 00:07:30.625
it's really easy to form galaxies.

00:07:31.458 --> 00:07:32.934
In the other universe,

00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.476
the things that start out
like small clumps,

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.393
they just stay really small.

00:07:37.417 --> 00:07:39.518
Not very much happens.

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:42.893
In that universe,
you wouldn't get our galaxy.

00:07:42.917 --> 00:07:44.601
Or any other galaxy.

00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:46.476
You wouldn't get the Milky Way,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.309
you wouldn't get the Sun,

00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:50.059
you wouldn't get us.

00:07:50.083 --> 00:07:52.750
We just couldn't exist in that universe.

00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:58.393
OK, so this crazy stuff, dark matter,

00:07:58.417 --> 00:08:00.227
it's most of the mass in the universe,
