The universe was expanding
and getting less dense overall

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.643
over the last 13.8 billion years.

00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:40.518
But gravity worked hard in those spots

00:05:40.542 --> 00:05:42.684
where there was a little bit more mass

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:47.018
and pulled more and more mass
into those regions.

00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:49.809
Now, all of this
is a little hard to imagine,

00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:53.184
so let me just show you
what I am talking about.

00:05:53.208 --> 00:05:56.768
Those computer models I mentioned
allow us to test these ideas,

00:05:56.792 --> 00:05:58.583
so let's take a look at one of them.
