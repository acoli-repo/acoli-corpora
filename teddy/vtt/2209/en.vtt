00:00:00.958 --> 00:00:02.911
Do you ever think about what would happen

00:00:02.935 --> 00:00:05.518
if the world were a little bit different?

00:00:05.542 --> 00:00:07.101
How your life would be different

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:09.768
if you were born 5,000 years from now

00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:11.083
instead of today?

00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:13.476
How history would be different

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.643
if the continents
were at different latitudes

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:19.601
or how life in the Solar system
would have developed

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:22.167
if the Sun were 10 percent larger.

00:00:23.292 --> 00:00:26.184
Well, playing with these
kinds of possibilities

00:00:26.208 --> 00:00:27.809
is what I get to do for a living

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:30.000
but with the entire universe.
