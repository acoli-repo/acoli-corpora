00:09:28.042 --> 00:09:31.893
that a dark matter particle,
which goes through us and the Earth,

00:09:31.917 --> 00:09:34.226
would hit a denser material

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.167
and leave behind
some trace of its passage.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.976
We're looking for dark matter in the sky,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.184
for the possibility
that dark matter particles

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:44.601
would crash into each other

00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:47.601
and create high-energy light
that we could see

00:09:47.625 --> 00:09:50.601
with special gamma-ray telescopes.

00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:54.351
We're even trying to make
dark matter here on Earth,

00:09:54.375 --> 00:09:58.934
by smashing particles together
and looking for what happens,

00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:02.042
using the Large Hadron
Collider in Switzerland.
