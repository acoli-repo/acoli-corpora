00:14:00.833 --> 00:14:04.643
Because just the existence
of these galaxies tells us

00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:07.476
that dark matter
can't be moving very fast,

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.417
and not much can be happening
when it runs into normal matter.

00:14:12.583 --> 00:14:14.018
In the next several years,

00:14:14.042 --> 00:14:17.708
we're going to make much more
precise maps of the sky.

00:14:19.292 --> 00:14:21.726
And those will help refine our movies

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.750
of the whole universe
and the entire galaxy.

00:14:25.708 --> 00:14:29.768
Physicists are also making new,
more sensitive experiments

00:14:29.792 --> 00:14:33.625
to try to catch some sign
of dark matter in their laboratories.
