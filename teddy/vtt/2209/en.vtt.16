00:07:58.417 --> 00:08:00.227
it's most of the mass in the universe,

00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:03.351
it's going through us right now,
we wouldn't be here without it.

00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:04.625
What is it?

00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:06.893
Well, we have no idea.

00:08:06.917 --> 00:08:08.292
(Laughter)

00:08:09.208 --> 00:08:12.268
But we have a lot of educated guesses,

00:08:12.292 --> 00:08:15.559
and a lot of ideas
for how to find out more.

00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:20.101
So, most physicists think
that dark matter is a particle,

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:23.184
similar in many ways to the subatomic
particles that we know of,

00:08:23.208 --> 00:08:26.226
like protons and neutrons and electrons.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:27.518
Whatever it is,

00:08:27.542 --> 00:08:31.417
it behaves very similarly
with respect to gravity.
