but with the entire universe.

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:33.851
I make model universes in a computer.

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:36.809
Digital universes that have
different starting points

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:41.434
and are made of different amounts
of different kinds of material.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:44.768
And then I compare
these universes to our own

00:00:44.792 --> 00:00:48.500
to see what it is made of
and how it evolved.

00:00:50.542 --> 00:00:54.893
This process of testing models
with measurements of the sky

00:00:54.917 --> 00:00:57.792
has taught us a huge amount
about our universe so far.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.851
One of the strangest
