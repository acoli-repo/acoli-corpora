00:06:29.792 --> 00:06:32.809
which was initially well mixed
with the dark matter,

00:06:32.833 --> 00:06:34.643
starts to separate from it,

00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:37.226
cool down, form stars,

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.684
and you get a small galaxy.

00:06:39.708 --> 00:06:42.726
Over time, over billions
and billions of years,

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.184
those small galaxies crash into each other

00:06:45.208 --> 00:06:48.226
and merge and grow
to become larger galaxies,

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.583
like our own galaxy, the Milky Way.

00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:55.458
Now, what happens
if you don't have dark matter?

00:06:56.292 --> 00:06:58.184
If you don't have dark matter,

00:06:58.208 --> 00:07:01.167
those spots never get clumpy enough.
