00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:33.643
And thus we think that all of the matter
was created during this time.

00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:35.851
Both the dark matter

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:38.958
and the regular matter
that makes up you and me.

00:04:40.167 --> 00:04:42.601
Now, let's go a little bit further

00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:45.101
to a time after the matter was created,

00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:47.434
after protons and neutrons formed,

00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:49.184
after hydrogen formed,

00:04:49.208 --> 00:04:53.226
about 400,000 years after the big bang.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.518
The universe was hot and dense
and really smooth

00:04:57.542 --> 00:05:00.268
but not perfectly smooth.
