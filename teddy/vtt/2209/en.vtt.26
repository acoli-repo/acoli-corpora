00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.684
If you don't have those small clumps,

00:13:01.708 --> 00:13:04.417
then you get fewer small galaxies.

00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:07.893
If you look up at the southern sky,

00:13:07.917 --> 00:13:11.268
you can actually see
two of these small galaxies,

00:13:11.292 --> 00:13:14.768
the largest of the small galaxies
that are orbiting our Milky Way,

00:13:14.792 --> 00:13:17.792
the Large Magellanic Cloud
and the Small Magellanic Cloud.

00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:20.226
In the last several years,

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.601
we have detected a whole bunch more
even smaller galaxies.

00:13:23.625 --> 00:13:25.434
This is an example of one of them

00:13:25.458 --> 00:13:28.393
that we detected
with the same dark energy survey

00:13:28.417 --> 00:13:31.518
that we used to make maps of the universe.
