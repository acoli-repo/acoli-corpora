00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:33.434
Well, the interesting thing is,

00:02:33.458 --> 00:02:35.976
dark matter is all around us

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.934
and probably right here.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:40.893
In fact, dark matter particles

00:02:40.917 --> 00:02:44.059
are probably going through
your body right now

00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:46.059
as you sit in this room.

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:47.434
Because we are on Earth

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:49.309
and Earth is spinning around the Sun,

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:52.268
and the Sun is hurtling through our galaxy

00:02:52.292 --> 00:02:55.518
at about half a million miles per hour.

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:57.351
But dark matter doesn't bump into us,

00:02:57.375 --> 00:02:58.875
it just goes right through us.
