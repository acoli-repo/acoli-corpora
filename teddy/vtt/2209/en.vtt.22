00:10:56.875 --> 00:11:00.125
of these kinds of measurements
we can make with galaxies.

00:11:01.208 --> 00:11:06.101
The first is that we can make
maps of the universe with galaxies.

00:11:06.125 --> 00:11:08.851
I am part of a survey
called the Dark Energy Survey,

00:11:08.875 --> 00:11:12.083
which has made the largest map
of the universe so far.

00:11:13.167 --> 00:11:18.601
We measured the positions and shapes
of 100 million galaxies

00:11:18.625 --> 00:11:20.917
over one-eighth of the sky.

00:11:22.458 --> 00:11:27.893
And this map is showing us all the matter
in this region of the sky,

00:11:27.917 --> 00:11:33.542
which is inferred by the light
distorted from these 100 million galaxies.
