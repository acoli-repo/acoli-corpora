00:11:27.917 --> 00:11:33.542
which is inferred by the light
distorted from these 100 million galaxies.

00:11:34.708 --> 00:11:37.768
The light distorted from all of the matter

00:11:37.792 --> 00:11:41.000
that was between those galaxies and us.

00:11:42.333 --> 00:11:46.976
The gravity of the matter is strong enough
to bend the path of light.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.667
And it gives us this image.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.684
So these kinds of maps

00:11:53.708 --> 00:11:56.768
can tell us about how much
dark matter there is,

00:11:56.792 --> 00:11:59.059
they also tell us where it is

00:11:59.083 --> 00:12:01.000
and how it changes over time.
