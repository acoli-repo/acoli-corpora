00:14:29.792 --> 00:14:33.625
to try to catch some sign
of dark matter in their laboratories.

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:38.309
Dark matter is still a huge mystery.

00:14:38.333 --> 00:14:41.583
But it's a really exciting time
to be working on it.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.101
We have really clear evidence it exists.

00:14:45.125 --> 00:14:47.518
From the scale of the smallest galaxies

00:14:47.542 --> 00:14:50.125
to the scale of the whole universe.

00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:54.958
Will we actually find it
and figure out what it is?

00:14:56.542 --> 00:14:58.309
I have no idea.

00:14:58.333 --> 00:15:01.268
But it's going to be
a lot of fun to find out.
