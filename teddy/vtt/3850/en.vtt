00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:04.955
Fifty-four percent of the world's population

00:00:04.955 --> 00:00:07.536
lives in our cities.

00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:09.181
In developing countries,

00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:11.461
one third of that population

00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:14.408
is living in slums.

00:00:14.408 --> 00:00:19.040
Seventy-five percent of global energy consumption

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.090
occurs in our cities,

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.599
and 80 percent of gas emissions

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.354
that cause global warming

00:00:26.354 --> 00:00:29.392
come from our cities.

00:00:29.392 --> 00:00:32.417
