00:00:29.392 --> 00:00:32.417
So things that you and I might think about

00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:34.532
as global problems,

00:00:34.532 --> 00:00:37.180
like climate change, the energy crisis

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.842
or poverty,

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:43.702
are really, in many ways, city problems.

00:00:43.702 --> 00:00:45.564
They will not be solved

00:00:45.564 --> 00:00:48.582
unless people who live in cities,

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:50.501
like most of us,

00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:53.293
actually start doing a better job,

00:00:53.293 --> 00:00:57.249
because right now, we are 
not doing a very good one.

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:00.585
And that becomes very clear
