00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.542
The American way of building cities

00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:04.253
has caused good quality public spaces

00:05:04.253 --> 00:05:06.237
to virtually disappear in many,

00:05:06.237 --> 00:05:07.992
many American cities,

00:05:07.992 --> 00:05:09.989
and as a result, they have seen

00:05:09.989 --> 00:05:12.544
a decline of relations,

00:05:12.544 --> 00:05:14.748
of the things that make us happy.

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:16.795
Many studies show an increase

00:05:16.795 --> 00:05:21.486
in solitude and a decrease in solidarity,

00:05:21.486 --> 00:05:26.142
honesty, and social and civic participation.

00:05:26.142 --> 00:05:29.506
So how do we start building cities

00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:32.116
that make us care?
