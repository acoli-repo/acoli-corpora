00:03:57.328 --> 00:04:02.109
So Rio, like so many cities across the global South,

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.080
is a place where you can go from northern Europe

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.980
to sub-Saharan Africa

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.984
in the space of 30 minutes.

00:04:09.984 --> 00:04:11.693
If you drive, that is.

00:04:11.693 --> 00:04:16.440
If you take public transit, it's about two hours.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.299
And lastly, perhaps most importantly,

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.780
cities, with the incredible wealth

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.282
of relations that they enable,

00:04:25.282 --> 00:04:29.160
could be the ideal places for human happiness

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.562
to flourish.
