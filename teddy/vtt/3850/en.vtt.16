So far, most city governments have been effective

00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:05.742
at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors

00:08:05.742 --> 00:08:09.450
who serve authorities with data on the city:

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:13.456
potholes, fallen trees or broken lamps.

00:08:13.456 --> 00:08:15.886
They have also, to a lesser extent,

00:08:15.886 --> 00:08:19.486
invited people to participate in improving

00:08:19.486 --> 00:08:21.100
the outcome of decisions

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.412
that were already made for them,

00:08:24.412 --> 00:08:25.987
just like my mom when I was eight

00:08:25.987 --> 00:08:27.753
and she told me that I had a choice:

00:08:27.753 --> 00:08:29.330
I had to be in bed by 8 p.m.,

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.243
but I could choose my pink
pajamas or my blue pajamas.
