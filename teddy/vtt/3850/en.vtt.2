00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:00.585
And that becomes very clear

00:01:00.585 --> 00:01:04.479
when we look into three aspects of city life:

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.605
first, our citizens' willingness to engage

00:01:08.605 --> 00:01:11.417
with democratic institutions;

00:01:11.417 --> 00:01:16.221
second, our cities' ability to really include

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.763
all of their residents;

00:01:18.763 --> 00:01:21.940
and lastly, our own ability

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.405
to live fulfilling and happy lives.

00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:28.184
When it comes to engagement,

00:01:28.184 --> 00:01:31.114
the data is very clear.
