00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.654
but also complement these structures

00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:07.572
with direct, effective, and 
collective decision making,

00:07:07.572 --> 00:07:09.496
decision making of the kind

00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:11.542
that attacks inequality

00:07:11.542 --> 00:07:14.782
by its very inclusive nature,

00:07:14.782 --> 00:07:16.605
decision making of the kind

00:07:16.605 --> 00:07:18.821
that can change our cities

00:07:18.821 --> 00:07:21.937
into better places for us to live.

00:07:21.937 --> 00:07:25.416
But there is a catch, obviously:

00:07:25.416 --> 00:07:28.157
Enabling widespread participation

00:07:28.157 --> 00:07:30.115
and redistributing power
