WEBVTT

00:02:29.563 --> 00:02:31.981
decided that it was not important

00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:34.726
to elect their leaders.

00:02:34.726 --> 00:02:38.380
The city of L.A., a city of four million people,

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.309
elected its mayor with just a bit over 200,000 votes.

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:45.795
That was the lowest turnout the city had seen

00:02:45.795 --> 00:02:48.676
in 100 years.

00:02:48.676 --> 00:02:51.720
Right here, in my city of Rio,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.794
in spite of mandatory voting,

00:02:54.794 --> 00:02:58.292
almost 30 percent of the voting population

00:02:58.292 --> 00:03:00.857
chose to either annul their votes
