00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:32.116
that make us care?

00:05:32.116 --> 00:05:36.750
Cities that value their most important asset:

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.349
the incredible diversity

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:41.555
of the people who live in them?

00:05:41.555 --> 00:05:45.212
Cities that make us happy?

00:05:45.212 --> 00:05:47.719
Well, I believe that if we want to change

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:50.271
what our cities look like,

00:05:50.271 --> 00:05:52.961
then we really have to change

00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:55.504
the decision-making processes

00:05:55.504 --> 00:05:59.328
that have given us the results 
that we have right now.

00:05:59.328 --> 00:06:02.500
We need a participation revolution,
