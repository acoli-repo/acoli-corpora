That's not participation,

00:08:35.482 --> 00:08:39.227
and in fact, governments have not been very good

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:42.130
at using technology to enable participation

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.080
on what matters —

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.393
the way we allocate our budget,

00:08:46.393 --> 00:08:48.615
the way we occupy our land,

00:08:48.615 --> 00:08:52.164
and the way we manage our natural resources.

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:54.278

00:08:54.278 --> 00:08:57.158
that can actually impact global problems

00:08:57.158 --> 00:09:00.980
that manifest themselves in our cities.
