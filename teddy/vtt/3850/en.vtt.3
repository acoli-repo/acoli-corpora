00:01:28.184 --> 00:01:31.114
the data is very clear.

00:01:31.114 --> 00:01:33.195
Voter turnout around the world

00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:35.636
peaked in the late '80s,

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:37.481
and it has been declining at a pace

00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:40.543
that we have never seen before,

00:01:40.543 --> 00:01:44.138
and if those numbers are bad at the national level,

00:01:44.138 --> 00:01:46.147
at the level of our cities,

00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:49.236
they are just dismal.

00:01:49.236 --> 00:01:50.830
In the last two years,

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.331
two of the world's most consolidated,

00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:57.166
oldest democracies, the U.S. and France,

00:01:57.166 --> 00:02:00.971
held nationwide municipal elections.
