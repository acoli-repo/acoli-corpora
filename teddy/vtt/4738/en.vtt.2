00:00:57.763 --> 00:01:00.476
with his new technique, winning a gold metal

00:01:00.476 --> 00:01:04.344
with an Olympic record leap of 2.24 meters.

00:01:04.344 --> 00:01:05.659
By the next Olympic Games,

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.889
almost all of the competing of high jumpers

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:09.976
had adopted what came to be known as

00:01:09.976 --> 00:01:11.930
the Fosbury Flop.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.892
What's the secret behind the technique?

00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:15.645
It lies in a physics concept

00:01:15.645 --> 00:01:17.483
called the center of mass.

00:01:17.483 --> 00:01:18.788
For every object,

00:01:18.788 --> 00:01:21.762
we can locate the average position of all of its mass

00:01:21.762 --> 00:01:23.846
by taking into account how the mass

00:01:23.846 --> 00:01:26.033
is spread around the object.

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:27.974
For instance, the center of mass

00:01:27.974 --> 00:01:31.119
of a flat, rectangular object of uniform density
