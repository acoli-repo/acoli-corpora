00:02:29.117 --> 00:02:32.528
Now look at the Fosbury Flop, and follow the position

00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:34.719
of the center of mass of the jumper.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.491
The jumper runs very fast,

00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:38.679
so he can divert his horizontal velocity

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:41.316
to vertical velocity, and jumps.

00:02:41.316 --> 00:02:43.513
Wait for it...there.

00:02:43.513 --> 00:02:45.323
Look at the jumper's center of mass

00:02:45.323 --> 00:02:47.279
as his body bends backward.

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:48.781
It's below the bar.

00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:51.015
That is the secret behind the jump.

00:02:51.015 --> 00:02:53.493
With the old, pre-Fosbury techniques,

00:02:53.493 --> 00:02:55.539
the jumper had to apply enough force

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.096
to lift his center of mass above the bar

00:02:58.096 --> 00:03:00.458
by a few inches in order to clear it.
