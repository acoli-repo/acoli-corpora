00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.513
their center of mass is around the belly,

00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:03.097
but what happens to your center of mass

00:02:03.097 --> 00:02:04.945
when you lift your hands in the air?

00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:06.906
Your center of mass moves upwards.

00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:09.366
It moves all the time as you move through the day,

00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:11.526
based on how your body is positioned.

00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:13.538
It can even move outside of your body.

00:02:13.538 --> 00:02:15.957
When you bend forward, your center of mass

00:02:15.957 --> 00:02:18.251
is located below your bent belly

00:02:18.251 --> 00:02:20.295
in a place where there is no mass at all.

00:02:20.295 --> 00:02:23.048
Weird to think about, but that's the average position

00:02:23.048 --> 00:02:24.411
of all your mass.

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:25.865
Many objects' center of mass

00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:27.192
are outside their bodies.

00:02:27.192 --> 00:02:29.117
Think of doughnuts or boomerangs.

00:02:29.117 --> 00:02:32.528
Now look at the Fosbury Flop, and follow the position
