00:01:27.974 --> 00:01:31.119
of a flat, rectangular object of uniform density

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.790
will be in the intersection of both diagonals,

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.028
in equal distance from each corner.

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:38.430
We can find the center of mass for other objects

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.085
by similar calculations,

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:42.678
or by finding the object's balancing point,

00:01:42.678 --> 00:01:45.717
which lies right underneath its center of mass.

00:01:45.717 --> 00:01:47.590
Try balancing a broom by holding it

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.931
and slowly bringing your hands together until they meet.

00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:53.394
This balancing point lies right underneath

00:01:53.394 --> 00:01:55.728
the broom's center of mass.

00:01:55.728 --> 00:01:57.930
We humans also have a center of mass.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.429
When most people stand up,

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.513
their center of mass is around the belly,
