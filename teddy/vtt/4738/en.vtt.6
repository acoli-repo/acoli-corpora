00:02:58.096 --> 00:03:00.458
by a few inches in order to clear it.

00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:03.263
The Fosbury Flopper doesn't have to do that.

00:03:03.263 --> 00:03:05.524
The genius of the Fosbury Flop is that the jumper

00:03:05.524 --> 00:03:07.763
can apply the same amount of force,

00:03:07.763 --> 00:03:10.555
but raise his body much higher than before.

00:03:10.555 --> 00:03:12.735
That means he can raise the bar so high

00:03:12.735 --> 00:03:14.565
that even when his center of mass

00:03:14.565 --> 00:03:18.331
can't go any higher, his arching body can.

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:19.642
Fosbury's technique brought

00:03:19.642 --> 00:03:21.231
the high jump to new heights

00:03:21.231 --> 00:03:22.733
by splitting the jumper's body

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:24.345
away from his center of mass,

00:03:24.345 --> 00:03:26.099
giving it that much more room

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.513
to clear higher and higher bars.

00:03:28.513 --> 00:03:30.948
So the Fosbury Flop may be sports history's
