00:07:57.833 --> 00:08:01.601
because Black bodies
and our genders have been caught

00:08:01.625 --> 00:08:03.018
in the white imagination,

00:08:03.042 --> 00:08:06.018
and we have always been transgressive.

00:08:06.042 --> 00:08:08.309
Transgressive meaning

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:15.018
a violation of accepted and imposed
boundaries of social acceptability.

00:08:15.042 --> 00:08:17.893
Blackness is transgressive.

00:08:17.917 --> 00:08:20.643
And once set free

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.851
from social acceptability,

00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:27.542
blackness challenges the limitations
of what gender can be.

00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:31.125
We have always been fugitives here.
