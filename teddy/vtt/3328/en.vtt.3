00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:31.809
of a society consumed
by boxes and binaries

00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:34.893
and "are you a boy or a girl?"

00:01:34.917 --> 00:01:37.018
Independent of such conventions,

00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:39.809
my body clings instead
to the long ago lore

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.101
that understood its magic.

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:44.625
I contain multitudes.

00:01:45.792 --> 00:01:48.434
From this supreme power to name myself,

00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:51.434
define myself and be myself,

00:01:51.458 --> 00:01:53.809
I stake a claim to myself

00:01:53.833 --> 00:01:56.101
and organize my resistance.

00:01:56.125 --> 00:02:01.750
A resistance that boldly proclaims
that Black trans lives matter.
