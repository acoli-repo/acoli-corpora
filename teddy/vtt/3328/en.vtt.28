00:13:56.458 --> 00:14:00.476
And if you believe that your liberation
is bound up with mine,

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.976
then I invite you

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.226
to make Black Trans Lives Matter
your personal ethic

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.101
by being transformative,

00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:09.851
loudly and mindfully.

00:14:09.875 --> 00:14:11.768
You can do that in three ways.

00:14:11.792 --> 00:14:15.125
Transform your thinking
about blackness and gender.

00:14:16.083 --> 00:14:18.893
Be loud by taking the risk

00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:23.809
to confront false assumptions
and other's fears and biases.

00:14:23.833 --> 00:14:27.934
Be mindful and pay attention and believe

00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:31.042
what Black trans people say
about our own lives.
