00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:32.208
is more neutral, really.

00:04:33.917 --> 00:04:35.934
While I sit there, mind you,

00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.226
head to toe in clothing
from the section of the store

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.809
where the dress buttons
go down the right side,

00:04:41.833 --> 00:04:45.393
and my pants give away
the number of inches around my waist,

00:04:45.417 --> 00:04:48.559
and my hair is cut
like Denzel's "Man on Fire,"

00:04:48.583 --> 00:04:51.101
but I'm still more neutral.

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:52.375
Really?

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:55.601
Because she still sees,

00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:57.101
and you see,

00:04:57.125 --> 00:04:59.059
a Black woman.

00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:04.333
And Black women's bodies
are always already made genderless.
