00:02:59.792 --> 00:03:02.518
caught at the time-traveling intersection

00:03:02.542 --> 00:03:05.809
of Juneteenth emancipation celebration

00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:09.059
and Stonewall's emancipation declaration,

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:13.333
Black trans lives
are both seen but yet unseen.

00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:19.059
Unseen by the antiblackness
of queer and trans movements.

00:03:19.083 --> 00:03:23.292
Unseen by the transphobia
and trans-antagonism of Black movements.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.393
Our sovereignty and resistance are blocked

00:03:27.417 --> 00:03:30.184
by layers of systems and structures
