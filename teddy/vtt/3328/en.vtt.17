00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:31.125
We have always been fugitives here.

00:08:32.708 --> 00:08:35.434
Escaping from gender surveillance

00:08:35.458 --> 00:08:37.393
to claim our sovereignty

00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:40.184
and right to exist and to live free,

00:08:40.208 --> 00:08:42.226
to proclaim as beautiful

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.934
that which was made ugly,

00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.684
to defy convention,

00:08:45.708 --> 00:08:52.184
Black lives and trans lives
and Black trans lives.

00:08:52.208 --> 00:08:54.184
And yet, in this world, that fact

00:08:54.208 --> 00:08:57.018
that Black trans lives make a difference,

00:08:57.042 --> 00:08:58.559
make differences

00:08:58.583 --> 00:09:02.643
and make a matter of mattering
