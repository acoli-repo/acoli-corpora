But let’s see what happens
when the canvas gets bigger.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.127
Try out an 8x8; 
what’s the lowest score you can get?

00:01:37.127 --> 00:01:41.694
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out yourself.

00:01:41.694 --> 00:01:42.779
Answer in: 3

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:43.840
Answer in: 2

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.223
Answer in: 1

00:01:45.223 --> 00:01:47.585
To get our bearings, 
we can start as before:

00:01:47.585 --> 00:01:49.903
dividing the canvas roughly in two.

00:01:49.903 --> 00:01:53.869
That gives us a 5x8 rectangle 
with area 40

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.483
and a 3x8 with area 24,

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.321
for a score of 16.

00:01:58.321 --> 00:01:59.528
That’s pretty bad.

00:01:59.528 --> 00:02:06.453
Dividing that 5x8 into a 5x5 
and a 5x3 leaves us with a score of 10.
