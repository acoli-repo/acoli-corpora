00:02:58.794 --> 00:03:03.217
you need to use another odd-value 
rectangle to get an even sum.

00:03:03.217 --> 00:03:06.633
With all that in mind, 
let’s see what works.

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:11.651
Starting with area 20 or more 
puts us over the limit too quickly.

00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:16.633
But we can get to 64 using
rectangles in the 14-18 range,

00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:18.804
leaving out 15.

00:03:18.804 --> 00:03:21.722
Unfortunately, there’s no way 
to make them fit.

00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:24.291
Using the 2x7 leaves a gap

00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:28.202
that can only be filled 
by a rectangle with a width of 1.

00:03:28.202 --> 00:03:32.277
Going lower, the next range
that works is 8 to 14,
