00:00:57.161 --> 00:01:01.175
and the goal is to get 
as low a score as possible.

00:01:01.175 --> 00:01:05.433
Here, the largest area is 12 
and the smallest is 4,

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:07.301
giving us a score of 8.

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:10.337
Since we didn’t try to go 
for a low score that time,

00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:12.208
we can probably do better.

00:01:12.208 --> 00:01:13.992
Let’s keep our 1x4

00:01:13.992 --> 00:01:19.031
while breaking the 3x4 
into a 3x3 and a 3x1.

00:01:19.031 --> 00:01:22.816
Now our score is 9 minus 3, or 6.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:25.359
Still not optimal, but better.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.452
With such a small canvas, 
there are only a few options.

00:01:29.452 --> 00:01:32.250
But let’s see what happens
when the canvas gets bigger.
