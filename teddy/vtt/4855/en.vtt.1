00:00:27.932 --> 00:00:31.757
but a 2x2 rectangle would be fine.

00:00:31.757 --> 00:00:33.106
Let’s try that.

00:00:33.106 --> 00:00:35.827
Say we have a canvas measuring 4x4.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.958
We can’t chop it directly in half,

00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.571
since that would give us 
identical rectangles of 2x4.

00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:47.007
But the next closest option 
- 3x4 and 1x4 - works.

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:49.441
That was easy, but we’re not done yet.

00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:52.109
Now take the area 
of the largest rectangle,

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.172
and subtract the area of the smallest.

00:00:55.172 --> 00:00:57.161
The result is our score,

00:00:57.161 --> 00:01:01.175
and the goal is to get 
as low a score as possible.
