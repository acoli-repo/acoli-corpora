00:03:28.202 --> 00:03:32.277
Going lower, the next range
that works is 8 to 14,

00:03:32.277 --> 00:03:34.797
leaving out the 3x3 square.

00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:36.946
This time, the pieces fit.

00:03:36.946 --> 00:03:38.823
That’s a score of 6.

00:03:38.823 --> 00:03:40.244
Can we do even better?

00:03:40.244 --> 00:03:41.339
No.

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:45.587
We can get the same score 
by throwing out the 2x7 and 1x8

00:03:45.587 --> 00:03:50.050
and replacing them 
with a 3x3, 1x7, and 1x6.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.739
But if we go any lower down the list,

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.517
the numbers become so small

00:03:54.517 --> 00:03:57.830
that we’d need a wider range 
of sizes to cover the canvas,

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.136
which would increase the score.
