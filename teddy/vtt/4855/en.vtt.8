00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.136
which would increase the score.

00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:03.812
There’s no trick or formula here 
– just a bit of intuition.

00:04:03.812 --> 00:04:05.887
It's more art than science.

00:04:05.887 --> 00:04:07.344
And for larger grids,

00:04:07.344 --> 00:04:12.737
expert mathematicians aren’t sure whether
they’ve found the lowest possible scores.

00:04:12.737 --> 00:04:14.921
So how would you divide a 4x4,

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.008
10x10,

00:04:16.008 --> 00:04:19.156
or 32x32 canvas?

00:04:19.156 --> 00:04:21.916
