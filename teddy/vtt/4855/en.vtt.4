00:01:59.528 --> 00:02:06.453
Dividing that 5x8 into a 5x5 
and a 5x3 leaves us with a score of 10.

00:02:06.453 --> 00:02:08.935
Better, but still not great.

00:02:08.935 --> 00:02:12.199
We could just keep dividing 
the biggest rectangle.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.208
But that would leave us 
with increasingly tiny rectangles,

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:19.018
which would increase the range 
between the largest and smallest.

00:02:19.018 --> 00:02:20.734
What we really want

00:02:20.734 --> 00:02:25.941
is for all our rectangles to fall
within a small range of area values.

00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:29.279
And since the total area 
of the canvas is 64,

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:31.615
the areas need to add up to that.
