00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:31.615
the areas need to add up to that.

00:02:31.615 --> 00:02:35.426
Let’s make a list 
of possible rectangles and areas.

00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:37.637
To improve on our previous score,

00:02:37.637 --> 00:02:41.404
we can try to pick a range 
of values spanning 9 or less

00:02:41.404 --> 00:02:43.735
and adding up to 64.

00:02:43.735 --> 00:02:46.654
You’ll notice that some values 
are left out

00:02:46.654 --> 00:02:52.253
because rectangles like 1x13 
or 2x9 won’t fit on the canvas.

00:02:52.253 --> 00:02:53.465
You might also realize

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:58.794
that if you use one of the rectangles 
with an odd area like 5, 9, or 15,

00:02:58.794 --> 00:03:03.217
you need to use another odd-value 
rectangle to get an even sum.
