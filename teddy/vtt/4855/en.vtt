Dutch artist Piet Mondrian’s abstract,
rectangular paintings

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:15.546
inspired mathematicians 
to create a two-fold challenge.

00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:21.498
First, we must completely cover a square
canvas with non-overlapping rectangles.

00:00:21.498 --> 00:00:27.932
All must be unique, so if we use a 1x4, 
we can’t use a 4x1 in another spot,

00:00:27.932 --> 00:00:31.757
but a 2x2 rectangle would be fine.
