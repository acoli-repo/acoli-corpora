00:00:28.738 --> 00:00:31.271
Behind me, you can see
some of the kind of work I do.

00:00:31.295 --> 00:00:33.632
"Imagine a World
Without America" is a painting,

00:00:33.656 --> 00:00:35.149
but I work in a range of media,

00:00:35.173 --> 00:00:38.173
including photography,
video and performance art.

00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:44.354
A current project,
"Slave Rebellion Reenactment,"

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:47.354
is going to be reenacted
on the outskirts of New Orleans

00:00:47.378 --> 00:00:48.537
this November.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.379
In 1989, I had an artwork that became
the center of controversy

00:00:54.403 --> 00:00:57.051
over its transgressive use
of the American flag.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.254
"What is the Proper Way
to Display a US Flag?"
