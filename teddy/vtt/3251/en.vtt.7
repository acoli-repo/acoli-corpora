00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:30.196
because while some wanted to kill me,
it was also a situation

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.910
where those who viewed the American flag
as standing for everything oppressive

00:03:33.934 --> 00:03:35.090
in this system

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:36.409
felt that they had a voice,

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:38.400
and that voice needed to be amplified.

00:03:38.837 --> 00:03:40.061
The point is this:

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:41.455
changing anything --

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:45.481
whether it's conventional ideas
about US national symbols,

00:03:45.505 --> 00:03:48.427
traditional thinking challenged
by scientific breakthroughs

00:03:48.451 --> 00:03:50.879
or ousting an authoritarian president --

00:03:50.903 --> 00:03:52.230
requires a lot of things.

00:03:52.254 --> 00:03:53.866
It requires courage,

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.045
luck

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.713
and also vision and boldness of action.

00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:00.141
But on luck --
