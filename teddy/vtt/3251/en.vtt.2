"What is the Proper Way
to Display a US Flag?"

00:01:00.278 --> 00:01:03.352
is a conceptual work that encouraged
audience participation.

00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:06.700
It consisted of a photo montage
that had text that read,

00:01:06.724 --> 00:01:09.219
"What is the Proper Way
to Display a US Flag?"

00:01:09.243 --> 00:01:12.841
Below that were books that people
could write responses to that question in,

00:01:12.865 --> 00:01:16.062
and below that was a flag
that people had the option of standing on.

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:19.146
The photo montage consisted
of images of South Korean students

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.617
burning American flags,

00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:23.465
holding signs that said,
"Yankee go home. Son of a bitch,"

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:26.728
and below that were flag-draped coffins
coming back from Vietnam.

00:01:27.461 --> 00:01:29.529
People wrote long and short answers.

00:01:29.553 --> 00:01:33.095
Thousands of people engaged with the work
in a lot of different languages.
