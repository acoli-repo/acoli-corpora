00:00:00.858 --> 00:00:02.333
I am a visual artist,

00:00:02.357 --> 00:00:05.738
and I make revolutionary art
to propel history forward.

00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:08.780
I'm going to come right out
and tell you something:

00:00:08.804 --> 00:00:10.669
I don't accept the economic foundation,

00:00:10.693 --> 00:00:11.854
the social relations

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:13.578
or the governing ideas of America.

00:00:14.523 --> 00:00:16.457
My art contributes to fundamental change

00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:20.360
by encouraging an audience to address
big questions from that perspective.

00:00:20.892 --> 00:00:24.178
Social change is hard,
but ideas matter tremendously.

00:00:25.594 --> 00:00:28.714
When I say I'm an artist,
most people think, "Oh, he's a painter."

00:00:28.738 --> 00:00:31.271
Behind me, you can see
some of the kind of work I do.
