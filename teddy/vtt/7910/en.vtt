Welcome to the gates of hell.

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:07.587
Now depending on your frame of mind,

00:00:07.628 --> 00:00:12.800
that is either a bizarrely morbid
or entirely appropriate way

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.596
to start a talk about climate
action in the year 2022.

00:00:17.472 --> 00:00:21.934
Behind me is a picture
from the Hell's Gate National Park

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:24.812
in the town of Naivasha,
in the Great Rift Valley

00:00:24.854 --> 00:00:26.814
in my home country, Kenya.

00:00:27.398 --> 00:00:30.943
Now its name may not
scream “tourist trap,”
