In 1978, Louise Brown became 


00:00:09.047 --> 00:00:14.450
the world's first baby to be born
by in vitro fertilization, or IVF.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.780
Her birth revolutionized 
the field of reproductive medicine.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.931
Given that approximately one in eight
heterosexual couples

00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:22.997
has difficulty conceiving,

00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:25.172
and that homosexual couples
and single parents

00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:27.804
often need clinical help to make a baby,

00:00:27.804 --> 00:00:30.561
the demand for IVF has been growing.
