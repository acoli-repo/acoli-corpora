00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:03.825
So a friend of mine who's a political scientist,

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:05.428
he told me several months ago

00:00:05.428 --> 00:00:07.496
exactly what this month would be like.

00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:10.410
He said, you know, there's this fiscal cliff coming,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.016
it's going to come at the beginning of 2013.

00:00:14.016 --> 00:00:16.776
Both parties absolutely need to resolve it,

00:00:16.776 --> 00:00:19.601
but neither party wants to be seen as the first to resolve it.

00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:23.818
Neither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it's due,

00:00:23.818 --> 00:00:26.438
so he said, December, you're just going to see lots of

00:00:26.438 --> 00:00:29.658
angry negotiations, negotiations breaking apart,

00:00:29.658 --> 00:00:32.407
reports of phone calls that aren't going well,
