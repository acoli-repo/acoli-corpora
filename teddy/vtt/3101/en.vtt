One winter morning, a couple of years ago,

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.705
I was driving to work
in Johannesburg, South Africa,

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:10.030
and noticed a haze hanging over the city.

00:00:10.895 --> 00:00:12.990
I make that drive on most days,

00:00:13.014 --> 00:00:15.887
so it was unusual
that I hadn't noticed this before.

00:00:16.559 --> 00:00:19.648
Johannesburg is known
for its distinctive skyline,

00:00:19.672 --> 00:00:21.489
which I could barely see that morning.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:26.843
It didn't take long for me to realize
that I was looking at an enormous cloud

00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:28.065
of air pollution.

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:32.565
The contrast between
the scenic environment I knew
