00:01:58.435 --> 00:02:01.459
I had to get smart
about air pollution first,

00:02:01.483 --> 00:02:04.578
and so I became a student again.

00:02:05.522 --> 00:02:07.628
I did a bit of basic research

00:02:07.652 --> 00:02:09.652
and soon learned that air pollution

00:02:09.676 --> 00:02:12.810
is the world's biggest
environmental health risk.

00:02:13.816 --> 00:02:16.190
Data from the World Health Organization

00:02:16.214 --> 00:02:21.356
shows that almost 14 percent
of all deaths worldwide in 2012

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.064
were attributable to household
and ambient air pollution,

00:02:25.088 --> 00:02:28.547
with most occurring
in low- and middle-income countries.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:33.180
Ambient air pollution alone
causes more deaths each year
