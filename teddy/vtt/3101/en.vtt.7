00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.500
So I decided I'd better get to know
some people working within the field.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.922
I started to speak to officials
from the City of Johannesburg

00:03:36.946 --> 00:03:38.573
and other surrounding cities,

00:03:38.597 --> 00:03:41.556
and I engaged the local
scientific community,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.770
and I also made a few cold calls.

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:47.569
The process of engagement I embarked upon

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:50.866
helped me to develop
a deeper understanding of the problem.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.856
It also helped me to avoid the trap

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.304
people in my profession sometimes
fall into when trying to innovate,

00:03:57.328 --> 00:03:59.655
where we are quick to apply a technology

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:02.473
before we've firmly grasped
the problem at hand.
