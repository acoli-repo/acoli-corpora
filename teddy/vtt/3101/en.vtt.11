00:05:29.283 --> 00:05:33.395
my colleagues from South Africa
and China and myself

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.156
created an air-quality
decision support system

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.530
that lives in the cloud.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.281
This software system
analyzes historical and real-time data

00:05:42.305 --> 00:05:44.973
to uncover the spatial-temporal
trends in pollution.

00:05:45.695 --> 00:05:48.550
We then used new
machine learning technology

00:05:48.574 --> 00:05:51.213
to predict future levels of pollution

00:05:51.237 --> 00:05:54.134
for several different pollutants
days in advance.

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.307
This means that citizens
can make better decisions

00:05:58.331 --> 00:06:00.046
about their daily movements
