Now, in my work,

00:03:00.998 --> 00:03:05.184
I explore new frontiers
for artificial intelligence,

00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:08.645
where the symbiotic relationship
between man and machine

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:12.581
can find a beneficial footing
and help us to make better decisions.

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:16.313
As I thought about
the air pollution problem,

00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:20.283
it became clear that we needed
to find a way to make better decisions

00:03:20.307 --> 00:03:22.940
about how we manage air pollution,

00:03:22.964 --> 00:03:24.947
and given the scale of the problem,

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:27.486
it was necessary to do it
in a collaborative way.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.500
So I decided I'd better get to know
some people working within the field.
