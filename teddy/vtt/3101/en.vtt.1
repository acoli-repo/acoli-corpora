00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:32.565
The contrast between
the scenic environment I knew

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:34.874
and this smog-covered skyline

00:00:34.898 --> 00:00:36.501
stirred up something within me.

00:00:37.092 --> 00:00:42.568
I was appalled by the possibility
of this city of bright and vivid sunsets

00:00:42.592 --> 00:00:44.726
being overrun by a dull haze.

00:00:45.258 --> 00:00:49.262
At that moment, I felt an urge
to do something about it,

00:00:49.286 --> 00:00:50.942
but I didn't know what.

00:00:51.808 --> 00:00:54.983
All I knew was

00:00:55.564 --> 00:00:57.661
The main challenge was,

00:00:57.685 --> 00:01:01.922
I didn't know much
about environmental science
