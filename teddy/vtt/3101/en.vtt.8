00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:02.473
before we've firmly grasped
the problem at hand.

00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:05.672
I began to develop an idea

00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:08.164
about what I could do
to improve the situation.

00:04:08.742 --> 00:04:11.158
I started by simply asking myself

00:04:11.182 --> 00:04:13.880
how I could bring together
in some meaningful way

00:04:13.904 --> 00:04:17.772
my skills in software engineering
and artificial intelligence

00:04:17.796 --> 00:04:20.438
and the expertise of the people
I'd reached out to.

00:04:21.075 --> 00:04:25.068
I wanted to create an online
air-quality management platform

00:04:25.092 --> 00:04:27.173
that would uncover trends in pollution

00:04:27.197 --> 00:04:29.123
and project into the future

00:04:29.147 --> 00:04:31.546
to determine what outcomes
can be expected.
