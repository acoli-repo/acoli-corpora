00:00:57.685 --> 00:01:01.922
I didn't know much
about environmental science

00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:03.471
air-quality management

00:01:03.495 --> 00:01:04.918
or atmospheric chemistry.

00:01:05.827 --> 00:01:07.716
I am a computer engineer,

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.759
and I was pretty sure I couldn't code
my way out of this air pollution problem.

00:01:11.783 --> 00:01:12.844
(Laughter)

00:01:12.868 --> 00:01:15.400
Who was I to do anything about this issue?

00:01:15.888 --> 00:01:18.432
I was but a citizen.

00:01:19.786 --> 00:01:23.667
In the following years,
I learned a very important lesson,

00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:27.849
a lesson we all need to take to heart
if we are to work towards a better future.

00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:32.412
Even if you're not an expert
in a particular domain,
