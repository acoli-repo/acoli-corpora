00:05:03.985 --> 00:05:07.406
can make the conditions right
for something remarkable to happen.

00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:11.757
Our willpower and imagination
are a guiding light,

00:05:11.781 --> 00:05:15.518
enabling us to chart new paths
and navigate through obstacles.

00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:19.899

of the air pollution problem,

00:05:19.923 --> 00:05:23.285
and having managed to source
over a decade's worth of data

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:24.761

and the meteorological conditions
for in and around Johannesburg,

00:05:29.283 --> 00:05:33.395
my colleagues from South Africa
and China and myself
