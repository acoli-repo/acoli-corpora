Ambient air pollution alone
causes more deaths each year

00:02:33.204 --> 00:02:35.520
than malaria and HIV/AIDS.

00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:40.188
In Africa, premature deaths
from unsafe sanitation

00:02:40.212 --> 00:02:41.951
or childhood malnutrition

00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:45.515
pale in comparison
to deaths due to air pollution,

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.245
and it comes at a huge economic cost:

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.402
over 400 billion US dollars as of 2013,

00:02:52.426 --> 00:02:57.418
according to a study by the Organisation
for Economic Cooperation and Development.
