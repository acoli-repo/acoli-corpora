00:00:00.887 --> 00:00:04.415
So I'm starting us out today
with a historical mystery.

00:00:05.037 --> 00:00:08.006
In 1957, there were two young women,

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:09.385
both in their 20s,

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:10.893
both living in the same city,

00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:13.753
both members of the same political group.

00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:18.591
That year, both decided
to commit violent attacks.

00:00:19.284 --> 00:00:23.413
One girl took a gun and approached
a soldier at a checkpoint.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.078
The other girl took a bomb
and went to a crowded caf√©.
