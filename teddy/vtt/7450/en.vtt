Naomi Bagdonas: Alright, so,
how often do you laugh at work?

00:00:05.293 --> 00:00:07.712
I mean really laugh.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.300
We asked some of you this question,
and here's what we heard.

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:14.677
"Rarely."

00:00:15.344 --> 00:00:16.512
"Seldomly."

00:00:16.554 --> 00:00:18.806
And then our personal favorite ...

00:00:19.223 --> 00:00:21.559
(Laughter)

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:24.645
"I study climate change.
Why would I laugh?"

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:27.440
The two of us teach a class
at Stanford Business School

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.400
about the power of humor in leadership.
