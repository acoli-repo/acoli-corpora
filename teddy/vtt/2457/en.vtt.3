00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:30.178
Every generation is twice
as well-off as its parents'.

00:01:30.686 --> 00:01:34.012
When it grows one percent per annum,

00:01:34.036 --> 00:01:37.663
it takes three generations
to double the standard of living.

00:01:37.687 --> 00:01:43.481
And in this process, many people
will be less well-off than their parents.

00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:46.019
They will have less of everything:

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:49.534
smaller roofs, or perhaps no roof at all,

00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:57.044
less access to education, to vitamins,
to antibiotics, to vaccination --

00:01:57.068 --> 00:01:58.343
to everything.

00:01:59.502 --> 00:02:05.363
Think of all the problems
that we're facing at the moment.
