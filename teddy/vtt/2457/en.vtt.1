Productivity is the principal driver

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.115
So we have a problem.

00:00:33.837 --> 00:00:36.606
In the largest European economies,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.780
productivity used to grow
five percent per annum

00:00:39.804 --> 00:00:42.919
in the '50s, '60s, early '70s.

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:46.971
From '73 to '83: three percent per annum.

00:00:46.995 --> 00:00:50.284
From '83 to '95: two percent per annum.

00:00:50.308 --> 00:00:55.018
Since 1995: less than
one percent per annum.

00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:57.486
The same profile in Japan.

00:00:58.115 --> 00:01:00.985
The same profile in the US,
