00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.722
There are two ways
to look at it, to prove it.

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:06.412
One, the one I prefer,

00:03:06.436 --> 00:03:11.981
is rigorous, elegant, nice -- math.

00:03:12.593 --> 00:03:15.856
But the full math version
takes a little while,

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.675
so there is another one.

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.165
It is to look at a relay race.

00:03:20.697 --> 00:03:22.365
This is what we will do today.

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:28.739
It's a bit more animated, more visual
and also faster -- it's a race.

00:03:29.572 --> 00:03:30.866
Hopefully, it's faster.
