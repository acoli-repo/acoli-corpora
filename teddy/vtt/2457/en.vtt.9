00:04:28.877 --> 00:04:31.300
At some point you will see,
towards the end,

00:04:31.324 --> 00:04:37.630
that Torri Edwards,
the fourth US runner, is ahead.

00:04:37.654 --> 00:04:44.143
Not surprising -- this year she got
the gold medal in the 100-meter race.

00:04:44.167 --> 00:04:49.109
And by the way, Chryste Gaines,
the second runner in the US team,

00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:51.770
is the fastest woman on earth.

00:04:51.794 --> 00:04:56.947
So, there are 3.5 billion women on earth.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.063
Where are the two fastest? On the US team.
