Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize
[winner] in economics, once wrote:

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:12.325
"Productivity is not everything,
but in the long run,

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.523
it is almost everything."

00:00:16.062 --> 00:00:17.468
So this is serious.

00:00:18.214 --> 00:00:23.018
There are not that many things on earth
that are "almost everything."

00:00:24.138 --> 00:00:30.911
Productivity is the principal driver
of the prosperity of a society.
