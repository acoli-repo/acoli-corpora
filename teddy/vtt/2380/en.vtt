Our world has many superheroes.

00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:10.012
But they have the worst of
all superpowers: invisibility.

00:00:10.012 --> 00:00:12.349
For example, the catadores,

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.462
workers who collect recyclable 
materials for a living.

00:00:16.462 --> 00:00:21.122
Catadores emerged from 
social inequality, unemployment,

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:24.141
and the abundance of solid waste

00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:28.740
from the deficiency of the 
waste collection system.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.500
Catadores provide a heavy, 
honest and essential work
