00:03:57.016 --> 00:04:05.150
In two years, over 170 catadores,
800 volunteers and 200 street artists

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.126
and more than 1,000 donors

00:04:07.126 --> 00:04:10.001
have been involved in the 
Pimp My Carroça movement,

00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:14.575
whose actions have even been used
in teaching recycling at a local school.

00:04:16.095 --> 00:04:20.108
So catadores are leaving 
invisibility behind

00:04:20.108 --> 00:04:23.662
and becoming increasingly
respected and valued.

00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:28.219
Because of their pimped carroças,
they are able to fight back to prejudice,

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:32.109
increase their income and 
their interaction with society.
