00:01:59.902 --> 00:02:03.336
I have painted over 200 
carroças in many cities

00:02:03.336 --> 00:02:07.301
and have been invited to do exhibitions 
and trips worldwide.

00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:11.953
And then I realized that catadores,
in their invisibility,

00:02:11.953 --> 00:02:13.981
are not exclusive to Brazil.

00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:18.505
I met them in Argentina, Chile,

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:23.079
Bolivia, South Africa, Turkey

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:28.104
and even in developed countries such
as the United States and Japan.

00:02:28.104 --> 00:02:32.820
And this was when I realized that I needed
to have more people join the cause
