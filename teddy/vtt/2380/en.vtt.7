Pimp My Carroça took to the streets
of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Curitiba.

00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:42.907
But to meet the demand in other cities,
including outside of Brazil,

00:03:42.907 --> 00:03:48.092
we have created Pimpx,
which is inspired by TEDx,

00:03:48.092 --> 00:03:54.026
and it's a simplified, do-it-yourself,
crowdfunded edition of Pimp My Carroça.

00:03:54.026 --> 00:03:57.016
So now everybody can join.

00:03:57.016 --> 00:04:05.150
In two years, over 170 catadores,
800 volunteers and 200 street artists
