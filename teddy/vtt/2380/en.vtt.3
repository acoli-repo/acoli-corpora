00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:31.370
In 2007, I took my work beyond walls
and onto the carroças,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.324
as a new urban support for my message.

00:01:34.324 --> 00:01:38.141
But at this time, 
giving voice to the catadores.

00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:43.482
By adding art and humor to the cause,
it became more appealing,

00:01:43.482 --> 00:01:46.050
which helped call attention 
to the catadores

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.975
and improve their self-esteem.

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:53.256
And also, they are famous now 
on the streets, on mass media and social.

00:01:53.256 --> 00:01:55.945
So, the thing is,

00:01:55.945 --> 00:01:59.902
I plunged into this universe 
and have not stopped working since.

00:01:59.902 --> 00:02:03.336
I have painted over 200 
carroças in many cities
