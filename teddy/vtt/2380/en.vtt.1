Catadores provide a heavy, 
honest and essential work

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.441
that benefits the entire population.
But they are not acknowledged for it.

00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:46.128
Here in Brazil, they collect 90 percent
of all the waste that's actually recycled.

00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:50.164
Most of the catadores work independently,

00:00:50.164 --> 00:00:55.575
picking waste from the streets and 
selling to junk yards at very low prices.

00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:58.970
They may collect over 300 kilos

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.825
in their bags, shopping carts, 
bicycles and carroças.
