When you think about innovation
and technology,

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:06.711
you're most likely thinking
about the latest app on your smartphone,

00:00:06.711 --> 00:00:09.547
or maybe you think
about rockets going into space.

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:12.175
But what about some of the world's
biggest challenges,

00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:14.010
like global hunger or climate change?

00:00:14.052 --> 00:00:16.888
They can seem overwhelming or, you know,

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.807
maybe you just think there
should be a nonprofit organization

00:00:19.807 --> 00:00:21.017
that takes care of that.

00:00:21.017 --> 00:00:23.269
But why is it that we think
so traditionally

00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:25.438
about some of the world's
biggest challenges?

00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:28.149
I believe innovation and technology

00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:31.069
can help tackle some
of the world's biggest challenges.
