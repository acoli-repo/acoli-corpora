00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:30.026
and they squeezed tight when I kissed him

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.478
and at some point in the evening,
our zero date became a first date.

00:04:33.502 --> 00:04:37.573
And two years later, we have a washer,
dryer and two house plants together.

00:04:38.064 --> 00:04:41.381
Now, I can't promise
you're going to end up with house plants.

00:04:41.405 --> 00:04:43.130
But the point of this story

00:04:43.154 --> 00:04:45.865
is that online dating
doesn't have to suck.

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.412
Don't treat it like a game,
and don't treat it like a resume review.

00:04:49.436 --> 00:04:52.229
Instead, use it to source
and qualify leads

00:04:52.253 --> 00:04:55.710
and then get offline as quickly
as possible with the zero date.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.039
Because the point of this isn't swiping.

00:04:59.063 --> 00:05:00.697
It's finding your person.
