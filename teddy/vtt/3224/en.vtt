00:00:00.968 --> 00:00:04.366
I first tried online dating
my freshman year of college,

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.682
which was in 2001,
in case you can't see my wrinkle.

00:00:08.436 --> 00:00:10.696
Now, as you may have noticed,
I'm six-feet tall,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.705
and when I arrived at my chosen university

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:17.045
and realized our men's Division III
basketball team averaged five-foot-eight,

00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:20.426
I abandoned the on-campus
scene and went online.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.178
Now, back then, online dating
was pretty close to the plot

00:00:23.202 --> 00:00:24.442
of "You've Got Mail."

00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:27.617
You'd write long emails
back and forth for weeks,

00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:29.616
before you finally met up in real life.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.379
Except, in my case,
you'd realize you have no chemistry
