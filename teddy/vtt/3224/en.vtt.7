00:03:27.387 --> 00:03:31.299
and then you only have to do your hair
and pick out one great outfit a week.

00:03:31.323 --> 00:03:34.220
The zero date also gave me a chance
to see how they responded

00:03:34.244 --> 00:03:35.910
to me asking them out.

00:03:35.934 --> 00:03:39.156
I figured not everyone
would dig my moxie, and I was right.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:43.077
Of my 29 qualified leads,
only 15 replied to my message,

00:03:43.101 --> 00:03:45.768
and of those, six scheduled a zero date.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.315
My first zero date
was with a set designer.

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:49.593
And we were both into yoga

00:03:49.617 --> 00:03:51.668
and preferred our bagels
with peanut butter,

00:03:51.692 --> 00:03:53.152
so it looked pretty promising.

00:03:53.176 --> 00:03:56.096
But two minutes in, I could tell
it wasn't going to be a thing

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.668
and I was relieved not to be
spending dinner with him.

00:03:58.692 --> 00:04:02.037
After that, I was a little nervous
about going to my next zero date.
