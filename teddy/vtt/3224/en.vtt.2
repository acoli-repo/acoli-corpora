00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:01.379
I'm an action-oriented overachieving
math and theater nerd,

00:01:01.403 --> 00:01:03.077
who ended up with an MBA.

00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:06.252
So, when things aren't working out,
I tend to take a step back,

00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:09.675
apply my business toolkit
to figure out why, and to fix it.

00:01:10.014 --> 00:01:12.299
My love life was no exception.

00:01:12.323 --> 00:01:16.767
The summer before I turned 30,
I took myself on a relationship off-site.

00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:19.229
Which means I went camping solo
in Maine for a week,

00:01:19.253 --> 00:01:22.595
to do a retro on my track record
of mediocre relationships.

00:01:23.236 --> 00:01:26.141
Because the thing was,
I knew what I wanted in a partner.

00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:30.205
Kindness, curiosity, empathy,
a sense of purpose.
