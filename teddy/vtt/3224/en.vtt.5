00:02:29.935 --> 00:02:32.434
but it turns out,
of my 210 inbound messages,

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:34.847
only 14 percent cleared that hurdle.

00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:36.037
(Laughter)

00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:39.307
Next, I wanted to meet in real life
as quickly as possible,

00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:42.323
because the things I cared about,
I couldn't see online.

00:02:42.347 --> 00:02:44.109
But the research, and my experience,

00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:48.114
shows you only need about 30 seconds
with someone to tell if you click.

00:02:48.581 --> 00:02:50.723
So I invented the zero date.

00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:53.732
The zero date is one drink, one hour.

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:56.688
With the goal of answering one question:

00:02:56.712 --> 00:02:59.149
Would I like to have
dinner with this person?

00:02:59.173 --> 00:03:00.553
Not "are they the one"?
