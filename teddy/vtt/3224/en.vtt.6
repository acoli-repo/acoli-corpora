00:02:59.173 --> 00:03:00.553
Not "are they the one"?

00:03:00.577 --> 00:03:03.973
Literally, "Would I like to spend
three hours across the table

00:03:03.997 --> 00:03:05.147
from this person?"

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.799
You tell them you have a hard stop --

00:03:07.823 --> 00:03:10.466
drinks with girlfriends,
a conference call with China --

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.363
it doesn't matter, they don't know you.

00:03:12.387 --> 00:03:13.853
The point is one hour.

00:03:14.466 --> 00:03:17.125
If it's awesome,
you schedule a first date.

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:20.291
And if it's not awesome,
you downshift into entertainer mode

00:03:20.315 --> 00:03:23.474
and you workshop a few new stories
for your next networking event.

00:03:23.823 --> 00:03:27.363
Plus, because it's just an hour,
you can squeeze up to three in one evening

00:03:27.387 --> 00:03:31.299
and then you only have to do your hair
and pick out one great outfit a week.
