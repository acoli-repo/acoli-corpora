First, I went to OkCupid,

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.847
because I wanted to avoid
the gamification of swipe-based apps.

00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:06.442
And also, because I wanted
a writing sample.

00:02:07.022 --> 00:02:09.252
Next, I set up a sales funnel,

00:02:09.276 --> 00:02:11.363
throwing out any sense of my type,

00:02:11.387 --> 00:02:15.196
and instead defining the criteria
that would qualify a lead.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.387
An inbound message had to do three things:

00:02:17.411 --> 00:02:20.577
had to be written in complete sentences
and with good grammar;

00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:22.678
it had to reference
something in my profile,

00:02:22.702 --> 00:02:25.006
so I know it's not
a copy-and-paste situation;

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.806
and it had to avoid all sexual content.

00:02:28.157 --> 00:02:29.911
I figured this was a pretty low bar,

00:02:29.935 --> 00:02:32.434
but it turns out,
of my 210 inbound messages,
