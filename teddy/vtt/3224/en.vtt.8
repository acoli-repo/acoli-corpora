After that, I was a little nervous
about going to my next zero date.

00:04:02.061 --> 00:04:04.870
But we had agreed to meet
on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade

00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:06.958
with a flask of whiskey
to watch the sunset,

00:04:06.982 --> 00:04:09.402
and honestly, it was two blocks
from my apartment.

00:04:09.426 --> 00:04:12.331
Plus, this guy had a podcast,
I have a podcast,

00:04:12.355 --> 00:04:15.307
worst case scenario,
we can talk about our podcasts.

00:04:15.331 --> 00:04:18.214
Then, Chas set down next to me.

00:04:18.688 --> 00:04:20.666
And this kind and empathetic man

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.767
told great jokes
and asked even better questions.

00:04:24.355 --> 00:04:27.994
He was a lawyer and a writer,
and his eyes twinkled when he laughed

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:30.026
and they squeezed tight when I kissed him
