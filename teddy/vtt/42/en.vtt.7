00:03:29.887 --> 00:03:32.578
to multiply within the bacteria
and then kill them --

00:03:32.602 --> 00:03:35.739
that make them so interesting
from a medical point of view.

00:03:35.763 --> 00:03:38.040
The other part that I find
extremely interesting

00:03:38.064 --> 00:03:40.318
is the scale at which this is going on.

00:03:40.342 --> 00:03:43.826
Now, just five years ago,
I really had no clue about phages.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.314
And yet, today I would tell you
they are part of a natural principle.

00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:51.702
Phages and bacteria go back
to the earliest days of evolution.

00:03:51.726 --> 00:03:55.227
They have always existed in tandem,
keeping each other in check.

00:03:55.765 --> 00:03:59.637
So this is really the story of yin
and yang, of the hunter and the prey,

00:03:59.661 --> 00:04:01.245
at a microscopic level.
