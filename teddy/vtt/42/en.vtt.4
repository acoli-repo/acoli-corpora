(Laughter)

00:02:00.974 --> 00:02:03.768
Well, viruses are good at infecting cells.

00:02:03.792 --> 00:02:06.006
And phages are great
at infecting bacteria.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.458
And your hand, just like
so much of our body,

00:02:08.482 --> 00:02:10.918
is a hotbed of bacterial activity,

00:02:10.942 --> 00:02:14.180
making it an ideal
hunting ground for phages.

00:02:14.204 --> 00:02:17.053
Because after all, phages hunt bacteria.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.486
It's also important to know that phages
are extremely selective hunters.

00:02:22.014 --> 00:02:25.947
Typically, a phage will only infect
a single bacterial species.

00:02:26.648 --> 00:02:29.640
So in this rendering here,
the phage that you see

00:02:29.664 --> 00:02:32.830
hunts for a bacterium
called Staphylococcus aureus,
