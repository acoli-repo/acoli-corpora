00:02:59.307 --> 00:03:01.998
At this point, the phage
reprograms the bacteria

00:03:02.022 --> 00:03:04.395
into producing lots of new phages.

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.351
The bacteria, in effect,
becomes a phage factory.

00:03:07.704 --> 00:03:11.664
Once around 50-100 phages have accumulated
within the bacteria cell,

00:03:11.688 --> 00:03:14.077
the phages are then able
to release a protein

00:03:14.101 --> 00:03:16.177
that disrupts the bacteria cell wall.

00:03:16.514 --> 00:03:19.680
As the bacteria bursts,
the phages move out

00:03:19.704 --> 00:03:22.459
and go on the hunt again
for a new bacteria to infect.

00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:26.466
Now, I'm sorry, this probably
sounded like a scary virus again.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.863
But it's exactly this ability of phages --

00:03:29.887 --> 00:03:32.578
to multiply within the bacteria
and then kill them --
