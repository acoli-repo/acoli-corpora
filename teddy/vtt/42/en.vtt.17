Today, most of you
will have heard about superbugs.

00:08:30.974 --> 00:08:33.111
Those are bacteria
that have become resistant

00:08:33.135 --> 00:08:37.649
to many, if not all, of the antibiotics
that we have developed

00:08:37.673 --> 00:08:39.273
to treat this infection.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.094
How did we get here?

00:08:41.118 --> 00:08:44.092
Well, we weren't as smart
as we thought we were.

00:08:44.578 --> 00:08:47.521
As we started using
antibiotics everywhere --

00:08:47.545 --> 00:08:50.934
in hospitals, to treat and prevent;
at home, for simple colds;

00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.220
on farms, to keep animals healthy --

00:08:53.244 --> 00:08:54.644
the bacteria evolved.

00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:59.358
In the onslaught of antibiotics
that were all around them,

00:08:59.382 --> 00:09:02.401
those bacteria survived
that were best able to adapt.
