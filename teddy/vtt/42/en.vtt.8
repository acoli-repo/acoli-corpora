00:03:59.661 --> 00:04:01.245
at a microscopic level.

00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:04.236
Some scientists have even estimated

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.990
that phages are the most
abundant organism on our planet.

00:04:08.863 --> 00:04:11.934
So even before we continue
talking about their medical potential,

00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:15.122
I think everybody should know
about phages and their role on earth:

00:04:15.146 --> 00:04:17.546
they hunt, infect and kill bacteria.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.511
Now, how come we have something
that works so well in nature,

00:04:21.535 --> 00:04:23.926
every day, everywhere around us,

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.704
and yet, in most parts of the world,

00:04:25.728 --> 00:04:27.744
we do not have a single drug on the market

00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:30.776
that uses this principle
to combat bacterial infections?
