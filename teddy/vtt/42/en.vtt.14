00:06:57.752 --> 00:07:00.672
So when chemical antibiotics
emerged in the 1940s,

00:07:00.696 --> 00:07:02.787
they completely changed the game.

00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:04.819
And this guy played a major role.

00:07:04.843 --> 00:07:06.137
This is Alexander Fleming.

00:07:06.161 --> 00:07:07.970
He won the Nobel Prize in medicine

00:07:07.994 --> 00:07:10.129
for his work contributing
to the development

00:07:10.153 --> 00:07:12.120
of the first antibiotic, penicillin.

00:07:12.871 --> 00:07:16.998
And antibiotics really work
very differently than phages.

00:07:17.022 --> 00:07:19.799
For the most part, they inhibit
the growth of the bacteria,

00:07:19.823 --> 00:07:22.895
and they don't care so much
which kind of bacteria are present.

00:07:23.196 --> 00:07:25.126
The ones that we call broad-spectrum

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.742
will even work against
a whole bunch of bacteria out there.

00:07:28.766 --> 00:07:31.260
Compare that to phages,
which work extremely narrowly
