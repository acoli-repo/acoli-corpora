WEBVTT

00:02:29.664 --> 00:02:32.830
hunts for a bacterium
called Staphylococcus aureus,

00:02:32.854 --> 00:02:36.109
which is known as MRSA
in its drug-resistant form.

00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:38.266
It causes skin or wound infections.

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.828
The way the phage hunts is with its feet.

00:02:42.364 --> 00:02:44.862
The feet are actually extremely
sensitive receptors,

00:02:44.886 --> 00:02:47.761
on the lookout for the right surface
on a bacterial cell.

00:02:48.158 --> 00:02:49.410
Once it finds it,

00:02:49.434 --> 00:02:52.363
the phage will latch on
to the bacterial cell wall

00:02:52.387 --> 00:02:53.987
and then inject its DNA.

00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:56.037
DNA sits in the head of the phage

00:02:56.061 --> 00:02:58.850
and travels into the bacteria
through the long body.

00:02:59.307 --> 00:03:01.998
At this point, the phage
reprograms the bacteria
