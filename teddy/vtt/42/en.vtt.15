00:07:28.766 --> 00:07:31.260
Compare that to phages,
which work extremely narrowly

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.727
against one bacterial species,

00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:34.806
and you can see the obvious advantage.

00:07:35.575 --> 00:07:38.426
Now, back then, this must have felt
like a dream come true.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.649
You had a patient
with a suspected bacterial infection,

00:07:41.673 --> 00:07:43.268
you gave him the antibiotic,

00:07:43.292 --> 00:07:46.451
and without really needing to know
anything else about the bacteria

00:07:46.475 --> 00:07:47.649
causing the disease,

00:07:47.673 --> 00:07:49.188
many of the patients recovered.

00:07:49.212 --> 00:07:51.569
And so as we developed
more and more antibiotics,

00:07:51.593 --> 00:07:55.278
they, rightly so, became the first-line
therapy for bacterial infections.

00:07:55.831 --> 00:08:00.069
And by the way, they have contributed
tremendously to our life expectancy.
