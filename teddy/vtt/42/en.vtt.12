00:05:58.631 --> 00:06:02.306
because a tiny drop was sufficient
to have a huge impact.

00:06:02.853 --> 00:06:06.077
He called the agent he had found
an "invisible microbe"

00:06:06.101 --> 00:06:07.906
and gave it the name "bacteriophage,"

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.363
which, literally translated,
means "bacteria eater."

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.792
And by the way, this is one
of the most fundamental discoveries

00:06:13.816 --> 00:06:15.125
of modern microbiology.

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:19.363
So many modern techniques go back
to our understanding of how phages work --

00:06:19.387 --> 00:06:21.681
in genomic editing,
but also in other fields.

00:06:21.705 --> 00:06:24.664
And just today, the Nobel Prize
in chemistry was announced

00:06:24.688 --> 00:06:28.569
for two scientists who work with phages
and develop drugs based on that.

00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:31.758
Now, back in the 1920s and 1930s,
