00:00:00.873 --> 00:00:02.295
Take a moment

00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:03.835
and think about a virus.

00:00:04.913 --> 00:00:06.706
What comes to your mind?

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.983
An illness?

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:09.333
A fear?

00:00:09.357 --> 00:00:11.363
Probably something really unpleasant.

00:00:11.387 --> 00:00:13.934
And yet, viruses are not all the same.

00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:17.489
It's true, some of them cause
devastating disease.

00:00:17.513 --> 00:00:21.600
But others can do the exact opposite --
they can cure disease.

00:00:21.624 --> 00:00:23.656
These viruses are called "phages."

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:27.434
Now, the first time I heard
about phages was back in 2013.

00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:29.609
My father-in-law, who's a surgeon,

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:32.053
was telling me about a woman
he was treating.
