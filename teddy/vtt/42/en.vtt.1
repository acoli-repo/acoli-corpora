00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:32.053
was telling me about a woman
he was treating.

00:00:32.077 --> 00:00:35.196
The woman had a knee injury,
required multiple surgeries,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.673
and over the course of these,

00:00:36.697 --> 00:00:39.569
developed a chronic
bacterial infection in her leg.

00:00:39.593 --> 00:00:40.853
Unfortunately for her,

00:00:40.877 --> 00:00:43.910
the bacteria causing the infection
also did not respond

00:00:43.934 --> 00:00:46.401
to any antibiotic that was available.

00:00:46.807 --> 00:00:50.196
So at this point, typically, the only
option left is to amputate the leg

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.632
to stop the infection
from spreading further.

00:00:53.268 --> 00:00:56.799
Now, my father-in-law was desperate
for a different kind of solution,

00:00:56.823 --> 00:01:01.325
and he applied for an experimental,
last-resort treatment using phages.
