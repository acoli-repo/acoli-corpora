Now, back in the 1920s and 1930s,

00:06:31.782 --> 00:06:34.695
people also immediately saw
the medical potential of phages.

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:36.378
After all, albeit invisible,

00:06:36.402 --> 00:06:38.925
you had something
that reliably was killing bacteria.

00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:42.950
Companies that still exist today,
such as Abbott, Squibb or Lilly,

00:06:42.974 --> 00:06:44.574
sold phage preparations.

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:48.260

00:06:48.284 --> 00:06:50.691
it's very difficult to get
to a reliable drug.

00:06:51.117 --> 00:06:53.109
Just imagine going to the FDA today

00:06:53.133 --> 00:06:55.439

that invisible virus

00:06:55.463 --> 00:06:57.056
you want to give to patients.

00:06:57.752 --> 00:07:00.672
So when chemical antibiotics
emerged in the 1940s,
