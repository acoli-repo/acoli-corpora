00:09:27.014 --> 00:09:30.220
And let me tell you, they are not
impressed by multidrug resistance.

00:09:30.244 --> 00:09:31.395
(Laughter)

00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:37.172
They are just as happily killing
and hunting bacteria all around us.

00:09:38.028 --> 00:09:41.329
And they've also stayed selective,
which today is really a good thing.

00:09:41.353 --> 00:09:44.837
Today, we are able to reliably identify
a bacterial pathogen

00:09:44.861 --> 00:09:47.355
that's causing an infection
in many settings.

00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:50.477
And their selectivity will help us
avoid some of the side effects

00:09:50.501 --> 00:09:54.045
that are commonly associated
with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

00:09:54.609 --> 00:09:58.442
But maybe the best news of all is:
they are no longer an invisible microbe.

00:09:58.466 --> 00:09:59.791
We can look at them.

00:09:59.815 --> 00:10:01.260
And we did so together before.
