00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:33.171
The image that you see here was taken
by an electron microscope.

00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:36.929
And that means what we see on the screen
is in reality extremely tiny.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.017
The grainy thing in the middle
with the head, the long body

00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:42.490
and a number of feet --

00:01:42.514 --> 00:01:45.204
this is the image of a prototypical phage.

00:01:45.228 --> 00:01:46.450
It's kind of cute.

00:01:46.474 --> 00:01:48.029
(Laughter)

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:50.958
Now, take a look at your hand.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.075
In our team, we've estimated
that you have more than 10 billion phages

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:57.566
on each of your hands.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.678
What are they doing there?

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:00.950
(Laughter)
