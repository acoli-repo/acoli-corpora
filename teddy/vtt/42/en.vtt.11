00:05:28.818 --> 00:05:33.063
and then took a tiny drop and added it
to freshly cultivated bacteria.

00:05:33.087 --> 00:05:35.263
And he observed
that within a number of hours,

00:05:35.287 --> 00:05:37.252
the bacteria had been killed.

00:05:37.276 --> 00:05:41.053
He then repeated this,
again filtering, taking a tiny drop,

00:05:41.077 --> 00:05:43.651
adding it to the next batch
of fresh bacteria.

00:05:43.675 --> 00:05:46.182
He did this in sequence 50 times,

00:05:46.206 --> 00:05:48.071
always observing the same effect.

00:05:48.095 --> 00:05:50.817
And at this point,
he made two conclusions.

00:05:50.841 --> 00:05:54.278
First of all, the obvious one:
yes, something was killing the bacteria,

00:05:54.302 --> 00:05:55.798
and it was in that liquid.

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:58.607
The other one: it had to be
biologic in nature,

00:05:58.631 --> 00:06:02.306
because a tiny drop was sufficient
to have a huge impact.
