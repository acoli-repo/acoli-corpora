WEBVTT

00:09:59.815 --> 00:10:01.260
And we did so together before.

00:10:01.284 --> 00:10:03.132
We can sequence their DNA.

00:10:03.156 --> 00:10:04.752
We understand how they replicate.

00:10:04.776 --> 00:10:06.664
And we understand the limitations.

00:10:06.688 --> 00:10:08.055
We are in a great place

00:10:08.079 --> 00:10:12.093
to now develop strong and reliable
phage-based pharmaceuticals.

00:10:12.117 --> 00:10:14.299
And that's what's happening
around the globe.

00:10:14.323 --> 00:10:17.078
More than 10 biotech companies,
including our own company,

00:10:17.102 --> 00:10:20.687
are developing human-phage applications
to treat bacterial infections.

00:10:20.711 --> 00:10:24.918
A number of clinical trials
are getting underway in Europe and the US.

00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:28.061
So I'm convinced
that we're standing on the verge

00:10:28.085 --> 00:10:30.045
of a renaissance of phage therapy.
