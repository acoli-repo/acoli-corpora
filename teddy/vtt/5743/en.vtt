Call me weird,
but I love a good ride-along.

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:05.788
Like, love them.

00:00:05.788 --> 00:00:08.163
I've been on ride-alongs
across the world --

00:00:08.163 --> 00:00:10.996
in Amsterdam, in Canada, in Boston,

00:00:10.996 --> 00:00:13.079
and even right here, in Denver.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.288
And what I've learned

00:00:14.288 --> 00:00:17.746
is that people call the cops
for a number of reasons --

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:19.621
anything from a lost cat,

00:00:19.663 --> 00:00:22.413
to a neighbor they just want
to know more about,

00:00:22.413 --> 00:00:25.538
to maybe a loved one or a stranger
having a mental health crisis.

00:00:26.246 --> 00:00:28.246
But really, at the heart of it,

00:00:28.246 --> 00:00:31.746
people call 9-1-1 because they just
don't know what else to do.
