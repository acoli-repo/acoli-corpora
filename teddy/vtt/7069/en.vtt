00:00:07.704 --> 00:00:11.204
Inside our cells, each of us has
a second set of genes

00:00:11.204 --> 00:00:14.579
completely separate from the 23 pairs 
of chromosomes

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:16.246
we inherit from our parents.

00:00:16.413 --> 00:00:18.746
And this isn’t just the case for humans—

00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:22.163
it’s true of every animal,
plant, and fungus,

00:00:22.163 --> 00:00:25.746
and nearly every multicellular
organism on Earth.

00:00:26.704 --> 00:00:30.079
This second genome belongs
to our mitochondria,
