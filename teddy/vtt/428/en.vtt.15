that when women coders on one platform
hid their gender, like myself,

00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:35.708
their code was accepted
four percent more than men.

00:07:36.542 --> 00:07:39.458
So this is not about the talent.

00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:42.851
This is about an elitism in AI

00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:45.667
that says a programmer
needs to look like a certain person.

00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:50.476
What we really need to do
to make AI better

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.542
is bring people
from all kinds of backgrounds.

00:07:54.542 --> 00:07:57.101
We need people who can
write and tell stories

00:07:57.125 --> 00:07:59.292
to help us create personalities of AI.
