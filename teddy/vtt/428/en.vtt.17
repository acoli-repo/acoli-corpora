Less racist robots, less machines
that are going to take our jobs --

00:08:34.332 --> 00:08:37.457
and more about what technology
can actually achieve.

00:08:38.292 --> 00:08:41.726
So, yes, some of the energy
in the world of AI,

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.143

what ads you see on your stream.

00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:52.667

making the world so much better.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.268
Think about a pregnant woman
in the Democratic Republic of Congo,

00:08:57.292 --> 00:09:01.476
who has to walk 17 hours
to her nearest rural prenatal clinic
