00:10:27.333 --> 00:10:30.458
so they don't just repeat
our own past mistakes.

00:10:32.125 --> 00:10:35.667
So I hope I leave you
thinking about two things.

00:10:36.542 --> 00:10:41.101
First, I hope you leave
thinking about bias today.

00:10:41.125 --> 00:10:44.309
And that the next time
you scroll past an advert

00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:47.143
that assumes you are interested
in fertility clinics

00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:50.018
or online betting websites,

00:10:50.042 --> 00:10:52.059
that you think and remember

00:10:52.083 --> 00:10:56.708
that the same technology is assuming
that a black man will reoffend.

00:10:57.833 --> 00:11:02.000
Or that a woman is more likely
to be a personal assistant than a CEO.
