00:08:00.208 --> 00:08:02.250
We need people who can solve problems.

00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:06.893
We need people
who face different challenges

00:08:06.917 --> 00:08:12.268
and we need people who can tell us
what are the real issues that need fixing

00:08:12.292 --> 00:08:15.333
and help us find ways
that technology can actually fix it.

00:08:17.833 --> 00:08:21.559
Because, when people
from diverse backgrounds come together,

00:08:21.583 --> 00:08:23.726
when we build things in the right way,

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.792
the possibilities are limitless.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.059
And that's what I want to end
by talking to you about.
