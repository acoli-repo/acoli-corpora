Or you've scrolled past adverts
of fertility clinics

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.667
on your Facebook feed.

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:38.018
Or in my case, Indian marriage bureaus.

00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:39.309
(Laughter)

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:42.309
But AI isn't just being used
to make decisions

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.934
about what products we want to buy

00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:47.458
or which show we want to binge watch next.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:54.226
I wonder how you'd feel about someone
who thought things like this:

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.184
"A black or Latino person

00:01:56.208 --> 00:02:00.333
is less likely than a white person
to pay off their loan on time."
