00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.143
And it is up to all of us in this room

00:11:32.167 --> 00:11:34.893
to convince the governments
and the corporations

00:11:34.917 --> 00:11:37.809
to build AI technology for everyone,

00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:40.226
including the edge cases.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.309
And for us all to get education

00:11:42.333 --> 00:11:44.708
about this phenomenal
technology in the future.

00:11:46.167 --> 00:11:48.184
Because if we do that,

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:53.101
then we've only just scratched the surface
of what we can achieve with AI.

00:11:53.125 --> 00:11:54.393
Thank you.

00:11:54.417 --> 00:11:57.125
