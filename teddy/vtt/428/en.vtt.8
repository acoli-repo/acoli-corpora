They all have two things in common:

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.601
one, they can never get my name right,

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:07.292
and second, they are all female.

00:04:08.417 --> 00:04:11.184
They are designed to be
our obedient servants,

00:04:11.208 --> 00:04:14.458
turning your lights on and off,
ordering your shopping.

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:18.434
You get male AIs too,
but they tend to be more high-powered,

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:21.517
like IBM Watson,
making business decisions,

00:04:21.541 --> 00:04:25.333
Salesforce Einstein
or ROSS, the robot lawyer.

00:04:26.208 --> 00:04:30.268
So poor robots, even they suffer
from sexism in the workplace.
