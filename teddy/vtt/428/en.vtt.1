00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:31.309
I'm the person my friends
and followers message

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:32.875
freaking out about the future.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.934
We see this everywhere.

00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:40.851
This media panic that
our robot overlords are taking over.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:42.792
We could blame Hollywood for that.

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:48.250
But in reality, that's not the problem
we should be focusing on.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.893
There is a more pressing danger,
a bigger risk with AI,

00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:54.500
that we need to fix first.

00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:57.726
So we are back to this question:

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.458
How many decisions
have been made about you today by AI?
