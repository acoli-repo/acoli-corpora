00:05:32.792 --> 00:05:38.583
The good news about AI
is that it is entirely within our control.

00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:43.333
We get to teach the right values,
the right ethics to AI.

00:05:44.167 --> 00:05:46.351
So there are three things we can do.

00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:49.726
One, we can be aware of our own biases

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.476
and the bias in machines around us.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.018
Two, we can make sure that diverse teams
are building this technology.

00:05:57.042 --> 00:06:01.958
And three, we have to give it
diverse experiences to learn from.
