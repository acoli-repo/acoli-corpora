00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.769
Proto-Indo-European itself descended
from an even more ancient language,

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.908
but unfortunately, this is as far back
as historical and archeological evidence

00:04:07.908 --> 00:04:10.088
will allow us to go.

00:04:10.088 --> 00:04:12.280
Many mysteries remain just out of reach,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.658
such as whether there might be a link
between Indo-European

00:04:15.658 --> 00:04:17.842
and other major language families,

00:04:17.842 --> 00:04:22.522
and the nature of the languages spoken
in Europe prior to its arrival.

00:04:22.522 --> 00:04:27.418
But the amazing fact remains that nearly
3 billion people around the world,

00:04:27.418 --> 00:04:29.980
many of whom cannot understand each other,

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.360
are nevertheless speaking the same words
shaped by 6000 years of history.
