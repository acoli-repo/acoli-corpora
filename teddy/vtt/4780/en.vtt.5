00:02:27.988 --> 00:02:31.781
that came after the "sk" to "sh" shift.

00:02:31.781 --> 00:02:33.710
These examples show us

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.628
that just as the various Romance languages
descended from Latin,

00:02:37.628 --> 00:02:41.603
English, Swedish, German, 
and many other languages

00:02:41.603 --> 00:02:46.006
descended from their own common ancestor
known as Proto-Germanic

00:02:46.006 --> 00:02:48.854
spoken around 500 B.C.E.

00:02:48.854 --> 00:02:52.301
Because this historical language
was never written down,

00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:56.184
we can only reconstruct it 
by comparing its descendants,

00:02:56.184 --> 00:02:59.302
which is possible thanks 
to the consistency of the changes.

00:02:59.302 --> 00:03:03.671
We can even use the same process
to go back one step further,
