they brought their speech with them,

00:01:01.793 --> 00:01:05.267
adding a massive amount 
of French and Latin vocabulary

00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:08.286
to the English language 
previously spoken there.

00:01:08.286 --> 00:01:11.049
Today, we call that language Old English.

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.495
This is the language of Beowulf.

00:01:13.495 --> 00:01:15.609
It probably doesn't look very familiar,

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:19.915
but it might be more recognizable
if you know some German.

00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:23.807
That's because Old English
belongs to the Germanic language family,

00:01:23.807 --> 00:01:27.595
first brought to the British Isles
in the 5th and 6th centuries

00:01:27.595 --> 00:01:31.179
by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.
