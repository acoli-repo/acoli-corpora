00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:01.175
and certain core vocabulary.

00:02:01.175 --> 00:02:03.682
For example, after the 6th century,

00:02:03.682 --> 00:02:09.011
German words starting with "p,"
systematically shifted to a "pf" sound

00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:13.109
while their Old English counterparts
kept the "p" unchanged.

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.977
In another split, words 
that have "sk" sounds in Swedish

00:02:16.977 --> 00:02:20.394
developed an "sh" sound in English.

00:02:20.394 --> 00:02:23.236
There are still some English 
words with "sk,"

00:02:23.236 --> 00:02:25.257
like "skirt," and "skull,"

00:02:25.257 --> 00:02:27.988
but they're direct borrowings 
from Old Norse

00:02:27.988 --> 00:02:31.781
that came after the "sk" to "sh" shift.
