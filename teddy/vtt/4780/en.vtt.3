The Germanic dialects they spoke would
become known as Anglo-Saxon.

00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:38.931
Viking invaders in the 8th 
to 11th centuries

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:42.943
added more borrowings 
from Old Norse into the mix.

00:01:42.943 --> 00:01:45.771
It may be hard to see the roots
of modern English

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.634
underneath all the words borrowed

00:01:47.634 --> 00:01:51.738

and other languages.

00:01:51.738 --> 00:01:56.904
But comparative linguistics can help us
by focusing on grammatical structure,

00:01:56.904 --> 00:01:58.733
patterns of sound changes,

00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:01.175
and certain core vocabulary.
