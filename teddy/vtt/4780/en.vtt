When we talk about English,
we often think of it as a single language

00:00:10.657 --> 00:00:14.997
but what do the dialects spoken
in dozens of countries around the world

00:00:14.997 --> 00:00:17.050
have in common with each other,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.980
or with the writings of Chaucer?

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.028
And how are any of them related
to the strange words in Beowulf?

00:00:23.028 --> 00:00:25.271
The answer is that like most languages,

00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:28.326
English has evolved 
through generations of speakers,

00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:31.307
undergoing major changes over time.
