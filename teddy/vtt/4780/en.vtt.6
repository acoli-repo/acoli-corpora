We can even use the same process
to go back one step further,

00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:09.741
and trace the origins of Proto-Germanic
to a language called Proto-Indo-European,

00:03:09.741 --> 00:03:11.922
spoken about 6000 years ago

00:03:11.922 --> 00:03:16.512
on the Pontic steppe 
in modern day Ukraine and Russia.

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:20.843
This is the reconstructed ancestor
of the Indo-European family

00:03:20.843 --> 00:03:25.371
that includes nearly all languages
historically spoken in Europe,

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:28.711
as well as large parts of Southern
and Western Asia.

00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:31.453
And though it requires a bit more work,
