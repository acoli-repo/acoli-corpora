00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:00.141
increasingly talks about a lethal illness

00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:01.428
in the past tense.

00:01:02.614 --> 00:01:06.477
Science can, in our lifetimes --
even in a decade --

00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:09.708
transform what it means
to have a specific illness.

00:01:12.055 --> 00:01:13.589
But not for all illnesses.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:19.097
My friend Robert and I
were classmates in graduate school.

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:20.922
Robert was smart,

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:22.423
but with each passing month,

00:01:22.447 --> 00:01:25.601
his thinking seemed to become
more disorganized.

00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:29.439
He dropped out of school,
got a job in a store ...

00:01:29.463 --> 00:01:31.681
But that, too, became too complicated.
