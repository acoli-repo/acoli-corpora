They've even developed molecules
that interfere with complement proteins,

00:14:00.803 --> 00:14:04.410
and they're starting to test them
in the brain as well as the immune system.

00:14:05.124 --> 00:14:09.845
It's potentially a path toward a drug
that might address a root cause

00:14:09.869 --> 00:14:12.518
rather than an individual symptom,

00:14:12.542 --> 00:14:16.590
and we hope very much that this work
by many scientists over many years

00:14:16.614 --> 00:14:17.766
will be successful.

00:14:19.689 --> 00:14:22.703
But C4 is just one example

00:14:22.727 --> 00:14:25.839
of the potential for data-driven
scientific approaches

00:14:25.863 --> 00:14:29.766
to open new fronts on medical problems
that are centuries old.
