00:00:00.785 --> 00:00:02.489
Nine years ago,

00:00:02.513 --> 00:00:05.614
my sister discovered lumps
in her neck and arm

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:07.398
and was diagnosed with cancer.

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:12.184
From that day, she started to benefit

00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:15.323
from the understanding
that science has of cancer.

00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:18.305
Every time she went to the doctor,

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.523
they measured specific molecules

00:00:20.547 --> 00:00:23.428
that gave them information
about how she was doing

00:00:23.452 --> 00:00:24.761
and what to do next.

00:00:26.095 --> 00:00:29.761
New medical options
became available every few years.
