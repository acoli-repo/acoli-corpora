You see, before I became a biologist,
I worked in computers and math,

00:04:31.898 --> 00:04:33.222
and I learned this lesson:

00:04:34.365 --> 00:04:38.549
wherever you can collect vast amounts
of the right kinds of data

00:04:38.573 --> 00:04:40.603
about the functioning of a system,

00:04:41.365 --> 00:04:44.983
you can use computers in powerful new ways

00:04:45.007 --> 00:04:48.232
to make sense of that system
and learn how it works.

00:04:48.256 --> 00:04:50.778
Today, big-data approaches
are transforming

00:04:50.802 --> 00:04:53.285
ever-larger sectors of our economy,

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:56.595
and they could do the same
in biology and medicine, too.

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:59.176
But you have to have
the right kinds of data.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.459
You have to have data
about the right things.
