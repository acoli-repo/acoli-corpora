You have to have data
about the right things.

00:05:01.917 --> 00:05:05.782
And that often requires
new technologies and ideas.

00:05:06.815 --> 00:05:10.309
And that is the mission that animates
the scientists in my lab.

00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:14.225
Today, I want to tell you
two short stories from our work.

00:05:15.427 --> 00:05:18.531
One fundamental obstacle we face

00:05:18.555 --> 00:05:21.215
in trying to turn the brain
into a big-data problem

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:26.484
is that our brains are composed of
and built from billions of cells.

00:05:27.246 --> 00:05:31.105
And our cells are not generalists;
they're specialists.
