00:07:57.489 --> 00:08:00.547
into each cell's RNA molecules.

00:08:00.571 --> 00:08:03.407
Those are the molecular
transcripts it's making

00:08:03.431 --> 00:08:06.534
of the specific genes
that it's using to do its job.

00:08:07.383 --> 00:08:11.590
And then we sequence billions
of these combined molecules

00:08:12.532 --> 00:08:15.030
and use the sequences to tell us

00:08:15.054 --> 00:08:17.656
which cell and which gene

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.220
every molecule came from.

00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:23.853
We call this approach "Drop-seq,"
because we use droplets

00:08:23.877 --> 00:08:26.452
to separate the cells for analysis,

00:08:26.476 --> 00:08:29.921
and we use DNA sequences
to tag and inventory

00:08:29.945 --> 00:08:31.433
and keep track of everything.
