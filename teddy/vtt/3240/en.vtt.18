"Oh, this is going to make you guys
the go-to for every major brain project."

00:09:01.257 --> 00:09:02.801
That's not how we saw it.

00:09:02.825 --> 00:09:07.356
Science is best when everyone
is generating lots of exciting data.

00:09:08.197 --> 00:09:11.411
So we wrote a 25-page instruction book,

00:09:11.435 --> 00:09:16.013
with which any scientist could build
their own Drop-seq system from scratch.

00:09:16.037 --> 00:09:19.734
And that instruction book has been
downloaded from our lab website

00:09:19.758 --> 00:09:22.723
50,000 times in the past two years.

00:09:23.598 --> 00:09:26.650
We wrote software
that any scientist could use

00:09:26.674 --> 00:09:29.572
to analyze the data
from Drop-seq experiments,

00:09:29.596 --> 00:09:31.311
and that software is also free,
