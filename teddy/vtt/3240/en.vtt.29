There are hundreds of places
in our genomes

00:14:32.913 --> 00:14:35.498
that shape risk for brain illnesses,

00:14:35.522 --> 00:14:39.588
and any one of them could lead us
to the next molecular insight

00:14:39.612 --> 00:14:41.632
about a molecule that matters.

00:14:41.656 --> 00:14:45.643
And there are hundreds of cell types that
use these genes in different combinations.

00:14:45.667 --> 00:14:47.736
As we and other scientists
work to generate

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.829
the rest of the data that's needed

00:14:49.853 --> 00:14:52.246
and to learn all that we can
from that data,

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:54.673
we hope to open many more new fronts.

00:14:56.483 --> 00:15:01.562
Genetics and single-cell analysis
are just two ways
