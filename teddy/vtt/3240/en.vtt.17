00:08:29.945 --> 00:08:31.433
and keep track of everything.

00:08:32.727 --> 00:08:34.703
And now, whenever we do an experiment,

00:08:34.727 --> 00:08:37.970
we analyze tens of thousands
of individual cells.

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:41.642
And today in this area of science,

00:08:41.666 --> 00:08:46.597
the challenge is increasingly
how to learn as much as we can

00:08:46.621 --> 00:08:48.493
as quickly as we can

00:08:48.517 --> 00:08:50.255
from these vast data sets.

00:08:52.914 --> 00:08:55.684
When we were developing Drop-seq,
people used to tell us,

00:08:55.708 --> 00:09:00.512
"Oh, this is going to make you guys
the go-to for every major brain project."
