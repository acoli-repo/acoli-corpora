00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:30.729
how cells with hundreds
of different people's genomes

00:15:30.753 --> 00:15:32.923
respond differently to the same stimulus.

00:15:34.248 --> 00:15:39.151
These projects bring together
people with diverse backgrounds

00:15:39.175 --> 00:15:41.668
and training and interests --

00:15:41.692 --> 00:15:47.569
biology, computers, chemistry,
math, statistics, engineering.

00:15:48.205 --> 00:15:52.437
But the scientific possibilities
rally people with diverse interests

00:15:52.461 --> 00:15:54.696
into working intensely together.

00:15:56.871 --> 00:15:59.422
What's the future
that we could hope to create?
