00:06:27.445 --> 00:06:30.521
that if you wanted to inventory
all of the molecules

00:06:30.545 --> 00:06:33.470
in a part of the brain or any organ,

00:06:33.494 --> 00:06:37.448
you had to first grind it up
into a kind of cellular smoothie.

00:06:38.678 --> 00:06:39.908
But that's a problem.

00:06:40.737 --> 00:06:43.275
As soon as you've ground up the cells,

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:46.810
you can only study the contents
of the average cell --

00:06:46.834 --> 00:06:48.429
not the individual cells.

00:06:49.182 --> 00:06:52.891
Imagine if you were trying to understand
how a big city like New York works,

00:06:52.915 --> 00:06:55.457
but you could only do so
by reviewing some statistics

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:57.510
about the average resident of New York.

00:06:58.637 --> 00:07:00.616
Of course, you wouldn't learn very much,
