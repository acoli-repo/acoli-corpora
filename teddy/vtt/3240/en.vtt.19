00:09:29.596 --> 00:09:31.311
and that software is also free,

00:09:31.335 --> 00:09:35.723
and it's been downloaded from our website
30,000 times in the past two years.

00:09:36.328 --> 00:09:41.307
And hundreds of labs have written us
about discoveries that they've made

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:42.774
using this approach.

00:09:42.798 --> 00:09:46.358
Today, this technology is being used
to make a human cell atlas.

00:09:46.382 --> 00:09:49.736
It will be an atlas of all
of the cell types in the human body

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.440
and the specific genes
that each cell type uses to do its job.

00:09:56.133 --> 00:09:59.009
Now I want to tell you about
a second challenge that we face

00:09:59.033 --> 00:10:01.481
in trying to turn the brain
into a big data problem.
