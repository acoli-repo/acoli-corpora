00:12:28.204 --> 00:12:30.003
it's called "C4" for short --

00:12:31.036 --> 00:12:34.925
comes in dozens of different forms
in different people's genomes,

00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:38.146
and these different forms
make different amounts

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.412
of C4 protein in our brains.

00:12:40.957 --> 00:12:44.942
And he found that the more
C4 protein our genes make,

00:12:44.966 --> 00:12:47.078
the greater our risk for schizophrenia.

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:52.826
Now, C4 is still just one risk factor
in a complex system.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.839
This isn't big B,

00:12:54.863 --> 00:12:58.420
but it's an insight about
a molecule that matters.

00:12:59.492 --> 00:13:03.129
Complement proteins like C4
were known for a long time
