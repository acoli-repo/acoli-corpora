00:10:29.999 --> 00:10:34.945
And these recipes vary
from person to person to person

00:10:34.969 --> 00:10:38.311
in ways that cause the proteins
to vary from person to person

00:10:38.335 --> 00:10:40.122
in their precise sequence

00:10:40.146 --> 00:10:43.297
and in how much each cell type
makes of each protein.

00:10:44.441 --> 00:10:47.834
It's all encoded in our DNA,
and it's all genetics,

00:10:47.858 --> 00:10:50.675
but it's not the genetics
that we learned about in school.

00:10:51.572 --> 00:10:53.555
Do you remember big B, little b?

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.660
If you inherit big B, you get brown eyes?

00:10:57.085 --> 00:10:58.308
It's simple.

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:02.624
Very few traits are that simple.
