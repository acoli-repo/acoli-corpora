00:04:10.526 --> 00:04:14.792
We need to learn which of our cells

and which molecules in those cells

And that's the mission
I want to tell you about today.

00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:26.590
My lab develops technologies
with which we try to turn the brain

00:04:26.614 --> 00:04:28.314
into a big-data problem.

00:04:28.338 --> 00:04:31.874
You see, before I became a biologist,
I worked in computers and math,
