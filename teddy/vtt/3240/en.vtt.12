00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:02.779
Now, we know many
important things about cell types.

00:06:02.803 --> 00:06:05.554
They can differ dramatically
in size and shape.

00:06:05.578 --> 00:06:09.713
One will respond to a molecule
that the other doesn't respond to,

00:06:09.737 --> 00:06:11.531
they'll make different molecules.

00:06:11.555 --> 00:06:14.076
But science has largely
been reaching these insights

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.043
in an ad hoc way, one cell type at a time,

00:06:17.067 --> 00:06:18.553
one molecule at a time.

00:06:19.854 --> 00:06:24.585
We wanted to make it possible to learn
all of this quickly and systematically.

00:06:25.673 --> 00:06:27.421
Now, until recently, it was the case

00:06:27.445 --> 00:06:30.521
that if you wanted to inventory
all of the molecules
