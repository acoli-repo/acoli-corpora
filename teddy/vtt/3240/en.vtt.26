Complement proteins like C4
were known for a long time

00:13:03.153 --> 00:13:05.106
for their roles in the immune system,

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.908
where they act as a kind of
molecular Post-it note

00:13:07.932 --> 00:13:09.512
that says, "Eat me."

00:13:10.475 --> 00:13:13.142
And that Post-it note
gets put on lots of debris

00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:15.523
and dead cells in our bodies

00:13:15.547 --> 00:13:18.037
and invites immune cells
to eliminate them.

00:13:18.779 --> 00:13:22.318
But two colleagues of mine found
that the C4 Post-it note

00:13:23.183 --> 00:13:26.481
also gets put on synapses in the brain

00:13:26.505 --> 00:13:28.369
and prompts their elimination.

00:13:29.154 --> 00:13:32.420
Now, the creation and elimination
of synapses is a normal part
