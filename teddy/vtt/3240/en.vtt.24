who contributed their DNA
to genetic research on schizophrenia.

00:12:02.406 --> 00:12:04.502
It had been known for several years

00:12:04.526 --> 00:12:08.637
that the human genome's largest influence
on risk of schizophrenia

00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:10.463
comes from a part of the genome

00:12:10.487 --> 00:12:13.831
that encodes many of the molecules
in our immune system.

00:12:13.855 --> 00:12:16.889
But it wasn't clear which gene
was responsible.

00:12:17.746 --> 00:12:21.786
A scientist in my lab developed
a new way to analyze DNA with computers,

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.905
and he discovered something
very surprising.

00:12:24.929 --> 00:12:28.180
He found that a gene called
"complement component 4" --

00:12:28.204 --> 00:12:30.003
it's called "C4" for short --
