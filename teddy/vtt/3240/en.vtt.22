Very few traits are that simple.

00:11:03.232 --> 00:11:07.957
Even eye color is shaped by much more
than a single pigment molecule.

00:11:08.861 --> 00:11:13.111
And something as complex
as the function of our brains

00:11:13.135 --> 00:11:16.382
is shaped by the interaction
of thousands of genes.

00:11:16.406 --> 00:11:18.746
And each of these genes
varies meaningfully

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.608
from person to person to person,

00:11:20.632 --> 00:11:24.149
and each of us is a unique
combination of that variation.

00:11:25.419 --> 00:11:27.635
It's a big data opportunity.

00:11:28.214 --> 00:11:31.390
And today, it's increasingly
possible to make progress
