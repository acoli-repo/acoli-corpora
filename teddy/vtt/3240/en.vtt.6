00:02:57.767 --> 00:03:01.222
and they're the cause of so many
tragedies harder to measure:

00:03:01.246 --> 00:03:03.684
lost relationships and connections,

00:03:03.708 --> 00:03:06.747
missed opportunities
to pursue dreams and ideas.

00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:10.538
These illnesses limit human possibilities

00:03:10.562 --> 00:03:12.716
in ways we simply cannot measure.

00:03:15.493 --> 00:03:19.509
We live in an era in which
there's profound medical progress

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.344
on so many other fronts.

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:23.915
My sister's cancer story
is a great example,

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.001
and we could say the same
of heart disease.

00:03:26.025 --> 00:03:29.610
Drugs like statins will prevent
millions of heart attacks and strokes.
