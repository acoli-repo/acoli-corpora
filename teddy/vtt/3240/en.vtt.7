When you look at these areas
of profound medical progress

00:03:34.016 --> 00:03:35.480
in our lifetimes,

00:03:35.504 --> 00:03:37.178
they have a narrative in common:

00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:42.615
scientists discovered molecules
that matter to an illness,

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:47.318
they developed ways to detect
and measure those molecules in the body,

00:03:48.492 --> 00:03:51.270
and they developed ways
to interfere with those molecules

00:03:51.294 --> 00:03:53.342
using other molecules -- medicines.

00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:57.941
It's a strategy that has worked
again and again and again.

00:03:59.403 --> 00:04:03.045
But when it comes to the brain,
that strategy has been limited,
