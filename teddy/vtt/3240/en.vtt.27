Now, the creation and elimination
of synapses is a normal part

00:13:32.444 --> 00:13:34.298
of human development and learning.

00:13:34.322 --> 00:13:37.243
Our brains create and eliminate
synapses all the time.

00:13:37.921 --> 00:13:40.881
But our genetic results suggest
that in schizophrenia,

00:13:40.905 --> 00:13:44.138
the elimination process
may go into overdrive.

00:13:45.185 --> 00:13:49.114
Scientists at many drug companies tell me
they're excited about this discovery,

00:13:49.138 --> 00:13:52.377
because they've been working
on complement proteins for years

00:13:52.401 --> 00:13:53.941
in the immune system,

00:13:53.965 --> 00:13:56.171
and they've learned a lot
about how they work.

00:13:56.885 --> 00:14:00.779
They've even developed molecules
that interfere with complement proteins,
