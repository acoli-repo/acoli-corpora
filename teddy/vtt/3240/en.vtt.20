00:09:59.033 --> 00:10:01.481
in trying to turn the brain
into a big data problem.

00:10:01.505 --> 00:10:04.784
And that challenge is that
we'd like to learn from the brains

00:10:04.808 --> 00:10:07.252
of hundreds of thousands of living people.

00:10:07.998 --> 00:10:11.702
But our brains are not physically
accessible while we're living.

00:10:12.895 --> 00:10:16.855
But how can we discover molecular factors
if we can't hold the molecules?

00:10:18.352 --> 00:10:22.900
An answer comes from the fact that
the most informative molecules, proteins,

00:10:22.924 --> 00:10:24.706
are encoded in our DNA,

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:29.260
which has the recipes our cells follow
to make all of our proteins.

00:10:29.999 --> 00:10:34.945
And these recipes vary
from person to person to person
