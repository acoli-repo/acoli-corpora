Genetics and single-cell analysis
are just two ways

00:15:01.586 --> 00:15:05.353
of trying to turn the brain
into a big data problem.

00:15:06.424 --> 00:15:08.583
There is so much more we can do.

00:15:09.235 --> 00:15:12.309
Scientists in my lab
are creating a technology

00:15:12.333 --> 00:15:15.529
for quickly mapping the synaptic
connections in the brain

00:15:15.553 --> 00:15:18.491
to tell which neurons are talking
to which other neurons

00:15:18.515 --> 00:15:22.511
and how that conversation changes
throughout life and during illness.

00:15:23.467 --> 00:15:27.987
And we're developing a way
to test in a single tube

00:15:28.011 --> 00:15:30.729
how cells with hundreds
of different people's genomes
