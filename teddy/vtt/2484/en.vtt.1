00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.960
and no one had really even run against her
in a Democratic primary.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.536
But in my mind, this was my way

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.056
to make a difference,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.200
to disrupt the status quo.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.320
The polls, however,
told a very different story.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.136
My pollsters told me
that I was crazy to run,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.080
that there was no way that I could win.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.096
But I ran anyway,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.296
and in 2012, I became an upstart
in a New York City congressional race.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.400
I swore I was going to win.
