00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.400
I swore I was going to win.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.616
I had the endorsement
from the New York Daily News,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.976
the Wall Street Journal
snapped pictures of me on election day,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.600
and CNBC called it one of the hottest
races in the country.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.696
I raised money from everyone I knew,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.616
including Indian aunties

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.360
that were just so happy
an Indian girl was running.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.416
But on election day, the polls were right,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.480
and I only got 19 percent of the vote,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.656
and the same papers
that said I was a rising political star

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.096
now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars
