00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.096
now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.136
on 6,321 votes.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.440
Don't do the math.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.480
It was humiliating.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.976
Now, before you get the wrong idea,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.440
this is not a talk
about the importance of failure.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.680
Nor is it about leaning in.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.616
I tell you the story
of how I ran for Congress

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.096
because I was 33 years old

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.856
and it was the first time
in my entire life
