00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.440
"Professor, there's something
wrong with me."

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.816
We have to begin to undo
the socialization of perfection,

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.456
but we've got to combine it
with building a sisterhood

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.320
that lets girls know
that they are not alone.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.040
Because trying harder
is not going to fix a broken system.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.936
I can't tell you how many women tell me,

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.736
"I'm afraid to raise my hand,

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.896
I'm afraid to ask a question,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.296
because I don't want to be the only one

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.760
who doesn't understand,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.040
the only one who is struggling.
