00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.016
The teacher will look at her screen,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.920
and she'll see a blank text editor.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.456
If she didn't know any better,
she'd think that her student

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.560
spent the past 20 minutes
just staring at the screen.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.576
But if she presses undo a few times,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.320
she'll see that her student
wrote code and then deleted it.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.096
She tried, she came close,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.200
but she didn't get it exactly right.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.656
Instead of showing
the progress that she made,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.640
she'd rather show nothing at all.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.000
Perfection or bust.
