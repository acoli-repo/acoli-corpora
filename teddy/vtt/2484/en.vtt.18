socialized to be imperfect,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.193
who have learned to keep trying,
who have learned perseverance.

00:09:07.217 --> 00:09:09.216
And whether they become coders

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.896
or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé,

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.240
they will not defer their dreams.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.440
And those dreams have never been
more important for our country.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.456
For the American economy,
for any economy to grow,

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.616
to truly innovate,

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.840
we cannot leave behind
half our population.
