00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.695
So a few years ago,

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.656
I did something really brave,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.360
or some would say really stupid.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.160
I ran for Congress.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.776
For years, I had existed
safely behind the scenes in politics

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.856
as a fundraiser, as an organizer,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.080
but in my heart, I always wanted to run.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.136
The sitting congresswoman
had been in my district since 1992.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.056
She had never lost a race,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.960
and no one had really even run against her
in a Democratic primary.
