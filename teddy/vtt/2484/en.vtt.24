We own the Internet,

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.816

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.016
And I think when companies
have diverse teams,

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.456
and they have incredible women

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.896
they build awesome things,
and we see it every day.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.656
