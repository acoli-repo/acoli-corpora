00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.856
and it was the first time
in my entire life

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.536
that I had done something
that was truly brave,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.240
where I didn't worry about being perfect.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.096
And I'm not alone:

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.856
so many women I talk to tell me

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.776
that they gravitate
towards careers and professions

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.896
that they know
they're going to be great in,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.296
that they know they're
going to be perfect in,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.136
and it's no wonder why.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.216
Most girls are taught
to avoid risk and failure.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.016
We're taught to smile pretty,

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.560
play it safe, get all A's.
