00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.256
So in 2012, I started a company
to teach girls to code,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.336
and what I found
is that by teaching them to code

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.520
I had socialized them to be brave.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.456
Coding, it's an endless process
of trial and error,

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.656
of trying to get the right command
in the right place,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.096
with sometimes just a semicolon

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.440
making the difference
between success and failure.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.336
Code breaks and then it falls apart,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.776
and it often takes many, many tries

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.096
until that magical moment
