00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.936
This year we'll teach 40,000
in all 50 states.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.216
(Applause)

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.296
And that number is really powerful,

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:12.616
because last year we only graduated
7,500 women in computer science.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.216
Like, the problem is so bad

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.720
that we can make
that type of change quickly.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.816
CA: And you're working with some
of the companies in this room even,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.016
who are welcoming
graduates from your program?

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.016
RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners,

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.096
from Twitter to Facebook

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.616
to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft
to Pixar to Disney,
