00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.256
in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.840
and pretty much everywhere you look.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.176
In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.856
looked at how bright fifth graders
handled an assignment

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.480
that was too difficult for them.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.176
She found that bright girls
were quick to give up.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.920
The higher the IQ,
the more likely they were to give up.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.256
Bright boys, on the other hand,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.976
found the difficult material
to be a challenge.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.736
They found it energizing.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.960
They were more likely
to redouble their efforts.
