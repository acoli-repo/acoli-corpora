Perfection or bust.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.200
It turns out that our girls
are really good at coding,

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.031
but it's not enough
just to teach them to code.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.911
My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor
at the University of Columbia

00:07:13.935 --> 00:07:15.696
and teaches intro to Java

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.400
tells me about his office hours
with computer science students.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.376
When the guys are struggling
with an assignment,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.976
they'll come in and they'll say,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.360
"Professor, there's something
wrong with my code."

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.376
The girls will come in and say,

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.440
"Professor, there's something
wrong with me."
