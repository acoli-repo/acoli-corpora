Some of my most wonderful memories of childhood

00:00:03.417 --> 00:00:06.968
are of spending time with my grandmother, Mamar,

00:00:06.968 --> 00:00:10.768
in our four-family home in Brooklyn, New York.

00:00:10.768 --> 00:00:13.843

00:00:13.843 --> 00:00:15.888
It was a place where I could sneak a cup of coffee,

00:00:15.888 --> 00:00:19.769
which was really warm milk 
with just a touch of caffeine.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.303
She loved life.

00:00:22.303 --> 00:00:24.798
And although she worked in a factory,

00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:27.970
she saved her pennies and she traveled to Europe.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.299
And I remember poring over those pictures with her
