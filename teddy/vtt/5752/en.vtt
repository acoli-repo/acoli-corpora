00:00:00.246 --> 00:00:01.704
"Always wear sunscreen."

00:00:01.746 --> 00:00:03.079
"Eat a balanced diet."

00:00:03.079 --> 00:00:04.954
"A penny saved is a penny earned."

00:00:04.996 --> 00:00:07.788
You probably all learned
these lessons as a kid,

00:00:07.788 --> 00:00:09.163
maybe from your parents,

00:00:09.163 --> 00:00:12.329
or if you grew up in the '80s,
on the public service announcements

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:15.413
at the end of every episode
of the G.I. Joe cartoons.

00:00:15.454 --> 00:00:18.204
But chances are, despite knowing this,

00:00:18.246 --> 00:00:21.038
you still stepped outside
without putting on sunscreen,

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.621
devoured an entire bag of chips in one go

00:00:23.663 --> 00:00:26.663
or spent way more of your paycheck
than you anticipated.

00:00:26.704 --> 00:00:28.204
So why is that?

00:00:28.704 --> 00:00:30.996
