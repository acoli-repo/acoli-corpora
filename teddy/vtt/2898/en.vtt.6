00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:02.745
And, we almost never saw a reef hit zero.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.776
The second time I cried underwater

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.210
was on the north shore of Curaçao, 2011.

00:03:10.234 --> 00:03:11.918
It was the calmest day of the year,

00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:14.311
but it's always pretty
sketchy diving there.

00:03:14.335 --> 00:03:16.431
My boyfriend and I swam against the waves.

00:03:16.455 --> 00:03:19.129
I watched my compass
so we could find our way back out,

00:03:19.153 --> 00:03:20.783
and he watched for sharks,

00:03:20.807 --> 00:03:23.663
and after 20 minutes of swimming
that felt like an hour,

00:03:23.687 --> 00:03:25.403
we finally dropped down to the reef,

00:03:25.427 --> 00:03:26.986
and I was so shocked,

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.656
and I was so happy

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.675
that my eyes filled with tears.
