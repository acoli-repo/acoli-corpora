00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:32.482
Caribbean reefs met one of three fates.

00:02:32.954 --> 00:02:35.200
Some reefs lost their corals very quickly.

00:02:37.245 --> 00:02:40.689
Some reefs lost their corals more slowly,

00:02:40.713 --> 00:02:43.706
but kind of ended up in the same place.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.667
OK, so far this is not going very well.

00:02:46.244 --> 00:02:48.507
But some reefs in the Caribbean --

00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:50.424
the ones best protected

00:02:50.448 --> 00:02:53.162
and the ones a little
further from humans --

00:02:53.186 --> 00:02:56.727
they managed to hold onto their corals.

00:02:57.407 --> 00:02:58.890
Give us a challenge.
