00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:00.274
except ...

00:02:00.298 --> 00:02:02.237
over in the Caribbean where I work,

00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:04.339
we've already been through the nosedive.

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:08.643
Reefs there have suffered
through centuries of intense human abuse.

00:02:08.944 --> 00:02:11.127
We kind of already know
how the story goes.

00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:15.289
And we might be able to help predict
what happens next.

00:02:15.954 --> 00:02:17.529
Let's consult a graph.

00:02:20.622 --> 00:02:22.003
Since the invention of scuba,

00:02:22.027 --> 00:02:25.008
scientists have measured
the amount of coral on the seafloor,

00:02:25.032 --> 00:02:26.698
and how it's changed through time.

00:02:27.396 --> 00:02:29.857
And after centuries
of ratcheting human pressure,

00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:32.482
Caribbean reefs met one of three fates.
