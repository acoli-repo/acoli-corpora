and the clear bleached tissue
that's left usually starves to death

00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:36.069
and then rots away.

00:01:37.124 --> 00:01:39.487

This is happening

00:01:42.308 --> 00:01:46.444
The Northern Great Barrier Reef

over a distance of hundreds of miles,

00:01:49.047 --> 00:01:50.849

00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:00.274
