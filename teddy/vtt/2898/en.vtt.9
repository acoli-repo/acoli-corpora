00:04:34.352 --> 00:04:36.965
This coral lost half of its skin.

00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:41.216
But if you look at the side
of this coral a few years later,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.588
this coral is actually healthy again.

00:04:43.612 --> 00:04:45.909
It's doing what a healthy coral does.

00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:48.031
It's making copies of its polyps,

00:04:48.055 --> 00:04:49.510

and it's reclaiming its territory.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.540
If a few polyps survive,

00:04:53.564 --> 00:04:54.737
a coral can regrow;

00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:58.866
it just needs time and protection
and a reasonable temperature.

00:04:59.368 --> 00:05:01.177
Some corals can regrow in 10 years --
