00:00:00.926 --> 00:00:03.350
The first time I cried underwater

00:00:03.374 --> 00:00:04.917
was in 2008,

00:00:04.941 --> 00:00:06.518
the island of CuraÃ§ao,

00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:08.424
way down in the southern Caribbean.

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:10.500
It's beautiful there.

00:00:10.524 --> 00:00:13.450
I was studying these corals for my PhD,

00:00:13.474 --> 00:00:15.856
and after days and days
of diving on the same reef,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.909
I had gotten to know them as individuals.

00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.404
I had made friends with coral colonies --

00:00:20.428 --> 00:00:22.182
totally a normal thing to do.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.956
Then, Hurricane Omar smashed them apart
and ripped off their skin,

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.469
leaving little bits of wounded tissue
that would have a hard time healing,
