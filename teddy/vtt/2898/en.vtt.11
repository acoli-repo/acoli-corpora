We try to understand
how corals make babies,

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:34.923
and how those babies
find their way to the reef,

00:05:34.947 --> 00:05:37.249
and we invent new methods
to help them survive

00:05:37.273 --> 00:05:39.206
those early, fragile life stages.

00:05:40.084 --> 00:05:43.085
One of my favorite
coral babies of all time

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:45.119
showed up right after Hurricane Omar.

00:05:45.143 --> 00:05:47.834
It's the same species
I was studying before the storm,

00:05:47.858 --> 00:05:50.290
but you almost never see
babies of this species --

00:05:50.314 --> 00:05:51.529
it's really rare.

00:05:51.553 --> 00:05:53.867
This is actually an endangered species.

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:57.895
In this photo, this little baby coral,
this little circle of polyps,

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.343
is a few years old.

00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:01.265
Like its cousins that bleach,
