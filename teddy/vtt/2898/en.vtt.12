00:05:59.796 --> 00:06:01.265
Like its cousins that bleach,

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.125
it's fighting back the algae.

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:05.074
And like its cousins on the north shore,

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:08.139
it's aiming to live for 1,000 years.

00:06:09.198 --> 00:06:12.048
What's happening in the world
and in the ocean

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:13.870
has changed our time horizon.

00:06:14.637 --> 00:06:17.676
We can be incredibly pessimistic

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.704
and what we really took for granted.

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:24.958
But we can still be optimistic
on the long term,

00:06:24.982 --> 00:06:27.460
and we can still be ambitious
about what we fight for

00:06:27.484 --> 00:06:30.582
and what we expect from our governments,
