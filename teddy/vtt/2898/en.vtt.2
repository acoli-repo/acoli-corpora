00:00:58.832 --> 00:01:00.379
"I cried right into my mask,"

00:01:00.403 --> 00:01:02.613
seeing the damage on the reefs.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.590
Then a scientist in Australia wrote,

00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:08.611
"I showed my students
the results of our coral surveys,

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:09.987
and we wept."

00:01:10.896 --> 00:01:13.544
Crying about corals
is having a moment, guys.

00:01:13.568 --> 00:01:14.702
(Laughter)

00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:16.670
And that's because reefs in the Pacific

00:01:16.694 --> 00:01:19.528
are losing corals faster
than we've ever seen before.

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.141
Because of climate change,

00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:23.974
the water is so hot for so long
in the summers,

00:01:23.998 --> 00:01:26.173
that these animals
can't function normally.

00:01:26.674 --> 00:01:29.702
They're spitting out the colored algae
that lives in their skin,

00:01:29.726 --> 00:01:34.791
and the clear bleached tissue
that's left usually starves to death
