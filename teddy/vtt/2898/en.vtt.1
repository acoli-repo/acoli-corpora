leaving little bits of wounded tissue
that would have a hard time healing,

00:00:32.493 --> 00:00:35.800
and big patches of dead skeleton
that would get overgrown by algae.

00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:38.405
When I saw this damage for the first time,

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:40.239
stretching all the way down the reef,

00:00:40.263 --> 00:00:42.120
I sunk onto the sand in my scuba gear

00:00:42.144 --> 00:00:43.540
and I cried.

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:45.921
If a coral could die that fast,

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.834
how could a reef ever survive?

00:00:48.354 --> 00:00:51.313
And why was I making it my job
to try to fight for them?

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:54.884
I never heard another scientist
tell that kind of story

00:00:54.908 --> 00:00:56.274
until last year.

00:00:56.803 --> 00:00:58.808
A scientist in Guam wrote,

00:00:58.832 --> 00:01:00.379
"I cried right into my mask,"
