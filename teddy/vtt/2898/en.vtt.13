00:06:27.484 --> 00:06:30.582
and what we expect from our governments,

00:06:30.606 --> 00:06:31.897
from our planet.

00:06:32.544 --> 00:06:36.274
Corals have been living on planet Earth
for hundreds of millions of years.

00:06:36.298 --> 00:06:38.491
They survived the extinction
of the dinosaurs.

00:06:38.515 --> 00:06:39.780
They're badasses.

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:41.846
(Laughter)

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.409
An individual coral can go through
tremendous trauma and fully recover

00:06:46.433 --> 00:06:49.219
if it's given a chance
and it's given protection.

00:06:50.222 --> 00:06:53.051
Corals have always
been playing the long game,

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:55.141
and now so are we.

00:06:55.792 --> 00:06:56.945
Thanks very much.

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:59.817
(Applause)
