00:03:59.912 --> 00:04:01.566
Some will be ragged on the edge,

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.479
some will be beautiful.

00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:06.782
And by protecting shorelines
and giving us food to eat

00:04:06.806 --> 00:04:08.555
and supporting tourism,

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.701
they will still be worth
billions and billions of dollars a year.

00:04:12.223 --> 00:04:14.814
The best time to protect a reef
was 50 years ago,

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:17.756
but the second-best time is right now.

00:04:19.295 --> 00:04:21.246
Even as we go through bleaching events,

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.813
more frequent and in more places,

00:04:23.837 --> 00:04:26.112
some corals will be able to recover.

00:04:26.972 --> 00:04:29.824
We had a bleaching event
in 2010 in the Caribbean

00:04:29.848 --> 00:04:33.433
that took off big patches of skin
on boulder corals like these.
