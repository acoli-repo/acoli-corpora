Some corals can regrow in 10 years --

00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:02.924
others take a lot longer.

00:05:02.948 --> 00:05:05.599
But the more stresses
we take off them locally --

00:05:05.623 --> 00:05:09.617
things like overfishing,
sewage pollution, fertilizer pollution,

00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:12.086
dredging, coastal construction --

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.980
the better they can hang on
as we stabilize the climate,

00:05:15.004 --> 00:05:16.814
and the faster they can regrow.

00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:21.684
And as we go through the long,
tough and necessary process

00:05:21.708 --> 00:05:24.313
of stabilizing the climate
of planet Earth,

00:05:24.337 --> 00:05:26.767
some new corals will still be born.

00:05:27.323 --> 00:05:29.230
This is what I study in my research.

00:05:29.678 --> 00:05:32.225
We try to understand
how corals make babies,
