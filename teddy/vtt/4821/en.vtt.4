00:01:57.722 --> 00:02:00.401
traveling at 5% of the speed of light

00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:06.123
should be able to replicate throughout
our galaxy in 4 million years or less.

00:02:06.123 --> 00:02:07.972
That may sound like a long time,

00:02:07.972 --> 00:02:11.554
but when you consider that our universe
is 14 billion years old,

00:02:11.554 --> 00:02:14.323
on a cosmic scale, it's incredibly fast -

00:02:14.323 --> 00:02:19.763
the equivalent of about 2.5 hours
in an entire year.

00:02:19.763 --> 00:02:23.253
Creating von Neumann machines
would require a few technologies

00:02:23.253 --> 00:02:24.893
we don't have yet,

00:02:24.893 --> 00:02:27.054
including advanced 
artificial intelligence,

00:02:27.054 --> 00:02:28.554
miniaturization,

00:02:28.554 --> 00:02:30.793
and better propulsion systems.
