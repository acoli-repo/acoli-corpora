writes about a universe in which
many different von Neumann machines exist

00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:35.193
and proliferate simultaneously.

00:03:35.193 --> 00:03:38.274
Some are designed 
to greet young civilizations,

00:03:38.274 --> 00:03:41.855
others to locate and destroy them
before they become a threat.

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:44.825
In fact, in Brin's story "Lungfish,"

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:50.375
some von Neumann machines are keeping
a close watch over the Earth right now,

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:53.198
waiting for us to reach a certain level
of sophistication

00:03:53.198 --> 00:03:55.739
before they make their move.

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.026
For now, all we have is curiosity 
and theory.

00:03:59.026 --> 00:04:01.140
But the next time 
you look at the night sky,
