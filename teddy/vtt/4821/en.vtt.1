00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:34.016
So far we've sent a single spacecraft
outside our solar system,

00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:39.209
trudging along at 0.006% of 
the speed of light.

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:42.615
At that rate, it would take over 
2.5 billion years

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:45.759
just to get from one end of the galaxy
to the other.

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:48.329
And then there's the question 
of human survival.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.460
The gulf between stars is simply enormous.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.169
We couldn't live sustainably 
on most planets,

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:57.880
and we require a lot of resources
to stay alive.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.880
And yet, decades ago, scholars found
that it's theoretically possible
