Some astronomers, like Carl Sagan,

00:03:01.075 --> 00:03:06.032
say that intelligent aliens wouldn't
build self-replicating machines at all.

00:03:06.032 --> 00:03:07.770
They might hurtle out of control,

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.521
scavenging planets to their cores
in order to keep replicating.

00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:13.730
Others take the machines absence as proof

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.115
that intelligent alien civilizations 
don't exist,

00:03:17.115 --> 00:03:21.684
or that they go extinct before they can
develop the necessary technologies.

00:03:21.684 --> 00:03:25.056
But all this hasn't stopped people from
imagining what it would be like

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:27.097
if they were out there.

00:03:27.097 --> 00:03:28.865
Science fiction author David Brin

00:03:28.865 --> 00:03:33.006
writes about a universe in which
many different von Neumann machines exist
