00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.880
And yet, decades ago, scholars found
that it's theoretically possible

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.181
to not just spread human civilization
across the galaxy,

00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:07.610
but to do so quite quickly,

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.980
without breaking any known 
laws of physics.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.139
Their idea is based on the work
of a mathematician named John von Neumann,

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:18.890
who designed on paper machines 
that could self-replicate

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.679
and create new generations of themselves.

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.570
These would later come to be known
as von Neumann machines.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.532
In the context of space exploration,

00:01:27.532 --> 00:01:30.041
von Neumann machines could be
built on Earth
