00:02:28.554 --> 00:02:30.793
and better propulsion systems.

00:02:30.793 --> 00:02:34.253
If we wanted to use them to spread actual
humans throughout the galaxy,

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:37.013
we would need 
yet another technological leap -

00:02:37.013 --> 00:02:41.599
the ability to artificially 
grow biological organisms and bodies

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.933
using raw elements 
and genetic information.

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:47.432
Regardless, if in the last billion years

00:02:47.432 --> 00:02:50.221
an alien civilization 
created such a machine

00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:53.124
and set it multiplying its way toward us,

00:02:53.124 --> 00:02:56.373
our galaxy would be 
swarming with them by now.

00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:58.978
So then where are all these machines?

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:01.075
Some astronomers, like Carl Sagan,
