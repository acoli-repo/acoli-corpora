00:01:27.532 --> 00:01:30.041
von Neumann machines could be
built on Earth

00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:32.182
and launched into space.

00:01:32.182 --> 00:01:36.242
There, the self-sufficient machines
would land on distant planets.

00:01:36.242 --> 00:01:40.442
They would then mine the available
resources and harvest energy,

00:01:40.442 --> 00:01:42.691
build replicas of themselves,

00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:44.632
launch those to the nearest planets,

00:01:44.632 --> 00:01:46.451
and continue the cycle.

00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:49.492
The result is the creation 
of millions of probes

00:01:49.492 --> 00:01:54.112
spreading outwards into the universe
like a drop of ink in a fishbowl.

00:01:54.112 --> 00:01:57.722
Scholars crunched the numbers and found
that a single von Neumann machine

00:01:57.722 --> 00:02:00.401
traveling at 5% of the speed of light
