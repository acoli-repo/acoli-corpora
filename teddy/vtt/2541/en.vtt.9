All of us have these experiences.
We learn things every day, every minute

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.536
about what we love, what we hate,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.560
what we're good at,
what we're terrible at.

00:04:35.584 --> 00:04:37.976
And if we don't spend time
paying attention to that

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.536
and assimilating that learning

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.536
and applying it to the rest of our lives,
it's all for nothing.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.216
Every day, every week,
every month of every year

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.696
I spend some time
just reflecting on what went right,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.863
what went wrong,
and what do I want to repeat,

00:04:49.887 --> 00:04:51.463
what can I apply more to my life.

00:04:51.487 --> 00:04:54.576
And even more so than that,
as you see people, especially today,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.981
who inspire you, who are doing
things where you say

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:59.936
"Oh God, what Jeff is doing,
I want to be like him."

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.681
Why are you saying that?
