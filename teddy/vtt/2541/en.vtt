00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.256
Wow, what an honor. I always wondered
what this would feel like.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.055
So eight years ago,
I got the worst career advice of my life.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.536
I had a friend tell me,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.496
"Don't worry about how much
you like the work you're doing now.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.536
It's all about just building your resume."

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.216
And I'd just come back
from living in Spain for a while,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.574
and I'd joined this Fortune 500 company.
I thought, "This is fantastic.

00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:22.614
I'm going to have
big impact on the world."

00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:25.336
I had all these ideas.
And within about two months,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.360
I noticed at about 10am every morning
I had this strange urge

00:00:28.384 --> 00:00:31.936
to want to slam my head
through the monitor of my computer.
