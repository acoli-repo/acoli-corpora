00:05:27.324 --> 00:05:30.456
that everybody seems to be living
going up this ladder to nowhere.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.136
It's kind of like in Wall Street 2,
if anybody saw that,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.976
the peon employee asks
the big Wall Street banker CEO,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.136
"What's your number?
Everyone's got a number,

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.696
where if they make this money,
they'll leave it all."

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.240
He says, "Oh, it's simple. More."

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.416
And he just smiles.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.216
And it's the sad state
of most of the people

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.776
that haven't spent time
understanding what matters for them,

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.536
who keep reaching for something
that doesn't mean anything to us,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.056
but we're doing it because everyone
said we're supposed to.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.816
But once we have this framework together,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.456
we can start to identify
the things that make us come alive.
