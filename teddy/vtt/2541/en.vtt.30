00:14:58.319 --> 00:15:01.016
in a month where more people
had quit their jobs

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.376
than had been laid off.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.616
They thought this was an anomaly,
but it's happened three months straight.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.336
In a time where people claim
it's kind of a tough environment,

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.696
people are giving a middle finger
to this scripted life,

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.776
the things that people
say you're supposed to do,

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.536
in exchange for things that matter to them
and do the things that inspire them.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.336
And the thing is, people
are waking up to this possibility,

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:25.336
that really the only thing that limits
possibility now is imagination.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.336
That's not a cliché anymore.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.536
I don't care what it is that you're into,
what passion, what hobby.
