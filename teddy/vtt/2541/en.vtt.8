And the Strengths Finder 2.0
is a book and also an online tool.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.616
I highly recommend it for sorting out
what it is that you're naturally good at.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.056
And next, what's our framework
or our hierarchy for making decisions?

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.296
Do we care about the people,
our family, health,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.456
or is it achievement, success,
all this stuff?

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.147
We have to figure out what it is
to make these decisions,

00:04:18.171 --> 00:04:19.896
so we know what our soul is made of,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.616
so that we don't go selling it
to some cause we don't give a shit about.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.336
And then the next step is our experiences.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.816
All of us have these experiences.
We learn things every day, every minute
