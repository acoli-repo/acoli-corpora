00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.608
So I wanted to find out,
what is it that sets these people apart,

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:32.968
the people who do the passionate,
world-changing work,

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:34.616
that wake up inspired every day,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.416
and then these people,
the other 80 percent

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.496

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.616
and I read books and did case studies,

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.336
300 books altogether
on purpose and career and all this,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.680

really for the selfish reason of --

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.736
I wanted to find the work
that I couldn't not do,

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.296
what that was for me.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.962
But as I was doing this,
more and more people started to ask me,

00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:00.456
"You're into this career thing.
