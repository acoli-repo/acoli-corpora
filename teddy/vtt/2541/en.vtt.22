00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.856
They change everything,
and it's a proven fact.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.176
In 1898, Norman Triplett did this study
with a bunch of cyclists,

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.000
and he would measure their times
around the track in a group,

00:11:08.025 --> 00:11:09.176
and also individually.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.896
And he found that every time the cyclists
in the group would cycle faster.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.736
And it's been repeated
in all kinds of walks of life since then,

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.656
and it proves the same thing over again,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.536
that the people around you matter,
and environment is everything.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.136
But it's on you to control it,
because it can go both ways.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.736
With 80 percent of people
who don't like the work they do,

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.936
that means most people around us,
not in this room, but everywhere else,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.616
are encouraging complacency and keeping us
from pursuing the things that matter to us
