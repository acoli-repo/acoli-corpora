00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:31.456
There's no major in university
on passion and purpose and career.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.736
I don't know how that's not
a required double major,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.576
but don't even get me started on that.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.576
I mean, you spend more time
picking out a dorm room TV set

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.536
than you do you picking your major
and your area of study.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.176
But the point is,
it's on us to figure that out,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.416
and we need a framework,
we need a way to navigate through this.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.298
And so the first step of our compass is
finding out what our unique strengths are.

00:03:51.322 --> 00:03:54.336
What are the things that we wake up
loving to do no matter what,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.856
whether we're paid or we're not paid,
the things that people thank us for?

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.856
And the Strengths Finder 2.0
is a book and also an online tool.
