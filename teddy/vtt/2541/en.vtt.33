00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.600
the people who are in this room.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.496
Because I see it as our responsibility
to show the world

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.936
that what's seen as impossible
can become that new normal.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.136
And that's already starting to happen.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.856
First, do the things that inspire us,

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.576
so we can inspire other people
to do the things that inspire them.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.240
But we can't find that

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.256
unless we know what we're looking for.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.376
We have to do our work on ourself,

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.976
be intentional about that,
and make those discoveries.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.524
Because I imagine a world where 80 percent
of people love the work they do.
