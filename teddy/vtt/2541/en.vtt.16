Even if it's Lake Tahoe,
it's fresh water, totally unfounded fear,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.696
ridiculous, but it's there.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.216
Anyway, three years ago
I find myself on this tugboat

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.216
right down here in the San Francisco Bay.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.696
It's a rainy, stormy, windy day,
and people are getting sick on the boat,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.054
and I'm sitting there wearing a wetsuit,
and I'm looking out the window

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:18.056
in pure terror thinking
I'm about to swim to my death.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.336
I'm going to try to swim
across the Golden Gate.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.176
And my guess is some people in this room
might have done that before.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.416
I'm sitting there, and my buddy Jonathan,
who had talked me into it,

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.696
he comes up to me
and he could see the state I was in.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.456
And he says, "Scott, hey man,
what's the worst that could happen?
