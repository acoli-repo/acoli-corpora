00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.856
are climbing their way up this ladder
that someone tells them to climb,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.416
and it ends up being leaned up
against the wrong wall,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.096
or no wall at all.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.816
The more time I spent around
these people and saw this problem,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.056
I thought, what if we could
create a community,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.456
a place where people
could feel like they belonged

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.623
and that it was OK
to do things differently,

00:02:44.647 --> 00:02:47.362
to take the road less traveled,
where that was encouraged,

00:02:47.386 --> 00:02:49.936
and inspire people to change?

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.656
And that later became
what I now call Live Your Legend,

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.347
which I'll explain in a little bit.

00:02:54.371 --> 00:02:58.056
But as I've made these discoveries,
I noticed a framework

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.461
of really three simple things

00:02:59.485 --> 00:03:02.616
that all these different passionate
world-changers have in common,
