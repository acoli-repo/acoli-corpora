00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:00.456
"You're into this career thing.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.696
I don't like my job.
Can we sit down for lunch?"

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.896
I'd say, "Sure."
But I would have to warn them,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.216
because at this point,
my quit rate was also 80 percent.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.466

It was, "Why are you doing
the work that you're doing?"

00:02:20.632 --> 00:02:22.736
And so often their answer would be,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.056
"Well, because somebody
told me I'm supposed to."

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.216
And I realized that so many
people around us

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.856
are climbing their way up this ladder
that someone tells them to climb,
