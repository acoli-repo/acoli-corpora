00:09:27.278 --> 00:09:30.776
and I'm trying to just thaw my face out,
and I'm watching people finish.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.826
And I see this one kid,
something didn't look right.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.856
And he's just flailing like this.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:39.296
And he's barely able to sip some air
before he slams his head back down.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.536
And I notice other parents
were watching too,

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.016
and I swear they were thinking
the same thing I was:

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.976
this is why you don't let nine-year-olds
swim from Alcatraz.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.216
This was not fatigue.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.536
All of a sudden, two parents
run up and grab him,

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.336
and they put him on their shoulders,
and they're dragging him like this,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.216
totally limp.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.576
And then all of a sudden
they walk a few more feet

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.576
and they plop him down in his wheelchair.
