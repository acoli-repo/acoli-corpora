00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.456
we can start to identify
the things that make us come alive.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.696
You know, before this, a passion
could come and hit you in the face,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.416
or maybe in your possible line of work,
you might throw it away

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.631
because you don't have
a way of identifying it.

00:06:08.655 --> 00:06:12.191
But once you do, you can see something
that's congruent with my strengths,

00:06:12.215 --> 00:06:14.016
my values, who I am as a person,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.326
so I'm going to grab ahold of this,
I'm going to do something with it,

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.208
and I'm going to pursue it
and try to make an impact with it.

00:06:20.232 --> 00:06:22.776
And Live Your Legend
and the movement we've built

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.467
wouldn't exist if I didn't have
this compass to identify,

00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:28.736
"Wow, this is something I want to pursue
and make a difference with."

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.816
If we don't know what we're looking for,
we're never going to find it,
