00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.816
If we don't know what we're looking for,
we're never going to find it,

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.376
but once we have
this framework, this compass,

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.856
then we can move on to what's next --
and that's not me up there --

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.096
doing the impossible
and pushing our limits.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.136
There's two reasons
why people don't do things.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.136
One is they tell themselves
they can't do them,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.296
or people around them
tell them they can't do them.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.856
Either way, we start to believe it.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.256
Either we give up,
or we never start in the first place.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.176
The things is, everything was impossible
until somebody did it.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.736
Every invention,
every new thing in the world,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.427
people thought were crazy at first.

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:01.880
Roger Bannister and the four-minute mile,
it was a physical impossibility
