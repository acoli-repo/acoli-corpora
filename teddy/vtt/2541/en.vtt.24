00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.936
to help people do work that they genuinely
cared about and that inspired them,

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.296
and I was doing all I could,

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.496
and there were only
three people paying attention,

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.759
and they're all right there:
my mother, father and my wife, Chelsea.

00:12:07.783 --> 00:12:09.279
Thank you guys for the support.

00:12:09.303 --> 00:12:10.776
(Applause)

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.496
And this is how badly I wanted it,
it grew at zero percent for four years,

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.496
and I was about to shut it down,

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.216
and right about then,

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.776
I moved to San Francisco and started
to meet some pretty interesting people

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.016
who had these crazy
lifestyles of adventure,

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.056
of businesses and websites and blogs

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.336
that surrounded their passions
and helped people in a meaningful way.
