00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.576
and they plop him down in his wheelchair.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.136
And he puts his fists up in the most
insane show of victory I've ever seen.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.816
I can still feel the warmth
and the energy on this guy

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.416
when he made this accomplishment.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.416
I had seen him earlier that day
in his wheelchair.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.416
I just had no idea he was going to swim.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.536
I mean, where is he
going to be in 20 years?

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.976
How many people told him he couldn't
do that, that he would die if he tried that?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.136
You prove people wrong,
you prove yourself wrong,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.976
that you can make
little incremental pushes

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.536
of what you believe is possible.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.976
You don't have to be
the fastest marathoner in the world,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.381
just your own impossibilities,
to accomplish those,
