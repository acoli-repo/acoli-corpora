00:02:59.485 --> 00:03:02.616
that all these different passionate
world-changers have in common,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.296
whether you're a Steve Jobs
or if you're just, you know,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.376
the person that has
the bakery down the street.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.416
But you're doing work
that embodies who you are.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.336
I want to share those three with you,
so we can use them as a lens

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.027
for the rest of today
and hopefully the rest of our life.

00:03:15.051 --> 00:03:17.827
The first part of this three-step
passionate work framework

00:03:17.851 --> 00:03:20.776
is becoming a self-expert
and understanding yourself,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.456
because if you don't know
what you're looking for,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.096
you're never going to find it.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.740
And the thing is that no one
is going to do this for us.

00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:31.456
There's no major in university
on passion and purpose and career.
