Well, for four years,
I knew nobody in this space,

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.536
and I didn't even know it existed,
that people could do this stuff,

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.536
that you could have movements like this.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.216
And then I'm over here in San Francisco,
and everyone around me was doing it.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.336
It became normal, so my thinking went
from how could I possibly do this

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.176
to how could I possibly not.

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.416
And right then, when that happens,
that switch goes on in your head,

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.107
it ripples across your whole world.

00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:54.056
And without even trying,
your standards go from here to here.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.795
You don't need to change your goals.
You just need to change your surroundings.

00:13:57.819 --> 00:14:02.176
That's it, and that's why I love
being around this whole group of people,
