00:00:00.342 --> 00:00:03.101
For a long time in my life,

00:00:03.101 --> 00:00:07.692
I felt like I'd been living two different lives.

00:00:07.692 --> 00:00:11.097
There's the life that everyone sees,

00:00:11.097 --> 00:00:14.804
and then there's the life that only I see.

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:17.324
And in the life that everyone sees,

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:19.798
who I am is a friend,

00:00:19.798 --> 00:00:22.353
a son, a brother,

00:00:22.353 --> 00:00:25.979
a stand-up comedian and a teenager.

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:27.820
That's the life everyone sees.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.346
If you were to ask my friends and family to describe me,

00:00:29.346 --> 00:00:31.185
that's what they would tell you.
