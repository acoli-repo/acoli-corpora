00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:31.185
grabbing premature babies
out of their incubators,

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:33.751
desperate to get them to safety,

00:00:33.775 --> 00:00:35.842
before she broke down in tears.

00:00:36.982 --> 00:00:38.449
And I felt devastated.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.076
Fellow humanitarians and I
have spent blood, sweat and tears

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.569
rebuilding hospitals

00:00:44.593 --> 00:00:47.193
so that our patients may live, not die.

00:00:49.238 --> 00:00:52.145
And through this work, I made a discovery.

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:56.065
The reason that people survive in crisis

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.763
is because of the remarkable work
of the people in crisis themselves.
