00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:32.013
and over 800 medical personnel
who have been killed --

00:05:32.037 --> 00:05:35.505
over 90 percent of it
by the Syrian regime --

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:38.523
and they say this is part
of a systemic targeting

00:05:38.547 --> 00:05:40.033
and destruction of health care,

00:05:40.057 --> 00:05:41.435
using it as a weapon of war.

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:44.935
And the thing with this is
that it's not just our problem,

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:46.490
it's yours, too, and everyone's,

00:05:46.514 --> 00:05:48.867
because A, it exacerbates
the refugee situation --

00:05:48.891 --> 00:05:51.019
when you have a decimated
health care system,

00:05:51.043 --> 00:05:55.143
it means the next Ebola-type
epicenter of disease is going to be Syria;

00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:57.932
and unfortunately, it sets
a very dangerous precedent

00:05:57.956 --> 00:06:01.420
that makes all of our hospitals
anywhere in the world dangerous,
