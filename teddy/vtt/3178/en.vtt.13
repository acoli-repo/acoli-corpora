00:06:29.427 --> 00:06:31.641
and it was like an absolute reciprocation.

00:06:31.665 --> 00:06:35.212
IDA and these Syrians
and many people in places of conflict

00:06:35.236 --> 00:06:37.339
feel very unheard and unseen.

00:06:37.363 --> 00:06:38.720
And I think the fact that --

00:06:38.744 --> 00:06:41.181
and they see things
through the prism of government,

00:06:41.185 --> 00:06:43.149
so when they see government's not acting,

00:06:43.173 --> 00:06:46.006
they assume everyone
who lives in those places doesn't care.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.682
So when they see that display,

00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:50.308
it really does just renew
everyone's faith in humanity.

00:06:50.683 --> 00:06:51.842
SA: Thank you, Rola.

00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:53.944
RH: Thank you.
SA: Thank you for everything.

00:06:53.968 --> 00:06:55.118
