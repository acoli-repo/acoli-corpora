WEBVTT

00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:31.347
a start-up determined
to address this imbalance

00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:33.862
and enable local responders
to provide health care

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:36.155
to their war-devastated communities.

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.470
We had devised a simple model:

00:02:39.101 --> 00:02:42.172
source trusted and impactful local groups,

00:02:42.196 --> 00:02:45.182
support their development
through an accelerator program

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:49.059
and connect them to you
via our crowdfunding platform,

00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:51.426
where they can fund-raise
for their health needs.

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.744
So when IDA asked for help,

00:02:53.768 --> 00:02:57.537
I decided to launch CanDo
seven months early,

00:02:57.561 --> 00:02:59.156
with very little money,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.292
and many people, including myself,
thought I had finally gone mad.
