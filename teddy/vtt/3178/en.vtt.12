00:05:57.956 --> 00:06:01.420
that makes all of our hospitals
anywhere in the world dangerous,

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:03.222
and that is not how it should be.

00:06:03.246 --> 00:06:05.699
SA: So this actually
isn't just about money, either,

00:06:05.723 --> 00:06:07.121
CanDo isn't just about money.

00:06:07.145 --> 00:06:10.870
Tell me what it means to you
that 5,000 people all over the world

00:06:10.894 --> 00:06:15.113
contributed 350,000 dollars
to build Hope Hospital.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.704
RH: I think the answer
is in that word, it's in hope.

00:06:19.728 --> 00:06:24.168
I think everyone who donated,
they had their faith in humanity renewed,

00:06:24.192 --> 00:06:26.863
knowing there are people like IDA
and those doctors,

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:29.403
who are exhibiting
the absolute best of humanity,

00:06:29.427 --> 00:06:31.641
and it was like an absolute reciprocation.
