00:04:28.538 --> 00:04:32.291
putting the necessary resources
in the hands of those who need them most

00:04:32.315 --> 00:04:36.053
and are best placed to use them
effectively and efficiently.

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:40.442
We need to support the people
who are not only saving lives now,

00:04:40.466 --> 00:04:44.767
but it will also be them stitching
their wounded communities back together,

00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:47.224
once a conflict is over to help them heal.

00:04:48.392 --> 00:04:52.672
Local humanitarians
have the courage to persist,

00:04:52.696 --> 00:04:54.667
to dust themselves off from the wreckage

00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:58.006
and to start again,
risking their lives to save others.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.942
And we can match their courage
by not looking away or turning our backs,
