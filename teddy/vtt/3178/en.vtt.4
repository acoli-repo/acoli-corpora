00:01:59.204 --> 00:02:01.204
I have witnessed this reality.

00:02:01.763 --> 00:02:04.337
It means those with the knowledge,
skill and ability

00:02:04.361 --> 00:02:05.866
to respond on the front lines

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.128
have little of the necessary tools,
equipment and resources

00:02:09.152 --> 00:02:10.581
they need to save lives.

00:02:11.275 --> 00:02:15.487
It means groups like IDA don't have funds
to rebuild their hospital.

00:02:16.188 --> 00:02:20.069
The humanitarian system is failing
the most vulnerable communities

00:02:20.093 --> 00:02:21.627
in their darkest hours.

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:25.450
Now, at the time
of receiving that message,

00:02:25.474 --> 00:02:27.491
I was on sabbatical from my clinical work,

00:02:27.515 --> 00:02:28.680
setting up CanDo,

00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:31.347
a start-up determined
to address this imbalance
