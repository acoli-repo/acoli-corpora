00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.763
is because of the remarkable work
of the people in crisis themselves.

00:01:01.703 --> 00:01:05.313
People survive because of the local
doctors, nurses and aid workers

00:01:05.337 --> 00:01:08.465
who are from the very heart
of the affected community,

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:12.022
the people who dare to work
where others can't or won't.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.307
People survive because
of people like Malak,

00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:20.117
who, despite sustaining a severe
burns injury in the line of duty,

00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:22.950
the first thing she did
when discharged from hospital

00:01:22.974 --> 00:01:25.172
was to go back caring for small children.

00:01:26.338 --> 00:01:29.213
From the rubble of death and devastation

00:01:29.237 --> 00:01:32.504
arise the most gallant
and noble human beings.
