(Applause)

00:04:05.282 --> 00:04:09.761
We can provide lifesaving assistance
in the most volatile places on earth.

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.872
The system needs to change,

00:04:11.896 --> 00:04:16.886
and change starts with us all
sharing a new humanitarian vision,

00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:21.815
one where you, global citizens
with skills, expertise and resources,

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:25.077
stand together with the local responders;

00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:28.514
one where we are all humanitarians,

00:04:28.538 --> 00:04:32.291
putting the necessary resources
in the hands of those who need them most
