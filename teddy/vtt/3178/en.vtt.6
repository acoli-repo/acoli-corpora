00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.292
and many people, including myself,
thought I had finally gone mad.

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:10.164
I wanted to do something
that transformed our collective anger

00:03:10.188 --> 00:03:12.196
into something beautiful.

00:03:12.704 --> 00:03:15.488
And that's how
the People's Convoy was born.

00:03:15.512 --> 00:03:17.329
It was a global crowdfunding campaign

00:03:17.353 --> 00:03:20.940
to enable IDA to rebuild
a whole new children's hospital,

00:03:20.964 --> 00:03:25.393
and, if successful, we the people
would take the medical equipment

00:03:25.417 --> 00:03:28.443
all the way from London
to the Syria border.

00:03:28.467 --> 00:03:29.883
And we did it.
