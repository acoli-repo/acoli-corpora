00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.456
acquired either from a DSLR camera
or a mobile phone, for the patient.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.936
Then remember those
billions of information packets?

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.496
We overlaid those from
the medical image onto this image,

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.040
creating something
that we call a composite image.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.776
Much to our surprise,
we only required 50 --

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.136
I repeat, only 50 --

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.000
of these composite images to train
our algorithms to high efficiencies.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.016
To summarize our approach,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.216
instead of using 10,000
very expensive medical images,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.256
we can now train the AI algorithms
in an unorthodox way,

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.536
using only 50 of these high-resolution,
but standard photographs,
