Computer algorithms today
are performing incredible tasks

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.896
with high accuracies, at a massive scale,
using human-like intelligence.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.856
And this intelligence of computers
is often referred to as AI

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.736
or artificial intelligence.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.960
AI is poised to make an incredible impact
on our lives in the future.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.816
Today, however,
we still face massive challenges

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.336
in detecting and diagnosing
several life-threatening illnesses,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.720
such as infectious diseases and cancer.
