00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.383
traditional artificial
intelligence approaches

00:02:01.407 --> 00:02:02.856
suffer from the same problem.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.440
Large amounts of data, expert physicians
and expert medical imaging technologies.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.616
So, can we invent more scalable, effective

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.936
and more valuable artificial
intelligence architectures

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.016
to solve these very important
problems facing us today?

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.336
And this is exactly
what my group at MIT Media Lab does.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.216
We have invented a variety
of unorthodox AI architectures

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.416
to solve some of the most important
challenges facing us today

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.640
in medical imaging and clinical trials.
