00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.536
using only 50 of these high-resolution,
but standard photographs,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.056
acquired from DSLR cameras
and mobile phones,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.616
and provide diagnosis.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.856
More importantly,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.016
our algorithms can accept,
in the future and even right now,

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.856
some very simple, white light
photographs from the patient,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.320
instead of expensive
medical imaging technologies.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.216
I believe that we are poised
to enter an era

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.176
where artificial intelligence

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.736
is going to make an incredible
impact on our future.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.216
And I think that thinking
about traditional AI,

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.016
which is data-rich but application-poor,
