00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.640
in medical imaging and clinical trials.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.536
In the example I shared
with you today, we had two goals.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.536
Our first goal was to reduce
the number of images

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.816
required to train
artificial intelligence algorithms.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.936
Our second goal -- we were more ambitious,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.696
we wanted to reduce the use
of expensive medical imaging technologies

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.936
to screen patients.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.160
So how did we do it?

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.136
For our first goal,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.216
instead of starting
with tens and thousands

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.256
of these very expensive medical images,
like traditional AI,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.336
we started with a single medical image.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.136
From this image, my team and I
figured out a very clever way
