00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.136
From this image, my team and I
figured out a very clever way

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.896
to extract billions
of information packets.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.616
These information packets
included colors, pixels, geometry

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.176
and rendering of the disease
on the medical image.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.536
In a sense, we converted one image
into billions of training data points,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.096
massively reducing the amount of data
needed for training.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.336
For our second goal,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.216
to reduce the use of expensive medical
imaging technologies to screen patients,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.096
we started with a standard,
white light photograph,

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.456
acquired either from a DSLR camera
or a mobile phone, for the patient.
