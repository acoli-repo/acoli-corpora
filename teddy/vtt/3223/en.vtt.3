00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.640
So, can we solve this problem
using artificial intelligence?

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.896
Today, if I were to use traditional
artificial intelligence architectures

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.136
to solve this problem,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.616
I would require 10,000 --

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.656
I repeat, on an order of 10,000
of these very expensive medical images

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.056
first to be generated.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.976
After that, I would then go
to an expert physician,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.496
who would then analyze
those images for me.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.616
And using those two pieces of information,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.296
I can train a standard deep neural network
or a deep learning network

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.456
to provide patient's diagnosis.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.216
Similar to the first approach,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.383
traditional artificial
intelligence approaches
