00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.896
very expensive
medical imaging technologies

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.016
such as fluorescent imaging,
CTs, MRIs, to be performed.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.336
Once those images are collected,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.880
another expert physician then diagnoses
those images and talks to the patient.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.976
As you can see, this is
a very resource-intensive process,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.416
requiring both expert physicians,
expensive medical imaging technologies,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.536
and is not considered practical
for the developing world.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.920
And in fact, in many
industrialized nations, as well.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.640
So, can we solve this problem
using artificial intelligence?
