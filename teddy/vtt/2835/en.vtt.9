00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.127
Unfortunately, that would be more
something an interrogation droid would do.

00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:32.373
Yoda.

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:34.052
Small little guy, like a baby.

00:04:34.076 --> 00:04:36.511
What we do is basically
treat him like a baby,

00:04:36.535 --> 00:04:40.059
in the sense that we're going to place
one pad in the center of the chest

00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:41.234
and one in the back.

00:04:41.258 --> 00:04:42.926
If we place them both in the front,

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.520
they can be too close
and cause severe arcing,

00:04:45.544 --> 00:04:47.029
so we want to avoid that.

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:49.180
Hopefully, this helped to clarify

00:04:49.204 --> 00:04:51.506
and put some light
on some of the darker issues

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.750
of using an AED in the Star Wars universe,

00:04:53.774 --> 00:04:55.238
or any universe in total.

00:04:55.262 --> 00:04:56.703
I'll leave you with one point.

00:04:56.727 --> 00:04:59.519
Remember, if you do find yourself
dealing with a Wookiee,

00:04:59.543 --> 00:05:01.191
do not shave the entire Wookiee.
