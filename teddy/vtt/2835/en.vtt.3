00:01:29.926 --> 00:01:31.451
But, the Jedi do have a problem.

00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:33.117
They have a head appendage issue.

00:01:33.141 --> 00:01:36.336
And so I can be totally clear,
thinking I'm ready to go,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.610
but I'm accidentally touching a tentacle

00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:40.545
and inadvertently shocking myself.

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:41.989
(Laughter)

00:01:42.013 --> 00:01:46.551
So before you hit that button,
make sure you are clear

00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:48.446
and everyone else is clear.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.947
Going back to that stormtrooper:

00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:53.369
If I did get that chest plate off in time,

00:01:53.393 --> 00:01:57.223
what would you do if you suddenly found
there was a Wookiee under there,

00:01:57.247 --> 00:01:59.755
or possibly two Ewoks?

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:01.130
(Laughter)
