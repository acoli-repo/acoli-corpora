Last year, I got a chance to watch
the new "Star Wars" movie,

00:00:03.588 --> 00:00:04.743
which was fantastic,

00:00:04.767 --> 00:00:06.204
but one thing kept bugging me.

00:00:06.228 --> 00:00:08.160
I don't know if you noticed this or not.

00:00:08.184 --> 00:00:10.264
In this entirely technically
advanced world,

00:00:10.288 --> 00:00:12.450
I did not see a single AED anywhere,

00:00:12.474 --> 00:00:13.882
which was totally shocking --

00:00:13.906 --> 00:00:16.227
almost as shocking
as not knowing what an AED is,

00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:17.644
which you guys do know.

00:00:17.668 --> 00:00:18.819
But for those at home,

00:00:18.843 --> 00:00:21.865
an AED is an automated
external defibrillator.

00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:24.947
It's the device you use
when your heart goes into cardiac arrest

00:00:24.971 --> 00:00:26.951
to shock it back into a normal rhythm,

00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:30.454
or, as one of the guys I was teaching
a class to referred to it as:
