00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:01.130
(Laughter)

00:02:01.154 --> 00:02:02.427
Well, lucky for us,

00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:04.651
in the kit there's actually a razor,

00:02:04.675 --> 00:02:08.230
and we can use that to shave the chest
on the upper right-hand side

00:02:08.254 --> 00:02:09.783
and the lower left.

00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:12.497
Wookiees also have another problem.

00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:13.949
They have an accessory issue.

00:02:13.973 --> 00:02:16.529
What we want to do is remove these --

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:19.968
anything between the two pads
we want to remove,

00:02:19.992 --> 00:02:22.179
since it can cause
something called "arcing."

00:02:22.203 --> 00:02:24.153
For those who don't know what arcing is,

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:25.590
do you remember the Emperor,

00:02:25.614 --> 00:02:28.350
when he shoots electricity
out the ends of his fingers --

00:02:28.374 --> 00:02:29.387
(Laughter)

00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:31.042
that would be kind of like arcing.
