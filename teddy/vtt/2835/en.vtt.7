00:03:29.556 --> 00:03:31.744
But he does love cupcakes.

00:03:31.768 --> 00:03:32.919
Speaking about Jabba,

00:03:32.943 --> 00:03:35.459
if we do have to use an AED on him,

00:03:35.483 --> 00:03:37.325
remember pad placement is the same,

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.130
even though he doesn't have nipples.

00:03:39.154 --> 00:03:42.277
So it's going to be
upper right-hand side, lower left.

00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:45.473
If we were going through, we're shocking,
getting ready to go --

00:03:45.497 --> 00:03:46.844
after we've done the shock,

00:03:46.868 --> 00:03:49.914
one of the things we need to do
is remember to do compression.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:53.570
The preferred method
is 30 compressions and two breaths

00:03:53.594 --> 00:03:56.107
in the center of the chest,
between the nipples,

00:03:56.131 --> 00:03:57.960
pressing down at least two inches,

00:03:57.984 --> 00:03:59.928
no more than two and a half,

00:03:59.952 --> 00:04:02.975
at a rate of at least 100 beats a minute,
