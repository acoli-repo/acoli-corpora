00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:30.454
or, as one of the guys I was teaching
a class to referred to it as:

00:00:30.478 --> 00:00:32.028
"The shocky-hearty-box thing."

00:00:32.052 --> 00:00:33.709
(Laughter)

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.244
But I really can't blame the Empire,

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:37.936
since health and safety regulations

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.106
aren't really their first
order of business.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.244
Though, even if we --

00:00:42.268 --> 00:00:46.107
I think worse than not having an AED
would be if there was one there,

00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:48.179
but just, no one knew where to find it.

00:00:48.203 --> 00:00:51.993
These devices can drastically increase
your chance of survival --

00:00:52.017 --> 00:00:54.627
almost like a tauntaun on Hoth.

00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:55.673
(Laughter)

00:00:55.697 --> 00:00:58.875
But I'm pretty sure
that stormtrooper is going to be toast,

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.084
regardless if we have an AED or not,
