00:03:59.952 --> 00:04:02.975
at a rate of at least 100 beats a minute,

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:04.674
no more than 120.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.782
Unfortunately, due to the size
of Jabba's mouth

00:04:08.806 --> 00:04:10.571
and also what he puts in said mouth,

00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:15.028
we may not want to actually
do the mouth-to-mouth part.

00:04:15.052 --> 00:04:17.533
So instead, we can do
compression-only CPR.

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:19.997
The way of remembering
the compression-only part

00:04:20.021 --> 00:04:22.840
is we can actually use the Imperial March.

00:04:22.864 --> 00:04:24.781
I would sing it for you --

00:04:24.805 --> 00:04:26.246
(Laughter)

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.127
Unfortunately, that would be more
something an interrogation droid would do.
