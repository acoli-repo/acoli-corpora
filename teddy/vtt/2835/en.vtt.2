00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.084
regardless if we have an AED or not,

00:01:01.108 --> 00:01:04.825
since what happens is the chest plate
is going to be quite hard to get off,

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.839
and like that tauntaun,

00:01:06.863 --> 00:01:10.275
the AED has a very short window of time
at which it's highly effective.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.687
In this case -- basically, we've got
to use it within the first 10 minutes.

00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:17.813
The Jedi, on the other hand,
have no problems with their outfits.

00:01:17.837 --> 00:01:19.569
Those robes open straight up,

00:01:19.593 --> 00:01:22.103
you can place the pads
right onto the chest --

00:01:22.127 --> 00:01:24.005
so upper-right-hand side of the chest,

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:25.188
lower left,

00:01:25.212 --> 00:01:28.360
wait for the unit to determine
if it's a shockable rhythm

00:01:28.384 --> 00:01:29.902
and get ready to shock.

00:01:29.926 --> 00:01:31.451
But, the Jedi do have a problem.
