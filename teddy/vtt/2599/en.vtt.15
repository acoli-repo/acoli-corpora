00:07:28.902 --> 00:07:32.820
I would observe or I would input reality.

00:07:33.847 --> 00:07:36.529
Speech recognition
and biometric authentication

00:07:36.553 --> 00:07:39.813
are great examples of a machine
interacting with humans

00:07:39.837 --> 00:07:41.552
from an input perspective.

00:07:42.481 --> 00:07:44.772
Secondly, as a machine,

00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:49.907
I could place digital information,
or output information,

00:07:49.931 --> 00:07:51.096
into reality.

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:56.611
Holograms are examples of a machine
interacting with an environment

00:07:56.635 --> 00:07:58.095
from an output perspective.

00:07:58.968 --> 00:08:01.086
Finally, as a machine,
