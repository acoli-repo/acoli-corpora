00:10:58.506 --> 00:11:00.540
Finger crossed. Hi, Jeff.

00:11:02.514 --> 00:11:03.680
Jeff Norris: Hey, Alex.

00:11:03.704 --> 00:11:06.807
Alex Kipman: Phew! That worked.
How are you doing today, Jeff?

00:11:06.831 --> 00:11:08.934
(Applause)

00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.022

00:11:11.046 --> 00:11:14.498
AK: So, can you tell us a little bit,
Jeff, about where you are?

00:11:16.197 --> 00:11:19.198
JN: Well, I'm actually in three places.

00:11:19.222 --> 00:11:22.103
I'm standing in a room across the street,

00:11:22.127 --> 00:11:25.131
while I'm standing on this stage with you,

00:11:25.155 --> 00:11:29.957
while I'm standing on Mars,
a hundred million miles away.

00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:33.673
AK: Wow, a hundred million
miles away. This is crazy!
