00:05:28.393 --> 00:05:32.099
Within the digital universe,
we have the power to displace space

00:05:32.123 --> 00:05:33.874
and the power to displace time.

00:05:34.381 --> 00:05:37.717
It doesn't matter if you're using
technology for entertainment,

00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:39.966
productivity or communication.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.861
Think of it this way:

00:05:41.885 --> 00:05:43.265
let's all go home tonight

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.955
and watch our favorite show on television.

00:05:46.462 --> 00:05:50.004
This is theater -- time
and space displaced.

00:05:50.634 --> 00:05:52.734
As soon as I'm done with this TED Talk,

00:05:52.758 --> 00:05:56.075
I'm going to immediately call
my lovely family in Seattle.

00:05:59.261 --> 00:06:01.142
That's displacement of space.
