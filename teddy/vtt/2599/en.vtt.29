Thank you.

00:14:31.344 --> 00:14:36.413
(Applause)

00:14:36.437 --> 00:14:38.934
Helen Walters: Thanks so much.
I have some questions.

00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:40.109
AK: OK.

00:14:40.133 --> 00:14:42.555
HW: So there's been
some talk in the press.

00:14:42.579 --> 00:14:45.605
And I'll just ask you straight,
then we have a straight answer.

00:14:45.629 --> 00:14:48.311
There's been talk about the difference
between the demos

00:14:48.335 --> 00:14:50.517
and the reality of the commercial product.

00:14:50.541 --> 00:14:52.492
Talk about this field of view issue.

00:14:52.516 --> 00:14:56.835
Is this type of experience what someone
who buys the product will get?

00:14:56.859 --> 00:14:58.818
AK: It's a great question,

00:14:58.842 --> 00:15:01.493
Or, said better, this is a question
we've been receiving
