00:07:58.968 --> 00:08:01.086
Finally, as a machine,

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.642
I could exchange energy
with the world via haptics.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.392
Now, imagine being able to feel
the temperature of a virtual object,

00:08:10.416 --> 00:08:13.635
or better yet, imagine pushing a hologram

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:16.492
and having it push you back
with equal force.

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:18.676
With this perspective,

00:08:19.186 --> 00:08:24.148
we are able to collapse reality
into a simple matrix.

00:08:24.172 --> 00:08:25.323
Now here's a secret:

00:08:25.347 --> 00:08:27.405
as an engineer, I get really excited

00:08:27.429 --> 00:08:30.283
anytime I can reduce
something to the matrix.
