00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:30.091
NASA is using HoloLens
to let scientists explore planets

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:31.345
holographically.

00:02:31.932 --> 00:02:33.218
Now, this is important.

00:02:34.194 --> 00:02:36.636
By bringing holograms into our world,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.285
I'm not just talking about a new device
or a better computer.

00:02:40.914 --> 00:02:45.801
I'm talking about freeing ourselves
from the 2D confines

00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:48.308
of traditional computing.

00:02:49.334 --> 00:02:50.937
Put it this way:

00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:55.181
temporally adjusted, we're like
cave people in computer terms.

00:02:55.878 --> 00:02:57.792
We've barely discovered charcoal

00:02:57.816 --> 00:03:01.996
and started drawing
the first stick figures in our cave.
