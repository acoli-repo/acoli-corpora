00:08:27.429 --> 00:08:30.283
anytime I can reduce
something to the matrix.

00:08:30.783 --> 00:08:32.822
From self-driving cars

00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:34.435
to smartphones

00:08:34.459 --> 00:08:36.781
to this holographic computer on my head,

00:08:36.805 --> 00:08:40.587
machines are becoming capable
of understanding our world.

00:08:41.293 --> 00:08:43.828
And they are starting to interact with us

00:08:43.852 --> 00:08:46.967
in significantly more personal ways.

00:08:48.197 --> 00:08:51.822
Now, imagine having granular control

00:08:51.846 --> 00:08:53.682
over everything in the world.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.465
Move the dial one way,

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.145
and you get reality.
