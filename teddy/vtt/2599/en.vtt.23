AK: Wow, a hundred million
miles away. This is crazy!

00:11:33.697 --> 00:11:36.483
Can you tell us a little bit more
about where all this data

00:11:36.507 --> 00:11:38.196
from Mars is coming from?

00:11:40.005 --> 00:11:41.457
JN: Absolutely.

00:11:41.481 --> 00:11:45.567
This is a precise
holographic replica of Mars,

00:11:45.591 --> 00:11:48.771
built from data captured
by the Curiosity Mars Rover,

00:11:48.795 --> 00:11:51.850
that I can explore as easily
as a place on Earth.

00:11:53.056 --> 00:11:56.310
Humans are natural explorers.

00:11:56.334 --> 00:11:58.895
We can instantly
understand an environment,

00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:00.666
just by being present in it.
