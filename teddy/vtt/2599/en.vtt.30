00:14:58.842 --> 00:15:01.493
Or, said better, this is a question
we've been receiving

00:15:01.517 --> 00:15:04.180
in the media for possibly the last year.

00:15:04.204 --> 00:15:06.951
If you do your research,
I haven't answered that question.

00:15:06.975 --> 00:15:08.381
I've purposely ignored it,

00:15:08.405 --> 00:15:10.919
because ultimately,
it's the wrong question to ask.

00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:17.959
That's the equivalent of me showing
holograms to someone for the first time,

00:15:17.983 --> 00:15:21.793
and you then saying,
"What's the size of your television?"

00:15:21.817 --> 00:15:24.511
The field of view for the product
is almost irrelevant.

00:15:24.535 --> 00:15:28.033
What we should be talking about
is the density of lights,

00:15:28.057 --> 00:15:29.843
or radiance, that shows up.

00:15:29.867 --> 00:15:33.238
Better said, what the angular resolution
is of the things that you see.
