00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.460
Thousands of years from now,

00:00:03.088 --> 00:00:06.325
we'll look back at the first
century of computing

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.398
as a fascinating but very peculiar time --

00:00:11.096 --> 00:00:16.102
the only time in history where humans
were reduced to live in 2D space,

00:00:16.126 --> 00:00:20.045
interacting with technology
as if we were machines;

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:25.286
a singular, 100-year period
in the vastness of time

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.998
where humans communicated,

00:00:28.022 --> 00:00:30.673
were entertained and managed their lives
