It required sensing the world
from the perspective of a machine.

00:07:02.429 --> 00:07:06.031
If you're a machine trying
to sense our world,

00:07:06.055 --> 00:07:08.359
how would you actually
break the problem down?

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:11.832
You'd probably try to classify things

00:07:11.856 --> 00:07:13.021
as a human,

00:07:14.205 --> 00:07:15.380
an environment

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:18.189
or an object.

00:07:19.973 --> 00:07:24.202
But how would that machine
then interact with reality?

00:07:25.063 --> 00:07:26.688
And I can think of three ways.

00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:28.878
First, as a machine,

00:07:28.902 --> 00:07:32.820
I would observe or I would input reality.
