00:10:26.174 --> 00:10:31.309
And I can squint, and I can already
see holographic telepresence

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:32.507
in our near future.

00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:36.158
In fact, since we've been lucky
with our demo so far,

00:10:36.182 --> 00:10:38.491
let's try doing something else
even more crazy.

00:10:39.153 --> 00:10:41.906
I invite you to experience,

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.967
for the first time anywhere in the world,

00:10:44.991 --> 00:10:47.476
here on the TED stage,

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.818
a real-life holographic teleportation,

00:10:51.953 --> 00:10:55.660
between me and my friend,
Dr. Jeffrey Norris,

00:10:55.684 --> 00:10:58.482
from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

00:10:58.506 --> 00:11:00.540
Finger crossed. Hi, Jeff.
