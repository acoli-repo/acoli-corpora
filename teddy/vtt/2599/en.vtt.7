WEBVTT

00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:31.238
with HoloLens,

00:03:31.262 --> 00:03:34.562
and I can't think of a better place
to do it than here at TED.

00:03:35.221 --> 00:03:38.995
Momentarily, I am going
to be seeing holograms

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.341
right on this stage,

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:42.621
just as clearly as I can see all of you.

00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:46.283
Now at the same time,
we have also this special camera

00:03:46.307 --> 00:03:48.003
that just walked in onstage

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:51.259
so that all of you can share
in this experience with me

00:03:51.283 --> 00:03:52.695
up on all the monitors.

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:55.272
So let's start our journey.

00:03:55.296 --> 00:03:57.732
And what better place
to begin our journey,

00:03:57.756 --> 00:04:00.859
than in the computer cave of 2D.
