00:01:59.804 --> 00:02:01.861
enhancing the way we experience life

00:02:01.885 --> 00:02:04.598
beyond our ordinary range of perceptions.

00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:09.257
Now, I'm not thinking
about a distant future.

00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:11.458
I'm talking about today.

00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:15.102
We are already seeing
car companies like Volvo

00:02:15.126 --> 00:02:18.053
designing cars differently with HoloLens;

00:02:18.077 --> 00:02:22.808
universities like Case Western
redefining the way medical students learn;

00:02:22.832 --> 00:02:24.252
and my personal favorite,

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:30.091
NASA is using HoloLens
to let scientists explore planets
