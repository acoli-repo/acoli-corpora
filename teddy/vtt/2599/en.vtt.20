00:10:03.579 --> 00:10:04.737
And the world?

00:10:05.096 --> 00:10:07.491
The world was mesmerized.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.356

and their children

00:10:12.986 --> 00:10:16.523
will experience the continued
exploration of space

00:10:16.547 --> 00:10:20.498
with technology
that understands this world.

00:10:21.355 --> 00:10:25.689
We already live in a world where
real-time universal translators exist.

00:10:26.174 --> 00:10:31.309
And I can squint, and I can already
see holographic telepresence
