00:00:28.022 --> 00:00:30.673
were entertained and managed their lives

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.371
from behind a screen.

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:37.976
Today, we spend most of our time
tapping and looking at screens.

00:00:38.762 --> 00:00:42.349
What happened to interacting
with each other?

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.711
I don't know about you, but I feel limited

00:00:45.735 --> 00:00:49.283
inside this 2D world
of monitors and pixels.

00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:51.816
And it is this very limitation

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.256
and my desire to connect with people

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.268
that inspires me as a creator.

00:00:56.292 --> 00:00:59.643
Put simply: I want
to create a new reality,

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:05.374
a reality where technology brings
us infinitely closer to each other,
