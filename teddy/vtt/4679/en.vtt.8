00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:01.360
you can put the numbers in a matrix

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.904
and then an encryption key in another.

00:04:03.904 --> 00:04:04.785
Multiply them together

00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:07.118
and you've got a new encoded matrix.

00:04:07.118 --> 00:04:09.347
The only way to decode the new matrix

00:04:09.347 --> 00:04:10.520
and read the message

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.128
is to have the key,

00:04:12.128 --> 00:04:13.936
that second matrix.

00:04:13.936 --> 00:04:15.372
There's even a branch of mathematics

00:04:15.372 --> 00:04:17.230
that uses matrices constantly,

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.876
called Linear Algebra.

00:04:18.876 --> 00:04:21.130
If you ever get a chance to study Linear Algebra,

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.966
do it, it's pretty awesome.

00:04:22.966 --> 00:04:24.352
But just remember,

00:04:24.352 --> 00:04:26.439
once you know how to use matrices,

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.893
you can do pretty much anything.
