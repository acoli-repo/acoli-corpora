00:00:28.164 --> 00:00:30.129
as early as ancient China

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:31.571
came up with a way to represent

00:00:31.571 --> 00:00:34.148
arrays of many numbers at once.

00:00:34.148 --> 00:00:37.322
Nowadays we call such an array a "matrix,"

00:00:37.322 --> 00:00:40.059
and many of them hanging out together, "matrices".

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.620
Matrices are everywhere.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.555
They are all around us,

00:00:44.555 --> 00:00:47.891
even now in this very room.

00:00:47.891 --> 00:00:49.784
Sorry, let's get back on track.

00:00:49.784 --> 00:00:51.762
Matrices really are everywhere, though.

00:00:51.762 --> 00:00:53.073
They are used in business,

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:54.198
economics,

00:00:54.198 --> 00:00:54.988
cryptography,

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.198
physics,

00:00:56.198 --> 00:00:57.301
electronics,

00:00:57.301 --> 00:00:59.269
and computer graphics.

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.537
One reason matrices are so cool
