00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:30.328
We ran out of room.

00:03:30.328 --> 00:03:33.236
So, these matrices can't be multiplied.

00:03:33.236 --> 00:03:35.957
The number of columns in the first matrix

00:03:35.957 --> 00:03:39.509
has to be the same as the number of rows in the second matrix.

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:40.522
As long as you're careful

00:03:40.538 --> 00:03:42.385
to match up your dimensions right, though,

00:03:42.385 --> 00:03:43.687
it's pretty easy.

00:03:43.687 --> 00:03:45.499
Understanding matrix multiplication

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:46.990
is just the beginning, by the way.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.697
There's so much you can do with them.

00:03:48.697 --> 00:03:50.499
For example, let's say you want

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:52.421
to encrypt a secret message.

00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:54.588
Let's say it's "Math rules".

00:03:54.588 --> 00:03:56.917
Though, why anybody would want to keep this a secret

00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:58.283
is beyond me.

00:03:58.283 --> 00:03:59.641
Letting numbers stand for letters,

00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:01.360
you can put the numbers in a matrix
