One reason matrices are so cool

00:01:01.537 --> 00:01:04.314
is that we can pack so much information into them

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:06.588
and then turn a huge series of different problems

00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:09.551
into one single problem.

00:01:09.551 --> 00:01:13.262
So, to use matrices, we need to learn how they work.

00:01:13.262 --> 00:01:15.172
It turns out, you can treat matrices

00:01:15.172 --> 00:01:16.682
just like regular numbers.

00:01:16.682 --> 00:01:17.309
You can add them,

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:18.038
subtract them,

00:01:18.038 --> 00:01:19.698
even multiply them.

00:01:19.698 --> 00:01:20.915
You can't divide them,

00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:22.890
but that's a rabbit hole of its own.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.972
Adding matrices is pretty simple.

00:01:24.972 --> 00:01:27.195
All you have to do is add the corresponding entries

00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:28.597
in the order they come.

00:01:28.597 --> 00:01:30.457
So the first entries get added together,
