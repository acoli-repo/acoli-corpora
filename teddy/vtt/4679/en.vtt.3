00:01:28.597 --> 00:01:30.457
So the first entries get added together,

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:31.276
the second entries,

00:01:31.276 --> 00:01:31.963
the third,

00:01:31.963 --> 00:01:33.494
all the way down.

00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:35.740
Of course, your matrices have to be the same size,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.817
but that's pretty intuitive anyway.

00:01:37.817 --> 00:01:39.861
You can also multiply the whole matrix

00:01:39.861 --> 00:01:42.207
by a number, called a scalar.

00:01:42.207 --> 00:01:45.183
Just multiply every entry by that number.

00:01:45.183 --> 00:01:47.173
But wait, there's more!

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:51.373
You can actually multiply one matrix by another matrix.

00:01:51.373 --> 00:01:52.597
It's not like adding them, though,

00:01:52.597 --> 00:01:54.186
where you do it entry by entry.

00:01:54.186 --> 00:01:55.396
It's more unique

00:01:55.396 --> 00:01:57.466
and pretty cool once you get the hang of it.

00:01:57.466 --> 00:01:58.616
Here's how it works.

00:01:58.616 --> 00:02:01.053
Let's say you have two matrices.
