00:02:57.578 --> 00:03:01.539
4 plus -3 is 1.

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:05.147
-8 plus 0 is -8.

00:03:05.147 --> 00:03:07.383
So, here's your answer.

00:03:07.383 --> 00:03:09.218
Not all that bad, is it?

00:03:09.218 --> 00:03:10.917
There's one catch, though.

00:03:10.917 --> 00:03:12.505
Just like with addition,

00:03:12.505 --> 00:03:15.265
your matrices have to be the right size.

00:03:15.265 --> 00:03:17.927
Look at these two matrices.

00:03:17.927 --> 00:03:20.688
2 times 8 is 16.

00:03:20.688 --> 00:03:23.434
3 times 4 is 12.

00:03:23.434 --> 00:03:25.109
3 times

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.807
wait a minute,

00:03:26.807 --> 00:03:28.876
there are no more rows in the second matrix.

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:30.328
We ran out of room.
