00:02:28.962 --> 00:02:31.419
Multiply the first number in the row

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.750
by the first number in the column:

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.930
1 times 2 is 2.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.547
Now do the next ones:

00:02:37.547 --> 00:02:39.469
3 times 3 is 9.

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.040
Now add them up:

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.451
2 plus 9 is 11.

00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:46.038
Let's put that number in the top-left position

00:02:46.038 --> 00:02:48.053
so that it matches up with the rows and columns

00:02:48.053 --> 00:02:49.308
we used to get it.

00:02:49.308 --> 00:02:50.725
See how that works?

00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:53.569
You can do the same thing to get the other entries.

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.578
-4 plus 0 is -4.

00:02:57.578 --> 00:03:01.539
4 plus -3 is 1.
