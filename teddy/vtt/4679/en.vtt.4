00:01:58.616 --> 00:02:01.053
Let's say you have two matrices.

00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:02.841
Let's make them both two by two,

00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:05.385
meaning two rows by two columns.

00:02:05.385 --> 00:02:07.590
Write the first matrix to the left

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.475
and the second matrix goes next to it

00:02:09.475 --> 00:02:10.785
and translated up a bit,

00:02:10.785 --> 00:02:12.576
kind of like we are making a table.

00:02:12.576 --> 00:02:15.401
The product we get when we multiply the matrices together

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.897
will go right between them.

00:02:16.897 --> 00:02:20.641
We'll also draw some gridlines to help us along.

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:24.203
Now, look at the first row of the first matrix

00:02:24.203 --> 00:02:26.951
and the first column of the second matrix.

00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:28.962
See how there's two numbers in each?

00:02:28.962 --> 00:02:31.419
Multiply the first number in the row
