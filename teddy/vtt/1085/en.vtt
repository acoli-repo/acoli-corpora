00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to ask you all to consider for a second

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the very simple fact

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that, by far,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
most of what we know about the universe

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
comes to us from light.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and see stars with our bare eyes.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The Sun burns our peripheral vision.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We see light reflected off the Moon.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
at the celestial bodies,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the known universe has come to us through light,
