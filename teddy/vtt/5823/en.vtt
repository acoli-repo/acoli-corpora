00:00:00.197 --> 00:00:04.397
In 1998, my friends and I
won a national art competition.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.163
The prize was a week in Disneyland Paris,

00:00:07.197 --> 00:00:09.730
with hundreds of other children
from across the world,

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.897
as delegates to UNESCO's
International Children's Summit.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.697
Now this was no ordinary
trip to Disneyland.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.663
Between running riot in the park
and making friends,

00:00:18.697 --> 00:00:21.097
we workshopped the future of this planet.

00:00:21.097 --> 00:00:23.330
How could we overcome
the problems of pollution

00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:25.863
and their threats to human
and environmental health?

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.963
How could we guarantee
universal human rights

00:00:28.963 --> 00:00:31.363
of equality, justice and dignity?
