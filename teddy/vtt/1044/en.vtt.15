00:07:28.553 --> 00:07:30.364
And what's happening here,
this is where you've actually

00:07:30.388 --> 00:07:33.394
elected to join that Nike community.
You've bought into it.

00:07:33.418 --> 00:07:35.514
They're not advertising
loud messages at you,

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:37.712
and that's where advertising
has started to shift now

00:07:37.736 --> 00:07:40.366
is into things like services,
tools and applications.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.311
So Nike is literally acting
as a well-being partner,

00:07:43.335 --> 00:07:46.196
a health and fitness partner
and service provider.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.354
So what happens with this
is they're saying, "Right,

00:07:48.378 --> 00:07:50.950
you have a data dashboard.
We know how far you've run,

00:07:50.974 --> 00:07:53.719
how far you've moved, what your calorie
intake, all that sort of stuff.

00:07:53.743 --> 00:07:56.941
What you can do is, the more you
run, the more points you get,

00:07:56.965 --> 00:07:59.919
and we have an auction where
you can buy Nike stuff

00:07:59.943 --> 00:08:03.442
but only by proving that you've actually
used the product to do stuff."
