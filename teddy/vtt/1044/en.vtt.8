and disrupt and interrogate
what money means,

00:04:00.832 --> 00:04:03.915
what our relationship with it
is, what defines money,

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.993
then the ultimate extension of that is,

00:04:07.017 --> 00:04:09.846

00:04:26.493 --> 00:04:29.017
So if you've actually decided
that you trust a brand,

00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:31.851
you want a relationship, you
want to engage with the brand,
