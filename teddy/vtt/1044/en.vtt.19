00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.386
And you think, is it much of a leap?

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.425
It seems farfetched,
but when you think about it,

00:09:34.449 --> 00:09:37.143
in America in 1860,

00:09:37.167 --> 00:09:41.350
there were 1,600 corporations
issuing banknotes.

00:09:41.374 --> 00:09:44.650
There were 8,000 kinds
of notes in America.

00:09:44.674 --> 00:09:45.907
And the only thing that stopped that,

00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:48.515
the government controlled
four percent of the supply,

00:09:48.539 --> 00:09:50.159
and the only thing that stopped it

00:09:50.183 --> 00:09:51.852
was the Civil War breaking out,

00:09:51.876 --> 00:09:54.924
and the government suddenly wanted
to take control of the money.

00:09:54.948 --> 00:09:58.566
So government, money, war,
nothing changes there, then.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.421
So what I'm going to ask is, basically,
