00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:31.870
And I am going to tell you the answer,

00:00:31.894 --> 00:00:34.480
but obviously after this short break.

00:00:34.504 --> 00:00:36.389
So a more challenging question is one

00:00:36.413 --> 00:00:38.272
that I was asked, actually,
by one of our writers

00:00:38.296 --> 00:00:40.773
a couple of weeks ago,
and I didn't know the answer:

00:00:40.797 --> 00:00:43.013
What's the world's best
performing currency?

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:44.923
It's actually Bitcoin.

00:00:44.947 --> 00:00:47.138
Now, for those of you
who may not be familiar,

00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:50.596
Bitcoin is a crypto-currency, a virtual
currency, synthetic currency.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.402
It was founded in 2008
by this anonymous programmer

00:00:54.426 --> 00:00:57.270
using a pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:00:57.294 --> 00:00:59.641
No one knows who or what he is.

00:00:59.665 --> 00:01:01.902
He's almost like the Banksy
of the Internet.
