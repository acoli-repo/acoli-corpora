He's almost like the Banksy
of the Internet.

00:01:01.926 --> 00:01:05.010
And I'm probably not going
to do it proper service here,

00:01:05.034 --> 00:01:07.177
but my interpretation
of how it works is that

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:09.960
Bitcoins are released
through this process of mining.

00:01:09.984 --> 00:01:12.508
So there's a network
of computers that are challenged

00:01:12.532 --> 00:01:14.662
to solve a very complex
mathematical problem

00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:17.928
and the person that manages to solve
it first gets the Bitcoins.

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:18.914
And the Bitcoins are released,

00:01:18.938 --> 00:01:21.558
they're put into a public
ledger called the Blockchain,

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:24.211
and then they float, so
they become a currency,

00:01:24.235 --> 00:01:27.258
and completely decentralized,
that's the sort of

00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:29.806
scary thing about this,
which is why it's so popular.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.282
So it's not run
by the authorities or the state.
