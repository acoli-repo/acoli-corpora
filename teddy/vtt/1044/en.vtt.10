00:04:58.058 --> 00:05:01.096
are actually being made
with Starbucks Star points.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.930
So that's a sort of Starbucks currency

00:05:02.954 --> 00:05:04.963
staying within its ecosystem.

00:05:04.987 --> 00:05:07.891
And what I find interesting is that Amazon

00:05:07.915 --> 00:05:10.971
has recently launched Amazon coins.

00:05:10.995 --> 00:05:13.710
So admittedly it's a currency at the moment
that's purely for the Kindle.

00:05:13.734 --> 00:05:16.898
So you can buy apps and make
purchases within those apps,

00:05:16.922 --> 00:05:18.295
but you think about Amazon,

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.653
you look at the trust
barometer that I showed you

00:05:20.677 --> 00:05:23.591
where people are starting
to trust businesses,

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:26.092
especially businesses
that they believe in and trust

00:05:26.116 --> 00:05:27.482
more than governments.

00:05:27.506 --> 00:05:28.984
So suddenly, you start thinking,

00:05:29.008 --> 00:05:30.822
well Amazon potentially could push this.
