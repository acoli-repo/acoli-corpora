00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:31.851
you want a relationship, you
want to engage with the brand,

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:34.710
you're already kind of participating
in lots of new forms

00:04:34.734 --> 00:04:36.249
of currency.

00:04:36.273 --> 00:04:38.239
So you think about loyalty.

00:04:38.263 --> 00:04:40.302
Loyalty essentially is a micro-economy.

00:04:40.326 --> 00:04:43.537
You think about rewards
schemes, air miles.

00:04:43.561 --> 00:04:45.686
The Economist said a few years ago that

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.876
there are actually more
unredeemed air miles in the world

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.776
than there are dollar
bills in circulation.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.324
You know, when you are standing
in line in Starbucks,

00:04:55.348 --> 00:04:58.034
30 percent of transactions
in Starbucks on any one day

00:04:58.058 --> 00:05:01.096
are actually being made
with Starbucks Star points.
