00:01:59.212 --> 00:02:00.115
it's gaining respectability.

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:02.211
You get services,
like Reddit and Wordpress

00:02:02.235 --> 00:02:05.506
are actually accepting Bitcoin
as a payment currency now.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.449
And that's showing you that people

00:02:07.473 --> 00:02:10.000
are actually placing trust in technology,

00:02:10.024 --> 00:02:12.760
and it's started to trump and disrupt

00:02:12.784 --> 00:02:14.805
and interrogate traditional institutions

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.544
and how we think
about currencies and money.

00:02:17.568 --> 00:02:18.992
And that's not surprising,
if you think about

00:02:19.016 --> 00:02:20.912
the basket case that is the E.U.

00:02:20.936 --> 00:02:23.127
I think there was a Gallup
survey out recently

00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:25.113
that said something like, in America,

00:02:25.137 --> 00:02:28.887
trust in banks is at an all-time
low, it's something like 21 percent.

00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:30.702
