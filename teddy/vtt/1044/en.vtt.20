00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.421
So what I'm going to ask is, basically,

00:10:01.445 --> 00:10:03.816
is history repeating itself?

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.717
Is technology making paper
money feel outmoded?

00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:09.860
Are we decoupling money
from the government?

00:10:09.884 --> 00:10:12.884
You know, you think about, brands
are starting to fill the gaps.

00:10:12.908 --> 00:10:16.115
Corporations are filling gaps
that governments can't afford to fill.

00:10:16.139 --> 00:10:18.876
So I think, you know,
will we be standing on stage

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.561
buying a coffee -- organic,
fair trade coffee -- next year

00:10:22.585 --> 00:10:25.342
using TED florins or TED shillings?

00:10:25.366 --> 00:10:27.029
Thank you very much.

00:10:27.053 --> 00:10:29.229
(Applause)

00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:34.300
Thank you. (Applause)
