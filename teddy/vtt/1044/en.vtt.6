00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.159
And what's interesting
is that you can see that

00:03:02.183 --> 00:03:04.763
hierarchy is having a bit of a wobble,

00:03:04.787 --> 00:03:06.549
and it's all about heterarchical now,

00:03:06.573 --> 00:03:09.113
so people trust people
like themselves more

00:03:09.137 --> 00:03:12.197
than they trust corporations
and governments.

00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:14.380
And if you look at these figures
for the more developed markets

00:03:14.404 --> 00:03:17.108
like U.K., Germany, and so on,
they're actually much lower.

00:03:17.132 --> 00:03:18.119
And I find that sort of scary.

00:03:18.143 --> 00:03:20.191
People are actually
trusting businesspeople

00:03:20.215 --> 00:03:23.620
more than they're trusting
governments and leaders.

00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:26.727
So what's starting to happen,
if you think about money,

00:03:26.751 --> 00:03:28.936
if you sort of boil money
down to an essence,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.998
it is literally just an expression
of value, an agreed value.
