00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.282
So it's not run
by the authorities or the state.

00:01:32.306 --> 00:01:34.359
It's actually managed by the network.

00:01:34.383 --> 00:01:36.622
And the reason that it's proved
very successful

00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:40.040
is it's private, it's anonymous,
it's fast, and it's cheap.

00:01:40.064 --> 00:01:43.832
And you do get to the point where
there's some wild fluctuations with Bitcoin.

00:01:43.856 --> 00:01:46.747
So in one level it went
from something like 13 dollars

00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:49.339
to 266, literally
in the space of four months,

00:01:49.363 --> 00:01:52.078
and then crashed and lost half
of its value in six hours.

00:01:52.102 --> 00:01:53.912
And it's currently around that kind of

00:01:53.936 --> 00:01:56.392
110 dollar mark in value.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:59.188
But what it does show
is that it's sort of gaining ground,

00:01:59.212 --> 00:02:00.115
it's gaining respectability.
