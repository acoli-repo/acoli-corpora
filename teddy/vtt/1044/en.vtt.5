00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:30.702
And you can see here
some photographs from London

00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:32.917
where Barclays sponsored
the city bike scheme,

00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:34.524
and some activists have
done some nice piece

of guerrilla marketing here

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.959
they do this very interesting
survey every year

00:02:53.983 --> 00:02:57.154
precisely around trust
and what people are thinking.

00:02:57.178 --> 00:02:59.896
And this is a global survey,
so these numbers are global.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.159
And what's interesting
is that you can see that
