00:02:56.383 --> 00:03:00.301
and the people who are least interested to vote

00:03:00.301 --> 00:03:04.938
are the people whom you expect are going to gain most out of voting.

00:03:04.938 --> 00:03:08.363
I mean the unemployed, the under-privileged.

00:03:08.363 --> 00:03:10.055
And this is a major issue.

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:12.786
Because especially now with the economic crisis,

00:03:12.786 --> 00:03:15.237
you can see that the trust in politics,

00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:17.819
that the trust in democratic institutions,

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.738
was really destroyed.

00:03:19.738 --> 00:03:23.354
According to the latest survey being done by the European Commission,

00:03:23.354 --> 00:03:28.236
89 percent of the citizens of Europe believe that there is a growing gap

00:03:28.236 --> 00:03:34.562
between the opinion of the policy-makers and the opinion of the public.
