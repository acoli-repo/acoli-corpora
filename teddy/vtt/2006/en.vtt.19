And when we're now trying to see how we can change the situation,

00:09:30.467 --> 00:09:33.416
when basically we're trying to see what can be done about democracy,

00:09:33.416 --> 00:09:35.983
we should keep this ambiguity in mind.

00:09:35.983 --> 00:09:39.001
Because probably some of the things that we love most

00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:42.202
are going to be also the things that can hurt us most.

00:09:42.202 --> 00:09:45.386
These days it's very popular to believe

00:09:45.386 --> 00:09:47.700
that this push for transparency,

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:54.085
this kind of a combination between active citizens, new technologies

00:09:54.085 --> 00:09:57.749
and much more transparency-friendly legislation

00:09:57.749 --> 00:10:00.817
can restore trust in politics.
