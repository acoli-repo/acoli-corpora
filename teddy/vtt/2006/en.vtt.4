00:01:56.837 --> 00:02:02.185
But what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot?

00:02:02.185 --> 00:02:06.518
So the government decided to have the elections once again.

00:02:06.518 --> 00:02:09.068
And this time even a greater number,

00:02:09.068 --> 00:02:14.251
83 percent of the people, voted with blank ballots.

00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:17.002
Basically they went to the ballot boxes

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:20.068
to tell that they have nobody to vote for.

00:02:20.068 --> 00:02:25.100
This is the opening of a beautiful novel by Jose Saramago

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.583
called "Seeing."

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:28.833
But in my view it very well captures

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:33.217
part of the problem that we have with democracy in Europe these days.
