00:01:26.502 --> 00:01:30.302
And because of the rain until four o'clock in the afternoon,

00:01:30.302 --> 00:01:32.987
nobody went to the polling stations.

00:01:32.987 --> 00:01:34.752
But then the rain stopped,

00:01:34.752 --> 00:01:36.986
people went to vote.

00:01:36.986 --> 00:01:40.136
And when the votes had been counted,

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:47.452
three-fourths of the people have voted with a blank ballot.

00:01:47.452 --> 00:01:49.802
The government and the opposition,

00:01:49.802 --> 00:01:52.736
they have been simply paralyzed.

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:54.853
Because you know what to do about the protests.

00:01:54.853 --> 00:01:56.837
You know who to arrest, who to negotiate with.

00:01:56.837 --> 00:02:02.185
But what to do about people who are voting with a blank ballot?
