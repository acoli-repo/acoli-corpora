00:08:28.533 --> 00:08:31.199
This is the other side of the things that we like.

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:33.217
And when you go to the brain sciences,

00:08:33.217 --> 00:08:37.583
what political consultants learned from the brain scientists

00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:40.935
is don't talk to me about ideas anymore,

00:08:40.935 --> 00:08:43.200
don't talk to me about policy programs.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.967
What really matters is basically to manipulate the emotions of the people.

00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:51.034
And you have this very strongly

00:08:51.034 --> 00:08:55.435
to the extent that, even if you see when we talk about revolutions these days,

00:08:55.435 --> 00:09:01.434
these revolutions are not named anymore around ideologies or ideas.
