Are you not afraid with all these technologies

00:11:31.134 --> 00:11:33.134
that are going to track down

00:11:33.134 --> 00:11:36.749
any statement the politicians are going to make on certain issues,

00:11:36.749 --> 00:11:40.616
are you not afraid that this is going to be a very strong signal to politicians

00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:45.250
to repeat their positions, even the very wrong positions,

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:49.267
because consistency is going to be more important than common sense?

00:11:49.267 --> 00:11:50.949
And the Americans who are in the room,

00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:54.001
are you not afraid that your presidents are going to govern

00:11:54.001 --> 00:11:57.376
on the basis of what they said in the primary elections?

00:11:57.376 --> 00:11:59.367
I find this extremely important,

00:11:59.367 --> 00:12:03.399
because democracy is about people changing their views
