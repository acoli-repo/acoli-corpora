but we also know that the Internet created these echo chambers and political ghettos

00:08:04.216 --> 00:08:09.318
in which for all your life you can stay with the political community you belong to.

00:08:09.318 --> 00:08:11.250
And it's becoming more and more difficult

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.016
to understand the people who are not like you.

00:08:14.016 --> 00:08:15.884
I know that many people here

00:08:15.884 --> 00:08:20.648
have been splendidly speaking about the digital world and the possibility for cooperation,

00:08:20.648 --> 00:08:24.682
but [have you] seen what the digital world has done to American politics these days?

00:08:24.682 --> 00:08:28.533
This is also partly a result of the Internet revolution.

00:08:28.533 --> 00:08:31.199
This is the other side of the things that we like.
