00:04:25.872 --> 00:04:30.456
very much changed the way we're living and deepened our democratic experience.

00:04:30.456 --> 00:04:35.681
And the first was the cultural and social revolution of 1968 and 1970s,

00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:38.496
which put the individual at the center of politics.

00:04:38.496 --> 00:04:40.914
It was the human rights moment.

00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:44.764
Basically this was also a major outbreak, a culture of dissent,

00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:48.630
a culture of basically non-conformism,

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.931
which was not known before.

00:04:50.931 --> 00:04:53.280
So I do believe that even things like that

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.732
are very much the children of '68 --

00:04:56.732 --> 00:05:00.147
nevertheless that most of us had been even not born then.
