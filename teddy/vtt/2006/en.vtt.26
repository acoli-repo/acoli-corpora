00:12:59.001 --> 00:13:01.452
So I had the opportunity to talk to the prime minister,

00:13:01.452 --> 00:13:03.050
why he made this decision.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.766
He said, "Listen, this is the best way

00:13:04.766 --> 00:13:09.394
to keep the mouths of my ministers closed.

00:13:09.394 --> 00:13:12.479
Because it's going to be very difficult for them to dissent

00:13:12.479 --> 00:13:14.661
knowing that 24 hours after

00:13:14.661 --> 00:13:16.565
this is going to be on the public space,

00:13:16.565 --> 00:13:20.511
and this is in a certain way going to be a political crisis."

00:13:20.511 --> 00:13:21.978
So when we talk about transparency,

00:13:21.978 --> 00:13:23.577
when we talk about openness,

00:13:23.577 --> 00:13:25.694
I really do believe that what we should keep in mind

00:13:25.694 --> 00:13:29.444
is that what went right is what went wrong.

00:13:29.444 --> 00:13:33.628
And this is Goethe, who is neither Bulgarian nor a political scientist,
