Because first you have the 1960s and 1970s,

00:06:01.631 --> 00:06:03.497
cultural and social revolution,

00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:07.064
which in a certain way destroyed the idea of a collective purpose.

00:06:07.064 --> 00:06:11.900
The very idea, all these collective nouns that we have been taught about --

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.697
nation, class, family.

00:06:14.697 --> 00:06:17.181
We start to like divorcing, if we're married at all.

00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:20.530
All this was very much under attack.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.881
And it is so difficult to engage people in politics

00:06:24.881 --> 00:06:27.580
when they believe that what really matters

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.749
is where they personally stand.

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:33.499
And you have the market revolution of the 1980s
