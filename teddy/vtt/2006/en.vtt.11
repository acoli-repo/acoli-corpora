00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:32.414
to what extent the Internet empowered people.

00:05:32.414 --> 00:05:35.247
It has changed the way we are communicating

00:05:35.247 --> 00:05:36.997

00:05:36.997 --> 00:05:40.015
The very idea of political community totally has changed.

00:05:40.015 --> 00:05:42.330
And I'm going to name one more revolution,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.163
and this is the revolution in brain sciences,

00:05:44.163 --> 00:05:46.064
which totally changed the way

00:05:46.064 --> 00:05:49.400
we understand how people are making decisions.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.364
So this is what went right.

00:05:52.364 --> 00:05:54.698
But if we're going to see what went wrong,

00:05:54.698 --> 00:05:58.130
we're going to end up with the same five revolutions.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.631
Because first you have the 1960s and 1970s,
