00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.054
we have more rights, we can travel easier,

00:04:00.054 --> 00:04:02.403
we have access to more information --

00:04:02.403 --> 00:04:05.787
at the same time that trust in our democratic institutions

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:08.370
basically has collapsed?

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.806
So basically I want to ask:

00:04:09.806 --> 00:04:14.655
What went right and what went wrong in these 50 years

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:16.456
when we talk about democracy?

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:20.339
And I'll start with what went right.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.401
And the first thing that went right was, of course,

00:04:23.401 --> 00:04:25.872
these five revolutions which, in my view,

00:04:25.872 --> 00:04:30.456
very much changed the way we're living and deepened our democratic experience.
