00:03:28.236 --> 00:03:34.562
between the opinion of the policy-makers and the opinion of the public.

00:03:34.562 --> 00:03:38.570
Only 18 percent of Italians and 15 percent of Greeks

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.720
believe that their vote matters.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.786
Basically people start to understand that they can change governments,

00:03:45.786 --> 00:03:48.288
but they cannot change policies.

00:03:48.288 --> 00:03:50.904
And the question which I want to ask is the following:

00:03:50.904 --> 00:03:54.820
How did it happen that we are living in societies

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.370
which are much freer than ever before --

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.054
we have more rights, we can travel easier,
