00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:33.499
And you have the market revolution of the 1980s

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:39.460
and the huge increase of inequality in societies.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.366
Remember, until the 1970s,

00:06:41.366 --> 00:06:45.106
the spread of democracy has always been accompanied

00:06:45.106 --> 00:06:48.566
by the decline of inequality.

00:06:48.566 --> 00:06:50.732
The more democratic our societies have been,

00:06:50.732 --> 00:06:54.765
the more equal they have been becoming.

00:06:54.765 --> 00:06:57.099
Now we have the reverse tendency.

00:06:57.099 --> 00:06:59.799
The spread of democracy now is very much accompanied

00:06:59.799 --> 00:07:01.683
by the increase in inequality.
