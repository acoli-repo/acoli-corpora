00:00:00.371 --> 00:00:03.139
I'm afraid I'm one of those speakers

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:06.354
you hope you're not going to meet at TED.

00:00:06.354 --> 00:00:07.690

00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:11.722
Secondly, a political theorist

00:00:11.722 --> 00:00:14.187

00:00:24.576 --> 00:00:26.742
And one of the things that I want to question

00:00:26.742 --> 00:00:29.459

00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:31.393
