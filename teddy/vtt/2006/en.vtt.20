00:09:57.749 --> 00:10:00.817
can restore trust in politics.

00:10:00.817 --> 00:10:04.500
You believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this,

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.184
it can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie,

00:10:08.184 --> 00:10:10.699
it's going to be more difficult for them to steal

00:10:10.699 --> 00:10:14.384
and probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill.

00:10:14.384 --> 00:10:16.400
This is probably true.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.450
But I do believe that we should be also very clear

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:24.717
that now when we put the transparency at the center of politics

00:10:24.717 --> 00:10:28.316
where the message is, "It's transparency, stupid."

00:10:28.316 --> 00:10:31.899
Transparency is not about restoring trust in institutions.
