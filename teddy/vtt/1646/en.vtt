00:00:00.395 --> 00:00:04.047
What I want to do today is spend
some time talking about some stuff

00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:07.656
that's giving me a little bit
of existential angst,

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.976
for lack of a better word,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.086
over the past couple of years.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.338
And basically, these three quotes
tell what's going on.

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:19.626
"When God made the color purple,
God was just showing off,"

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.169
Alice Walker wrote in "The Color Purple."

00:00:22.193 --> 00:00:25.976
And Zora Neale Hurston wrote
in "Dust Tracks On A Road,"

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.826
"Research is a formalized curiosity.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.502
It's poking and prying with a purpose."
