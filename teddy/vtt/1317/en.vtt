00:00:00.757 --> 00:00:04.244
Five hundred seventy-one million

00:00:04.244 --> 00:00:10.551
two hundred thirty thousand pounds of paper towels

00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:12.438
are used by Americans

00:00:12.438 --> 00:00:16.109
every year.

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.164
If we could -- correction, wrong figure --

00:00:19.164 --> 00:00:21.515
13 billion used every year.

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:24.618
If we could reduce the usage of paper towels,

00:00:24.618 --> 00:00:27.800
one paper towel per person per day,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.681
571,230,000 pounds of paper not used.
