00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:02.318
Our own solar system is huge,

00:01:02.342 --> 00:01:05.651
so even getting a package
from the nearest star system

00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:07.778
4.4 light years away

00:01:07.802 --> 00:01:10.384
would take over 50,000 years.

00:01:10.408 --> 00:01:12.453
So this is a really big deal.

00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:15.447
The interstellar visitor
entered our solar system

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:17.321
from above the plane of the planets,

00:01:17.345 --> 00:01:20.178
coming from the direction
of the constellation Lyra,

00:01:20.202 --> 00:01:23.638
and it passed closest to the Sun
on September 9th,

00:01:23.662 --> 00:01:26.067
passing inside the orbit of Mercury.

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.738
Now this isn't a particularly
close approach or unusual distance.
