WEBVTT

00:11:58.852 --> 00:12:01.266
We're part of a much larger environment,

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:06.154
and in fact, we may even
be surrounded by interstellar visitors

00:12:06.178 --> 00:12:08.211
and not even know it.

00:12:08.235 --> 00:12:10.347
This unexpected gift

00:12:10.371 --> 00:12:14.958
has perhaps raised more questions
than its provided answers,

00:12:14.982 --> 00:12:20.307
but we were the first to say hello
to a visitor from another solar system.

00:12:20.712 --> 00:12:21.894
Thank you.

00:12:21.918 --> 00:12:28.902
(Applause)
