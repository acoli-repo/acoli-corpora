very close to a star
that was much denser than our own,

00:10:31.619 --> 00:10:35.032
and the star's tidal forces
shredded planetary material

00:10:35.056 --> 00:10:36.906
early in the solar system's history.

00:10:37.565 --> 00:10:41.526
Still others suggest that maybe
this is something that formed

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.716
during the death throes of a star,

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.532
perhaps during a supernova explosion,

00:10:46.556 --> 00:10:49.168
as planetary material got shredded.

00:10:50.345 --> 00:10:53.853
Whatever it is, we believe
it's a natural object,

00:10:53.877 --> 00:10:58.138
but we can't actually prove
that it's not something artificial.

The color, the strange shape,
the tumbling motion
