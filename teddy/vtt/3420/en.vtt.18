00:08:57.642 --> 00:09:01.118
In fact, minerals that have
tiny little bits of iron in the surface

00:09:01.142 --> 00:09:03.079
can also look red,

00:09:03.103 --> 00:09:05.953
as does the dark side
of Saturn's moon Iapetus,

00:09:05.977 --> 00:09:08.762
shown in these images
from the Cassini spacecraft.

00:09:09.432 --> 00:09:11.623
Nickel-iron meteorites,
in other words, metal,

00:09:11.647 --> 00:09:13.376
can also look red.

00:09:14.032 --> 00:09:16.702
So while we don't know
what's on the surface,

00:09:16.726 --> 00:09:19.872
we know even less
about what's on the inside.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:23.523
However, we do know
that it must at least be strong enough

00:09:23.547 --> 00:09:25.919
to not fly apart as it rotates,

00:09:25.943 --> 00:09:29.903
so it probably has a density
similar to that of rocky asteroids;

00:09:29.927 --> 00:09:32.419
perhaps even denser, like metal.
