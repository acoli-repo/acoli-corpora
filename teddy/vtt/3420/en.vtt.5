00:02:29.362 --> 00:02:33.198
but to me the most significant
is for what 'Oumuamua can tell us

00:02:33.222 --> 00:02:35.639
about the past of our solar system.

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:40.410
The process of the birth of a new solar
system and the growth of planets

00:02:40.434 --> 00:02:43.516
can be a violent and messy business.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.763
Leftover icy and rocky debris
gets ejected from the new solar system

00:02:47.787 --> 00:02:51.136
as the giant planets migrate
through the dusty disk

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.088
out of which they're formed.

00:02:54.175 --> 00:02:58.155
Now have you ever felt an emotional chill,

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:02.980
something that's so exciting
that a shiver runs up and down your spine?
