00:05:56.933 --> 00:06:00.100
Well, we weren't going to get
any second chances here.

00:06:00.124 --> 00:06:04.232
Because the weather was great,
'Oumuamua decided not to be.

00:06:04.256 --> 00:06:06.256
Its brightness wasn't constant.

00:06:06.732 --> 00:06:09.947
Now here we see 'Oumuamua
racing between the stars.

00:06:09.971 --> 00:06:11.550
It's centered in the middle.

00:06:11.574 --> 00:06:15.494
The stars are trailed out because
the telescope is following its motion.

00:06:16.145 --> 00:06:21.597
It started faint and then it got brighter,
fainter, brighter, and fainter again,

00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:26.446
as sunlight is reflected off
of four sides of an oblong object.

00:06:27.302 --> 00:06:29.732
The extreme brightness change

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:34.061
led us to an unbelievable
conclusion about its shape.
