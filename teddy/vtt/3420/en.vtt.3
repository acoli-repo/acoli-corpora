00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.738
Now this isn't a particularly
close approach or unusual distance.

00:01:30.762 --> 00:01:34.471
It's just much easier
to see objects close by.

00:01:35.124 --> 00:01:36.800
On October 14th,

00:01:36.824 --> 00:01:40.926
before we discovered it, it made
its closest approach to the Earth,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.640
within about 15 million miles.

00:01:43.664 --> 00:01:46.421
This is really close
by astronomical standards.

00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:51.817
Now rather than call this
by its unwieldy catalog name,

00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:54.484
we briefly called it "Rama,"

00:01:54.508 --> 00:01:58.016
after the cylindrical spacecraft
that passed through the solar system

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.254
in Arthur C. Clarke's classic
science fiction story in 1973.
