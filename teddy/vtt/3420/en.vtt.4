00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.254
in Arthur C. Clarke's classic
science fiction story in 1973.

00:02:03.865 --> 00:02:05.942
But this wasn't quite right either,

00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:09.199
so in honor of it being discovered
by a telescope in Hawaii,

00:02:09.223 --> 00:02:12.620
we consulted two experts
on Hawaiian culture --

00:02:12.644 --> 00:02:15.097
a Hawaiian navigator and a linguist --

00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:16.863
to propose a name.

00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:19.871
And they suggested "'Oumuamua,"

00:02:19.895 --> 00:02:24.950
which means scout or messenger
from the distant past reaching out to us.

00:02:25.972 --> 00:02:29.338
Now this discovery
was important for many reasons,

00:02:29.362 --> 00:02:33.198
but to me the most significant
is for what 'Oumuamua can tell us
