00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:32.846
but there's what you want
and what you can have,

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.204
and 'Oumuamua was moving away
and fading very rapidly.

00:03:37.228 --> 00:03:39.429
In the span of about a week,

00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:42.124
it had dropped in brightness
by a factor of [10].

00:03:42.852 --> 00:03:45.268
So this is about all the time
we were going to have

00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:47.179
to study it easily.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.612
So we had to distill the process
of getting telescope time --

00:03:52.636 --> 00:03:56.176
normally a very competitive,
peer-reviewed proposal process

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.048
that can take up to months --

00:03:58.072 --> 00:04:00.771
down to less than a few days.
