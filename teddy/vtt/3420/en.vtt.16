00:07:58.537 --> 00:08:02.496
we think that 'Oumuamua
may be more of a flattened oval.

00:08:03.822 --> 00:08:05.784
So let's get back to the energetics.

00:08:05.808 --> 00:08:07.719
What is it made of?

00:08:07.743 --> 00:08:10.967
Well, ideally we would love
to have a piece of 'Oumuamua

00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:14.189
into the laboratory,
so we could study it in detail.

00:08:14.213 --> 00:08:17.880
But since even private industry
can't manage to launch

00:08:17.904 --> 00:08:19.666
a spacecraft within a week

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.357
to something like this,

00:08:21.381 --> 00:08:24.542
astronomers have to rely
on remote observations.

00:08:24.566 --> 00:08:28.511
So astronomers will look at how the light
interacts with the surface.

00:08:28.535 --> 00:08:32.701
Some colors may get absorbed,
giving it a chemical fingerprint,
