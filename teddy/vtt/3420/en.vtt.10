00:04:58.109 --> 00:05:01.076
Now, if you don't believe me,
think of comparing the brightness

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.482
of a firefly in your backyard

00:05:02.506 --> 00:05:06.926
to the navigation lights
on a distant airplane.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.922
You know the airplane is much brighter --

00:05:08.946 --> 00:05:11.646
it just appears faint
because it's so far away.

00:05:12.775 --> 00:05:14.609
We're also going to need to know

00:05:14.633 --> 00:05:17.783
how reflective
the surface of 'Oumuamua is,

00:05:17.807 --> 00:05:19.917
and we don't have any clue,

00:05:19.941 --> 00:05:23.801
but it's reasonable to assume
it's very similar to small asteroids

00:05:23.825 --> 00:05:25.807
and comets in our solar system,

00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:27.181
or in technical terms,

00:05:27.205 --> 00:05:31.418
something between the reflectivity
of charcoal and wet sand.
