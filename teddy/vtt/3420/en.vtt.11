are used in what's called a service mode,

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.976
meaning we have to carefully develop
all the instructions

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.549
and send them to the telescope operator,

00:05:44.573 --> 00:05:47.502
and then anxiously wait
for the data to come back,

00:05:47.526 --> 00:05:49.749

Now I bet most of you don't have careers

00:05:52.098 --> 00:05:56.909

00:05:56.933 --> 00:06:00.100
Well, we weren't going to get
any second chances here.
