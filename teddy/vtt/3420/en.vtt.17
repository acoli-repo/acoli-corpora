00:08:28.535 --> 00:08:32.701
Some colors may get absorbed,
giving it a chemical fingerprint,

00:08:32.725 --> 00:08:34.972
whereas other colors may not.

00:08:34.996 --> 00:08:39.249
On the other hand, some substances
may just reflect more blue

00:08:39.273 --> 00:08:41.091
or red light efficiently.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:45.382
In the case of 'Oumuamua,
it reflected more red light,

00:08:45.406 --> 00:08:50.429
making it look very much like the organic
rich surface of the comet recently visited

00:08:50.453 --> 00:08:52.239
by the Rosetta spacecraft.

00:08:52.887 --> 00:08:57.618
But not everything that looks reddish
has the same composition.

00:08:57.642 --> 00:09:01.118
In fact, minerals that have
tiny little bits of iron in the surface
