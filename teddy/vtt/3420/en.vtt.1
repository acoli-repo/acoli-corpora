WEBVTT

00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:30.383
and this time the usual follow-up
measurements of position and speed

00:00:30.407 --> 00:00:33.222
showed something completely different.

00:00:33.246 --> 00:00:35.751
By October 22nd, we had enough data

00:00:41.334 --> 00:00:43.081
That's when I got the phone call,

astronomers are waiting for.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.277
(Laughter)

00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:53.422

pass through the solar system
since the 1970s,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.668
but until now, we'd never seen anything.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:02.318
