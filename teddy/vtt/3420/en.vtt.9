00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:30.131
the first thing we might like to know
is how massive 'Oumuamua is.

00:04:30.155 --> 00:04:32.995
Because after all,
it passed very close to the Earth,

00:04:33.019 --> 00:04:36.034
and we didn't know about it
until afterwards.

00:04:36.757 --> 00:04:41.058
How bad would this have been
had it not missed the Earth?

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.752
Well, the impact energy

00:04:43.776 --> 00:04:47.385
depends on the square
of the velocity times its mass,

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:51.005
and the mass depends
on how big it is and what it's made of.

00:04:51.647 --> 00:04:55.068
So how big is 'Oumuamua,
and what's its shape?

00:04:55.765 --> 00:04:58.085
Well, we can get this from its brightness.

00:04:58.109 --> 00:05:01.076
Now, if you don't believe me,
think of comparing the brightness
