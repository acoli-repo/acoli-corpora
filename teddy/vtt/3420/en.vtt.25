Jedidah Isler: Thanks, Karen.

00:12:32.425 --> 00:12:34.807
I of course enjoyed
that talk very much. Thank you.

00:12:34.831 --> 00:12:38.384
As I recall, we found it
pretty late in its journey towards us.

00:12:38.408 --> 00:12:42.020
Will future technologies like
the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope

00:12:42.044 --> 00:12:43.757
help us detect these things sooner?

00:12:44.353 --> 00:12:48.098
Karen Meech: Yeah. We're hoping that
we'll start to see a lot of these things,

00:12:48.122 --> 00:12:51.941
and ideally, you'd love to find one
as it's approaching the Sun,

00:12:51.965 --> 00:12:54.981
because you want to have time
to do all the science,

00:12:55.005 --> 00:12:56.202
or even more ideal,

00:12:56.226 --> 00:12:58.291
you'd get a spacecraft ready to go,

00:12:58.315 --> 00:13:01.465
parked somewhere in the L4 or L5 position,
