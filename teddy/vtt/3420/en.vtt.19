perhaps even denser, like metal.

00:09:33.305 --> 00:09:35.376
Well, at the very least,
I want to show you

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.542
one of the beautiful
color images that we got

00:09:37.566 --> 00:09:39.706
from one of the ground-based telescopes.

00:09:40.145 --> 00:09:43.144
All right, I admit,
it's not all that spectacular.

00:09:43.168 --> 00:09:44.180
(Laughter)

00:09:44.204 --> 00:09:47.163
We just don't have the resolution.

Even Hubble Space Telescope

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.189
doesn't present a much better view.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.633
But the importance of the Hubble data
was not because of the images,

00:09:55.657 --> 00:09:58.149
but because it extended
our observations out

00:09:58.173 --> 00:10:00.856
to two and a half months
from the discovery,
