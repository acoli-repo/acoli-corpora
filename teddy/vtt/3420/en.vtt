00:00:11.231 --> 00:00:15.351
Each morning, candidate objects
are examined by Pan-STARRS staff

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:18.602
and usually discovered to be no big deal.

00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:21.365

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:26.041
Pan-STARRS spotted an object
moving rapidly between the stars,

00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:30.383
and this time the usual follow-up
measurements of position and speed
