00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:31.604
people that, like you, 
wanted to change their country,

00:03:31.604 --> 00:03:34.484
and they jotted everything down.

00:03:34.484 --> 00:03:38.734
And one of the things that they wrote 
down is when they executed them.

00:03:38.734 --> 00:03:41.715
Inside that yellow rectangle, 
you see a code,

00:03:41.715 --> 00:03:44.026
it's a secret code: 300.

00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:45.523
And then you see a date.

00:03:45.523 --> 00:03:49.196
The 300 means "executed" and the date 
means when they were executed.

00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:52.584
Now that's going to come
into play in a second.

00:03:53.064 --> 00:03:56.689
What we did is we conducted
an exhumation in 2003,

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:01.530
where we exhumed 220 bodies
from 53 graves in a military base.
