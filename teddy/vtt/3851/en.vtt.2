00:00:59.335 --> 00:01:00.902
They want to know what happened.

00:01:00.902 --> 00:01:03.092
They want the bodies of their loved ones.

00:01:03.092 --> 00:01:06.339
But most of all,
what they want is they want you,

00:01:06.339 --> 00:01:10.395
they want everyone to know
that their loved ones did nothing wrong.

00:01:11.515 --> 00:01:16.824
Now, my case was that my father
received death threats in 1980.

00:01:17.203 --> 00:01:18.583
And we left.

00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:20.337
We left Guatemala and we came here.

00:01:20.337 --> 00:01:21.543
So I grew up in New York,

00:01:21.543 --> 00:01:25.323
I grew up in Brooklyn as a matter of fact,
and I went to New Utrecht High School

00:01:25.323 --> 00:01:27.141
and I graduated from Brooklyn College.

00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:28.707
The only thing was that

00:01:28.707 --> 00:01:32.578
I really didn't know what 
was happening in Guatemala.
