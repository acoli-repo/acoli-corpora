00:02:29.656 --> 00:02:33.095
We literally bring the 
skeleton out of the ground.

00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:37.237
Once we have those bodies, though,
we take them back to the city, to our lab,

00:02:37.237 --> 00:02:40.321
and we begin a process of trying
to understand mainly two things:


00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:42.614
One is how people died.

00:02:42.614 --> 00:02:45.718
So here you see a gunshot
wound to the back of the head

00:02:45.718 --> 00:02:48.367
or a machete wound, for example.

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:51.693
The other thing we want to understand
is who they are.

00:02:51.693 --> 00:02:55.152
Whether it's a baby,

00:02:55.152 --> 00:02:56.809
or an adult.

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.949
Whether it's a woman or a man.

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:00.732
But when we're done
with that analysis
