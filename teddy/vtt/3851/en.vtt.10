00:04:57.413 --> 00:05:04.090
So then we said, how many people
were executed on March 29, 1984?

00:05:06.716 --> 00:05:09.034
That's right, six as well.

00:05:09.034 --> 00:05:14.726
So we have Juan de Dios, Hugo,
Moises and Zoilo.

00:05:14.726 --> 00:05:18.574
All of them executed on the same date, 
all captured at different locations

00:05:18.574 --> 00:05:20.328
and at different moments.

00:05:20.328 --> 00:05:21.492
All put in that grave.

00:05:21.492 --> 00:05:24.636
The only thing we needed now
was the DNA of those four families

00:05:24.636 --> 00:05:27.881
So we went and we looked for them
and we found them.

00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:31.844
And we identified those six bodies
and gave them back to the families.
