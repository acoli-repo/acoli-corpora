But when we're done
with that analysis

00:03:00.732 --> 00:03:03.458
what we'll do is we'll take a small 
fragment of the bone

00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:06.272
and we'll extract DNA from it.

00:03:06.272 --> 00:03:07.367
We'll take that DNA

00:03:07.367 --> 00:03:12.127
and then we'll compare it with the
DNA of the families, of course.

00:03:12.127 --> 00:03:15.771
The best way to explain this to you
is by showing you two cases.

00:03:15.771 --> 00:03:18.318
The first is the case 
of the military diary.

00:03:18.318 --> 00:03:22.993
Now this is a document that was smuggled

00:03:22.993 --> 00:03:27.673
And what you see there
is the state following individuals,

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:31.604
people that, like you, 
wanted to change their country,
