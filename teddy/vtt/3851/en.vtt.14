00:06:57.888 --> 00:07:01.021
where the army came in, killed the men,

00:07:01.021 --> 00:07:05.256
and took the women and children 
in helicopters to an unknown location.

00:07:06.026 --> 00:07:06.968
Well, guess what?

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:11.161
The clothing from this grave matched the 
clothing from the region

00:07:11.161 --> 00:07:12.891
where these people were taken from,

00:07:12.891 --> 00:07:15.274
where these women and children 
were taken from.

00:07:15.274 --> 00:07:17.746
So we conducted some DNA analysis,
and guess what?

00:07:18.767 --> 00:07:21.034
We identified Martina Rojas 
and Manuel Chen.

00:07:21.034 --> 00:07:24.109
Both of them disappeared in that case,
and now we could prove it.

00:07:24.109 --> 00:07:27.119
We have physical evidence that
proves that this happened

00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:29.860
and that those people 
were taken to this base.

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.118
Now, Manuel Chen was three years old.
