00:01:28.707 --> 00:01:32.578
I really didn't know what 
was happening in Guatemala.

00:01:32.578 --> 00:01:35.447
I didn't care for it; it was too painful.

00:01:35.447 --> 00:01:39.754
But it wasn't till 1995 that I decided
to do something about it.

00:01:39.754 --> 00:01:40.908
So I went back.

00:01:40.908 --> 00:01:44.488
I went back to Guatemala, 
to look for the bodies,

00:01:44.488 --> 00:01:48.961
to understand what happened
and to look for part of myself as well.

00:01:50.051 --> 00:01:53.414
The way we work is that
we give people information.

00:01:53.414 --> 00:01:56.384
We talk to the family members
and we let them choose.

00:01:56.384 --> 00:01:59.614
We let them decide to tell
us the stories,

00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:01.466
to tell us what they saw,
