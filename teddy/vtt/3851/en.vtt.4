00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:01.466
to tell us what they saw,

00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:03.594
to tell us about their loved ones.

00:02:03.594 --> 00:02:04.880
And even more important,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.878
we let them choose to
give us a piece of themselves.

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:11.354
A piece, an essence, of who they are.

00:02:11.354 --> 00:02:13.611
And that DNA is what we're 
going to compare

00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:16.331
to the DNA that comes
from the skeletons.

00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:19.386
While we're doing that, though,
we're looking for the bodies.

00:02:19.386 --> 00:02:21.374
And these are skeletons by now,

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:24.280
most of these crimes 
happened 32 years ago.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.526
When we find the grave,

00:02:25.526 --> 00:02:29.656
we take out the dirt and eventually clean 
the body, document it, and exhume it.

00:02:29.656 --> 00:02:33.095
We literally bring the 
skeleton out of the ground.
