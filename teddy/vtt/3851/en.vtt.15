00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.118
Now, Manuel Chen was three years old.

00:07:33.118 --> 00:07:37.985
His mother went to the river to wash 
clothes, and she left him with a neighbor.

00:07:37.985 --> 00:07:39.689
That's when the army came

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:43.029
and that's when he was taken away in 
a helicopter and never seen again

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:45.008
until we found him in Grave 15.

00:07:45.008 --> 00:07:50.726
So now with science, with archaeology, 
with anthropology, with genetics,

00:07:50.726 --> 00:07:53.960
what we're doing is, we're
giving a voice to the voiceless.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.645
But we're doing more than that.

00:07:55.645 --> 00:07:57.810
We're actually providing 
evidence for trials,

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.331
like the genocide trial that happened 
last year in Guatemala
