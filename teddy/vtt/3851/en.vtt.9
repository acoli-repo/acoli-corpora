00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.026
and now we have documents
that told us exactly what happened.

00:04:30.026 --> 00:04:33.129
But most important is about
two weeks later,

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:35.816
we go another hit, another match

00:04:35.816 --> 00:04:40.617
from the same grave to Amancio Villatoro.

00:04:40.617 --> 00:04:43.363
The DNA of that body
also matched the DNA of that family.

00:04:43.363 --> 00:04:46.732
And then we noticed
that he was also in the diary.

00:04:46.732 --> 00:04:51.903
But it was amazing to see that he was 
also executed on March 29, 1984.

00:04:51.903 --> 00:04:55.749
So that led us to think, hmm, 
how many bodies were in the grave?

00:04:56.226 --> 00:04:57.413
Six.

00:04:57.413 --> 00:05:04.090
So then we said, how many people
were executed on March 29, 1984?
