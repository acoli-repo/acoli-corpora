00:00:27.858 --> 00:00:30.178
the ones we're still looking for today.

00:00:30.178 --> 00:00:32.738
We call them the Desaparecidos.

00:00:32.738 --> 00:00:35.603
Now, 83 percent of the victims 
are Mayan victims,

00:00:35.603 --> 00:00:38.008
victims that are the descendants

00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:40.744
of the original inhabitants of 
Central America.

00:00:40.744 --> 00:00:44.251
And only about 17 percent are of 
European descent.

00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:46.308
But the most important thing here is that

00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:52.329
the very people who are supposed to 
defend us, the police, the military,

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.995
are the ones that committed
most of the crimes.

00:00:56.035 --> 00:00:59.327
Now the families,
they want information.

00:00:59.335 --> 00:01:00.902
They want to know what happened.
