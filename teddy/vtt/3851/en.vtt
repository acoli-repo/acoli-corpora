00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:04.085
Guatemala is recovering from
a 36-year armed conflict.

00:00:04.085 --> 00:00:06.616
A conflict that was fought
during the Cold War.

00:00:06.616 --> 00:00:10.669
It was really just 
a small leftist insurgency

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:13.836
and a devastating response by the state.

00:00:13.836 --> 00:00:16.678
What we have as a result
is 200,000 civilian victims,

00:00:16.678 --> 00:00:20.332
160,000 of those
killed in the communities:

00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:24.428
small children, men, women, 
the elderly even.

00:00:24.428 --> 00:00:27.858
And then we have 
about 40,000 others, the missing,

00:00:27.858 --> 00:00:30.178
the ones we're still looking for today.
