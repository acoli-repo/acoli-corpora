00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:01.530
where we exhumed 220 bodies
from 53 graves in a military base.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.635
Grave 9, though, matched the family
of Sergio Saul Linares.

00:04:06.635 --> 00:04:09.361
Now Sergio was a professor
at the university.

00:04:09.361 --> 00:04:11.752
He graduted from Iowa State University

00:04:11.752 --> 00:04:14.129
and went back to Guatemala
to change his country.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.003
And he was captured on 
February 23, 1984.

00:04:18.003 --> 00:04:22.092
And if you can see there, he was 
executed on March 29, 1984,

00:04:22.092 --> 00:04:23.658
which was incredible.

00:04:23.658 --> 00:04:26.680
We had the body, we had the family's 
information and their DNA,

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.026
and now we have documents
that told us exactly what happened.
