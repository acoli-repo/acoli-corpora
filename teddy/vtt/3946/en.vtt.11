00:05:32.035 --> 00:05:34.131
that gives a copy editor pause.

Here is one from a story
about Staten Island

00:05:37.404 --> 00:05:39.395
after Hurricane Sandy:

00:05:40.092 --> 00:05:44.101
[A dock that had been broken
in the middle and lost its other half

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:46.509
sloped down toward the water,

00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:50.213
its support pipes and wires
leaning forward

00:05:50.237 --> 00:05:54.048
like when you open a box
of linguine and it slides out.]

00:05:54.072 --> 00:05:55.326

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.480
This would never have got past
the grammarian in the days of yore.
