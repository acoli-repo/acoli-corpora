00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:05.958
Come on! Get it together."

00:03:06.648 --> 00:03:10.156
Belie: to give a false impression.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.227
It should have been "betrayed."

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.301
E.B. White once wrote
of commas in The New Yorker:

00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:21.189

of knives outlining a body."

00:03:21.213 --> 00:03:22.915

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.745

of complaints about commas.

00:03:26.124 --> 00:03:30.120
"Are there really two commas
in 'Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard'?"
