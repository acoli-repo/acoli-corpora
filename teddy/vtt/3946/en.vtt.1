00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.908
We work at the level of the sentence,

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:33.620
maybe the paragraph,

00:00:33.644 --> 00:00:35.722
the words, the punctuation.

00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:38.880
Our business is in the details.

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:44.038
We put the diaeresis, the double dot,
over the "i" in "naïve."

00:00:44.591 --> 00:00:46.518
We impose house style.

00:00:46.542 --> 00:00:49.228
Every publication has a house style.

00:00:49.252 --> 00:00:51.775
The New Yorker's
is particularly distinctive.

00:00:52.503 --> 00:00:55.283
We sometimes get teased for our style.

00:00:55.307 --> 00:00:59.647
Imagine -- we still spell
"teen-ager" with a hyphen,

00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:01.947
as if that word had just been coined.
