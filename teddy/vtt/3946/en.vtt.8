00:03:58.466 --> 00:04:02.506
we might change it up
by using dashes around that phrase:

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.218
"... -- or, at least, restrain --"

00:04:06.392 --> 00:04:07.562
Perfect.

00:04:07.586 --> 00:04:09.164
(Applause)

00:04:09.188 --> 00:04:10.523
Then there's this:

00:04:10.547 --> 00:04:11.985
"Love you, love your magazine,

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:17.206
but can you please stop writing
massive numbers as text?"

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.784
[two and a half million ...]

00:04:18.808 --> 00:04:19.967
No.

00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:22.029
(Laughter)

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:25.155
One last cri de coeur
from a spelling stickler:

00:04:25.179 --> 00:04:30.323
["Those long stringy things
are vocal cords, not chords."]
