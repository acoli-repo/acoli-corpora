00:01:26.696 --> 00:01:30.068
We make suggestions to the author
through the editor

00:01:30.092 --> 00:01:32.713
to improve the emphasis of a sentence

00:01:32.737 --> 00:01:35.371
or point out unintentional repetitions

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:39.391
and supply compelling alternatives.

00:01:40.502 --> 00:01:43.480
Our purpose is to make
the author look good.

00:01:43.504 --> 00:01:46.833
Note that we give our proofs
not directly to the author,

00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:48.376
but to the editor.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.517
This often creates
a good cop/bad cop dynamic

00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:56.065
in which the copy editor -- I'll use that
as an umbrella term --

00:01:56.089 --> 00:01:59.096
is invariably the bad cop.
