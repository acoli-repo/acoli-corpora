We are getting the justice mic'ed,"]

00:07:31.434 --> 00:07:32.584
Mic'ed?

00:07:32.982 --> 00:07:34.979
The music industry spells it "mic"

00:07:35.003 --> 00:07:37.361
because that's how it's spelled
on the equipment.

00:07:37.385 --> 00:07:39.812
I'd never seen it used
as a verb with this spelling,

00:07:39.836 --> 00:07:42.366
and I was distraught
to think that "mic'ed"

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.675
would get into the magazine on my watch.

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:45.710
(Laughter)

00:07:45.734 --> 00:07:49.653
New Yorker style for "microphone"
in its abbreviated form is "mike."

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:53.146
Finally, there was a sticky
grammar and usage issue

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.884
in which the pronoun has to have
the same grammatical number

00:07:56.908 --> 00:07:58.359
as its antecedent.

00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:02.887
[everyone in the vicinity
held their breath]
