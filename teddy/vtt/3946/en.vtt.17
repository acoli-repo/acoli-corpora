00:08:27.372 --> 00:08:32.571
It is my job when I see it in print
to do my best to eliminate it.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.848
I couldn't make it,
"Everyone held her breath,"

00:08:35.872 --> 00:08:37.564
or "Everyone held his breath,"

00:08:37.588 --> 00:08:40.150
or "Everyone held his or her breath."

00:08:40.174 --> 00:08:42.994
Whatever I suggested had to blend in.

00:08:43.018 --> 00:08:44.374
I asked, through the editor,

00:08:44.398 --> 00:08:46.446
if the author would consider changing it

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:49.041
to "All in the vicinity
held their breath,"

00:08:49.065 --> 00:08:50.907
because "all" is plural.

00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:52.088
Nope.

00:08:52.112 --> 00:08:55.342
I tried again: "All those present
held their breath?"

00:08:55.366 --> 00:08:57.587
I thought this sounded vaguely judicial.

00:08:57.611 --> 00:08:58.858
But the editor pointed out

00:08:58.882 --> 00:09:01.287
that we could not have "present"
and "presence"
