00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:02.887
[everyone in the vicinity
held their breath]

00:08:03.491 --> 00:08:07.686
"Their" is plural and "everyone,"
its antecedent, is singular.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.648
You would never say,
"Everyone were there."

00:08:10.672 --> 00:08:14.513
Everyone was there. Everyone is here.

00:08:14.537 --> 00:08:18.151
But people say things like,
"Everyone held their breath" all the time.

00:08:18.175 --> 00:08:19.394
To give it legitimacy,

00:08:19.418 --> 00:08:22.841
copy editors call it
"the singular 'their,'"

00:08:22.865 --> 00:08:25.930
as if calling it singular
makes it no longer plural.

00:08:25.954 --> 00:08:27.348
(Laughter)

00:08:27.372 --> 00:08:32.571
It is my job when I see it in print
to do my best to eliminate it.
