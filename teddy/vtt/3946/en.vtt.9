["Those long stringy things
are vocal cords, not chords."]

00:04:30.347 --> 00:04:32.496
The outraged reader added,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.353
"I'm sure I'm not the first to write

00:04:34.377 --> 00:04:37.598
regarding this egregious
proofreading error,

00:04:37.622 --> 00:04:40.028
but I'm equally sure I won't be the last.

00:04:40.052 --> 00:04:41.272
Fie!"

00:04:41.296 --> 00:04:43.517
(Laughter)

00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:45.426
I used to like getting mail.

00:04:47.222 --> 00:04:49.818
There is a pact
between writers and editors.

00:04:49.842 --> 00:04:52.221
The editor never sells out the writer,

00:04:52.245 --> 00:04:55.797
never goes public about bad jokes
that had to be cut

00:04:55.821 --> 00:04:58.271
or stories that went on too long.

00:04:58.295 --> 00:05:03.153
A great editor saves a writer
from her excesses.
