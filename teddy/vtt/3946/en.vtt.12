00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.480
This would never have got past
the grammarian in the days of yore.

00:06:00.504 --> 00:06:01.743
But what could I do?

00:06:01.767 --> 00:06:04.371
Technically, the "like" should be an "as,"

00:06:04.395 --> 00:06:05.839
but it sounds ridiculous,

00:06:05.863 --> 00:06:09.576
as if the author were about to embark
on an extended Homeric simile --

00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:13.371
"as when you open a box of linguine."

00:06:13.395 --> 00:06:14.704
(Laughter)

00:06:14.728 --> 00:06:19.504
I decided that the hurricane
conferred poetic justice on Sandy

00:06:19.528 --> 00:06:21.179
and let the sentence stand.

00:06:21.203 --> 00:06:22.290
(Laughter)

00:06:22.314 --> 00:06:24.322
Generally, if I think something is wrong,

00:06:24.346 --> 00:06:25.838
I query it three times.

00:06:25.862 --> 00:06:29.717
I told Sandy that not long ago
in a moment of indiscretion and he said,

00:06:29.741 --> 00:06:31.252
"Only three?"
