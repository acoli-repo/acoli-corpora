00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:30.137
That was the last month
for the Year of the Horse.

00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:32.763
It's not because they like horses so much,

00:03:32.787 --> 00:03:36.256
it's because they try to avoid
having unlucky Goat babies.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.358
(Laughter)

00:03:37.382 --> 00:03:40.161
If you are a Goat, please don't feel bad.

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:41.915
Those are Goat babies.

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.049
They don't look like losers to me.

00:03:44.073 --> 00:03:45.238
(Laughter)

00:03:45.262 --> 00:03:48.024
Tiger is another undesirable animal,

00:03:48.048 --> 00:03:49.856
due to its volatile temperament.

00:03:50.337 --> 00:03:54.190
Many Chinese regions
saw a sharp decline of birthrate

00:03:54.214 --> 00:03:55.411
during those years.

00:03:56.122 --> 00:03:59.792
Perhaps one should consider
zodiac in reverse,

00:03:59.816 --> 00:04:04.020
as those Tiger and Goat babies
will face much less competition.
