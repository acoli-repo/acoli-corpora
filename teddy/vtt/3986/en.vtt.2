The Chinese zodiac is different.

00:01:01.948 --> 00:01:05.126
It's a 12-year cycle labeled with animals,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.726
starting with a Rat and ending with a Pig,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.092
and has no association
with constellations.

00:01:11.663 --> 00:01:16.512
For example, if you were born
in 1975, you are a Rabbit.

00:01:17.273 --> 00:01:19.174
Can you see your zodiac sign there?

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:25.424
Our Chinese ancestors constructed
a very complicated theoretical framework

00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:30.089
based on yin and yang, the five elements
and the 12 zodiac animals.
