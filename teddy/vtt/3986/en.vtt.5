00:02:28.702 --> 00:02:31.945
We believe some animals
are luckier than the others,

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:33.664
such as the Dragon.

00:02:33.688 --> 00:02:35.546
Unlike the Western tradition,

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.154
the Chinese Dragon is a symbol
for power, strength and wealth.

00:02:40.178 --> 00:02:42.861
It's everyone's dream
to have a Dragon baby.

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.475
Jack Ma's parents
must have been very proud.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.061
And they are not the only ones.

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:50.982
In 2012, the Year of the Dragon,

00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:53.305
the birthrate in China,
Hong Kong and Taiwan

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.016
increased by five percent.

00:02:55.596 --> 00:02:58.961
That means another
one million more babies.
