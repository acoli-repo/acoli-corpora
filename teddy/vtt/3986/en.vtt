Have you ever been asked
by your Chinese friend,

00:00:03.713 --> 00:00:05.368
"What is your zodiac sign?"

00:00:05.947 --> 00:00:08.432
Don't think they are making small talk.

00:00:08.456 --> 00:00:10.383
If you say, "I'm a Monkey,"

00:00:10.407 --> 00:00:11.766
they immediately know

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.186
you are either 24, 36, 48 or 60 years old.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.216
(Laughter)

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.798
Asking a zodiac sign is a polite way
of asking your age.

00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:24.505
By revealing your zodiac sign,
you are also being evaluated.

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.569
Judgments are being made
about your fortune or misfortune,

00:00:28.593 --> 00:00:30.971
your personality, career prospects
