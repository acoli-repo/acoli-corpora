00:00:00.515 --> 00:00:04.118
The universe is teeming with planets.

00:00:04.118 --> 00:00:05.994
I want us, in the next decade,

00:00:05.994 --> 00:00:08.387
to build a space telescope that'll be able to image

00:00:08.387 --> 00:00:10.488
an Earth about another star

00:00:10.488 --> 00:00:13.232
and figure out whether it can harbor life.

00:00:13.232 --> 00:00:15.392
My colleagues at the NASA
Jet Propulsion Laboratory

00:00:15.392 --> 00:00:18.253
at Princeton and I are working on technology

00:00:18.253 --> 00:00:21.791
that will be able to do just that in the coming years.

00:00:21.791 --> 00:00:23.776
Astronomers now believe that every star

00:00:23.776 --> 00:00:25.716
in the galaxy has a planet,

00:00:25.716 --> 00:00:27.992
and they speculate that up to one fifth of them

00:00:27.992 --> 00:00:29.068
have an Earth-like planet

00:00:29.068 --> 00:00:30.760
that might be able to harbor life,
