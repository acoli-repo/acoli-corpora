Recently, I spent several days exploring
Kashgar, a city in Xinjiang,

00:00:05.334 --> 00:00:06.711
northwest China.

00:00:07.128 --> 00:00:09.714
I got to wander the streets
of the old town

00:00:09.714 --> 00:00:13.426
and visit the bazaar and several mosques
and take in the sights.

00:00:14.052 --> 00:00:16.137
I've never been to Kashgar personally,

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.515
but through the YouTube videos
and Instagram posts of tourists,

00:00:19.557 --> 00:00:22.977
I was able to experience the city
at a key moment in time:

00:00:23.436 --> 00:00:25.438
October 2017,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.358
just as the mass detention campaign
in the region was gathering pace.
