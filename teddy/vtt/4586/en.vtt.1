00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.460
So what's the big deal?

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.991
Of course, you probably know the answer.

and the amount of it in circulation

00:00:55.376 --> 00:00:58.372
depended on a government's gold
or silver reserves.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.930
But after the US abolished
