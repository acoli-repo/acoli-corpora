00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:01.894
So most economists believe that
while too much of either is dangerous,

00:03:01.918 --> 00:03:06.806
a small, consistent amount of inflation
is necessary to encourage economic growth.

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:10.234
The Fed uses vast amounts of economic data

00:03:10.258 --> 00:03:13.597
to determine how much currency
should be in circulation,

00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:15.575
including previous rates of inflation,

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.881
international trends,
and the unemployment rate.

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.443
Like in the story of Goldilocks,

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:22.325
they need to get the numbers just right

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.921
in order to stimulate growth
and keep people employed,

00:03:24.945 --> 00:03:27.670
without letting inflation
reach disruptive levels.

00:03:27.694 --> 00:03:29.044
The Fed not only determines

00:03:29.068 --> 00:03:32.219
how much that paper
in your wallet is worth
