00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:31.133
means that the money in your wallet today
will be worth less tomorrow,

00:02:31.157 --> 00:02:33.156
making you want to spend it right away.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.013
While this would stimulate business,
it would also encourage overconsumption,

00:02:37.037 --> 00:02:39.875
or hoarding commodities,
like food and fuel,

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:41.620
raising their prices

00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:44.481
and leading to consumer shortages
and even more inflation.

00:02:45.704 --> 00:02:49.096
But deflation would make people
want to hold onto their money,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.009
and a decrease in consumer spending

00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:52.567
would reduce business profits,

00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:55.930
leading to more unemployment
and a further decrease in spending,

00:02:55.954 --> 00:02:58.227
causing the economy to keep shrinking.

00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:01.894
So most economists believe that
while too much of either is dangerous,
