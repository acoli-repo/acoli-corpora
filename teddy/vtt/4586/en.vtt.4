00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.832
which is to be exchanged
for goods and services.

00:02:01.856 --> 00:02:04.047
If the total amount
of currency in circulation

00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:08.794
increases faster than the total value
of goods and services in the economy,

00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:10.675
then each individual piece will be able

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.342
to buy a smaller portion
of those things than before.

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:15.204
This is called inflation.

00:02:15.228 --> 00:02:16.652
On the other hand,

00:02:16.676 --> 00:02:18.438
if the money supply remains the same,

00:02:18.462 --> 00:02:20.594
while more goods
and services are produced,

00:02:20.618 --> 00:02:22.564
each dollar's value would increase

00:02:22.588 --> 00:02:24.817
in a process known as deflation.

00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:26.616
So which is worse?

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.823
Too much inflation

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:31.133
means that the money in your wallet today
will be worth less tomorrow,
