00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.930
But after the US abolished
this system in 1971,

00:01:01.954 --> 00:01:05.762
the dollar became
what is known as fiat money,

00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:08.197
meaning not linked
to any external resource

00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:11.159
but relying instead solely
on government policy

00:01:11.183 --> 00:01:13.620
to decide how much currency to print.

00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:16.582
Which branch of our government
sets this policy?

00:01:16.606 --> 00:01:19.572
The Executive, the Legislative,
or the Judicial?

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:22.044
The surprising answer is:
none of the above!

00:01:22.068 --> 00:01:26.801
In fact, monetary policy is set
by an independent Federal Reserve System,

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:28.552
or the Fed,

00:01:28.576 --> 00:01:32.595
made up of 12 regional banks
in major cities around the country.
