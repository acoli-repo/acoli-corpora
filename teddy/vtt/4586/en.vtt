If you tried to pay for something
with a piece of paper,

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:11.350
you might run into some trouble.

00:00:11.374 --> 00:00:15.311
Unless, of course, the piece of paper
was a hundred dollar bill.

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:18.890
But what is it that makes that bill
so much more interesting and valuable

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:20.769
than other pieces of paper?

00:00:20.793 --> 00:00:23.421
After all, there's not much
you can do with it.

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:25.055
You can't eat it.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.556
You can't build things with it.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.272
And burning it is actually illegal.

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:30.460
So what's the big deal?
