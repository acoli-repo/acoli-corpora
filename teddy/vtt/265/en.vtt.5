00:02:28.243 --> 00:02:31.196
We break down the walls
of our medical maze

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.602
by taking the challenges
of Medicaid patients,

00:02:33.626 --> 00:02:36.942
turning them into opportunities,
and pocketing the difference.

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:41.244
The nuts and bolts
may seem simple, but they add up.

00:02:41.268 --> 00:02:43.648
For example, we have no appointments.

00:02:44.053 --> 00:02:45.632
We're walk-in only.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.006
Of course, that's how it works
at the emergency room,

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.040
at urgent cares and at Taco Bell.

00:02:52.527 --> 00:02:53.529
(Laughter)

00:02:53.553 --> 00:02:56.153
But not usually
at family doctor's offices.

00:02:56.857 --> 00:02:58.007
Why do we do it?

00:02:58.633 --> 00:03:01.903
Because Nasra can't call
for an appointment.
