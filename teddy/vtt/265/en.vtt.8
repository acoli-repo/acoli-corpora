00:03:59.923 --> 00:04:02.391
our medical providers
room their own patients,

00:04:02.415 --> 00:04:06.247
and our providers stay in one room
instead of alternating between rooms.

00:04:07.383 --> 00:04:10.875
Cutting steps cuts costs
and increases customer satisfaction.

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:16.260
We also hand out free medicines,
right from our exam room:

00:04:16.284 --> 00:04:19.093
over-the-counter ones
and some prescription ones, too.

00:04:19.117 --> 00:04:21.164
If Nasra's baby is sick,

00:04:21.188 --> 00:04:25.466
we put a bottle of children's Tylenol
or amoxicillin right in her hand.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.440
She can take that baby straight back home
instead of stopping at the pharmacy.
