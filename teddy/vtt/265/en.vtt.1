If your neighbors have a family of four
and make less than $33,000 a year,

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:32.378
then they can get Medicaid.

00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:34.944
But they can't find a doctor to see them.

00:00:35.498 --> 00:00:36.847
A study by Merritt Hawkins

00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:39.633
found that only 20 percent
of the family doctors in Denver

00:00:39.657 --> 00:00:41.457
take any Medicaid patients.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.085
And of those 20 percent, some have caps,
like five Medicaid patients a month.

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:50.708
Others make Medicaid patients
wait months to be seen,

00:00:50.732 --> 00:00:53.707
but will see you today,
if you have Blue Cross.

00:00:54.303 --> 00:00:57.605
This form of classist
discrimination is legal

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.469
and is not just a problem in Denver.
