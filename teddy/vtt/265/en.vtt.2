Almost half the family
doctors in the country

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.473
refuse to see Medicaid patients.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.506
Why?

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.224
Well, because Medicaid pays less
than private insurance

00:01:09.248 --> 00:01:13.248
and because Medicaid patients
are seen as more challenging.

00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:16.878
Some show up late for appointments,
some don't speak English

00:01:16.902 --> 00:01:19.871
and some have trouble
following instructions.

00:01:20.784 --> 00:01:23.588
I thought about this
while in medical school.

00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:28.736
If I could design a practice
that caters to low-income folks

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.760
instead of avoiding them,
