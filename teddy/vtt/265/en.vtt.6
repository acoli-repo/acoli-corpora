00:02:58.633 --> 00:03:01.903
Because Nasra can't call
for an appointment.

00:03:01.927 --> 00:03:05.238
She has a phone, but she
doesn't have phone minutes.

00:03:05.262 --> 00:03:08.394
She can't speak English,
and she can't navigate a phone tree.

00:03:09.518 --> 00:03:11.820
And she can't show up on time
for an appointment

00:03:11.844 --> 00:03:14.180
because she doesn't have a car,
she takes the bus,

00:03:14.204 --> 00:03:17.530
and she takes care of three kids
plus her disabled father.

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:19.664
So we have no appointments;

00:03:19.688 --> 00:03:21.450
she shows up when she wants,

00:03:21.474 --> 00:03:24.292
but usually waits less
than 15 minutes to be seen.

00:03:25.165 --> 00:03:28.565
She then spends as much time
with us as she needs.

00:03:29.394 --> 00:03:32.386
Sometimes that's 40 minutes,
usually it's less than five.
