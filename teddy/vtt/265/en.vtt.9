00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.662
I don't know about you, but I get sick
just looking at all those choices.

00:04:35.053 --> 00:04:37.587
Nasra doesn't stand a chance in there.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.156
We also text patients.

00:04:41.522 --> 00:04:43.387
We're open evenings and weekends.

00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:44.593
We do home visits.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.838
We've jumped dead car batteries.

00:04:46.862 --> 00:04:48.085
(Laughter)

00:04:48.109 --> 00:04:52.426
With customer satisfaction so high,
we've never had to advertise,

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.925
yet are growing at 25 percent a year.

00:04:56.292 --> 00:04:59.150
And we've become real good
at working with Medicaid,

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:02.276
since it's pretty much the only
insurance company we deal with.
