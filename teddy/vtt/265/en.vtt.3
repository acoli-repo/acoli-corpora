00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:41.720
So after residency, I opened up shop,
doing underserved medicine.

00:01:41.744 --> 00:01:44.401
Not as a nonprofit,
but as a private practice.

00:01:44.823 --> 00:01:48.833
A small business
seeing only resettled refugees.

That was six years ago,

00:01:51.267 --> 00:01:54.720

50,000 refugee medical visits.
