00:06:59.287 --> 00:07:01.335
And then, instead of taking
that money home,

00:07:01.359 --> 00:07:04.752
I put it back into the refugee community
as a business expense.

00:07:05.794 --> 00:07:07.318
This is Mango House.

00:07:07.342 --> 00:07:09.275
My version of a medical home.

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:12.794
In it, we have programs
to feed and clothe the poor,

00:07:12.818 --> 00:07:15.893
an after-school program, English classes,

00:07:15.917 --> 00:07:20.752
churches, dentist, legal help,
mental health and the scout groups.

00:07:21.821 --> 00:07:24.274
These programs are run
by tenant organizations

00:07:24.298 --> 00:07:26.172
and amazing staff,

00:07:26.196 --> 00:07:31.201
but all receive some amount of funding
form profits from my clinic.
