00:08:58.619 --> 00:09:00.635
you wrote on your school
application essays

00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:03.316
that you wanted to help
those less fortunate.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.607
But then you had your idealism
beaten out of you in training.

00:09:06.922 --> 00:09:09.056
Your creativity bred out of you.

00:09:09.922 --> 00:09:11.795
It doesn't have to be that way.

00:09:12.383 --> 00:09:16.249
You can choose underserved medicine
as a lifestyle specialty.

00:09:17.022 --> 00:09:18.578
Or you can be a specialist

00:09:18.602 --> 00:09:21.469
who cuts cost in order to see
low-income folks.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.171
And for the rest of you,
who don't work in health care,

00:09:25.195 --> 00:09:27.218
what did you write on your applications?

00:09:27.242 --> 00:09:30.734
Most of us wanted to save the world,
to make a difference.
