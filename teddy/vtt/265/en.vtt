Colfax Avenue, here in Denver, Colorado,

00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:09.160
was once called the longest,
wickedest street in America.

00:00:10.252 --> 00:00:13.450
My office is there in the same place --
it's a medical desert.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:16.370
There are government clinics
and hospitals nearby,

00:00:16.394 --> 00:00:19.362
but they're not enough to handle
the poor who live in the area.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.998
By poor, I mean those who are on Medicaid.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:25.483
Not just for the homeless;
20 percent of this country is on Medicaid.

00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:30.555
