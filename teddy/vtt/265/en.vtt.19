00:09:27.242 --> 00:09:30.734
Most of us wanted to save the world,
to make a difference.

00:09:31.885 --> 00:09:33.956
Maybe you've been
successful in your career

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.204
but are now looking for that meaning?

00:09:36.752 --> 00:09:38.219
How can you get there?

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.069
I don't just mean giving
a few dollars or a few hours;

00:09:42.093 --> 00:09:47.674
I mean how can you use your expertise
to innovate new ways of serving others.

00:09:48.419 --> 00:09:50.135
It might be easier than you think.

00:09:51.617 --> 00:09:54.617
The only way we're going to bridge
the underserved medicine gap

00:09:54.641 --> 00:09:56.664
is by seeing it as a business opportunity.

00:09:56.688 --> 00:09:59.172
The only way we're going to bridge
the inequality gap

00:09:59.196 --> 00:10:03.404
is by recognizing our privileges
and using them to help others.
