00:02:02.287 --> 00:02:05.144
Ninety percent of our patients
have Medicaid,

00:02:05.168 --> 00:02:07.429
and most of the rest, we see for free.

00:02:07.945 --> 00:02:10.294
Most doctors say you can't
make money on Medicaid,

00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:12.149
but we're doing it just fine.

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:13.323
How?

00:02:13.807 --> 00:02:16.673
Well, if this were real capitalism,
then I wouldn't tell you,

00:02:16.697 --> 00:02:18.421
because you'd become my competition.

00:02:18.445 --> 00:02:19.941
(Laughter)

00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:22.381
But I call this
"bleeding-heart" capitalism.

00:02:22.405 --> 00:02:23.758
(Laughter)

00:02:23.782 --> 00:02:27.179
And we need more people doing this,
not less, so here's how.

00:02:28.243 --> 00:02:31.196
We break down the walls
of our medical maze
