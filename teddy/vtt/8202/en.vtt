00:00:00.316 --> 00:00:05.756
So if we think of the deep ocean
as being this dark,

00:00:05.756 --> 00:00:08.116
deep, horrifying place
at the bottom of the Earth,

00:00:08.116 --> 00:00:12.916
it's easy to dismiss it as something
which is out of sight and out of mind.

00:00:12.956 --> 00:00:15.676
But myself and colleagues have been there,

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:19.436
and I think if we take some time
to think about the deep ocean

00:00:19.476 --> 00:00:20.636
as part of our planet,

00:00:20.636 --> 00:00:24.716
we all might want to protect it
as much as any other marine environment.

00:00:25.116 --> 00:00:29.556
Let your imagination tell you
what a deep-sea animal looks like.
