00:02:29.976 --> 00:02:31.916
where there are no predators.

00:02:31.916 --> 00:02:35.336
As long as these predator-free circumstances last,

00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:37.666
the birds thrive, but they are vulnerable

00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:39.506
to changes in their environment.

00:02:39.506 --> 00:02:41.746
For instance, human settlers bring dogs,

00:02:41.746 --> 00:02:45.106
cats, and stowaway rodents to islands.

00:02:45.106 --> 00:02:47.586
These animals often prey on flightless birds

00:02:47.586 --> 00:02:49.936
and can drive them to extinction.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:53.416
In New Zealand, stoats introduced by European settlers

00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:56.726
have threatened many native species of flightless bird.

00:02:56.726 --> 00:02:59.646
Some have gone extinct while others are endangered.

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:02.486
So in spite of the energy-saving advantages
