00:01:58.536 --> 00:02:01.946
the birds’ bodies change to match this new behavior.

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:04.736
Their bones, once hollow to minimize weight,

00:02:04.736 --> 00:02:06.026
become dense.

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:08.526
Their sturdy feathers turn to fluff.

00:02:08.526 --> 00:02:09.876
Their wings shrink,

00:02:09.876 --> 00:02:13.116
and in some cases disappear entirely.

00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:15.896
And the keel-like protrusion on their sternums,

00:02:15.896 --> 00:02:19.576
where the flight muscles attach, shrinks or disappears,

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:22.946
except in penguins, who repurpose their flight muscles

00:02:22.946 --> 00:02:25.296
and keels for swimming.

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:27.716
Most often, flightlessness evolves after

00:02:27.716 --> 00:02:29.976
a bird species flies to an island

00:02:29.976 --> 00:02:31.916
where there are no predators.
