00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:02.486
So in spite of the energy-saving advantages

00:03:02.486 --> 00:03:05.566
of flightlessness, many flightless bird species have

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:10.036
only a short run before going the way of the dodo.

00:03:10.036 --> 00:03:12.396
But a few flightless birds have survived on

00:03:12.396 --> 00:03:15.226
mainlands alongside predators aplenty.

00:03:15.226 --> 00:03:17.866
Unlike most small flightless species that

00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:20.386
come and go quickly, these giants have been

00:03:20.386 --> 00:03:23.256
flightless for tens of millions of years.

00:03:23.256 --> 00:03:25.986
Their ancestors appeared around the same time

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:28.566
as the first small mammals, and they were probably

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:31.226
able to survive because they were evolving—
