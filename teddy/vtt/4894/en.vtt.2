00:00:56.195 --> 00:01:00.515
and speedy ostriches, giant emus, and tiny kiwis.

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:04.325
Though the common ancestor of all modern birds could fly,

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:06.955
many different bird species have independently

00:01:06.955 --> 00:01:08.825
lost their flight.

00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:10.835
Flight can have incredible benefits,

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:13.545
especially for escaping predators, hunting,

00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:15.665
and traveling long distances.

00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:18.435
But it also has high costs:

00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:20.595
it consumes huge amounts of energy

00:01:20.595 --> 00:01:23.845
and limits body size and weight.

00:01:23.845 --> 00:01:26.095
A bird that doesn’t fly conserves energy,

00:01:26.095 --> 00:01:28.655
so it may be able to survive on a scarcer

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:32.535
or less nutrient-rich food source than one that flies.
