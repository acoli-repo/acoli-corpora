00:00:06.715 --> 00:00:09.915
In the lush rainforests of Australia, birds roost

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:13.595
in the low branches and amble across the forest floor,

00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:16.395
enjoying the shade and tropical fruits.

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:18.625
But the jungle isn’t theirs alone.

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:21.005
A dingo is prowling in the shadows,

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.095
and fruit won’t satisfy his appetite.

00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:26.125
The birds flee to safety

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.985
all but the cassowary,

00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:30.405
who can’t clear the ground on her puny wings.
