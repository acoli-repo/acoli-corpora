00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:31.226
able to survive because they were evolving—

00:03:31.226 --> 00:03:33.446
and growing—at the same time

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:36.036
as their mammalian predators.

00:03:36.036 --> 00:03:39.136
Most of these birds, like emus and ostriches,

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:41.836
ballooned in size, weighing hundreds of

00:03:41.836 --> 00:03:43.956
pounds more than wings can lift.

00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:46.766
Their legs grew thick, their feet sturdy,

00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:49.276
and newly developed thigh muscles turned

00:03:49.276 --> 00:03:52.036
them into formidable runners.

00:03:52.036 --> 00:03:54.116
Though they no longer use them to fly,

00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:55.986
many of these birds repurpose

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:57.686
their wings for other means.

00:03:57.686 --> 00:04:00.226
They can be spotted tucking their heads beneath them
