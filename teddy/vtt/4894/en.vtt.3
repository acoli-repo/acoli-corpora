00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:32.535
or less nutrient-rich food source than one that flies.

00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:35.226
The Takahe of New Zealand, for example,

00:01:35.226 --> 00:01:36.986
lives almost entirely on the

00:01:36.986 --> 00:01:40.466
soft base of alpine grasses.

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.936
For birds that nest or feed on the ground,

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.516
this predisposition to flightlessness

00:01:45.516 --> 00:01:47.546
can be even stronger.

00:01:47.546 --> 00:01:49.976
When a bird species doesn’t face

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:53.356
specific pressures to fly, it can stop flying

00:01:53.356 --> 00:01:55.906
in as quickly as a few generations.

00:01:55.906 --> 00:01:58.536
Then, over thousands or millions of years,

00:01:58.536 --> 00:02:01.946
the birds’ bodies change to match this new behavior.
