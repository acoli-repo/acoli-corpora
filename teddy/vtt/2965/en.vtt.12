00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.016
it only opens then closes the traps
a handful of times

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.680
until that trap dies.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.816
So therefore, it wants
to make really darn sure

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.256
that there's a meal inside of it
before the flytrap snaps shut.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.480
So how does it do that?

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.896
It counts the number of seconds

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.136
between successive
touching of those hairs.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.576
And so the idea is
that there's a high probability,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.056
if there's a fly inside of there,
they're going to be quick together,

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.296
and so when it gets the first
action potential,

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.736
it starts counting, one, two,

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.976
and if it gets to 20
and it doesn't fire again,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.416
then it's not going to close,
