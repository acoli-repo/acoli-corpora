00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.640
and sent it into
all the stems of the mimosa?

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.456
We should be able to create
the behavior of the mimosas

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.376
without actually touching it ourselves.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.416
And so if you'll allow me,

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.895
I'm going to go ahead
and trigger this mimosa right now

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:46.736
by touching on the hairs
of the Venus flytrap.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.360
So we're going to send information
about touch from one plant to another.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.336
So there you see it.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.576
So --

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.616
(Applause)
