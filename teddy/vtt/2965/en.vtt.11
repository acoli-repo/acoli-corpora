00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.000
However, the flytrap doesn't close.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.096
And to understand why that is,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.336
we need to know a little bit more
about the behavior of the flytrap.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.656
Number one is that it takes
a long time to open the traps back up --

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.856
you know, about 24 to 48 hours
if there's no fly inside of it.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.576
And so it takes a lot of energy.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.816
And two, it doesn't need to eat
that many flies throughout the year.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.496
Only a handful. It gets
most of its energy from the sun.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.736
It's just trying to replace
some nutrients in the ground with flies.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.016
And the third thing is,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.016
it only opens then closes the traps
a handful of times
