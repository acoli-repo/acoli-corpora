00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.416
then it's not going to close,

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.296
but if it does it within there,
then the flytrap will close.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.776
So we're going to go back now.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.816
I'm going to touch
the Venus flytrap again.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.856
I've been talking
for more than 20 seconds.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.840
So we can see what happens
when I touch the hair a second time.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.176
So what do we get?
We get a second action potential,

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.096
but again, the leaf doesn't close.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.056
So now if I go back in there

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.976
and if I'm a fly moving around,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.176
I'm going to be touching
the leaf a few times.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.616
I'm going to go and brush it a few times.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.056
And immediately,

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.816
the flytrap closes.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.976
So here we are seeing the flytrap
actually doing a computation.
