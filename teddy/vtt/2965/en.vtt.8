00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.656
we're going to record the electrical
potential from this plant, this mimosa.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.176
And so what we're going to do
is I've got a wire wrapped around the stem,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.280
and I've got the ground electrode where?

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.296
In the ground. It's an electrical
engineering joke. Alright.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.656
(Laughter)

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.416
Alright. So I'm going to go ahead
and tap the leaf here,

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.815
and I want you to look
at the electrical recording

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.800
that we're going to see inside the plant.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.416
Whoa. It is so big,
I've got to scale it down.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.856
Alright. So what is that?

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.856
That is an action potential
that is happening inside the plant.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.136
Why was it happening?
