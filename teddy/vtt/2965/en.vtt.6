00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.296
And so I want you to remember the shape
of what we'll be looking at right here,

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.176
because this is going to be important.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.616
This is a way that the brain
encodes information

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.336
in the form of an action potential.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.680
So now let's turn to some plants.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.456
So I'm going to first
introduce you to the mimosa,

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.696
not the drink, but the Mimosa pudica,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.056
and this is a plant that's found
in Central America and South America,

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.056
and it has behaviors.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.176
And the first behavior
I'm going to show you

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.296
is if I touch the leaves here,

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.520
you get to see that the leaves
tend to curl up.
