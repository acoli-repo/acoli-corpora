He called it the most wonderful
plant in the world.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.056
This is a plant
that was an evolutionary wonder.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.056
This is a plant that moves quickly,

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.376
which is rare,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.376
and it's carnivorous, which is also rare.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.856
And this is in the same plant.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.336
But I'm here today to tell you

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.776
that's not even the coolest thing
about this plant.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.320
The coolest thing
is that the plant can count.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.936
So in order to show that,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.136
we have to get some vocabulary
out of the way.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.416
So I'm going to do what we do
in the classroom with students.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.296
We're going to do
an experiment on electrophysiology,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.456
which is the recording
of the body's electrical signal,
