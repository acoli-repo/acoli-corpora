00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.056
But what about fast-moving plants?

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.176
Now, in 1760, Arthur Dobbs,
the Royal Governor of North Carolina,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.736
made a pretty fascinating discovery.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.616
In the swamps behind his house,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.296
he found a plant that would spring shut

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.000
every time a bug would fall in between it.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.656
He called this plant the flytrap,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.616
and within a decade,
it made its way over to Europe,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.176
where eventually the great Charles Darwin
got to study this plant,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.216
and this plant absolutely blew him away.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.776
He called it the most wonderful
plant in the world.
