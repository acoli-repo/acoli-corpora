00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.416
that things that move tend to have brains.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.056
And that's absolutely correct.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.536
Our nervous system evolved
because it is electrical.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.696
It's fast, so we can quickly respond
to stimuli in the world

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.936
and move if we need to.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.176
But you can go back
and push back on a student,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.256
and say, "Well, you know,
you say that plants don't have brains,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.736
but plants do move."

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.616
Anyone who has grown a plant

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.616
has noticed that the plant will move

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.456
and face the sun.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.616
But they'll say,
"But that's a slow movement.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.656
You know, that doesn't count.
That could be a chemical process."

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.056
But what about fast-moving plants?
