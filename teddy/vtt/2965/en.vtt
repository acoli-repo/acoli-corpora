00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.016
I'm a neuroscientist,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.336
and I'm the co-founder of Backyard Brains,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.216
and our mission is to train
the next generation of neuroscientists

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.256
by taking graduate-level
neuroscience research equipment

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.720
and making it available for kids
in middle schools and high schools.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.376
And so when we go into the classroom,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.296
one way to get them thinking
about the brain, which is very complex,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.256
is to ask them a very simple
question about neuroscience,

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.320
and that is, "What has a brain?"

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.296
When we ask that,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.375
students will instantly tell you
that their cat or dog has a brain,
