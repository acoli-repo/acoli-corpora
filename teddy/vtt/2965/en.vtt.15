00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.856
which is the ability
to communicate using electricity.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.136
It just uses slightly
different ions than we do,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.176
but it's actually doing the same thing.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.376
So just to show you

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.696
the ubiquitous nature
of these action potentials,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.936
we saw it in the Venus flytrap,

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.096
we've seen an action
potential in the mimosa.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.496
We've even seen
an action potential in a human.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.736
Now, this is the euro of the brain.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.896
It's the way that all
information is passed.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.736
And so what we can do
is we can use those action potentials

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.256
to pass information

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.016
between species of plants.
