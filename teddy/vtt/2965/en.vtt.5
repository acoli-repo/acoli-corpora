WEBVTT

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.456
which is the recording
of the body's electrical signal,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.776
either coming from neurons
or from muscles.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.136
And I'm putting some electrodes
here on my wrists.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.496
As I hook them up,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.696
we're going to be able to see a signal

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.176
on the screen here.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.096
And this signal may be familiar to you.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.296
It's called the EKG,
or the electrocardiogram.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.776
And this is coming
from neurons in my heart

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.336
that are firing
what's called action potentials,

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.216
potential meaning voltage and action
meaning it moves quickly up and down,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.696
which causes my heart to fire,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.536
which then causes
the signal that you see here.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.296
And so I want you to remember the shape
of what we'll be looking at right here,
