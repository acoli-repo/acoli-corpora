00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.375
students will instantly tell you
that their cat or dog has a brain,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.976
and most will say that a mouse
or even a small insect has a brain,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.816
but almost nobody says
that a plant or a tree

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.016
or a shrub has a brain.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.536
And so when you push --

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.136
because this could actually
help describe a little bit

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.336
how the brain actually functions --

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.576
so you push and say,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.136
"Well, what is it that makes
living things have brains versus not?"

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.616
And often they'll come back
with the classification

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.416
that things that move tend to have brains.
