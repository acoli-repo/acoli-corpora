00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.520
you get to see that the leaves
tend to curl up.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.536
And then the second behavior is,

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.736
if I tap the leaf,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.576
the entire branch seems to fall down.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.136
So why does it do that?

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.776
It's not really known to science.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.016
One of the reasons why
could be that it scares away insects

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.216
or it looks less appealing to herbivores.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.736
But how does it do that?
Now, that's interesting.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.896
We can do an experiment to find out.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.376
So what we're going to do now,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.816
just like I recorded
the electrical potential from my body,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.656
we're going to record the electrical
potential from this plant, this mimosa.
