00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.016
between species of plants.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.456
And so this is our interspecies
plant-to-plant communicator,

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.656
and what we've done
is we've created a brand new experiment

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.216
where we're going to record
the action potential from a Venus flytrap,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.016
and we're going to send it
into the sensitive mimosa.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.776
So I want you to recall what happens

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.736
when we touch the leaves of the mimosa.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.416
It has touch receptors
that are sending that information

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.536
back down in the form
of an action potential.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.896
And so what would happen

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.536
if we took the action potential
from the Venus flytrap

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.640
and sent it into
all the stems of the mimosa?
