00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.976
So here we are seeing the flytrap
actually doing a computation.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.496
It's determining
if there's a fly inside the trap,

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.016
and then it closes.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.440
So let's go back to our original question.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.816
Do plants have brains?

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.416
Well, the answer is no.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.816
There's no brains in here.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.416
There's no axons, no neurons.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.816
It doesn't get depressed.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.216
It doesn't want to know
what the Tigers' score is.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.336
It doesn't have
self-actualization problems.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.776
But what it does have
is something that's very similar to us,

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.856
which is the ability
to communicate using electricity.
