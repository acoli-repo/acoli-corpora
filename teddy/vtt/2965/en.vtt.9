00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.136
Why was it happening?

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.776
Because it wanted to move. Right?

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.816
And so when I hit the touch receptors,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.016
it sent a voltage all the way down
to the end of the stem,

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.296
which caused it to move.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.576
And now, in our arms,
we would move our muscles,

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.296
but the plant doesn't have muscles.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.576
What it has is water inside the cells

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.536
and when the voltage hits it,
it opens up, releases the water,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.994
changes the shape of the cells,
and the leaf falls.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.416
OK. So here we see an action potential
encoding information to move. Alright?

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.936
But can it do more?

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.216
So let's go to find out.
