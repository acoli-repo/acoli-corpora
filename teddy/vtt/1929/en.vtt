00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What I want to talk about is, as background,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is the idea that cars are art.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is actually quite meaningful to me,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and cars are thought so much as a product

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that --
