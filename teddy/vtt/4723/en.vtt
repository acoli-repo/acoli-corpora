You probably know that all stuff
is made up of atoms

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.424
and that an atom

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:15.166
is a really, really, really,
really tiny particle.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.604
Every atom has a core,

00:00:16.628 --> 00:00:18.152
which is made up of at least one

00:00:18.176 --> 00:00:19.518
positively charged particle

00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:21.143
called a proton,

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:22.397
and in most cases,

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:25.568
some number of neutral
particles called neutrons.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:26.942
That core is surrounded

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:30.148
by negatively charged
particles called electrons.
