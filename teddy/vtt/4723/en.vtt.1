00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:30.148
by negatively charged
particles called electrons.

00:00:30.794 --> 00:00:32.613
The identity of an atom is determined

00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:36.898
only by the number
of protons in its nucleus.

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:39.674
Hydrogen is hydrogen because it
has just one proton,

00:00:39.698 --> 00:00:41.413
carbon is carbon because it has six,

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:43.399
gold is gold because it has 79,

00:00:43.423 --> 00:00:44.680
and so on.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.126
Indulge me in a momentary tangent.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.492
How do we know about atomic structure?

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:52.723
We can't see protons,
neutrons, or electrons.

00:00:53.814 --> 00:00:55.338
So, we do a bunch of experiments

00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:58.258
and develop a model
for what we think is there.

00:00:58.282 --> 00:00:59.806
Then we do some more experiments

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.592
and see if they agree with the model.
