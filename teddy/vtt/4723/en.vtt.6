00:02:58.717 --> 00:03:00.540
as clouds of negative charged density

00:03:00.564 --> 00:03:02.660
that shift and move with time.

00:03:02.684 --> 00:03:04.391
How electrons from one atom

00:03:04.415 --> 00:03:06.414
interact with electrons from another

00:03:06.438 --> 00:03:08.761
determines almost everything.

00:03:08.785 --> 00:03:10.547
Atoms can give up their electrons,

00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:12.216
surrendering them to other atoms,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.624
or they can share electrons.

00:03:15.202 --> 00:03:17.060
And the dynamics of this social network

00:03:17.084 --> 00:03:19.527
are what make chemistry interesting.

00:03:19.551 --> 00:03:20.791
From plain old rocks

00:03:20.815 --> 00:03:22.598
to the beautiful complexity of life,

00:03:22.622 --> 00:03:24.360
the nature of everything we see,

00:03:24.384 --> 00:03:25.896
hear,

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.113
smell, taste, touch, and even feel

00:03:28.137 --> 00:03:30.971
is determined at the atomic level.
