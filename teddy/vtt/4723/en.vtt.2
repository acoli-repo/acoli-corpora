00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.592
and see if they agree with the model.

00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:02.813
If they do, great.

00:01:02.837 --> 00:01:05.678
If they don't, it might
be time for a new model.

00:01:05.702 --> 00:01:08.345
We've had lots of very
different models for atoms

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.486
since Democritus in 400 BC,

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.987
and there will almost certainly

00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:13.576
be many more to come.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.447
Okay, tangent over.

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:18.208
The cores of atoms tend to stick together,

00:01:18.232 --> 00:01:19.993
but electrons are free to move,

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:22.771
and this is why chemists love electrons.

00:01:22.795 --> 00:01:24.209
If we could marry them,

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:25.637
we probably would.

00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:26.957
But electrons are weird.

00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:29.526
They appear to behave either as particles,

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.108
like little baseballs,
