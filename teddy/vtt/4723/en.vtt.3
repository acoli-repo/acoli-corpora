00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.108
like little baseballs,

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:33.298
or as waves, like water waves,

00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:36.499
depending on the experiment
that we perform.

00:01:36.523 --> 00:01:38.523
One of the weirdest things about electrons

00:01:38.547 --> 00:01:40.673
is that we can't exactly
say where they are.

00:01:40.697 --> 00:01:42.715
It's not that we don't have the equipment,

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:44.117
it's that this uncertainty

00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:46.474
is part of our model of the electron.

00:01:46.498 --> 00:01:49.036
So, we can't pinpoint them, fine.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.731
But we can say
there's a certain probability

00:01:51.755 --> 00:01:53.716
of finding an electron in a given space

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.681
around the nucleus.

00:01:55.705 --> 00:01:58.561
And that means that we can
ask the following question:

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.399
If we drew a shape around the nucleus
