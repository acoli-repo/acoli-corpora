00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.399
If we drew a shape around the nucleus

00:02:00.423 --> 00:02:02.463
such that we would be 95% sure

00:02:02.487 --> 00:02:05.496
of finding a given electron
within that shape,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.067
what would it look like?

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.797
Here are a few of these shapes.

00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:12.545
Chemists call them orbitals,

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.903
and what each one looks like

00:02:13.927 --> 00:02:15.844
depends on, among other things,

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:17.691
how much energy it has.

00:02:17.715 --> 00:02:19.341
The more energy an orbital has,

00:02:19.365 --> 00:02:21.018
the farther most of its density is

00:02:21.042 --> 00:02:22.270
from the nucleus.

00:02:22.294 --> 00:02:25.251
By they way, why did we pick 95%

00:02:25.275 --> 00:02:26.887
and not 100%?

00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:28.191
Well, that's another quirk

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:29.979
of our model of the electron.
