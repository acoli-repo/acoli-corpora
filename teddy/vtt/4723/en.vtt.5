00:02:30.003 --> 00:02:32.204
Past a certain distance from the nucleus,

00:02:32.228 --> 00:02:34.049
the probability of finding an electron

00:02:34.073 --> 00:02:35.600
starts to decrease

00:02:35.624 --> 00:02:37.912
more or less exponentially,

00:02:37.936 --> 00:02:40.131
which means that while it
will approach zero,

00:02:40.155 --> 00:02:42.582
it'll never actually hit zero.

00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:44.274
So, in every atom,

00:02:44.298 --> 00:02:47.414
there is some small,
but non-zero, probability

00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:50.525
that for a very, very
short period of time,

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:51.709
one of its electrons

00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:54.973
is at the other end of the known universe.

00:02:55.973 --> 00:02:58.693
But mostly electrons stay
close to their nucleus

00:02:58.717 --> 00:03:00.540
as clouds of negative charged density
