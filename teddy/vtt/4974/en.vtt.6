00:02:58.495 --> 00:03:02.553
a book of psalms and prayers commissioned 
by Sir Geoffrey Luttrell,

00:03:02.553 --> 00:03:04.920
shows a young woman having her hair done,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.921
while a young man catches a bird in a net.

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:10.838
The shaved patch on his 
head is growing out,

00:03:10.838 --> 00:03:15.082
indicating that he is a clergyman 
neglecting his duties.

00:03:15.082 --> 00:03:17.030
This alludes to a family scandal

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.350
where a young cleric ran away with Sir 
Geoffrey’s daughter Elizabeth.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.883
The family’s personal spiritual advisor 
likely painted it into the book

00:03:25.883 --> 00:03:28.353
to remind his clients of their failings

00:03:28.353 --> 00:03:31.600
and encourage their spiritual development.
