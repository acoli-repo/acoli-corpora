no one can say for sure what the common 
motif of a knight fighting a snail means—

00:01:34.312 --> 00:01:38.023
or why the knight so often 
appears to be losing.

00:01:38.023 --> 00:01:41.450
The snail might be a symbol of the 
inevitability of death,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.171
which defeats even the strongest knights.

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:50.337
Or it could represent humility, and a 
knight’s need to vanquish his own pride.

00:01:50.337 --> 00:01:54.710
Many illuminated manuscripts were 
copies of religious or classical texts,

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.147
and the bookmakers incorporated their 
own ideas and opinions in illustrations.
