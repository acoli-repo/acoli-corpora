00:02:28.814 --> 00:02:30.926
In the "Chronica Majora,"

00:02:30.926 --> 00:02:34.213
Matthew Paris summarized a 
scandal of his day,

00:02:34.213 --> 00:02:36.453
in which the Welsh prince Griffin

00:02:36.453 --> 00:02:39.831
plummeted to his death 
from the tower of London.

00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:42.622
Some believed the prince fell, 
Paris wrote,

00:02:42.622 --> 00:02:45.032
while others thought he was pushed.

00:02:45.032 --> 00:02:47.229
He added his own take in the margins,

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:49.517
which show the prince falling to his death

00:02:49.517 --> 00:02:53.297
while trying to escape on a rope 
made of bed-sheets.

00:02:53.297 --> 00:02:57.013
Some margins told stories of 
a more personal nature.
