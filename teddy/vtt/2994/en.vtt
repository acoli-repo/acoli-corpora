00:00:00.991 --> 00:00:02.663
When I was four years old,

00:00:02.687 --> 00:00:05.582
my dad taught me
the Taos Pueblo Hoop Dance,

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:09.737
a traditional dance born hundreds
of years ago in Southwestern USA.

00:00:10.508 --> 00:00:13.428
A series of hoops are created
out of willow wood,

00:00:13.452 --> 00:00:17.314
and they're threaded together
to create formations of the natural world,

00:00:17.338 --> 00:00:19.357
showing the many beauties of life.

00:00:19.923 --> 00:00:22.905
In this dance, you're circling
in a constant spin,

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:24.991
mimicking the movement of the Sun

00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:26.662
and the passage of time.

00:00:28.232 --> 00:00:31.491
Watching this dance was magic to me.
