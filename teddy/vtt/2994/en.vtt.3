00:01:26.936 --> 00:01:31.559
My mother is Dutch-Indonesian and Chinese
with immigrant parents,

00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:33.569
and my father is Ojibwe

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:35.197
and an enrolled tribal member

00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:38.611
of the Prairie Band's Potawatomi Tribe
in Northeastern Kansas.

00:01:39.238 --> 00:01:42.218
So one weekend I'd be learning
how to fold dumplings,

00:01:42.242 --> 00:01:44.547
and the next, I'd be
traditional-style dancing

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:45.768
at a powwow,

00:01:45.792 --> 00:01:49.170
immersed in the powerful sounds
of drums and singers.

00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:53.011
Being surrounded by many
cultures was the norm,

00:01:53.035 --> 00:01:55.902
but also a very confusing experience.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.689
It was really hard for me
to find my voice,

00:01:58.713 --> 00:02:00.955
because I never felt I was enough --
