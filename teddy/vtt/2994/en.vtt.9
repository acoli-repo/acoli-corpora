00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:33.567
As of now, there are 567 federally
recognized tribes in the United States,

00:04:33.591 --> 00:04:35.452
when there used to be countless more.

00:04:36.179 --> 00:04:37.779
In my father's words,

00:04:37.803 --> 00:04:41.362
"Being Native is not about
wearing long hair in braids.

00:04:41.386 --> 00:04:43.802
It's not about feathers or beadwork.

00:04:44.244 --> 00:04:48.634
It's about the way we all center ourselves
in the world as human beings."

00:04:49.776 --> 00:04:52.075
After traveling with this film
for over a year,

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.500
I met indigenous people
from around the world,

00:04:54.524 --> 00:04:56.153
from the Ainu of Japan,

00:04:56.177 --> 00:04:57.627
Sami of Scandinavia,

00:04:57.651 --> 00:04:58.826
the Maori

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.084
and many more.
