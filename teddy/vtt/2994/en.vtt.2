As a filmmaker and composer,

00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:04.215
it's been my journey to find my voice,

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.608
reclaim the stories
of my heritage and the past

00:01:07.632 --> 00:01:11.694
and infuse them into music and film
time capsules to share.

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:15.164
To tell you a bit about
how I found my voice,

00:01:15.188 --> 00:01:17.458
I'd like to share a bit
about how I grew up.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.272
In Southern California, I grew up
in a multigenerational home,

00:01:21.296 --> 00:01:23.186
meaning I lived under the same roof

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.492
as my parents, aunts,
uncles and grandparents.

00:01:26.936 --> 00:01:31.559
My mother is Dutch-Indonesian and Chinese
with immigrant parents,
