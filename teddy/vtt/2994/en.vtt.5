00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:30.436
Through music, I'm inviting you
into a sonic portal

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.462
of my memories and emotions,

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:34.669
and I'm holding up a mirror to yours.

00:02:35.538 --> 00:02:38.738
One of my favorite instruments to play
is the guzheng zither,

00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:40.716
a Chinese harp-like instrument.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.494
While the hoop dance
is hundreds of years old,

00:02:43.518 --> 00:02:47.313
the guzheng has more
than 2,000 years of history.

00:02:47.337 --> 00:02:50.012
I'm playing the styles that greatly
influence me today,

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.673
like electronic music,

00:02:51.697 --> 00:02:55.679
with an instrument that was used
to play traditional folk music long ago.

00:02:56.235 --> 00:02:59.053
And I noticed an interesting connection:

00:02:59.077 --> 00:03:01.508
the zither is tuned
to the pentatonic scale,
