visuals and images on top of the music.

So I turned to internet tutorials
to learn editing software,

00:03:34.472 --> 00:03:36.569
went to community college to save money

00:03:36.593 --> 00:03:37.913
and created films.

00:03:39.012 --> 00:03:40.751
After a few years experimenting,

00:03:40.775 --> 00:03:44.173
I was 17 and had something
I wanted to tell and preserve.

00:03:44.197 --> 00:03:45.825

I lead with this in my latest
documentary film,

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:55.196
"Smoke That Travels,"

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.505
which immerses people into the world
of music, song, color and dance,
