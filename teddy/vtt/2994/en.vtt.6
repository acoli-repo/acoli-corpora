00:02:59.077 --> 00:03:01.508
the zither is tuned
to the pentatonic scale,

00:03:01.532 --> 00:03:05.084
a scale that is universally known
in so many parts of music

00:03:05.108 --> 00:03:06.293
around the world,

00:03:06.317 --> 00:03:09.130
including Native American folk songs.

00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:11.703
In both Chinese and Native folk,

00:03:11.727 --> 00:03:15.984
I sense this inherent sound of longing
and holding onto the past,

00:03:16.008 --> 00:03:19.403
an emotion that greatly drives
the music I create today.

00:03:20.603 --> 00:03:24.141
At the time, I wondered if I could make
this feeling of immersion

00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:25.323
even more powerful,

00:03:25.347 --> 00:03:27.559
by layering visuals and music --

00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:30.330
visuals and images on top of the music.
