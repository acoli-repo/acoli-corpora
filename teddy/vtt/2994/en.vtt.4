because I never felt I was enough --

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.822

or Native enough.

00:02:05.381 --> 00:02:08.432
Because I never felt I was a part
of any community,

00:02:08.456 --> 00:02:11.889
I sought to learn
the stories of my heritage

00:02:11.913 --> 00:02:14.682
and connect them together
to rediscover my own.

00:02:15.254 --> 00:02:18.965
The first medium I felt
gave me a voice was music.

00:02:20.043 --> 00:02:23.225
With layers of sounds
and multiple instruments,

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.907
I could create soundscapes and worlds
that were much bigger than my own.

00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:30.436
Through music, I'm inviting you
