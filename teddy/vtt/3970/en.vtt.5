WEBVTT

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.836
we brought the tech industry's
best practices into politics.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.591
We earned more money,

00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:36.336
we engaged more volunteers

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.034
and we earned more votes
than any political campaign in history.

00:02:40.058 --> 00:02:43.840
We were a cutting-edge start-up
that changed the game of politics forever.

00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:46.123
So when the President asked
a small group of us

00:02:46.147 --> 00:02:48.998
to bring that very same disruption
directly into government,

00:02:49.022 --> 00:02:50.889
I knew it wasn't going to be easy work,

00:02:50.913 --> 00:02:53.671
but I was eager and showed up
ready to get to work.

00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:57.441
Now, on my first day in DC,

00:02:57.465 --> 00:02:59.975
my first day in government,

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.940
I walked into the office
and they handed me a laptop.
