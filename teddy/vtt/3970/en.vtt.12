(Applause)

00:06:01.883 --> 00:06:05.106
Now, you can think of our team --
well, it's pretty funny --

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.182
you can think
of our team a little bit like

00:06:07.206 --> 00:06:09.816
the Peace Corps meets DARPA
meets SEAL Team 6.

00:06:10.316 --> 00:06:12.079
We're like the Peace Corps for nerds,

00:06:12.103 --> 00:06:15.076
but instead of traveling to crazy,
interesting, far-off places,

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.489
you spend a lot of time indoors,
behind computers,

00:06:17.513 --> 00:06:19.758
helping restore the fabric
of our democracy.

00:06:19.782 --> 00:06:21.501
(Laughter)

00:06:21.859 --> 00:06:26.173
Now, this team -- our playbook
for the United States Digital Service

00:06:26.197 --> 00:06:27.537
is pretty simple.

00:06:28.053 --> 00:06:31.657
The first play is we recruit
the very best talent
