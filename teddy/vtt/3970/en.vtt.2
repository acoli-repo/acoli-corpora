00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:00.784
that I could possibly think of.

00:01:00.808 --> 00:01:03.363
I could be sitting on my couch
in my apartment,

00:01:03.387 --> 00:01:06.429
and from my phone, I can order
a warm, gluten-free meal

00:01:06.453 --> 00:01:09.432
that can arrive at my door
in less than 10 minutes.

00:01:09.456 --> 00:01:13.679
But meanwhile, a working mother
who depends on food stamps

00:01:13.703 --> 00:01:15.764
to support her family

00:01:15.788 --> 00:01:18.927
has to complete an arduous,
complicated application

00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:21.412
which she might not even
be able to do online.

00:01:21.436 --> 00:01:25.578
And the inability of her to do that same
work from her couch means

00:01:25.602 --> 00:01:28.682
that she might be having to take
days or hours off of work

00:01:28.706 --> 00:01:30.094
that she can't spare.
