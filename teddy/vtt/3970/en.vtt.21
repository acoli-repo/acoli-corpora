00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:31.232
instead of waiting
in a black box for years.

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:34.462
So within less than three months
of our team being on the ground,

00:10:34.486 --> 00:10:37.731
we were already able to push
our first products to production.

00:10:38.152 --> 00:10:40.764
The first one, this is the form I-90.

00:10:40.788 --> 00:10:44.184
This is used to file
for your replacement green card.

00:10:44.208 --> 00:10:45.773
Now, for immigrant visa holders,

00:10:45.797 --> 00:10:48.685
a replacement green card is a big deal.

00:10:48.709 --> 00:10:50.967
Your green card is your proof
of identification,

00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:52.380
it's your work authorization,

00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:54.853
it's the proof that you can
be here in this country.

00:10:54.877 --> 00:10:58.098
So waiting six months while the government
processes the replacement

00:10:58.122 --> 00:10:59.322
is not cool.

00:10:59.346 --> 00:11:01.037
I'm excited to tell you that today,
