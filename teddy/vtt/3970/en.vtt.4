00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.962
the veterans coming home from battle.

00:02:00.986 --> 00:02:04.058
They can't get what they need
when they need it.

00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:05.468
And for these Americans,

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:09.147
government is more than just
a presidential election every four years.

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:12.237
Government is a lifeline
that provides services they need

00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:14.586
and depend on and deserve.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.777
Which is, quite frankly,

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:18.984
why government needs to get
its shit together and catch up.

00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:20.167
Just saying.

00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:23.501
(Applause)

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.871
Now, this wasn't always a problem
I was passionate about.

00:02:26.895 --> 00:02:29.655
When I joined President Obama's
campaign in 2008,

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.836
we brought the tech industry's
best practices into politics.
