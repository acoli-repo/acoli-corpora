00:03:28.097 --> 00:03:32.669
It spends over 86 billion dollars
a year -- 86 billion --

00:03:32.693 --> 00:03:34.346
on federal IT projects.

00:03:34.763 --> 00:03:35.914
For context:

00:03:35.938 --> 00:03:38.859
that is more than the entire
venture capital industry spends

00:03:38.883 --> 00:03:40.679
annually -- on everything.

00:03:41.547 --> 00:03:43.389
Now, the problem here

00:03:43.413 --> 00:03:47.524
is that we the taxpayers
are not getting what we pay for,

00:03:47.548 --> 00:03:51.365
because 94 percent of federal IT projects

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.604
are over budget or behind schedule.

00:03:53.628 --> 00:03:55.064
94 percent!

00:03:55.088 --> 00:03:56.577
For those of you keeping score,

00:03:56.601 --> 00:03:58.910
yes, the number 94 is very close to 100.

00:03:58.934 --> 00:04:00.402
