Think about what Airbnb took
that was normal from hospitality

00:07:33.076 --> 00:07:35.264
and revolutionized my apartment.

00:07:36.058 --> 00:07:38.924
The United States Digital Service
is doing exactly that.

00:07:38.948 --> 00:07:42.242
We are taking what Silicon Valley
and the private sector has learned

00:07:42.266 --> 00:07:43.568
through a ton of hard work

00:07:43.592 --> 00:07:46.203
about how to build
planetary-scale digital services

00:07:46.227 --> 00:07:48.091
that delight users at lower cost,

00:07:48.115 --> 00:07:49.955
and we're applying that to government,

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:52.875
where it is a radical departure
from the status quo.

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:54.923
Now, the good news is:

00:07:55.416 --> 00:07:56.879
it's starting to work.

00:07:57.768 --> 00:08:00.198
We know this because we can
already see the results
