00:03:58.934 --> 00:04:00.402
(Laughter)

00:04:01.045 --> 00:04:02.600
There's another problem:

00:04:02.624 --> 00:04:06.388
40 percent of those never end up
seeing the light of day.

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.990
They are completely scrapped or abandoned.

00:04:09.014 --> 00:04:13.772
Now, this is a very existentially
painful moment for any organization,

00:04:13.796 --> 00:04:16.193
because it means as government
continues to operate

00:04:16.217 --> 00:04:17.432
as it's programmed to do,

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:19.071
failure is nearly inevitable.

00:04:19.482 --> 00:04:22.946
And when the status quo
is the riskiest option,

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.018
that means there is simply no other choice

00:04:25.042 --> 00:04:26.784
than radical disruption.

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.257
So, what do we do about it?
