To me, this is what change
looks like in 2016.

00:13:32.493 --> 00:13:34.267
When you walk out of the Oval Office,

00:13:34.291 --> 00:13:36.632

00:13:36.656 --> 00:13:38.623

is beyond human beings."

00:13:50.423 --> 00:13:53.708

00:13:53.732 --> 00:13:55.693
and to fix this together.

00:13:56.073 --> 00:13:57.690
Yes, it's hard.

00:13:58.034 --> 00:14:00.137
It's particularly hard
when we have to fight,
