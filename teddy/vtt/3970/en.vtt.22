I'm excited to tell you that today,

00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:04.218
you can now, for the first time,
file for a replacement green card

00:11:04.242 --> 00:11:07.445
entirely online without anyone
touching a piece of paper.

00:11:07.469 --> 00:11:09.487
It is faster, it is cheaper,

00:11:09.511 --> 00:11:11.908
and it's a better user experience
for the applicant

00:11:11.932 --> 00:11:13.820
and the government employees alike.

00:11:13.844 --> 00:11:17.361
(Applause)

00:11:20.677 --> 00:11:21.828
Another one, quickly.

00:11:21.852 --> 00:11:25.099
Last fall, we just released
a brand-new practice civics test.

00:11:25.123 --> 00:11:27.363
So as part of becoming a US citizen,

00:11:27.387 --> 00:11:29.737
you have to pass a civics test.

00:11:29.761 --> 00:11:34.099
For anyone who has taken this test,
it can be quite the stressful process.
