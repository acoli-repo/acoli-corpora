00:12:58.966 --> 00:13:01.270
but they're not necessarily
the users themselves.

00:13:01.294 --> 00:13:03.835
So our team at the VA went out,
we looked at the data,

00:13:03.859 --> 00:13:05.523
we talked to veterans themselves

00:13:05.547 --> 00:13:07.135
and we started simple and small,

00:13:07.159 --> 00:13:10.543
with the two most important services
that matter most to them:

00:13:10.567 --> 00:13:13.346
education benefits
and disability benefits.

00:13:13.873 --> 00:13:16.517
I'm proud to say that they are
live on the site today,

00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:19.079
and as the team continues
to streamline more services,

00:13:19.103 --> 00:13:21.954
they will be ported over here,
and the old sites, shut down.

00:13:21.978 --> 00:13:26.344
(Applause)

00:13:27.596 --> 00:13:31.668
To me, this is what change
looks like in 2016.
