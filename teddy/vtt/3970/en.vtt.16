We know this because we can
already see the results

00:08:00.222 --> 00:08:03.859
from some of our early projects,
like the rescue effort of Healthcare.gov,

00:08:03.883 --> 00:08:05.473
when that went off the rails.

00:08:05.497 --> 00:08:09.201
Fixing Healthcare.gov was the first place
that we ran this play,

00:08:09.225 --> 00:08:11.082
and today we are taking that same play

00:08:11.106 --> 00:08:12.852
and scaling it across a large number

00:08:12.876 --> 00:08:16.284
of government's most important
citizen-facing services.

00:08:17.077 --> 00:08:19.324
Now, if I can take a moment

00:08:19.348 --> 00:08:21.451
and brag about the team for a second --

00:08:21.475 --> 00:08:24.062
it is the highest
concentration of badasses

00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:26.290
I could have ever dreamed of.

00:08:26.314 --> 00:08:30.142
We have top talent from Google,
