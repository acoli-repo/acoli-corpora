WEBVTT

00:08:26.314 --> 00:08:30.142
We have top talent from Google,
Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and the likes,

00:08:30.166 --> 00:08:32.327
all on staff today,

00:08:32.351 --> 00:08:35.675
all choosing to join their government.

00:08:35.699 --> 00:08:36.939
And what's incredible is,

00:08:36.963 --> 00:08:40.898
everybody is as eager and kind
as they are intelligent.

00:08:40.922 --> 00:08:44.382
And I might add, by the way,
over half of us are women.

00:08:44.406 --> 00:08:48.511
(Applause)

00:08:51.244 --> 00:08:53.583
The best way to understand this strategy

00:08:53.607 --> 00:08:55.867
is actually to walk through
a couple of examples

00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:57.621
of how it's working out in the wild.

00:08:57.645 --> 00:08:59.657
I'm going to give you
two examples quickly.

00:08:59.681 --> 00:09:01.497
The first one is about immigration.
