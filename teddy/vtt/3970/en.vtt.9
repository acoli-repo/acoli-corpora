00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:30.257
So, what do we do about it?

00:04:30.733 --> 00:04:32.416
How do we fix this?

00:04:33.065 --> 00:04:35.682
Well, the irony of all of this

00:04:35.706 --> 00:04:38.979
is that we actually don't have to look
any further than our backyard,

00:04:39.003 --> 00:04:42.868
because right here in America
are the very ideas, the very people,

00:04:42.892 --> 00:04:45.562
who have swept our world
into a radically different place

00:04:45.586 --> 00:04:47.252
than it was two decades ago.

00:04:47.276 --> 00:04:49.557
So what would it look like

00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:52.921
if it was actually as easy to get
student loans or veterans' benefits

00:04:52.945 --> 00:04:55.787
as it is to order cat food to my house?

00:04:56.358 --> 00:04:58.124
What would it look like

00:04:58.628 --> 00:05:02.561
if there was an easy pathway
for the very entrepreneurs and innovators
