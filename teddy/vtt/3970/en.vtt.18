00:08:59.681 --> 00:09:01.497
The first one is about immigration.

00:09:01.986 --> 00:09:05.601
This, my friends, is your typical
immigration application.

00:09:05.625 --> 00:09:06.788
Yes, you guessed it --

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:09.286
it's almost entirely paper-based.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:10.461
In the best case,

00:09:10.485 --> 00:09:13.293
the application takes about six
to eight months to process.

00:09:13.317 --> 00:09:17.150
It is physically shipped thousands
of miles -- thousands of miles! --

00:09:17.174 --> 00:09:19.614
between no less than six
processing centers.

00:09:20.188 --> 00:09:21.558
Now, little story:

00:09:22.168 --> 00:09:23.319
about a decade ago,

00:09:23.343 --> 00:09:26.220
the government thought
that if it brought this system online,

00:09:26.244 --> 00:09:29.118
it could save taxpayer dollars
and provide a better service,

00:09:29.142 --> 00:09:30.293
which was a great idea.
