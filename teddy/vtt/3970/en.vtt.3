And this growing dichotomy

00:01:33.713 --> 00:01:36.007

of the tech revolution

00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:37.426
and those it's left behind

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.972
is one of the greatest
challenges of our time --

00:01:39.996 --> 00:01:44.385
(Applause)

00:01:45.607 --> 00:01:49.862
Because government's failure
to deliver digital services that work

00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:54.440
is disproportionately impacting

00:01:54.464 --> 00:01:57.083
It's impacting the students
trying to go to college,

00:01:57.107 --> 00:01:59.161
the single mothers
trying to get health care,

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.962
the veterans coming home from battle.
