00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:30.309
of a new website, Vets.gov.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.905
Vets.gov is a simple, easy-to-use website

00:12:32.929 --> 00:12:36.665
that brings all of the online services
a veteran needs into one place.

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:39.404
One website, not thousands.

00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:43.165
The site is a work in progress,
but it's significant progress,

00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:45.776
because it's designed
with the users who matter most:

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.705
the veterans themselves.

00:12:47.729 --> 00:12:50.522
This might sound incredibly obvious,
because it should be,

00:12:50.546 --> 00:12:52.768
but sadly, this isn't
normal for government.

00:12:52.792 --> 00:12:56.236
Far too often, product decisions
are made by committees of stakeholders

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.942
who do their best to represent
the interests of the user,

00:12:58.966 --> 00:13:01.270
but they're not necessarily
the users themselves.
