00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.635
I'm here to talk to you today

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:05.771
about a story that we have all
been conditioned to believe

00:00:05.795 --> 00:00:07.335
is not possible.

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:09.657
It's a story about a living,
breathing start-up

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:12.076
flourishing in an unlikely environment:

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.926
the United States government.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.584
Now, this start-up is fundamentally
beginning to disrupt

00:00:16.608 --> 00:00:19.096
the way government does
business from the inside out.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.620
But before I get there,
let's start with the problem.

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:25.343
For me, the problem begins
with a number: 137.

00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:29.417
137 is the average number of days

00:00:29.441 --> 00:00:32.852
a veteran has to wait to have benefits
processed by the VA.
