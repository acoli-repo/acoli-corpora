00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:02.473
We deployed a small team
of just six people,

00:10:02.497 --> 00:10:04.179
and what many people don't know is

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:07.134
that's the same size as the rescue
effort of Healthcare.gov --

00:10:07.158 --> 00:10:08.379
just six people.

00:10:08.403 --> 00:10:10.234
And that team jumped in, side-by-side,

00:10:10.258 --> 00:10:12.972
to support the agency
in transitioning this project

00:10:12.996 --> 00:10:16.749
into more modern business practices,
more modern development practices.

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:18.381
Now, in non-tech speak,

00:10:18.405 --> 00:10:22.387
what that basically means
is taking big, multi-year projects

00:10:22.411 --> 00:10:24.726
and breaking them up
into bite-sized chunks,

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.386
so that way we can reduce the risk

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.047
and actually start to see results
every couple of weeks,

00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:31.232
instead of waiting
in a black box for years.
