00:11:58.581 --> 00:12:01.459
said something incredibly profound.

00:12:01.483 --> 00:12:04.706
She said that she's never been
this hopeful or optimistic

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.443
about a project in her entire
time in government.

00:12:08.101 --> 00:12:10.468
And she's been doing this for 30 years.

00:12:11.285 --> 00:12:13.706
That is exactly the kind of hope
and culture change

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:14.998
we are trying to create.

00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:18.919
For my second example, I want to bring
it back to veterans for a second,

00:12:18.943 --> 00:12:20.893
and what we are doing to build them a VA

00:12:20.917 --> 00:12:23.732
that is worthy of their service
and their sacrifice.

00:12:24.129 --> 00:12:26.297
I'm proud to say
that just a few months ago,

00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:28.217
we released a brand-new beta

00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:30.309
of a new website, Vets.gov.
