00:00:08.871 --> 00:00:13.163
In 2013, a group of researchers 
at DeepMind in London

00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:15.829
had set their sights on a grand challenge.

00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:19.288
They wanted to create an AI system 
that could beat,

00:00:19.288 --> 00:00:24.121
not just a single Atari game, 
but every Atari game.

00:00:24.663 --> 00:00:29.829
They developed a system they called 
Deep Q Networks, or DQN,

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.496
and less than two years later, 
it was superhuman.
