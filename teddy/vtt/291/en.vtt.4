00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.234
half a hectare in the center

00:02:01.234 --> 00:02:04.134
of the city of Iquique 
in the north of Chile

00:02:04.134 --> 00:02:07.062
using a $10,000 subsidy

00:02:07.062 --> 00:02:10.176
with which we had to buy the land,

00:02:10.176 --> 00:02:11.909
provide the infrastructure,

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.230
and build the houses that, 
in the best of the cases,

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.894
would be of around 40 square meters.

00:02:18.894 --> 00:02:21.099
And by the way, they said,

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.750
the cost of the land,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.806
because it's in the center of the city,

00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:26.550
is three times more

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.108
than what social housing can normally afford.
