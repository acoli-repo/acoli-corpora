00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:32.444
Evidence shows that people are better off in cities.

00:00:32.444 --> 00:00:34.593
But there's a problem that I would call

00:00:34.593 --> 00:00:36.899
the "3S" menace:

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.632
The scale, speed, and scarcity of means

00:00:39.632 --> 00:00:42.827
with which we will have to
respond to this phenomenon

00:00:42.827 --> 00:00:45.465
has no precedence in history.

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:46.654
For you to have an idea,

00:00:46.654 --> 00:00:49.880
out of the three billion 
people living in cities today,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.271
one billion are under the line of poverty.

00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:57.210
By 2030, out of the five billion people

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.480
that will be living in cities,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.837
two billion are going to 
be under the line of poverty.
