for the Angelini Innovation Center,

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.842

the right environment for knowledge creation.

00:06:13.176 --> 00:06:15.660

it's important, and we agreed on that.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.556
But for us, the question 
of the right environment

00:06:25.556 --> 00:06:27.722
was a very literal question.

00:06:27.722 --> 00:06:29.842
We wanted to have a working space

00:06:29.842 --> 00:06:32.595
with the right light, with the right temperature,
