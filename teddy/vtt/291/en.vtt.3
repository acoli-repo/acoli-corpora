00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:30.330
with 10,000 dollars per family.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.995
If we don't solve this equation,

00:01:31.995 --> 00:01:34.043
it is not that people 
will stop coming to cities.

00:01:34.043 --> 00:01:35.952
They will come anyhow,

00:01:35.952 --> 00:01:38.958
but they will live in slums, favelas

00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.368
and informal settlements.

00:01:40.368 --> 00:01:43.246
So what to do? Well, an answer may come

00:01:43.246 --> 00:01:47.840
from favelas and slums themselves.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.433
A clue could be in this 
question we were asked

00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:52.890
10 years ago.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.521
We were asked to accommodate 100 families

00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:58.939
that had been occupying illegally

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.234
half a hectare in the center
