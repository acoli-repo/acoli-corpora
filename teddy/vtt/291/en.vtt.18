00:08:57.441 --> 00:09:01.174
of common sense.

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:04.147
Last case I would like 
to share is how design

00:09:04.147 --> 00:09:06.442
can provide more comprehensive answers

00:09:06.442 --> 00:09:08.830
against natural disasters.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.895
You may know that Chile, in 2010,

00:09:11.895 --> 00:09:15.700
was hit by an 8.8 Richter scale

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.823
earthquake and tsunami,

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.698
and we were called to work

00:09:19.698 --> 00:09:21.940
in the reconstruction of the Constitución,

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.850
in the southern part of the country.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.347
We were given 100 days, three months,

00:09:27.347 --> 00:09:29.263
to design almost everything,

00:09:29.263 --> 00:09:31.580
from public buildings to public space,
