00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.016
trying to find the right answer.

00:12:03.016 --> 00:12:05.829
It is mainly trying to identify with precision

00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:07.900
what is the right question.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.987
There is nothing worse than answering well

00:12:09.987 --> 00:12:12.091
the wrong question.

00:12:12.091 --> 00:12:15.410
So it was pretty obvious after this process

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:18.941
that, well, we chicken out here

00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:21.517
and go away because it's too tense,

00:12:21.517 --> 00:12:23.543
or we go even further in asking,

00:12:23.543 --> 00:12:24.938
what else is bothering you?

00:12:24.938 --> 00:12:26.691
What other problems do you have

00:12:26.691 --> 00:12:29.273
and you want us to take 
care of now that the city

00:12:29.273 --> 00:12:33.595
will have to be rethought from scratch?
