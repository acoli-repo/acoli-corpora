Participate!

00:11:00.436 --> 00:11:02.510
Fisherman: I am a fisherman.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.619
Twenty-five fishermen work for me.

00:11:04.619 --> 00:11:06.958
Where should I take them? To the forest?

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:10.343
Man: So why can't we have a concrete defense?

00:11:10.343 --> 00:11:12.251
Done well, of course.

00:11:12.251 --> 00:11:14.141
Man 2: I am the history of Constitución.

00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:18.101
And you come here to tell me
that I cannot keep on living here?

00:11:18.101 --> 00:11:20.299
My whole family has lived here,

00:11:20.299 --> 00:11:21.771
I raised my children here,

00:11:21.771 --> 00:11:23.856
and my children will also 
raise their children here.

00:11:23.856 --> 00:11:26.364
and my grandchildren 
and everyone else will.

00:11:26.364 --> 00:11:28.890
But why are you imposing this on me?

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.767
You! You are imposing this on me!
