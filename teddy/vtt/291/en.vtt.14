00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.677
and then a glass skin on the outside

00:07:00.677 --> 00:07:04.553
that, due to direct sun radiation,

00:07:04.553 --> 00:07:09.761
creates a huge greenhouse effect inside.

00:07:09.761 --> 00:07:11.695
In addition to that, let's say a guy

00:07:11.695 --> 00:07:13.431
working on the seventh floor

00:07:13.431 --> 00:07:16.142
goes every single day 
through the third floor,

00:07:16.142 --> 00:07:19.180
but has no idea what the guy on that floor

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.909
is working on.

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:24.305
So we thought, well, maybe 
we have to turn this scheme

00:07:24.305 --> 00:07:26.106
inside out.

00:07:26.106 --> 00:07:27.928
And what we did was,

00:07:27.928 --> 00:07:32.110
let's have an open atrium,
