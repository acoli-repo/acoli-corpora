WEBVTT

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.552
and they threatened us

00:03:00.552 --> 00:03:02.860
to go on a hunger strike

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.158
if we even dared to offer this

00:03:05.158 --> 00:03:06.584
as a solution,

00:03:06.584 --> 00:03:09.655
because they could not 
make the tiny apartments

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:11.109
expand.

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.798
So the conclusion with the families —

00:03:13.798 --> 00:03:15.676
and this is important, 
not our conclusion —

00:03:15.676 --> 00:03:18.207
with the families, was that we had a problem.

00:03:18.207 --> 00:03:19.945
We had to innovate.

00:03:19.945 --> 00:03:22.611
So what did we do?

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.619
Well, a middle-class family

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:30.499
lives reasonably well
