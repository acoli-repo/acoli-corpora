00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:30.499
lives reasonably well

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.850
in around 80 square meters,

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.522
but when there's no money,

00:03:34.522 --> 00:03:35.864
what the market does

00:03:35.864 --> 00:03:40.122
is to reduce the size of the house

00:03:40.122 --> 00:03:42.971
to 40 square meters.

00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:44.719
What we said was,

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.239
what if,

00:03:48.845 --> 00:03:53.378
instead of thinking of 40 square meters

00:03:53.378 --> 00:03:56.059
as a small house,

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:58.385
why don't we consider it

00:03:58.385 --> 00:04:01.191
half of a good one?
