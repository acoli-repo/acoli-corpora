00:00:00.724 --> 00:00:03.428
If there's any power in design,

00:00:03.428 --> 00:00:05.771
that's the power of synthesis.

00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:07.466
The more complex the problem,

00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:09.967
the more the need for simplicity.

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:12.304
So allow me to share three cases

00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:14.114
where we tried to apply

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:17.117
design's power of synthesis.

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:21.218
Let's start with the global challenge of urbanization.

00:00:21.218 --> 00:00:24.896
It's a fact that people are moving towards cities.

00:00:24.896 --> 00:00:28.361
and even if counterintuitive, it's good news.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:32.444
Evidence shows that people are better off in cities.
