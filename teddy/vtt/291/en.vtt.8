00:03:58.385 --> 00:04:01.191
half of a good one?

00:04:01.191 --> 00:04:02.958
When you rephrase the problem

00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:05.664
as half of a good house

00:04:05.664 --> 00:04:07.299
instead of a small one,

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.508
the key question is, which half do we do?

00:04:10.508 --> 00:04:13.210
And we thought we had 
to do with public money

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.619
the half that families won't 
be able to do individually.

00:04:18.619 --> 00:04:21.147
We identified five design conditions

00:04:21.147 --> 00:04:23.505
that belonged to the hard half of a house,

00:04:23.505 --> 00:04:26.601
and we went back to the 
families to do two things:

00:04:26.601 --> 00:04:30.600
join forces and split tasks.
