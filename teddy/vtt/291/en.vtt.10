00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.536
So we went from this initial social housing

00:05:01.536 --> 00:05:05.930
to a middle-class unit achieved
by families themselves

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.666
within a couple of weeks.

00:05:08.666 --> 00:05:10.439
This was our first project

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:12.766
in Iquique 10 years ago.

00:05:12.766 --> 00:05:16.243
This is our last project in Chile.

00:05:16.243 --> 00:05:19.194
Different designs, same principle:

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.760
You provide the frame,

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.598
and from then on, families take over.

00:05:24.598 --> 00:05:28.698
So the purpose of design,

00:05:28.698 --> 00:05:31.708
trying to understand and 
trying to give an answer
