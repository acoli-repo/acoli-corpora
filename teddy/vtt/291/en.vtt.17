00:08:29.683 --> 00:08:31.416
It's not about technology.

00:08:31.416 --> 00:08:36.838
This is just archaic, 
primitive common sense,

00:08:36.838 --> 00:08:38.806
and by using common sense,

00:08:38.806 --> 00:08:41.787
we went from 120 kilowatts

00:08:41.787 --> 00:08:44.127
per square meter per year,

00:08:44.127 --> 00:08:46.298
which is the typical energy consumption

00:08:46.298 --> 00:08:48.290
for cooling a glass tower,

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:52.620
to 40 kilowatts per square meter per year.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.897
So with the right design,

00:08:54.897 --> 00:08:57.441
sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use

00:08:57.441 --> 00:09:01.174
of common sense.
