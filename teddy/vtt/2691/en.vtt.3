(Applause)

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.336
At this point, most people really
only care about the television show.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.040
(Laughter)

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.240
I know this from experience.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.656
OK, so the show was NBC's
"Saved by the Bell: The New Class."

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.280
And I played Weasel Wyzell,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.296
who was the sort of dorky,
nerdy character on the show,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.096
which made it a very
major acting challenge

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.616
for me as a 13-year-old boy.
