and the way you feel

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.760
Numerous studies demonstrate this.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.456
If you are asked to estimate

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.656
the walking speed of a man
in a video, for example,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.800
your answer will be different if you're
told to think about cheetahs or turtles.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.416
A hill appears steeper
if you've just exercised,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.656
and a landmark appears farther away

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.360
if you're wearing a heavy backpack.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.840
We have arrived
at a fundamental contradiction.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.576
What you see is a complex
mental construction of your own making,
