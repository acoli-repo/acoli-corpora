00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.816
We make assumptions
and faulty leaps of logic.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.095
We harbor bias.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.376
We know that we are right,
and they are wrong.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.016
We fear the worst.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.200
We strive for unattainable perfection.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.000
We tell ourselves
what we can and cannot do.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.976
In our minds, fish swim by in reverse
frantically wagging their heads

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.429
and we don't even notice them.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.336
I'm going to tell you
five facts about myself.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.680
One fact is not true.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.560
One: I graduated from Harvard at 19
with an honors degree in mathematics.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.640
Two: I currently run
a construction company in Orlando.
