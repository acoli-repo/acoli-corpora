00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.096
When I was diagnosed
with my blinding disease,

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.160
I knew blindness would ruin my life.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.336
Blindness was a death sentence
for my independence.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.240
It was the end of achievement for me.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.576
Blindness meant I would live
an unremarkable life,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.296
small and sad,

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.520
and likely alone.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.480
I knew it.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.240
This was a fiction born of my fears,
but I believed it.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.416
It was a lie, but it was my reality,

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.600
just like those backwards-swimming fish
in little Dorothy's mind.
