00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.576
It taught me to spot
those backwards-swimming fish

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.096
that our minds create.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.280
Going blind cast them into focus.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.840
What does it feel like to see?

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.360
It's immediate and passive.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.936
You open your eyes and there's the world.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.056
Seeing is believing. Sight is truth.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.280
Right?

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.800
Well, that's what I thought.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.440
Then, from age 12 to 25,
my retinas progressively deteriorated.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.296
My sight became an increasingly bizarre

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.600
carnival funhouse hall
of mirrors and illusions.
