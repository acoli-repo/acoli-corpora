00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.120
Let's take fear as just one example.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.280
Your fears distort your reality.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.056
Under the warped logic of fear,
anything is better than the uncertain.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.536
Fear fills the void at all costs,

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.696
passing off what you dread
for what you know,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.496
offering up the worst
in place of the ambiguous,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.280
substituting assumption for reason.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.856
Psychologists have
a great term for it: awfulizing.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.976
(Laughter)

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.536
Right?

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.840
Fear replaces the unknown with the awful.
