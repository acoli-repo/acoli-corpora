00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.600
just like those backwards-swimming fish
in little Dorothy's mind.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.416
If I had not confronted
the reality of my fear,

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.640
I would have lived it.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.480
I am certain of that.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.440
So how do you live your life
eyes wide open?

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.960
It is a learned discipline.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.960
It can be taught. It can be practiced.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.109
I will summarize very briefly.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.536
Hold yourself accountable

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.056
for every moment, every thought,

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.280
every detail.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.776
See beyond your fears.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.536
Recognize your assumptions.
