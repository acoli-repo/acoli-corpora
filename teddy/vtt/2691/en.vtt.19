your backwards-swimming fish
do you great harm.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:36.480
They exact a toll in missed opportunities
and unrealized potential,

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.776
and they engender insecurity and distrust

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.240
where you seek fulfillment and connection.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.760
I urge you to search them out.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.536
Helen Keller said that the only thing
worse than being blind

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.560
is having sight but no vision.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.696
For me, going blind
was a profound blessing,

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.760
because blindness gave me vision.
