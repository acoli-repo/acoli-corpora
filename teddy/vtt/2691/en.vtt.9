00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.376
that the illusion
of sight is so compelling.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.800
But make no mistake about it:
sight is an illusion.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.736
Here's where it gets interesting.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.856
To create the experience of sight,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.416
your brain references your conceptual
understanding of the world,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.496
other knowledge, your memories,
opinions, emotions, mental attention.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.080
All of these things and far more
are linked in your brain to your sight.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.456
These linkages work both ways,
and usually occur subconsciously.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.336
So for example,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.496
what you see impacts how you feel,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.120
and the way you feel
can literally change what you see.
