00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.856
I pieced together fragmented,
transitory images,

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.856
consciously analyzed the clues,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.960
searched for some logic
in my crumbling kaleidoscope,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.126
until I saw nothing at all.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.256
I learned that what we see

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.640
is not universal truth.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.400
It is not objective reality.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.696
What we see is a unique,
personal, virtual reality

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.840
that is masterfully
constructed by our brain.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.894
Let me explain with a bit
of amateur neuroscience.

00:03:57.918 --> 00:04:01.158
Your visual cortex takes up
about 30 percent of your brain.
