I've learned to solicit
a lot more verbal feedback.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.400
I basically force people
to tell me what they think.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.936
And in this respect,

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.056
it's become, like I said, a real blessing
for me personally and for my company,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.680
because we communicate
at a far deeper level,

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.320
we avoid ambiguities,

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:24.010
and most important, my team knows
that what they think truly matters.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.456
BG: Isaac, thank you for coming to TED.
