00:03:57.918 --> 00:04:01.158
Your visual cortex takes up
about 30 percent of your brain.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.016
That's compared to approximately
eight percent for touch

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.840
and two to three percent for hearing.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.336
Every second, your eyes
can send your visual cortex

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.520
as many as two billion
pieces of information.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.800
The rest of your body can send your brain
only an additional billion.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.896
So sight is one third
of your brain by volume

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.240
and can claim about two thirds
of your brain's processing resources.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.256
It's no surprise then

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.376
that the illusion
of sight is so compelling.
