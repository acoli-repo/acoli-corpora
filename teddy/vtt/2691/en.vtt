When Dorothy was a little girl,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.360
she was fascinated by her goldfish.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.536
Her father explained to her that fish swim
by quickly wagging their tails

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.440
to propel themselves through the water.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.176
Without hesitation,
little Dorothy responded,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.456
"Yes, Daddy, and fish swim backwards
by wagging their heads."

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.096
(Laughter)

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.936
In her mind, it was a fact
as true as any other.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.296
Fish swim backwards
by wagging their heads.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.520
She believed it.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.296
Our lives are full
of fish swimming backwards.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.816
We make assumptions
and faulty leaps of logic.
