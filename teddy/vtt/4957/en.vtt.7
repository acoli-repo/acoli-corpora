00:03:28.234 --> 00:03:30.654
catapulted the parade into the public eye—


00:03:30.654 --> 00:03:33.439
and garnered suffragists greater sympathy.

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.793
National newspapers lambasted the police,

00:03:35.793 --> 00:03:39.224
and Congressional hearings investigated 
their actions during the parade.

00:03:39.224 --> 00:03:42.277
After the protest, the "Women’s Journal" 
declared,

00:03:42.277 --> 00:03:47.220
“Washington has been disgraced. Equal 
suffrage has scored a great victory."

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.127
In this way,

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:51.148
the march initiated a surge
of support for women’s voting rights

00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:53.228
that endured in the coming years.

00:03:53.228 --> 00:03:56.290
Suffragists kept up steady pressure 
on their representatives,

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.617
attended rallies, and petitioned 
the White House.
