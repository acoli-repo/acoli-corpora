00:01:27.213 --> 00:01:30.760
As a member of the National American 
Women Suffrage Association,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.228
Paul proposed a massive pageant to whip 
up support and rejuvenate the movement.

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:37.835
Washington authorities initially 
rejected her plan-

00:01:37.835 --> 00:01:41.201
and then tried to relegate the march 
to side streets.

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.651
But Paul got those decisions overturned

00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:47.112
and confirmed a parade for the day 
before the presidential inauguration

00:01:47.112 --> 00:01:48.668
of Woodrow Wilson.

00:01:48.668 --> 00:01:50.714
This would maximize media coverage

00:01:50.714 --> 00:01:53.850
and grab the attention of the 
crowds who would be in town.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.087
However, in planning the parade,

00:01:56.087 --> 00:01:59.731
Paul mainly focused on appealing to 
white women from all backgrounds,

00:01:59.731 --> 00:02:01.773
including those who were racist.
