00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:09.106
On March 3, 1913,

00:00:09.106 --> 00:00:12.175
protesters parted for the woman in white:

00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:15.566
dressed in a flowing cape and 
sitting astride a white horse,

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:19.077
the activist Inez Milholland was 
hard to miss.

00:00:19.077 --> 00:00:22.096
She was riding at the helm of the 
Women’s Suffrage Parade-

00:00:22.096 --> 00:00:26.556
the first mass protest for a woman’s 
right to vote on a national scale.

00:00:26.556 --> 00:00:29.545
After months of strategic planning 
and controversy,

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:32.420
thousands of women gathered 
in Washington D.C.
