00:02:29.337 --> 00:02:33.675
joined the parade with the 22 founders 
of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority,

00:02:33.675 --> 00:02:37.677
an organization created by female 
students from Howard University.

00:02:37.677 --> 00:02:39.020
In these ways and more,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.604
black women persevered 
despite deep hostility

00:02:41.604 --> 00:02:43.253
from white women in the movement,

00:02:43.253 --> 00:02:46.068
and at great political and physical risk.

00:02:46.068 --> 00:02:47.516
On the day of the parade,

00:02:47.516 --> 00:02:50.519
suffragists assembled to create a 
powerful exhibition.

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.204
The surging sections of the procession 
included international suffragists,

00:02:54.204 --> 00:02:57.373
artists, performers and business-owners.

00:02:57.373 --> 00:02:59.909
Floats came in the form of golden 
chariots;

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.059
an enormous Liberty Bell; and a map 
of enfranchised countries.
