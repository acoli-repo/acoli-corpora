00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:32.420
thousands of women gathered 
in Washington D.C.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.559
Here, they called for a constitutional 
amendment granting them the right to vote.

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.450
By 1913, women’s rights activists had 
been campaigning for decades.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.114
As a disenfranchised group,

00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:48.853
women had no voice in the laws that 
affected their– or anyone else’s– lives.

00:00:48.853 --> 00:00:53.770
However, they were struggling to secure 
broader support for political equality.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.127
They’d achieved no major victories 
since 1896,

00:00:57.127 --> 00:01:00.352
when Utah and Idaho enfranchised women.
