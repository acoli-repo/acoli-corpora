Inez Milholland, the woman on 
the white horse,

00:04:02.413 --> 00:04:05.142
campaigned constantly throughout 
the United States,

00:04:05.142 --> 00:04:07.803
despite suffering from chronic 
health problems.

00:04:07.803 --> 00:04:10.669
She did not live to see her efforts 
come to fruition.

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.064
In 1916,

00:04:12.064 --> 00:04:16.561
she collapsed while giving a 
suffrage speech and died soon after.

00:04:16.561 --> 00:04:18.197
According to popular reports,

00:04:18.197 --> 00:04:19.818
her last words were,

00:04:19.818 --> 00:04:23.834
“Mr. President, how long must women 
wait for liberty?”

00:04:23.834 --> 00:04:26.467
Though full voting inclusion 
would take decades,

00:04:26.467 --> 00:04:29.959
in 1920, Congress ratified the 
19th amendment,

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:34.189
finally granting women the right to vote.
