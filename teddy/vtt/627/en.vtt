00:00:01.196 --> 00:00:02.956
No other organ,

00:00:02.956 --> 00:00:06.636
perhaps no other object in human life,

00:00:06.636 --> 00:00:10.796
is as imbued with metaphor
and meaning as the human heart.

00:00:11.356 --> 00:00:12.756
Over the course of history,

00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:16.116
the heart has been a symbol
of our emotional lives.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:20.836
It was considered by many
to be the seat of the soul,

00:00:20.836 --> 00:00:23.236
the repository of the emotions.

00:00:23.276 --> 00:00:30.036
The very word "emotion" stems in part
from the French verb "Ã©mouvoir,"
