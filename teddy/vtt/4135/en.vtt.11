00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
to the broadcasters who really was in charge.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So, between 1931 and 1939, they raised rates by some 448 percent,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
until the broadcasters finally got together

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and said, okay, enough of this.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And in 1939, a lawyer, Sydney Kaye, started something

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
called Broadcast Music Inc. We know it as BMI.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And BMI was much more democratic in the art

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
that it would include within its repertoire,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
including African American music for the first time in the repertoire.
