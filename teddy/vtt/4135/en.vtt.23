WEBVTT

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
is not what we call, quote, "piracy."

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I'm not talking about nor justifying

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
people taking other people's content in wholesale

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
I'm talking about people taking and recreating

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
using other people's content, using digital technologies

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
to say things differently.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Now, the importance of this

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
is not the technique that you've seen here.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Because, of course, every technique that you've seen here

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
is something that television and film producers

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
have been able to do for the last 50 years.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
The importance is that that technique has been democratized.
