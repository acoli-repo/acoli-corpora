The people will revolt, they predicted, because the very best music

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
was no longer available, because they had shifted

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to the second best public domain provided by BMI.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Well, they didn't revolt, and in 1941, ASCAP cracked.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And the important point to recognize

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
is that even though these broadcasters

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
were broadcasting something you would call second best,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that competition was enough to break, at that time,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
this legal cartel over access to music.
