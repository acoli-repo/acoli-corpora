00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I want to talk to you a little bit about user-generated content.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that's going to tell you a little bit

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
about how we open user-generated content up for business.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So, here's the first story.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
1906. This man, John Philip Sousa, traveled to this place,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the United States Capitol, to talk about this technology,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
what he called the, quote, "talking machines."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Sousa was not a fan of the talking machines.
