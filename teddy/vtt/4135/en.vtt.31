00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
a solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
and to realize the economic potential of that,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
and that's where the story of BMI becomes relevant.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Because, as BMI demonstrated, competition here

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
can achieve some form of balance. The same thing can happen now.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
We don't have a public domain to draw upon now,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
so instead what we need is two types of changes.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
First, that artists and creators embrace the idea,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
choose that their work be made available more freely.
