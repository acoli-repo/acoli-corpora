00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:32.722
And this is one potential solution.

00:03:32.722 --> 00:03:35.643
So this is the Fotokite.

00:03:35.643 --> 00:03:37.526
Well, let me see, it's a quadrocopter,

00:03:37.526 --> 00:03:41.834
but what's kind of special 
about it is there's a leash.

00:03:41.834 --> 00:03:44.928
It's literally a dog leash. It's very convenient.

00:03:44.928 --> 00:03:47.155
And the neat thing about it is,

00:03:47.155 --> 00:03:49.539
to fly it, there's no joysticks, nothing like this.

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:51.877
You just turn it on

00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:54.511
and you point in the direction that you want to fly.

00:03:54.511 --> 00:03:55.850
You give it a little twist.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.592
That's kind of the way you communicate.
