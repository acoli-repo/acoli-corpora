00:04:59.347 --> 00:05:01.216
this thing will actually prevent this thing

00:05:01.216 --> 00:05:02.882
from going into you.

00:05:02.882 --> 00:05:04.970
What's more, it tells you immediately that

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.998
I am the one responsible for this device.

00:05:06.998 --> 00:05:09.518
You don't have to look for someone controlling it.

00:05:09.518 --> 00:05:12.285
Now, I can tell you that it's easy a lot,

00:05:12.285 --> 00:05:15.300
but I think a really good way to prove that

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.359
is to grab a second one

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:22.364
and launch it.

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:25.647
And if I can do this on stage live,

00:05:25.647 --> 00:05:27.910
then I can show each and every one of you

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.965
in five minutes how to 
operate one of these devices.
