00:04:29.025 --> 00:04:30.859
You can turn it on.

00:04:30.859 --> 00:04:36.080
And now, it's like telling your dog to fly lower,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.638
if you have such a dog. So, I can press a button

00:04:38.638 --> 00:04:41.281
and manipulate it rather easily.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.970
So I just shifted its position.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.747
And it's really safe.

00:04:45.747 --> 00:04:48.430
I don't know about you guys in the front row —

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.674
(Laughter) — but at least in principle,

00:04:50.674 --> 00:04:52.789
you have to agree that you feel safer

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.837
because there is a physical connection.

00:04:54.837 --> 00:04:56.355
Live demos are hard, right?

00:04:56.355 --> 00:04:57.907
Things go wrong all the time.

00:04:57.907 --> 00:04:59.347
But no matter what,

00:04:59.347 --> 00:05:01.216
this thing will actually prevent this thing
