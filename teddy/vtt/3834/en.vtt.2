00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.975
So in a single image,

00:01:00.975 --> 00:01:04.770
you can really see the scale of this event —

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.838
just the number of people,

00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:10.525
the colors, the banners.

00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:14.366
You just can't consider this insignificant.

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.368
All in a single image, which was really cool to me.

00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:19.427
And I think, in the future,

00:01:19.427 --> 00:01:21.913
journalism and many other professions,

00:01:21.913 --> 00:01:24.432
there are flying cameras already
quite commonly out there,

00:01:24.432 --> 00:01:27.873
but I think, you wait a few months, a few years,

00:01:27.873 --> 00:01:29.910
and for many professions, it's really going to be

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.755
a requirement.
