00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:31.120
all people and all conditions,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.517
so we really have to make piloting easier.

00:02:33.517 --> 00:02:35.799
The other problem is regulations,

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.825
or rather, the lack of good regulation.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.738
For many good reasons, it's just difficult

00:02:40.738 --> 00:02:42.860
to come up with common sense laws

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.911
to regulate flying cameras.

00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:47.239
So we already have cameras.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.815
Everyone here, I'm sure, has a
smartphone with a camera, right?

00:02:49.815 --> 00:02:51.447
There are more and more of them.

00:02:51.447 --> 00:02:53.621
You hear about people with
Google Glass being attacked.

00:02:53.621 --> 00:02:56.321
You hear about, actually, a drone pilot,

00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:58.222
a hobbyist, was attacked two weeks ago

00:02:58.222 --> 00:03:00.348
because he was flying near a beach.
