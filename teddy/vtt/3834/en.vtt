00:00:00.378 --> 00:00:02.544
I came here to show you

00:00:02.544 --> 00:00:03.829
the Fotokite.

00:00:03.829 --> 00:00:05.931
It's a tethered, flying camera.

00:00:05.931 --> 00:00:08.170
But before I do that, I want to tell you a bit about

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.344

00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:11.839
So I was born in Russia,

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.948

00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:19.819
There were massive irregularities reported,

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:21.476
and people came out to protest,

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:25.170
which was very unlikely for Russia.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.755
And no one really knew

00:00:26.755 --> 00:00:28.839
how significant these protests were,

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.253
because, for whatever reason,
