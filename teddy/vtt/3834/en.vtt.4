It's a bit uncomfortable to fly,

00:02:01.868 --> 00:02:03.345
probably also for the operator.

00:02:03.345 --> 00:02:06.907
In fact, you can see that on the 
back of the pilot's shirt, it says,

00:02:06.907 --> 00:02:08.966
"No questions until landing"

00:02:08.966 --> 00:02:10.850
in Russian and in English,

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.224
because people are curious, and they'll go tap you,

00:02:13.224 --> 00:02:15.732
and then you lose your focus and things happen.

00:02:15.732 --> 00:02:17.947
And these guys are great. They're professionals;

00:02:17.947 --> 00:02:20.940
they're really careful in what they do.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.549
So in the protests, maybe you noticed,

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.407
they flew over the river so it was quite safe.

00:02:26.407 --> 00:02:29.411
But this doesn't necessarily apply to

00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:31.120
all people and all conditions,
