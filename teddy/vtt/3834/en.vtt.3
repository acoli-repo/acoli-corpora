00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.755
a requirement.

00:01:31.755 --> 00:01:33.994
And it make sense. It's 
such a unique perspective.

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:37.483
Nothing really communicates 
this scale, for example,

00:01:37.483 --> 00:01:40.507
in context, in a way that this does.

00:01:40.507 --> 00:01:42.925
But there are a few hurdles, 
and they are quite basic

00:01:42.925 --> 00:01:44.962
and quite fundamental.

00:01:44.962 --> 00:01:46.211
One is piloting.

00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:50.136
So for this image, they flew a camera,

00:01:50.136 --> 00:01:54.962
a five kilogram device with an SLR under it.

00:01:54.962 --> 00:01:59.438
It's quite heavy, lots of 
spinning, sharp things.

00:01:59.438 --> 00:02:01.868
It's a bit uncomfortable to fly,
