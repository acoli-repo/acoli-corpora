00:01:29.302 --> 00:01:32.572
a sense of surprise and unpredictability.

00:01:32.572 --> 00:01:34.339
Why not strangers?

00:01:34.339 --> 00:01:36.633
Because strangers are part of a world

00:01:36.633 --> 00:01:38.898
of really rigid boundaries.

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.850
They belong to a world of people I know

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.364
versus people I don't know,

00:01:44.364 --> 00:01:46.843
and in the context of my digital relations,

00:01:46.843 --> 00:01:50.864
I'm already doing things with people I don't know.

00:01:50.864 --> 00:01:54.082
The question isn't whether or not I know you.

00:01:54.082 --> 00:01:56.586
The question is, what can I do with you?

00:01:56.586 --> 00:01:59.195
What can I learn with you?

00:01:59.195 --> 00:02:03.496
What can we do together that benefits us both?
