00:03:58.888 --> 00:04:02.023
to take our possessions, those things that used to be

00:04:02.023 --> 00:04:05.145
very restricted to us and to our friends in our houses,

00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:08.967
and to make them available to people we don't know.

00:04:08.967 --> 00:04:11.690
Whether it's our clothes, whether it's our cars,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.313
whether it's our bikes, whether it's our books or music,

00:04:14.313 --> 00:04:17.306
we are able to take our possessions now

00:04:17.306 --> 00:04:20.737
and make them available to people we've never met.

00:04:20.737 --> 00:04:23.548
And we concluded a very important insight,

00:04:23.548 --> 00:04:25.336
which was that as people's relationships

00:04:25.336 --> 00:04:27.877
to the things in their lives change,

00:04:27.877 --> 00:04:31.321
so do their relations with other people.
