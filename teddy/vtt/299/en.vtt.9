00:04:27.877 --> 00:04:31.321
so do their relations with other people.

00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:32.729
And yet recommendation system

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.004
after recommendation system continues to miss the boat.

00:04:37.004 --> 00:04:39.553
It continues to try to predict what I need

00:04:39.553 --> 00:04:42.793
based on some past characterization of who I am,

00:04:42.793 --> 00:04:45.089
of what I've already done.

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:47.593
Security technology after security technology

00:04:47.593 --> 00:04:49.769
continues to design data protection

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:52.174
in terms of threats and attacks,

00:04:52.174 --> 00:04:55.769
keeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations.

00:04:55.769 --> 00:04:58.265
Categories like "friends" and "family"

00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:00.742
and "contacts" and "colleagues"
