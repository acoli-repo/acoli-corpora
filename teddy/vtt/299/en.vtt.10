00:04:58.265 --> 00:05:00.742
and "contacts" and "colleagues"

00:05:00.742 --> 00:05:04.529
don't tell me anything about my actual relations.

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:06.773
A more effective way to think about my relations

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:09.465
might be in terms of closeness and distance,

00:05:09.465 --> 00:05:13.285
where at any given point in time, with any single person,

00:05:13.285 --> 00:05:16.776
I am both close and distant from that individual,

00:05:16.776 --> 00:05:21.284
all as a function of what I need to do right now.

00:05:21.284 --> 00:05:23.922
People aren't close or distant.

00:05:23.922 --> 00:05:26.983
People are always a combination of the two,

00:05:26.983 --> 00:05:30.703
and that combination is constantly changing.
