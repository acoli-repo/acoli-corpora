"Don't talk to strangers."

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.219
You have heard that phrase uttered

00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:10.532
by your friends, family, schools and the media for decades.

00:00:10.532 --> 00:00:13.444
It's a norm. It's a social norm.

00:00:13.444 --> 00:00:15.802
But it's a special kind of social norm,

00:00:15.802 --> 00:00:18.332
because it's a social norm that wants to tell us

00:00:18.332 --> 00:00:22.796
who we can relate to and who we shouldn't relate to.

00:00:22.796 --> 00:00:25.300
"Don't talk to strangers" says,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.476
"Stay from anyone who's not familiar to you.

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:31.891
Stick with the people you know.
