strangers are quite frankly not the point.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.402
The point that we should be worried about is,

00:01:05.402 --> 00:01:08.289
how much strangeness are we getting?

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.295
Why strangeness? Because our social relations

00:01:11.295 --> 00:01:14.089
are increasingly mediated by data,

00:01:14.089 --> 00:01:18.646
and data turns our social relations into digital relations,

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:20.995
and that means that our digital relations

00:01:20.995 --> 00:01:24.797
now depend extraordinarily on technology

00:01:24.797 --> 00:01:27.715
to bring to them a sense of robustness,

00:01:27.715 --> 00:01:29.302
a sense of discovery,

00:01:29.302 --> 00:01:32.572
a sense of surprise and unpredictability.
