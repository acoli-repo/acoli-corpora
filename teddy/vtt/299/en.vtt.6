00:02:56.687 --> 00:03:00.199
made the point that any two arbitrarily selected people

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.921
were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps.

00:03:03.921 --> 00:03:06.951
His point was that strangers are out there.

00:03:06.951 --> 00:03:08.523
We can reach them. There are paths

00:03:08.523 --> 00:03:11.209
that enable us to reach them.

Mark Granovetter, Stanford sociologist, in 1973

00:03:14.978 --> 00:03:17.776
in his seminal essay "The Strength of Weak Ties,"

00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:20.602
made the point that these weak ties

00:03:20.602 --> 00:03:23.089
that are a part of our networks, these strangers,

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:26.081
are actually more effective at diffusing information to us

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:30.617
than are our strong ties, the people closest to us.
