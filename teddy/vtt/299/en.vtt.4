What can we do together that benefits us both?

00:02:03.496 --> 00:02:05.858
I spend a lot of time thinking about

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:08.618
how the social landscape is changing,

00:02:08.618 --> 00:02:11.090
how new technologies create new constraints

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.880
and new opportunities for people.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.531
The most important changes facing us today

00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:19.337
have to do with data and what data is doing

00:02:19.337 --> 00:02:21.442
to shape the kinds of digital relations

00:02:21.442 --> 00:02:23.906
that will be possible for us in the future.

00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:26.139
The economies of the future depend on that.

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.058
Our social lives in the future depend on that.

00:02:29.058 --> 00:02:32.090
The threat to worry about isn't strangers.
