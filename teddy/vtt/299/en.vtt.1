00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:31.891
Stick with the people you know.

00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:34.865
Stick with people like you."

00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:37.217
How appealing is that?

00:00:37.217 --> 00:00:40.442
It's not really what we do, is it, when we're at our best?

00:00:40.442 --> 00:00:43.226
When we're at our best, we reach out to people

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:44.844
who are not like us,

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.711
because when we do that, we learn from people

00:00:47.711 --> 00:00:49.980
who are not like us.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.081
My phrase for this value of being with "not like us"

00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:55.953
is "strangeness,"

00:00:55.953 --> 00:00:59.853
and my point is that in today's digitally intensive world,

00:00:59.853 --> 00:01:03.219
strangers are quite frankly not the point.
