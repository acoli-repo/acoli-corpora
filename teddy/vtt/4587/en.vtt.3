00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:31.429
in some pretty interesting activities,

00:01:31.453 --> 00:01:35.494
playing music is the brain's equivalent
of a full-body workout.

00:01:35.518 --> 00:01:38.682
The neuroscientists saw
multiple areas of the brain light up,

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:41.614
simultaneously processing
different information

00:01:41.638 --> 00:01:45.508
in intricate, interrelated,
and astonishingly fast sequences.

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:49.860
But what is it about making music
that sets the brain alight?

00:01:49.884 --> 00:01:51.795
The research is still fairly new,

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.476
but neuroscientists
have a pretty good idea.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.928
Playing a musical instrument

00:01:55.952 --> 00:01:59.293
engages practically every area
of the brain at once,

00:01:59.317 --> 00:02:03.315
especially the visual,
auditory, and motor cortices.
