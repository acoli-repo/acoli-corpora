00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.171
Multiple areas of their brains
were lighting up at once,

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:02.820
as they processed the sound,

00:01:02.844 --> 00:01:05.841
took it apart to understand elements
like melody and rhythm,

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:10.028
and then put it all back together
into unified musical experience.

00:01:10.052 --> 00:01:13.019
And our brains do all this work
in the split second

00:01:13.043 --> 00:01:17.385
between when we first hear the music
and when our foot starts to tap along.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.921
But when scientists turned
from observing the brains

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:22.611
of music listeners to those of musicians,

00:01:22.635 --> 00:01:25.892
the little backyard fireworks
became a jubilee.

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:29.447
It turns out that while listening
to music engages the brain

00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:31.429
in some pretty interesting activities,
