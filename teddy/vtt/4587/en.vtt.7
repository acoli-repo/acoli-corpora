00:03:29.232 --> 00:03:31.970
to give each memory multiple tags,

00:03:31.994 --> 00:03:34.310
such as a conceptual tag,
an emotional tag,

00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:36.850
an audio tag, and a contextual tag,

00:03:36.874 --> 00:03:38.579
like a good Internet search engine.

00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:42.659
How do we know that all these benefits
are unique to music,

00:03:42.683 --> 00:03:45.148
as opposed to, say, sports or painting?

00:03:45.172 --> 00:03:47.545
Or could it be
that people who go into music

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.474
were already smarter to begin with?

00:03:49.498 --> 00:03:52.679
Neuroscientists have explored
these issues, but so far,

00:03:52.703 --> 00:03:55.353
they have found that the artistic
and aesthetic aspects

00:03:55.377 --> 00:03:57.330
of learning to play a musical instrument

00:03:57.354 --> 00:04:01.709
are different from any other activity
studied, including other arts.
