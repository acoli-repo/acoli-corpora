00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:31.385
How do we know this?

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:33.201
Well, in the last few decades,

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:35.696
neuroscientists have made
enormous breakthroughs

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.329
in understanding how our brains work
by monitoring them in real time

00:00:40.353 --> 00:00:43.441
with instruments like
fMRI and PET scanners.

00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:45.694
When people are hooked up
to these machines,

00:00:45.718 --> 00:00:48.600
tasks, such as reading
or doing math problems,

00:00:48.624 --> 00:00:53.010
each have corresponding areas of the brain
where activity can be observed.

00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:56.292
But when researchers got
the participants to listen to music,

00:00:56.316 --> 00:00:58.276
they saw fireworks.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.171
Multiple areas of their brains
were lighting up at once,
