00:01:59.317 --> 00:02:03.315
especially the visual,
auditory, and motor cortices.

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:07.757
As with any other workout, disciplined,
structured practice in playing music

00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:11.690
strengthens those brain functions,
allowing us to apply that strength

00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:13.595
to other activities.

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:17.120
The most obvious difference between
listening to music and playing it

00:02:17.144 --> 00:02:19.704
is that the latter requires
fine motor skills,

00:02:19.728 --> 00:02:22.781
which are controlled
in both hemispheres of the brain.

00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:26.113
It also combines the linguistic
and mathematical precision,

00:02:26.137 --> 00:02:28.382
in which the left hemisphere
is more involved,

00:02:28.406 --> 00:02:31.941
with the novel and creative
content that the right excels in.
