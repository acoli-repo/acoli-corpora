00:03:57.354 --> 00:04:01.709
are different from any other activity
studied, including other arts.

00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:04.244
And several randomized studies
of participants,

00:04:04.268 --> 00:04:05.670
who showed the same levels

00:04:05.694 --> 00:04:09.047
of cognitive function
and neural processing at the start,

00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:12.855
found that those who were exposed
to a period of music learning

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.183
showed enhancement in multiple
brain areas, compared to the others.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.908
This recent research about
the mental benefits of playing music

00:04:19.932 --> 00:04:22.565
has advanced our understanding
of mental function,

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:25.501
revealing the inner rhythms
and complex interplay

00:04:25.525 --> 00:04:28.493
that make up the amazing
orchestra of our brain.
