00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:02.212
musicians often have higher levels
of executive function,

00:03:02.236 --> 00:03:04.237
a category of interlinked tasks

00:03:04.261 --> 00:03:07.896
that includes planning, strategizing,
and attention to detail

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.231
and requires simultaneous analysis
of both cognitive and emotional aspects.

00:03:13.255 --> 00:03:16.478
This ability also has an impact
on how our memory systems work.

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:20.425
And, indeed, musicians exhibit
enhanced memory functions,

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:25.454
creating, storing, and retrieving memories
more quickly and efficiently.

00:03:25.478 --> 00:03:29.208
Studies have found that musicians appear
to use their highly connected brains

00:03:29.232 --> 00:03:31.970
to give each memory multiple tags,
