Did you know that every time
musicians pick up their instruments,

00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:20.269
there are fireworks going off
all over their brain?

00:00:20.293 --> 00:00:22.856
On the outside,
they may look calm and focused,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.843
reading the music and making the precise
and practiced movements required.

00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:29.354
But inside their brains,
there's a party going on.
