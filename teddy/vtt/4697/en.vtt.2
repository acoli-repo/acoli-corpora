00:01:00.424 --> 00:01:01.710
So, you hold out your arms,

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:02.970
hoping to catch her.

00:01:02.994 --> 00:01:04.992
Seconds later, you will find yourself

00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:07.664
holding her lifeless body.

00:01:07.688 --> 00:01:08.657
What happened?

00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:11.528
Well, pressure is force divided by area.

00:01:11.552 --> 00:01:12.767
The smaller the area,

00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:13.972
the bigger the pressure.

00:01:13.996 --> 00:01:15.859
This is why we can lift heavy objects

00:01:15.883 --> 00:01:17.405
without breaking our skin,

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:19.145
but a tiny needle can make us bleed

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:21.865
with just a little poke.

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:24.032
The pressure that will be
exerted on her body

00:01:24.056 --> 00:01:25.821
can be calculated by force

00:01:25.845 --> 00:01:28.454
divided by the area
on the top of your arms

00:01:28.478 --> 00:01:29.955
that comes in contact with her.

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.707
It doesn't matter if your arms
are strong enough
