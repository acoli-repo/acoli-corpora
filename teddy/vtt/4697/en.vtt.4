00:01:59.228 --> 00:02:00.393
with your arms above your head

00:02:00.417 --> 00:02:01.228
holding a door,

00:02:01.252 --> 00:02:03.014
in hopes of distributing the pressure

00:02:03.038 --> 00:02:04.654
across a larger surface area,

00:02:04.678 --> 00:02:06.678
but all you're doing is essentially moving

00:02:06.702 --> 00:02:08.623
the ground up by 10 feet.

00:02:08.647 --> 00:02:10.908
So, she's now falling from 290 feet,

00:02:10.932 --> 00:02:12.415
instead of 300 feet,

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.675
reaching the speed of 173 feet per second

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:16.491
just before impact,

00:02:16.515 --> 00:02:18.429
not counting air resistance.

00:02:18.453 --> 00:02:21.073
It's the equivalent of crashing
at 94 miles per hour

00:02:21.097 --> 00:02:24.347
into a wall with a door in front of it.

00:02:27.684 --> 00:02:30.514
The only thing that could
save her is flying.
