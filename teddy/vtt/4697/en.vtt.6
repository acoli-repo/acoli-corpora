00:02:58.252 --> 00:03:01.044
her head is getting that much
closer to the pavement!

00:03:01.068 --> 00:03:02.505
If she's falling from a high place,

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:03.671
and you can't get to her

00:03:03.695 --> 00:03:05.838
until she's only a few feet
above the ground,

00:03:05.862 --> 00:03:07.685
there's really nothing you can do

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.008
other than magically turn the pavement

00:03:10.032 --> 00:03:10.988
into marshmellow

00:03:11.012 --> 00:03:14.340
to allow her enough time
to slowly come to a stop.

00:03:16.894 --> 00:03:19.228
Then, break out the chocolate
and graham crackers

00:03:19.252 --> 00:03:21.124
and you've got s'mores.

00:03:21.148 --> 00:03:22.949
Mmmm, delicious!

00:03:26.642 --> 00:03:29.258
Now, which superpower physics lesson

00:03:29.282 --> 00:03:31.527
will you explore next?
