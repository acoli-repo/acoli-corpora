00:02:27.684 --> 00:02:30.514
The only thing that could
save her is flying.

00:02:30.538 --> 00:02:34.134
But that power comes with its
own host of scientific issues.

00:02:34.158 --> 00:02:36.310
If you could fly,

00:02:36.334 --> 00:02:38.578
what you must do is fly up to her,

00:02:38.602 --> 00:02:40.824
start flying down at the speed
she is falling,

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:42.063
hold on to her,

00:02:42.087 --> 00:02:43.760
then gradually slow down

00:02:43.784 --> 00:02:45.842
until you come to a complete stop.

00:02:48.272 --> 00:02:50.376
This process requires
a lot of cushion space

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.165
between the point she starts
falling and the ground.

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.195
Every second you waste

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.812
on changing into your superhero costume

00:02:56.836 --> 00:02:58.228
and flying up to her height,

00:02:58.252 --> 00:03:01.044
her head is getting that much
closer to the pavement!
