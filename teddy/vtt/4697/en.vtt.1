00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.148
has expanded one thousand times.

00:00:31.172 --> 00:00:32.844
You'd have to be very careful

00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:34.488
when you're shaking someone's hand

00:00:34.512 --> 00:00:36.417
so you don't end up breaking their bones

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:39.421
or crushing everyone you hug.

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:43.320
And using a fork to pick
up a piece of broccoli

00:00:43.344 --> 00:00:44.412
from a Styrofoam plate

00:00:44.436 --> 00:00:46.436
without driving the fork through the plate

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.252
is going to be as difficult
as brain surgery.

00:00:51.276 --> 00:00:52.396
Say the day comes

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.259
and you get the chance
to save a damsel in distress

00:00:55.283 --> 00:00:57.659
falling from a helicopter.
