00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.707
It doesn't matter if your arms
are strong enough

00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:34.044
to catch her body
without breaking your bones.

00:01:34.068 --> 00:01:35.497
Her spine is not strong enough

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:37.915
to be caught by you without being damaged.

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.654
Even if you rip off the nearest door

00:01:39.678 --> 00:01:41.931
to provide a bigger
area to catch her with,

00:01:43.932 --> 00:01:46.893
you still wouldn't be
able to save her anyway.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.120
Remember, it's not
the fall that kills her,

00:01:50.144 --> 00:01:52.820
but the sudden stop at the bottom.

00:01:52.844 --> 00:01:55.178
Let's say she's falling
from a 32 story building,

00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:56.205
about 300 feet,

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.526
and you are 6 feet tall,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.204
maybe 10 feet on your tippy-toes,

00:01:59.228 --> 00:02:00.393
with your arms above your head
