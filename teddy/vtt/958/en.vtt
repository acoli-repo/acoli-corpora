00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to address the issue of compassion.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Compassion has many faces.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Some of them are fierce; some of them are wrathful;

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
some of them are tender; some of them are wise.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
A line that the Dalai Lama once said,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
he said, "Love and compassion are necessities.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
They are not luxuries.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Without them,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
humanity cannot survive."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And I would suggest,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
it is not only humanity that won't survive,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but it is all species on the planet,
