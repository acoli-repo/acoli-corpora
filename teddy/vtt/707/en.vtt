Pat Mitchell: You have brought us images from the Yemen Times.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And take us through those,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and introduce us to another Yemen.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Nadia Al-Sakkaf: Well, I'm glad to be here.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I would like to share with you all

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
some of the pictures that are happening today in Yemen.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This picture shows a revolution

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
started by women,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and it shows women and men

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
leading a mixed protest.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The other picture

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is the popularity of the real need for change.
