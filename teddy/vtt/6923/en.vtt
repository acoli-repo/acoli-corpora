While the weather in Iceland is
often cold, wet, and windy,

00:00:12.454 --> 00:00:17.329
a nearly endless supply of heat bubbles
away below the surface.

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:22.913
In fact, almost every building in the 
country is heated by geothermal energy,

00:00:22.913 --> 00:00:26.663
in a process with virtually
no carbon emissions.

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.038
So how exactly does this renewable energy
work?
