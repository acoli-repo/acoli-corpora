This is a solar concentrator
in Seville, Spain.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.576
So this facility contains 2,650 mirrors

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.656
which are arrayed in concentric circles
around an 140-meter-tall tower

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.920
at its center.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.936
At the top of the tower,

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.176
there is a capsule of molten salt

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.816
that gets heated by the beams
of light reflected upwards

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.160
from the mirrors below.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.256
From there, the salt circulates
to a storage tank underground,
