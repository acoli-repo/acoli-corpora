If you look closely at this overview,
you'll see a lot of little specks.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.576
Those are actually cows at a feedlot

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.120
in Summerfield, Texas,
in the United States.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.296
So once cows reach a particular weight,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.456
roughly 300 kilograms,

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.280
they are moved here
and placed on a specialized diet.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.096
Over the next three to four months,
the cows gain an additional 180 kilograms

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.256
before they are shipped off to slaughter.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.696
