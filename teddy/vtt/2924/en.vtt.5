00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.896
to see if I could bring this feeling
of overwhelming scale and beauty

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.576
to many more people

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.656
just by using one small computer

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.880
in my small New York City apartment.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.496
It was then, in 2013,
that I launched "Daily Overview."

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.056
Every day, I have used satellite imagery

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.456
to create one expansive
overhead view of our planet.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.416
More than 1,000 of these images
have been created thus far,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.936
and more than 600,000 people

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.016
tune in for this daily dose
of perspectives.
