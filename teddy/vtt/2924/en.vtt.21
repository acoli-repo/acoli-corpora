00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.040
what the places I just showed you
look like from outer space.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.416
And while you may enjoy
the aesthetics of an image,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.696
once you learn exactly
what it is you're seeing,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.600
you may struggle with the fact
that you still like it.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.296
And that's the tension
I want to create with my work,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.456
because I believe
it is that contemplation,

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.416
that internal dialogue

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.856
that will lead to greater
interest in our planet

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.120
and more awareness
of what we're doing to it.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.896
I believe that viewing the Earth
from the overview perspective

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.760
is more important now than ever before.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.776
Through the incredible technology
of these high-flying cameras,
