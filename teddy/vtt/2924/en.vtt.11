You're also probably wondering
about this glowing pool at the top there.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.576
That gets its color from a unique
combination of manure, chemicals

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.640
and a particular type of algae
that grows in the stagnant water.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.976
This is the Mount Whaleback iron ore mine

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.296
in the Pilbara region
of Western Australia,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.136
a beautiful yet scary scar
on the face of the Earth.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.216
Of the world's mined iron ore,

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.176
98 percent is used to make steel

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.496
and is therefore a major component
in the construction of buildings,

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.520
automobiles or appliances
such as your dishwasher or refrigerator.
