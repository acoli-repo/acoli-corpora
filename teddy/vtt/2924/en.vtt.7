00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.896
that has a focal length of 16 meters,

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.616
so that's roughly 290 times greater

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.960
than a DSLR camera equipped
with a standard 55 millimeter lens.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.256
So if were able to attach
one of their satellites

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.440
to the roof of this theater in Oxford,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.976
we could take a picture of a football,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.080
clearly, on the pitch
at the stadium in Amsterdam.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.600
That's 450 kilometers away.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.496
That's incredibly powerful technology.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.016
And I decided at the beginning
of this project
