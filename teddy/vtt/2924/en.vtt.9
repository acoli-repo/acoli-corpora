WEBVTT

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.136
we shape landscapes and seascapes

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.120
and cityscapes with increasing
control and impunity.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.896
So with that in mind,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.600
I would like to share
a few of my overviews with you now.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.176
Here we see cargo ships and oil tankers

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.960
waiting outside the entry
to the port of Singapore.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.816
This facility is the second-busiest
in the world by terms of total tonnage,

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.216
accounting for one-fifth
of the world's shipping containers

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.696
and one half of the annual supply

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.080
of crude oil.
