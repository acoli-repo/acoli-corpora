00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.736
where it produces steam,

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.216
which spins turbines

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.736
and generates enough electricity
to power 70,000 homes

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.080
and offsets 30,000 tons
of carbon dioxide emissions every year.

by the expansion of mechanized agriculture

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.056
and cattle ranching,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.296
so as the country tries to meet
the demand of its growing population
