00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.016
And I decided at the beginning
of this project

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.496
that I would use
that incredible technology

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.416
to focus on the places

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.760
where humans have impacted the planet.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.496
As a species, we dig and scrape
the Earth for resources,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.960
we produce energy,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.200
we raise animals
and cultivate crops for food,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.336
we build cities, we move around,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.696
we create waste.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.016
And in the process
of doing all of these things,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.136
we shape landscapes and seascapes
