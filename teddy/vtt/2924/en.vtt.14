00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.296
so as the country tries to meet
the demand of its growing population

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.536
and feed them,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.856
the sacrificial destruction
of its rainforest

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.360
has taken place to do so.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.136
It is estimated that the country
lost 4.5 million acres of rainforest

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.616
in one decade alone

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.840
from 2000 until 2010.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.840
This is the Eixample district
in Barcelona, Spain.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.416
So the overview perspective
can be incredibly helpful

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.456
to help us understand how cities function

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.416
and how we can devise
smarter solutions for urban planning,

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.576
and this will become only more relevant
