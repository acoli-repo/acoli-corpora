In a study released just this past year,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.456
a team of researchers
at the University of Pennsylvania

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.096
examined the testimonies
of hundreds of astronauts

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.376
who had the opportunity

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.096
second, an increased sense
of connection to all other living beings;
