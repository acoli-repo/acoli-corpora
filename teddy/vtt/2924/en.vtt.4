00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.720
This feeling is commonly referred to
as the "overview effect."

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.360
Only 558 people
have ever been to outer space.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.336
558 people had the opportunity

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.496
to gaze down in awe,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.176
to wonder at our planet

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.816
floating in an infinite sea of darkness.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.616
But what if that number were bigger?

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.136
Three years ago,
I set off on my own mission:

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.896
to see if I could bring this feeling
of overwhelming scale and beauty
