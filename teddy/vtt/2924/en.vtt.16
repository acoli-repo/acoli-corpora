00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.976
This is the Dadaab Refugee Camp
in northern Kenya,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.936
the largest such facility
of its kind in the world.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.216
To cope with the influx of refugees
who are fleeing Somalia,

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.136
where there is famine and conflict,

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.656
the UN has built this area
gridded out at left

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.416
called the LFO extension

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.976
to house more and more refugees

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.976
who are arriving and occupying
these white dots,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.336
which are actually tents

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.840
which will slowly fill up
the area over time.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.576
So if you have one of these overviews,

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.400
you have a moment in time.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.136
If we have two overviews, however,
