00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.016
tune in for this daily dose
of perspectives.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.136
I create the imagery by curating photos
from the massive archive

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.520
of a satellite company
called Digital Globe.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.856
They operate a constellation
of five satellites,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.496
each roughly the size of an ambulance,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.936
that is constantly
taking pictures of the Earth

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.280
as they orbit at
28,000 kilometers per hour.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.840
Now, what does this mean?

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.976
Each of these satellites
is equipped with a camera

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.896
that has a focal length of 16 meters,
