above the Moon's horizon.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.616
Astronaut Bill Anders frantically
asks his crewmates where their camera is,

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.056
grabs the Hasselblad,
points it towards the window,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.416
presses the shutter,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.560
and takes one of the most
important photographs of all time:

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.760
"Earthrise."

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.376
When the crew was safely home
a few days later,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.020
they were asked about the mission.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.216
Anders famously replied,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.336
"We went to the moon,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.560
but we actually discovered Earth."
