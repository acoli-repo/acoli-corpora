00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.440
and displaced millions.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.536
So this patch of desert
is seen in Mafraq, Jordan in 2011,

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.256
the year the conflict started,

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.920
and when we compare it to an image
captured just this year in 2017,

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.320
we see the construction
of the Zaatari refugee camp.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.696
So just as the astronauts of Apollo 8

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.656
watched the Earth rising above
the lunar landscape for the first time,

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.856
there is no way
that you could have imagined

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.040
what the places I just showed you
look like from outer space.
