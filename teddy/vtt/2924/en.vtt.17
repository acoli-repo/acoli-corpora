00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.136
If we have two overviews, however,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.000
we are able to tell stories
about changes in time.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.096
I call that feature
of the project "Juxtapose,"

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.480
and we'll share a few examples
of it with you now.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.560
So the tulip fields in Netherlands
bloom every year in April.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.256
So we take an image
captured in March a few weeks before

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.800
and contrast it to one
taken a few weeks later.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:56.000
We're able to watch the flowers bloom
in this magnificent cascade of color.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.440
It is estimated that the Dutch produce
4.3 billion tulip bulbs every year.
