00:00:01.142 --> 00:00:04.360
It's Christmas Eve, 1968.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.936
The Apollo 8 spacecraft
has successfully completed

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.680
its first three orbits around the moon.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.656
Launched from Cape Canaveral
three days before,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.376
this is the first time

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.120
that humans have ever traveled
beyond low Earth orbit.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.456
On the vessel's fourth pass,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.176
the Earth slowly comes into view

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.160
and reveals itself
above the Moon's horizon.
