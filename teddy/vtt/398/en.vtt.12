00:06:08.247 --> 00:06:12.786
So I was talking about the necessity
to showcase our stories,

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.984
because when I think about
the sacrifices that were made for us,

00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:17.655
it helped me keep going.

00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:20.500
One of the very first actions
of our Faure Must Go movement

00:06:20.524 --> 00:06:23.911
was to come up with a petition,
asking citizens to sign

00:06:23.935 --> 00:06:28.041
so that we can demand new elections,
as the constitution allows.

00:06:28.065 --> 00:06:29.885
People were scared to put their names

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:32.495
because, they said,
they don't want to get in trouble.
