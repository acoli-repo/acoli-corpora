00:06:58.686 --> 00:07:02.710
It is the stories of resistance,
the stories of defiance,

00:07:02.734 --> 00:07:04.795
the stories of resilience,

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:06.919
that inspire people to get involved,

00:07:06.943 --> 00:07:10.432
not the stories of abuse
and killings and hurt,

00:07:10.456 --> 00:07:13.808
because as humans, it's only natural
for us to be scared.

00:07:14.268 --> 00:07:17.803
I would like to share with you
a few characteristics of dictatorships

00:07:17.827 --> 00:07:20.461
so that you can assess your own country

00:07:20.485 --> 00:07:23.537
and see if you are also
at risk of joining us.

00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:25.899
(Laughter and cheers)

00:07:25.923 --> 00:07:30.677
(Applause)
