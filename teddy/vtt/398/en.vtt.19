00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.838
you just run, disappear;
you vanish from the universe,

00:09:31.862 --> 00:09:33.910
because they can still find you in Turkey.

00:09:33.934 --> 00:09:36.789
So people like myself,
we don't get to live in Togo anymore.

00:09:36.813 --> 00:09:37.969
And people like myself,

00:09:37.993 --> 00:09:40.899
we don't get to live in the same place
for more than a month,

00:09:40.923 --> 00:09:42.608
because we don't want to be traced.

00:09:42.632 --> 00:09:43.910

are beyond human imagination.

00:09:50.476 --> 00:09:53.103
The stories of some
of the activists that were killed,

00:09:53.127 --> 00:09:55.552
their bodies dumped in the sea,

00:09:55.576 --> 00:09:57.014
that were tortured

00:09:57.038 --> 00:10:00.313
to the point where they lost
their hearing or their sight --
