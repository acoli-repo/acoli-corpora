00:07:25.923 --> 00:07:30.677
(Applause)

00:07:31.141 --> 00:07:33.667
Number one thing to look at:
concentration of power.

00:07:33.691 --> 00:07:37.168
Is the power in your country concentrated
in the hands of a few, an elite?

00:07:37.192 --> 00:07:39.824
It can be a political elite,
ideological elite.

00:07:39.848 --> 00:07:41.410
And you have a strongman,

00:07:41.434 --> 00:07:45.027
because we always have one guy
who is presented as the messiah

00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:47.013
who will save us from the world.

00:07:47.037 --> 00:07:49.514
The second point is propaganda.

00:07:49.538 --> 00:07:51.651
Dictators feed on propaganda.

00:07:51.675 --> 00:07:54.419
They like giving the impression
that they are the saviors,

00:07:54.443 --> 00:07:56.622
and without them,
the country will fall apart.

00:07:56.646 --> 00:07:59.801
And they are always fighting
some foreign forces, you know?

00:07:59.825 --> 00:08:01.952
The Christians, the Jewish, the Muslims,
