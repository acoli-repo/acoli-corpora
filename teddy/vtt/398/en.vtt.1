00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:30.610
Togo has been ruled
by the same family for 51 years,

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:34.125
making us the oldest autocracy in Africa.

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.323
That's a record.

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:36.941
We have a second-coolest record:

00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:41.170
we have been ranked three times
as the unhappiest country on earth.

00:00:41.194 --> 00:00:42.691
You are all invited.

00:00:42.715 --> 00:00:44.462
(Laughter)

00:00:44.486 --> 00:00:45.871
So just to let you know,

00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:49.259
it's not very cool
to live under an autocracy.

00:00:49.283 --> 00:00:53.279
But the interesting thing is that I have
met, throughout the course of my activism,

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:55.246
so many people from different countries,

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.048
and when I tell them about Togo,
their reaction is always,

00:00:58.072 --> 00:01:02.095
"How can you guys allow the same people
to terrorize you for 51 years?
