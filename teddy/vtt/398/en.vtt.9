That is why I said it is very important
to cover the stories of activists

00:04:31.093 --> 00:04:33.528
in the way that it helps mobilize people,

00:04:33.552 --> 00:04:36.726
not in the way that it helps
deter their action

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.637
and force even more their subjugation
to the oppressive system.

00:04:42.808 --> 00:04:44.979
During these years
that I've been an activist,

00:04:45.003 --> 00:04:48.250
there are days that I felt like quitting
because I couldn't take it.

00:04:48.274 --> 00:04:49.894
Well then, what kept me going?

00:04:49.918 --> 00:04:51.952
The one thing that kept me going:

00:04:51.976 --> 00:04:53.848
I remember the story of my grandfather,

00:04:53.872 --> 00:04:59.439
and how he used to walk
465 miles from his village to the city,

00:04:59.463 --> 00:05:01.481
just to protest for independence.
