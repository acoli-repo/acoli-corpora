00:08:57.989 --> 00:09:01.313
Point one: all animals are created equal.
So you don't have that.

00:09:01.337 --> 00:09:04.446
So whenever animals are abused,
we say animal cruelty.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.891
But when it comes to humans,
we say human rights abuses,

00:09:07.915 --> 00:09:10.381
because we assume
that all humans have rights.

00:09:10.405 --> 00:09:14.022
But some of us are actually still fighting
for our right to have rights.

00:09:14.046 --> 00:09:18.320
So in that condition, I don't talk about
human rights abuse or violation.

00:09:18.344 --> 00:09:21.568
When you live in a country
and you have an issue with the president

00:09:21.592 --> 00:09:25.006
and the worst thing that can happen
is he bans you from the presidency,

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:26.181
you are lucky.

00:09:26.205 --> 00:09:29.276
When you come to my country
and have an issue with the president,

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.838
you just run, disappear;
you vanish from the universe,
