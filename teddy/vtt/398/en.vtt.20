00:09:57.038 --> 00:10:00.313
to the point where they lost
their hearing or their sight --

00:10:00.337 --> 00:10:01.885
those stories still haunt me.

00:10:01.909 --> 00:10:03.913
And sometimes, as an activist,

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:07.005
I am less concerned about dying
than how it will happen.

00:10:07.029 --> 00:10:09.687
Sometimes I just sit down
and I imagine all scenarios.

00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:12.709
What are they going to do?
Are they going to cut my ears first?

00:10:12.733 --> 00:10:16.115
Or are they going to cut my tongue
because I'm always insulting them?

00:10:16.139 --> 00:10:18.170
It sounds cruel, but it is the reality.

00:10:18.194 --> 00:10:20.618
We live in a very cruel world.

00:10:20.642 --> 00:10:23.349
Dictators are cruel monsters,

00:10:23.373 --> 00:10:25.971
and I am not saying it to be nice.

00:10:27.081 --> 00:10:30.477
So yes, that is the final characteristic.
