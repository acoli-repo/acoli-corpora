00:08:28.953 --> 00:08:31.833
and they use the military
to suppress dissident voices,

00:08:31.857 --> 00:08:33.891
even though they try
to give the impression

00:08:33.915 --> 00:08:35.946
that the military
is to protect the nation.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.374
And they suppress institutions
and destroy them

00:08:38.398 --> 00:08:41.068
so that they don't have to be
held accountable.

00:08:41.092 --> 00:08:43.867
So do you have a heavily
militarized country?

00:08:43.891 --> 00:08:47.424
And this leads to point four,
what I call human cruelty.

00:08:47.448 --> 00:08:49.479
You know when we talk about animals,

00:08:49.503 --> 00:08:52.144
we say animal cruelty
when animals are abused,

00:08:52.168 --> 00:08:55.150
because there's no charter
acknowledged by the UN

00:08:55.174 --> 00:08:57.504
saying animal rights charter.

00:08:57.989 --> 00:09:01.313
Point one: all animals are created equal.
So you don't have that.
