00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
which in some ways

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
was a more discreditable thing still.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
The third reason, I won't go into.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
But anyway, I gave that testimony,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and that presented me with a crisis.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
What was I going to do?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
This testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
of my ministers, who had, in my view

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
had perpetrated a war on a falsehood.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And so I was in crisis.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And this wasn't a pretty thing.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
I moaned about it, I hesitated,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I went on and on and on to my long-suffering wife,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service.
