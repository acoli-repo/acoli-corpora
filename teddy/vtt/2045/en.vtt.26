00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And one thing led to another,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and I ended up having a desk

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
in ?What If! in New York,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
when I started Independent Diplomat.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And watching ?What If!

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
develop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
or new flavors for Coke

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
actually helped me innovate

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
new strategies for the Kosovars

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
and for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy --

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
that diplomacy, like business,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
is a business of solving problems,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy;

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
it's all zero sum games and realpolitik
