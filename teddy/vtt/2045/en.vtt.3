00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
As a child,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I read the newspaper thoroughly.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I was fascinated by the Cold War,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
by the INF negotiations

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
over intermediate-range nuclear missiles,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
in Angola or Afghanistan.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
These things really interested me.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And so I decided quite at an early age

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I wanted to be a diplomat.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And I, one day, I announced this to my parents --

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and my father denies this story to this day --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I said, "Daddy, I want to be a diplomat."
