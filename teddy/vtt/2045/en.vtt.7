00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And that was exciting -- that was fun.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It was really interesting.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000

And the pinnacle of my career, as it turned out,

to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
which was my specialty.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And there, I dealt with things

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
