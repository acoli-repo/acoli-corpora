00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
My story is a little bit about war.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's about disillusionment.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's about death.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And it's about rediscovering

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
idealism

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in all of that wreckage.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And perhaps also, there's a lesson

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
about how to deal with

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
our screwed-up, fragmenting

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and dangerous world of the 21st century.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I don't believe in straightforward narratives.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I don't believe in a life or history

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
written as decision "A" led to consequence "B"
