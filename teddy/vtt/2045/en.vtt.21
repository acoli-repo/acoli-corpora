00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and life is not simple, one reason narratives.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
It was a complicated thing,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
But that was one of the reasons.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And that kind of gave me the inspiration --

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
or rather to be precise,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
it gave my wife the inspiration.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
She said, "Why don't you advise the Kosovars?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy?"

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
They were not allowed diplomats.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
They were not allowed a foreign office

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
to help them deal with this immensely complicated process,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And so that was the idea.
