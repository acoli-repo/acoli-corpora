00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
A second thing happened in Kosovo,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
which kind of delivered the answer,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
which I couldn't really answer,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
which is, "What do I do with my life?"

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I love diplomacy --

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I have no career --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I expected my entire life to be a diplomat, to be serving my country.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I wanted to be an ambassador,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and my mentors, my heroes,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
people who got to the top of my profession,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and here I was throwing it all away.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
A lot of my friends were still in it.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
My pension was in it.
