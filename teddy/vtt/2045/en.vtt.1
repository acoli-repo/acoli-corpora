00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I don't believe in a life or history

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
written as decision "A" led to consequence "B"

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
led to consequence "C" --

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
these neat narratives that we're presented with,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and that perhaps we encourage in each other.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I believe in randomness,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and one of the reasons I believe that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
is because me becoming a diplomat was random.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm colorblind.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I was born unable to see most colors.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This is why I wear gray and black most of the time,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and I have to take my wife with me

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to chose clothes.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And I'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy.
