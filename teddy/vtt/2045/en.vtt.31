00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
it's no longer good enough

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
to say that international relations, or global affairs,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
or chaos in Somalia,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
or what's going on in Burma is none of your business,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and that you can leave it to governments to get on with.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I can connect any one of you

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
by six degrees of separation

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
to the Al-Shabaab militia in Somalia.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Ask me how later, particularly if you eat fish, interestingly enough,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
but that connection is there.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
We are all intimately connected.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And this isn't just Tom Friedman,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
it's actually provable in case after case after case.
