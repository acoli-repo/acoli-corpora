00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And this isn't just Tom Friedman,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
it's actually provable in case after case after case.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
What that means is, instead of asking your politicians to do things,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
you have to look to yourself to do things.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
in a sort of loose way.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
There aren't neat examples, but one example is this:

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
the way the world is changing

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
is embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work --

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
the U.N. Security Council.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
The U.N. was established in 1945.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Its charter is basically designed

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
to stop conflicts between states --

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
interstate conflict.
