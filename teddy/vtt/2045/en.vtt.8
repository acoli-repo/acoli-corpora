00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And there, I dealt with things

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
like the Middle East peace process,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
the Lockerbie issue --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
we can talk about that later, if you wish --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
but above all, my responsibility was Iraq

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and its weapons of mass destruction

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and the sanctions we placed on Iraq

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I was the chief British negotiator

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
on the subject,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and I was steeped in the issue.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And anyway,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy.
