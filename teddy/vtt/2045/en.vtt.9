00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
We went through several wars

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
during my time in New York.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I negotiated for my country

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
the resolution in the Security Council

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
of the 12th of September 2001

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
condemning the attacks of the day before,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
which were, of course, deeply present to us

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
actually living in New York at the time.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So it was kind of the best of time, worst of times

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
kind of experience.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
I lived the high-life.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Although I worked very long hours,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I lived in a penthouse in Union Square.
