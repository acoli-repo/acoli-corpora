00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Although I worked very long hours,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I lived in a penthouse in Union Square.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I was a single British diplomat in New York City;

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
you can imagine what that might have meant.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
(Laughter)

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
to the job that was waiting for me in London.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I decided to take a sabbatical,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
in fact, at the New School, Bruce.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I realized that there was something wrong
