00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
a very limited subject.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And I testified to that inquiry in secret.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and its WMD,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and my testimony to the inquiry said three things:

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
that the government exaggerated the intelligence,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
which was very clear in all the years I'd read it.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And indeed, our own internal assessment was very clear

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
that Iraq's WMD

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
did not pose a threat to its neighbors, let alone to us.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Secondly, the government had ignored all available alternatives to war,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
which in some ways
