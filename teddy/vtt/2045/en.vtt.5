00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Being a diplomat, then and now,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
is an incredible job, and I loved every minute of it --

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I enjoyed the status of it.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and reveled in

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
this amazing access I had to world events.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I traveled to the Gaza Strip.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I headed the Middle East Peace Process section

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
in the British Foreign Ministry.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I became a speechwriter

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
for the British Foreign Secretary.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I met Yasser Arafat.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I negotiated

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
with Saddam's diplomats at the U.N.
