00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I felt -- there's a scene in the Al Pacino movie "The Insider," which you may know,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
where he goes back to CBS

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
after they've let him down over the tobacco guy,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and he goes, "You know, I just can't do this anymore. Something's broken."

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And it was like that for me. I love that movie.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I felt just something's broken.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I can't actually sit with my foreign minister

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
or my prime minister again with a smile on my face

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and do what I used to do gladly for them.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So took a running leap

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and jumped over the edge of a cliff.
