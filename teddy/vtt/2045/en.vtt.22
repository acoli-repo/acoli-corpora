00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And so that was the idea.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
the world's first diplomatic advisory group

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and a non-profit to boot.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And it began when I flew back from London

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
after my time at the U.N. in Kosovo.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
"Look, I'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
I know this stuff. It's what I do. Why don't I come and help you?"

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And he raised his glass of raki to me and said,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
"Yes, Carne. Come."

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And I came to Kosovo

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and advised the Kosovo government.
