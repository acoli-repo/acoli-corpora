00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
which was then under U.N. administration.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And two things happened in Kosovo,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
which kind of, again,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
shows the randomness of life,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
because these things turned out to be

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
two of the pivots of my life

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and helped to deliver me to the next stage.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
But they were random things.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
One was that, in the summer of 2004,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
the British government, somewhat reluctantly,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
decided to have an official inquiry

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
into the use of intelligence on WMD

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
in the run up to the Iraq War,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
a very limited subject.
