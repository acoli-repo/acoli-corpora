00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
My pension was in it.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And I gave it up.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And what was I going to do?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And that year, in Kosovo,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
this terrible, terrible thing happened, which I saw.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
In March 2004, there were terrible riots

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
all over the province -- as it then was -- of Kosovo.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
18 people were killed.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
It was anarchy.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
to know that the police and the military --

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
there were lots of military troops there --

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
actually can't stop that rampaging mob

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
who's coming down the street.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop
