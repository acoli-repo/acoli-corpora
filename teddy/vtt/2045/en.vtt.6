00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
with Saddam's diplomats at the U.N.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Later, I traveled to Kabul

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And I would travel

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
in a C-130 transport

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and go and visit warlords

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
in mountain hideaways

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and negotiate with them

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
surrounded by my Special Forces escort,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
who, themselves, had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
because it was so dangerous.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And that was exciting -- that was fun.
