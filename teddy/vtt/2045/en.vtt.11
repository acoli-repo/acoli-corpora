00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
In some inchoate, inarticulate way

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I realized that there was something wrong

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
with my work, with me.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I was exhausted,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and I was also disillusioned

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And I decided to take some time out from work.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The Foreign Office was very generous.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
You could take these special unpaid leave, as they called them,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and yet remain part of the diplomatic service, but not actually do any work.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
It was nice.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And eventually, I decided

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
which was then under U.N. administration.
