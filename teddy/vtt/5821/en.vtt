00:00:00.997 --> 00:00:04.063
Three planes, 25 hours, 10,000 miles.

00:00:04.097 --> 00:00:07.797
My dad gets off a flight from Australia
with one thing in mind

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.330
and it's not a snack or a shower or a nap.

00:00:11.363 --> 00:00:12.763
It's November 2016

00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:16.930
and Dad is here to talk to Americans
about the election.

00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:19.797
Now, Dad's a news fiend, but for him,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.630
this is not just red or blue,
swing states or party platforms.

00:00:24.663 --> 00:00:27.063
He has some really specific intentions.

00:00:27.063 --> 00:00:31.263
He wants to listen,
be heard and understand.
