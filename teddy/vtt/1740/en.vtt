00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I started juggling a long time ago,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but long before that, I was a golfer, and that's what I was, a golfer.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And as a golfer and as a kid,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that I sort of lived my whole life, is process.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And it's the process of learning things.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
One of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer, but he was lefty.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And he had a real passion for golf,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and he also created this whole mythology

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
about Ben Hogan and various things.
