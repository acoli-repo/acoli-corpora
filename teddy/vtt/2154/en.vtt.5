00:02:29.403 --> 00:02:31.279
drop wine on the tablecloth,

00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:34.040
and the wine wicks all over everything.

00:02:34.064 --> 00:02:36.103
Put it on your shirt, it ruins the shirt.

00:02:36.127 --> 00:02:38.866
That's what a hydrophilic surface does.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.513
So in this device, the idea
is that you drip the bottom end of it

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:45.176
in a drop of, in this case, urine.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.948
The fluid wicks its way
into those chambers at the top.

00:02:48.972 --> 00:02:53.176
The brown color indicates
the amount of glucose in the urine,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.747
the blue color indicates the amount
of protein in the urine.

00:02:56.771 --> 00:02:59.807
And the combination of those two
is a first-order shot

00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:02.953
at a number of useful things
that you want.
