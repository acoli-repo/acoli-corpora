00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:00.016
You don't want to do that.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.529
So how do you dispose of that?

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:04.235
It's a problem everywhere,
and here, you simply burn it.

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.759
So it's a sort of a practical approach
to starting on things.

00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:13.073
Now, you say, "If paper is a good idea,

00:04:13.097 --> 00:04:15.060
other people have surely thought of it."

00:04:15.084 --> 00:04:16.966
And the answer is, of course, yes.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.810
Those half of you, roughly, who are women,

00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:23.296
at some point may have had
a pregnancy test.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.304
And the most common of these
is in a device

00:04:27.328 --> 00:04:29.176
that looks like the thing on the left.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.692
It's something called
a lateral-flow immunoassay.
