00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:33.011

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:36.791
And he was telling the truth,

00:07:36.815 --> 00:07:39.389

00:07:39.413 --> 00:07:42.556
"today," "this month,"
"since the rainy season" --

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.064

for misunderstanding.

00:07:45.088 --> 00:07:46.095

00:07:49.707 --> 00:07:53.818
how to deal with matters
that seem uninteresting, like compliance.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.705

at what a typical test looks like.

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:03.176
Prick a finger, you get some blood --
about 50 microliters.
