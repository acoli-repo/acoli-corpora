00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.676
The problem I want to talk with you
about is really the problem of:

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.506
How does one supply health care
in a world in which cost is everything?

00:00:13.014 --> 00:00:14.251
How do you do that?

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.534
And the basic paradigm
we want to suggest to you,

00:00:17.558 --> 00:00:18.783
I want to suggest to you,

00:00:18.807 --> 00:00:22.479
is one in which you say
that in order to treat disease,

00:00:22.503 --> 00:00:25.875
you have to first know
what you're treating, that's diagnostics,

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:27.546
and then you have to do something.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.886
The program we're involved in is something
we call "Diagnostics for All,"
