00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:02.953
at a number of useful things
that you want.

00:03:02.977 --> 00:03:06.334
So, this is an example of a device
made from a simple piece of paper.

00:03:06.358 --> 00:03:08.618
Now, how simple can you make
the production?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.965
Why do we choose paper?

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.369
There's an example
of the same thing on a finger,

00:03:14.393 --> 00:03:16.649
showing you basically what it looks like.

00:03:16.673 --> 00:03:19.101
One reason for using paper
is that it's everywhere.

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:24.298
We have made these kinds of devices
using napkins and toilet paper

00:03:24.322 --> 00:03:26.552
and wraps, and all kinds of stuff.

00:03:26.576 --> 00:03:29.014
So the production capability is there.

00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:33.335
The second is, you can put lots and lots
of tests in a very small place.
