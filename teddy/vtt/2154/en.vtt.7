00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:33.335
The second is, you can put lots and lots
of tests in a very small place.

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.178
I'll show you in a moment
that the stack of paper there

00:03:36.202 --> 00:03:38.934
would probably hold
something like 100,000 tests,

00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.699
something of that kind.

00:03:40.723 --> 00:03:43.568
And then finally, a point
you don't think of so much

00:03:43.592 --> 00:03:46.176
in developed world medicine:

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.879
it eliminates sharps.

00:03:47.903 --> 00:03:51.285
And what sharps means
is needles, things that stick.

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:53.603
If you've taken a sample
of someone's blood

00:03:53.627 --> 00:03:56.124
and the someone might have hepatitis C,

00:03:56.148 --> 00:03:58.695
you don't want to make a mistake
and stick it in you.

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:00.016
You don't want to do that.
