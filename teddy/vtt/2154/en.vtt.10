00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:01.674
So it works very well there,
but it doesn't work very well

00:05:01.698 --> 00:05:03.784
when you need more
quantitative information.

00:05:03.808 --> 00:05:05.028
There are also dipsticks,

00:05:05.052 --> 00:05:06.798
but if you look at the dipsticks,

00:05:06.822 --> 00:05:09.035
they're for another kind
of urine analysis.

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.936
There are an awful lot of colors
and things like that.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.253
What do you actually do about that
in a difficult circumstance?

00:05:16.372 --> 00:05:20.681
So the approach we started with is to ask:

00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:24.176
Is it really practical
to make things of this sort?

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.487
And that problem is now,
in a purely engineering way, solved.

00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:32.060
And the procedure that we have
is simply to start with paper.
