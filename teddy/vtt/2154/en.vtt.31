00:15:28.644 --> 00:15:31.176
The most recent involved
a couple of people at MIT,

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.320
one of them being
an exceptionally bright kid

00:15:33.344 --> 00:15:36.054
who is one of the very
few people I would think of

00:15:36.078 --> 00:15:37.467
who's an authentic genius.

00:15:37.491 --> 00:15:41.541
We all struggled for an entire day
to think about simplicity.

00:15:41.565 --> 00:15:45.747
And I want to give you the answer
of this deep scientific thought.

00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:47.104
[What is simplicity?

00:15:47.128 --> 00:15:48.715
"It's impossible to f..k it up"]

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:49.788
(Laughter)

00:15:49.812 --> 00:15:52.262
So, in a sense, you get what you pay for.

00:15:52.286 --> 00:15:53.795
Thank you very much.

00:15:53.819 --> 00:15:55.904
