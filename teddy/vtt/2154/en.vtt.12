00:05:59.186 --> 00:06:01.962
And there is an example
of the kind of thing that you see.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:03.825
That's on a piece of 8 by 12 paper.

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:06.118
That takes about two seconds to make.

00:06:06.142 --> 00:06:08.784
And so I regard that as done.

00:06:08.808 --> 00:06:10.602
There's a very important issue here,

00:06:10.626 --> 00:06:15.044
which is that because it's a printer,
a color printer, it prints colors.

00:06:15.068 --> 00:06:16.592
That's what color printers do.

00:06:16.616 --> 00:06:19.382
I'll show you in a moment,
that's actually quite useful.

00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:23.176
Now, the next question
that you would like to ask is:

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.391
What would you like to measure?
What would you like to analyze?

00:06:26.415 --> 00:06:31.176
And the thing you'd most like to analyze,
we're a fair distance from.
