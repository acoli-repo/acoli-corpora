WEBVTT

00:10:27.319 --> 00:10:31.053
is that the compute capability
of this thing is not so different

00:10:31.077 --> 00:10:33.916
from the compute capability
of your desktop computer.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.601
This is a fantastic device
which is only beginning to be tapped.

00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:41.071
I don't know whether the idea
of one computer, one child

00:10:41.095 --> 00:10:42.246
makes any sense.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.176
Here's the computer of the future,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.401
because this screen is already there
and they're ubiquitous.

00:10:48.851 --> 00:10:52.088
All right, let me show you just
a little bit about advanced devices.

00:10:52.112 --> 00:10:54.266
And we'll start by posing
a little problem.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.687
What you see here
is another centimeter-sized device,

00:10:57.711 --> 00:11:01.694
and the different colors
are different colors of dye.
