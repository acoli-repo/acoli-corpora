00:06:56.719 --> 00:07:00.214
and simpler ones,
such as guidance of treatment.

00:07:00.238 --> 00:07:03.176
Now, even that's more
complicated than you think.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.415
A friend of mine works
in transcultural psychiatry,

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:09.545
and he is interested in the question

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:12.299
of why people do
and don't take their meds.

00:07:12.323 --> 00:07:15.898
So Dapsone, or something like that,
you have to take for a while.

00:07:15.922 --> 00:07:19.538
He has a wonderful story
of talking to a villager in India

00:07:19.562 --> 00:07:20.713
and saying,

00:07:20.737 --> 00:07:22.543
"Have you taken your Dapsone?" "Yes."

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:24.433
"Have you taken it every day?" "Yes."

00:07:24.457 --> 00:07:26.411
"Have you taken if for a month?" "Yes."

00:07:26.435 --> 00:07:27.936
What the guy actually meant

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.862
was that he'd fed a 30-day dose of Dapsone
to his dog that morning.
