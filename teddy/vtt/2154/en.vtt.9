It's something called
a lateral-flow immunoassay.

00:04:31.716 --> 00:04:33.176
In that particular test,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.815
urine, either containing
a hormone called hCG,

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:40.176
does or does not flow
across a piece of paper.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.101
And there are two bars; one bar
indicates that the test is working,

00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:47.290
and if the second bar shows up,
you're pregnant.

00:04:47.314 --> 00:04:50.485
This is a terrific kind of test
in a binary world,

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:53.424
and the nice thing about pregnancy
is either you are pregnant

00:04:53.448 --> 00:04:54.602
or you're not pregnant;

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:57.607
you're not partially pregnant
or thinking about being pregnant

00:04:57.631 --> 00:04:58.915
or something of that sort.

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:01.674
So it works very well there,
but it doesn't work very well
