a pretty awful telephone system.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.176
It turns out there's an enormous

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.579
already available on that subject,
which is the Mars Rover problem.

00:10:07.603 --> 00:10:11.470
How do you get back an accurate view
of the color on Mars

00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:15.280

to go through here,

00:10:19.765 --> 00:10:22.809

systems for doing this

00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:24.534
are really pretty well understood.

00:10:24.558 --> 00:10:27.295
Also, a fact which you may not know

00:10:27.319 --> 00:10:31.053
is that the compute capability
of this thing is not so different
