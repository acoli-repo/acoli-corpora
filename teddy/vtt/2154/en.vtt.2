and diagnostic system world.

00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:06.713
So, the technology I want to talk
about is for the third world,

00:01:06.737 --> 00:01:08.135
for the developing world,

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.700
but it has, I think,
much broader application,

00:01:10.724 --> 00:01:14.187
because information is so important
in the health care system.

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:16.835
So you see two examples here.

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:22.608
One is a lab that is actually
a fairly high-end laboratory in Africa.

00:01:22.632 --> 00:01:26.936
The second is basically an entrepreneur
who is set up and doing who-knows-what

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.407
at a table in a market.

00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:31.378
I don't know what kind
of health care is delivered there.
