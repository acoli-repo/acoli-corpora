00:09:28.893 --> 00:09:30.714
that indicate how things work.

00:09:30.738 --> 00:09:33.762
So my view of the health care
worker of the future

00:09:33.786 --> 00:09:36.353
is not a doctor, but an 18-year-old,

00:09:36.377 --> 00:09:39.129
otherwise unemployed, who has two things:

00:09:39.153 --> 00:09:41.236
a backpack full
of these tests and a lancet

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.176
to occasionally take a blood sample,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.759
and an AK-47.

00:09:44.783 --> 00:09:47.379
And these are the things
that get him through his day.

00:09:47.403 --> 00:09:48.951
(Laughter)

00:09:50.112 --> 00:09:52.447
There's another very
interesting connection here,

00:09:52.471 --> 00:09:58.011
and that is, that what one wants to do
is pass through useful information

00:09:58.035 --> 00:10:01.566
over what is generally
a pretty awful telephone system.
