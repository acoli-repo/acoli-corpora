00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.091
is to make something more elaborate:

00:11:31.115 --> 00:11:33.192
You take several different
layers of paper,

00:11:33.216 --> 00:11:36.287
each one containing
its own little fluid system,

00:11:36.311 --> 00:11:40.900
and you separate them by pieces of,
literally, double-sided carpet tape,

00:11:40.924 --> 00:11:43.810
the stuff you use to stick
the carpets onto the floor.

00:11:43.834 --> 00:11:47.060
And the fluid will flow
from one layer into the next.

00:11:47.084 --> 00:11:50.176
It distributes itself,
flows through further holes,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.789
distributes itself.

00:11:51.813 --> 00:11:55.054
And what you see,
at the lower right-hand side there,

00:11:55.078 --> 00:12:00.377
is a sample in which a single sample
of blood has been put on the top,
