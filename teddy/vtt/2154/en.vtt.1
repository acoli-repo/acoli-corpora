00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.886
The program we're involved in is something
we call "Diagnostics for All,"

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.021
or "zero-cost diagnostics."

00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:37.459
How do you provide medically
relevant information

00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:40.107
at as close as possible to zero cost?

00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:41.361
How do you do it?

00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:43.176
Let me just give you two examples.

00:00:43.707 --> 00:00:49.573
The rigors of military medicine are not
so dissimilar from the third world:

00:00:49.597 --> 00:00:53.949
poor resources, a rigorous environment --
a series of problems --

00:00:53.973 --> 00:00:55.954
light weight and things of this kind.

00:00:55.978 --> 00:00:59.412
And also they're not so different
from the home health care

00:00:59.436 --> 00:01:01.841
and diagnostic system world.
