They're everywhere --
six billion a month in India.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.722
And the idea is that what one does
is to take the device,

00:09:08.746 --> 00:09:11.176
you dip it, you develop the color,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.425
you take a picture,
the picture goes to a central laboratory.

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:16.176
You don't have to send out a doctor,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.941
you send out somebody
who can just take the sample,

00:09:18.965 --> 00:09:22.690
and in the clinic either a doctor,
or ideally, a computer in this case,

00:09:22.714 --> 00:09:23.878
does the analysis.

00:09:23.902 --> 00:09:25.753
Turns out to work actually quite well,

00:09:25.777 --> 00:09:28.869
particularly when your color printer
has printed the color bars

00:09:28.893 --> 00:09:30.714
that indicate how things work.
