00:11:55.078 --> 00:12:00.377
is a sample in which a single sample
of blood has been put on the top,

00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:02.911
and it has gone through
and distributed itself

00:12:02.935 --> 00:12:06.281
into these 16 holes on the bottom,

00:12:06.305 --> 00:12:09.009
in a piece of paper --
basically, it looks like a chip,

00:12:09.033 --> 00:12:10.771
two pieces of paper thick.

00:12:10.795 --> 00:12:12.278
And in this particular case,

00:12:12.302 --> 00:12:15.066
we were just interested
in the replicability of that.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.394
But that is, in principle,
the way you solve

00:12:17.418 --> 00:12:19.574
the "fever of unexplained origin" problem,

00:12:19.598 --> 00:12:22.354
because each one of those spots
then becomes a test

00:12:22.378 --> 00:12:25.977
for a particular set
of markers of disease,

00:12:26.001 --> 00:12:28.267
and this will work in due course.

00:12:28.291 --> 00:12:31.607
Here is an example of a slightly
more complicated device.
