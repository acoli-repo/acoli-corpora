I don't know what kind
of health care is delivered there.

00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:35.254
But it's not really
what is probably most efficient.

00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:38.974
What is our approach?

00:01:39.442 --> 00:01:44.967
The way in which one typically
approaches a problem of lowering cost,

00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:47.854
starting from the perspective
of the United States,

00:01:47.878 --> 00:01:50.021
is to take our solution,

00:01:50.045 --> 00:01:52.200
and then try to cut cost out of it.

00:01:52.763 --> 00:01:54.176
No matter how you do that,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.706
you're not going to start
with a $100,000 instrument

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.151
and bring it down to no cost.

00:01:58.175 --> 00:01:59.348
It isn't going to work.

00:01:59.372 --> 00:02:02.231
So the approach we took
was the other way around, to ask:
