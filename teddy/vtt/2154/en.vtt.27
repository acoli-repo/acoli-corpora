00:13:27.571 --> 00:13:30.054
and then you take tubing,
and you stick it on that.

00:13:30.078 --> 00:13:32.818
You put the blood in,
somebody sits there and spins it.

00:13:32.842 --> 00:13:34.961
It works really, really well.

00:13:34.985 --> 00:13:37.399
And we sat down,
we did the physics of eggbeaters

00:13:37.423 --> 00:13:40.500
and self-aligning tubes
and all the rest of that kind of thing,

00:13:40.524 --> 00:13:41.986
and sent it off to a journal.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.332
We were very proud of this,

00:13:43.356 --> 00:13:46.218
particularly the title,
which was "Eggbeater as Centrifuge."

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:47.316
(Laughter)

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.491
And we sent it off,

00:13:48.515 --> 00:13:50.422
and by return mail, it came back.

00:13:50.446 --> 00:13:52.176
I called up the editor and I said,

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.322
"What's going on? How is this possible?"

00:13:54.346 --> 00:13:57.480
The editor said, with enormous disdain,

00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:58.947
"I read this.

00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:02.727
And we're not going to publish it,
because we only publish science."
