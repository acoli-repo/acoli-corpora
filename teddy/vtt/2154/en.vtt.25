00:12:28.291 --> 00:12:31.607
Here is an example of a slightly
more complicated device.

00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:32.813
There's the chip.

00:12:32.837 --> 00:12:34.053
You dip in a corner.

00:12:34.077 --> 00:12:35.624
The fluid goes into the center.

00:12:35.648 --> 00:12:39.431
It distributes itself out
into these various wells or holes

00:12:39.455 --> 00:12:40.691
and turns color,

00:12:40.715 --> 00:12:43.408
all done with paper and carpet tape.

00:12:43.432 --> 00:12:45.589
So it's, I think, as low-cost

00:12:45.613 --> 00:12:48.440
as we're likely to be able
to come up and make things.

00:12:49.432 --> 00:12:52.728
Now, I have two last
little stories to tell you

00:12:52.752 --> 00:12:55.362
in finishing off this business.

00:12:55.386 --> 00:12:56.551
This is one:

00:12:56.575 --> 00:12:59.016
One of the things
you occasionally need to do

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.687
is separate blood cells from serum.
