00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:03.176
Prick a finger, you get some blood --
about 50 microliters.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.031
That's about all you're going to get,

00:08:05.055 --> 00:08:09.031
because you can't use
the usual sort of systems.

00:08:09.585 --> 00:08:11.259
You can't manipulate it very well;

00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:13.399
I'll show something
about that in a moment.

00:08:13.423 --> 00:08:16.176
So you take the drop of blood,
no further manipulations,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.983
you put it on a little device,

00:08:18.007 --> 00:08:22.680
the device filters out the blood cells,
lets the serum go through,

00:08:22.704 --> 00:08:26.465
and you get a series of colors
down in the bottom there.

00:08:26.489 --> 00:08:30.648
And the colors indicate
"disease" or "normal."
