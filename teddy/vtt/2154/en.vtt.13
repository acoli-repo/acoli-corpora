00:06:26.415 --> 00:06:31.176
And the thing you'd most like to analyze,
we're a fair distance from.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.176
It's what's called
"fever of undiagnosed origin."

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.761
Someone comes into the clinic,
they have a fever, they feel bad.

00:06:38.785 --> 00:06:39.951
What do they have?

00:06:39.975 --> 00:06:43.377
Do they have TB? Do they have AIDS?
Do they have a common cold?

00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:44.615
The triage problem.

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.295
That's a hard problem for reasons
I won't go through.

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:50.861
There are an awful lot of things
that you'd like to distinguish among.

00:06:50.885 --> 00:06:53.087
But then there are a series of things --

00:06:53.111 --> 00:06:56.695
AIDS, hepatitis, malaria, TB, others --

00:06:56.719 --> 00:07:00.214
and simpler ones,
such as guidance of treatment.
