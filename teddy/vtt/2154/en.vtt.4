00:01:59.372 --> 00:02:02.231
So the approach we took
was the other way around, to ask:

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:04.720
What is the cheapest possible stuff

00:02:04.744 --> 00:02:07.680
that you could make
a diagnostic system out of,

00:02:07.704 --> 00:02:10.251
and get useful information
and add function?

00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:12.272
And what we've chosen is paper.

00:02:12.296 --> 00:02:15.320
What you see here is a prototypic device.

00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:17.176
It's about a centimeter on the side.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.177
It's about the size of a fingernail.

00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:22.804
The lines around the edges are a polymer.

00:02:22.828 --> 00:02:24.670
It's made of paper.

00:02:24.694 --> 00:02:29.379
And paper, of course, wicks fluid,
as you know, paper, cloth --

00:02:29.403 --> 00:02:31.279
drop wine on the tablecloth,
