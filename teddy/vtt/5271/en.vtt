Imagine we want to build a new space port

00:00:09.617 --> 00:00:13.200
at one of four recently settled 
Martian bases,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.650
and are holding a vote 
to determine its location.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.482
Of the hundred colonists on Mars, 
42 live on West Base, 26 on North Base,

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:28.252
15 on South Base, and 17 on East Base.

00:00:28.252 --> 00:00:32.342
For our purposes, letâ€™s assume 
that everyone prefers the space port
