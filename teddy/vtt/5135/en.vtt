00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.050
At any given moment, trillions of cells 
are traveling through your blood vessels,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.604
sometimes circling the body 
in just one minute.

00:00:14.604 --> 00:00:18.535
Each of these cells 
has its origins deep in your bones.

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:22.985
Bones might seem rock-solid, 
but theyâ€™re actually quite porous inside.

00:00:22.985 --> 00:00:26.022
Large and small blood vessels 
enter through these holes.

00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:29.575
And inside most of the large bones 
of your skeleton is a hollow core

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:32.075
filled with soft bone marrow.
