00:01:27.506 --> 00:01:31.466
the blob is sleeping in its 
obtuse triangle form.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:34.126
You can make clean, straight-line cuts

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:37.696
between any two points 
on or inside the triangle.

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:42.356
But you’ll only have time to make 
7 cuts while the satellite is above you.

00:01:42.356 --> 00:01:45.266
By the time it completes 
its orbit and returns,

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:48.216
the blob will have consumed 
the entire world,

00:01:48.216 --> 00:01:52.756
if even a single portion that 
will wake up remains.

00:01:52.756 --> 00:01:56.454
How can you cut the blob entirely 
into acute triangles

00:01:56.454 --> 00:01:59.084
and stop it from destroying the planet?

00:01:59.084 --> 00:02:01.274
