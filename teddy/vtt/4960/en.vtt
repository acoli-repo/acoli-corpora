00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:10.239
A shooting star crashes on Earth,

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:13.139
and a hideous blob emerges.

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.025
It creeps and leaps, it glides and slides.

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:19.185
It’s also unstoppable:

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.645
weapons, fire, extreme temperatures…

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:23.385
no matter what you throw at it,

00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:27.275
it just regrows and continues its rampage.

00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:29.475
Its expansion is breathtaking;

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:32.135
it doubles in size every hour.
