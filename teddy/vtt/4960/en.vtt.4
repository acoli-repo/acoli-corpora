Answer in 1

00:02:07.467 --> 00:02:09.595
While this seems doable at first,

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:14.505
there’s a hidden difficulty when it comes
to avoiding obtuse and right angles.

00:02:14.505 --> 00:02:17.825
Every time you make a cut that 
reaches an edge,

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:22.785
it either makes an acute and 
an obtuse angle, or two right angles.

00:02:22.785 --> 00:02:27.675
That makes it seems like you’re doomed
to keep creating obtuse angles.

00:02:27.675 --> 00:02:30.355
But as with so many of life’s problems,
