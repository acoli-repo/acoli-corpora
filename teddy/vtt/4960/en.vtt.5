But as with so many of life’s problems,

00:02:30.355 --> 00:02:33.485
we can look to pizza for inspiration.

00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:36.835
Imagine squaring off the 
outside of a pizza,

00:02:36.835 --> 00:02:39.975
so that instead of a circle, 
it’s an octagon.

00:02:39.975 --> 00:02:41.805
When we cut it into slices,

00:02:41.805 --> 00:02:44.345
each of the eight triangles is acute.

00:02:44.345 --> 00:02:46.695
This works with larger polygons too.

00:02:46.695 --> 00:02:51.655
Importantly, it also works for some 
polygons with fewer sides,

00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:55.785
including heptagons, hexagons, 
and pentagons.

00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:56.792
That’s good news,

00:02:56.792 --> 00:03:00.742
because if you cut off the sharp corners 
of the blob triangle,
