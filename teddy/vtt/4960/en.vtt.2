00:00:57.101 --> 00:01:00.881
However, when you break the sleeping 
blob into two triangles,

00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:03.011
you make a critical discovery.

00:01:03.011 --> 00:01:05.421
The acute triangle portion,

00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:09.751
with all angles less than 90 degrees, 
is inert.

00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:11.589
It never “wakes up.”

00:01:11.589 --> 00:01:12.959
The obtuse triangle,

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:15.539
which has an angle greater 
than 90 degrees,

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.219
wakes up as usual and keeps growing.

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:22.519
Similar experiments show that all shapes 
other than acute triangles,

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:26.136
including right triangles, 
will also wake up.

00:01:26.136 --> 00:01:27.506
For the next few minutes,

00:01:27.506 --> 00:01:31.466
the blob is sleeping in its 
obtuse triangle form.
