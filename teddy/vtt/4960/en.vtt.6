00:02:56.792 --> 00:03:00.742
because if you cut off the sharp corners 
of the blob triangle,

00:03:00.742 --> 00:03:04.392
a pentagon is exactly what 
you’ll be left with.

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:06.232
And just like a pizza,

00:03:06.232 --> 00:03:10.782
you can cut the blob pentagon 
into five acute triangles.

00:03:10.782 --> 00:03:15.808
That’s 7 cuts, and it renders the 
blob completely inert.

00:03:15.808 --> 00:03:17.308
You’ve saved the day!

00:03:17.318 --> 00:03:19.318
Now you just need to figure out what to do

00:03:19.318 --> 00:03:22.948
with all of these giant, practically 
indestructible triangles.
