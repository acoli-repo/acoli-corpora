00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.051
It was dark when two mysterious, 
shrouded figures

00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:15.636
appeared in the hillside village.

00:00:16.596 --> 00:00:22.185
The strangers knocked on every door 
in town, asking for food and shelter.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.813
But, again and again, 
they were turned away.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.484
Soon, there was just one door left:

00:00:29.484 --> 00:00:32.862
that of a small, thatched shack.
