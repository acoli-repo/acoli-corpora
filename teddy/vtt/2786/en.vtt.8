00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.496
So what exactly is this photocatalysis?

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.736
Let's break it down:

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.416
"photo" means from the sun,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.480
and a catalyst is something
that speeds up a reaction.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.216
So what photocatalysis is doing

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.400
is it's just speeding up
this solar disinfection process.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.736
When sunlight comes in
and strikes a photocatalyst,

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.376
like TiO2, or titanium dioxide,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.816
it creates these
really reactive oxygen species,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.120
like superoxides, hydrogen peroxide
and hydroxyl radicals.
