00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.120
like superoxides, hydrogen peroxide
and hydroxyl radicals.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.816
These reactive oxygen species

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.736
are able to remove bacteria and organics

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.720
and a whole lot of contaminants
from drinking water.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.136
But unfortunately,
there are several disadvantages

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.040
to the way photocatalytic SODIS
is currently deployed.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.776
See, what they do is they take
the clear plastic bottles

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.240
and they coat the inside
with this photocatalytic coating.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.496
But photocatalysts like titanium dioxide

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.216
are actually commonly used in sunscreens
