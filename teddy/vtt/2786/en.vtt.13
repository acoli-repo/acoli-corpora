00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.056
my journey hasn't really been easy.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.456
You know, I didn't have access
to a sophisticated laboratory.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.976
I was 14 years old when I started,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.336
but I didn't let my age deter me

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.216
in my interest
in pursuing scientific research

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.720
and wanting to solve
the global water crisis.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.616
See, water isn't
just the universal solvent.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.440
Water is a universal human right.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.416
And for that reason,

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.616
I'm continuing to work
on this science fair project from 2012
