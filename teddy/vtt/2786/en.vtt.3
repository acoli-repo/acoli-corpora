00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.656
compelled me to want to find a solution

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.640
to our world's clean water problem.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.096
I wanted to know
why these kids lacked water,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.560
a substance that is essential for life.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.256
And I learned that we are facing

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.640
a global water crisis.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.536
Now, this may seem surprising,

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.656
as 75 percent of our planet
is covered in water,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.736
but only 2.5 percent
of that is freshwater,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.696
and less than one percent
of Earth's freshwater supply
