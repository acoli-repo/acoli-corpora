00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.760
and then exposed to sunlight
for six to eight hours.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.536
The UV radiation from the sun

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.016
destroys the DNA
of these harmful pathogens

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.000
and decontaminates the water.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.616
Now, while SODIS is really easy to use
and energy-efficient,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.936
as it only uses solar energy,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.336
it's really slow,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.120
as it can take up to two days
when it's cloudy.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.056
So in order to make
the SODIS process faster,

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.376
this new method called photocatalysis

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.040
has recently been used.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.496
So what exactly is this photocatalysis?
