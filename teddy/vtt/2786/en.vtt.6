(Laughter)

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.016
Actually, at first I converted
my kitchen into a laboratory,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.880
but my parents didn't really approve
and kicked me out.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.856
I also read a lot of journal papers
on water-related research,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.736
and I learned that currently
in developing countries,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.176
something called solar disinfection,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.160
or SODIS, is used to purify water.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.816
In SODIS, clear plastic bottles
are filled with contaminated water

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.760
and then exposed to sunlight
for six to eight hours.
