00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.616
I'm continuing to work
on this science fair project from 2012

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.816
to bring it from the laboratory
into the real world.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.296
And this summer,
I founded Catalyst for World Water,

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.600
a social enterprise aimed at catalyzing
solutions to the global water crisis.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.160
(Applause)

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.216
Alone, a single drop of water
can't do much,

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.656
but when many drops come together,

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.160
they can sustain life on our planet.
