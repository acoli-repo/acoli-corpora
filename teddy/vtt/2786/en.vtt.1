00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.880
where I can just turn on a tap
and easily get clean, potable water,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.000
in India, the water is often contaminated.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.336
So my parents have to make sure

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.320
that the water we drink is safe.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.856
However, I soon realized

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.536
that not everyone is fortunate enough

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.000
to enjoy the clean water we did.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.376
Outside my grandparents' house
in the busy streets of India,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.056
I saw people standing in long lines

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.776
under the hot sun

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.080
filling buckets with water from a tap.
