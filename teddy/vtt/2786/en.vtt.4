and less than one percent
of Earth's freshwater supply

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.680
is available for human consumption.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.456
With rising populations,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.455
industrial development
and economic growth,

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.256
our demand for clean water is increasing,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.480
yet our freshwater resources
are rapidly depleting.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.456
According to the
World Health Organization,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.376

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.000
lack access to a clean water source.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.256
Lack of access to clean water
is a leading cause of death

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.296
in children under the age of five
