Hello.

00:00:02.457 --> 00:00:03.541
So as you know,

00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:05.668
my comfort zone isn’t here.

00:00:05.877 --> 00:00:07.211
It’s usually on set,

00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:08.880
behind a camera,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.922
like him,

00:00:09.922 --> 00:00:10.923
or him.

00:00:11.215 --> 00:00:12.717
But I’m very happy to be here.

00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:16.471
So yes, I was born in Beirut, Lebanon.

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.057
It’s what I call my home country.

00:00:19.557 --> 00:00:22.268
It’s the place
where my first memories are,

00:00:22.268 --> 00:00:24.395
where my parents live,

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:26.230
where my first loves are,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.607
my first heartbreaks.

00:00:28.024 --> 00:00:29.734
I’ve lived in other places

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:31.652
and I’ve made them home,
