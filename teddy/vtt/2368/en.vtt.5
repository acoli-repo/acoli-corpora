00:02:27.298 --> 00:02:30.736
your father to come home
and it's all going to be happy

00:02:30.736 --> 00:02:32.490
and you're waiting for that sound of the door opening.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.746
Well the sound that we looked forward to

00:02:33.746 --> 00:02:35.639
was the click of the door closing,

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:40.347
which meant he'd gone and would not come back.

00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:43.806
So for three decades,

00:02:43.806 --> 00:02:46.847
I never laid eyes on my father, nor he on me.

00:02:46.847 --> 00:02:48.615
We never spoke to each other for three decades,

00:02:48.615 --> 00:02:50.416
and then a couple of years ago, I decided

00:02:50.416 --> 00:02:54.687
to turn the spotlight on him.

00:02:54.687 --> 00:02:56.575
"You are being watched.

00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:58.431
Actually, you are.

00:02:58.431 --> 00:03:00.495
You are being watched."
