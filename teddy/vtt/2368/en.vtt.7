00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.493
so confound their expectations of you.

00:03:33.493 --> 00:03:37.771
To that end, Bageye and his friends,

00:03:37.771 --> 00:03:39.426
mostly Jamaican,

00:03:39.426 --> 00:03:43.180
exhibited a kind of Jamaican bella figura:

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.794
Turn your best side to the world,

00:03:45.794 --> 00:03:48.068
show your best face to the world.

00:03:48.068 --> 00:03:49.842
If you have seen some of the images

00:03:49.842 --> 00:03:51.978
of the Caribbean people arriving

00:03:51.978 --> 00:03:53.630
in the '40s and '50s,

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.026
you might have noticed that a lot of the men

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:56.915
wear trilbies.

00:03:56.915 --> 00:04:00.556
Now, there was no tradition
of wearing trilbies in Jamaica.
