00:01:59.663 --> 00:02:01.790
ready to drop death charges

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.777
at the first sound of any disturbance.

00:02:05.777 --> 00:02:08.712
So that lesson was the lesson that

00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:10.160
"Do not draw attention to yourself

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.424
either in the home or outside of the home."

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:15.110
Maybe it's a migrant lesson.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.280
We were to be below the radar,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.775
so there was no communication, really,

00:02:19.775 --> 00:02:22.936
between Bageye and us and us and Bageye,

00:02:22.936 --> 00:02:25.544
and the sound that we most looked forward to,

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:27.298
you know when you're a child and you want

00:02:27.298 --> 00:02:30.736
your father to come home
and it's all going to be happy
