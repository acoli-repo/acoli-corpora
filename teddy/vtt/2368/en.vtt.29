my father would say, "If it's so, then it's so."

Jamaicans will tell you that
there's no such thing as facts,

00:14:36.855 --> 00:14:38.880
there are only versions.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.361
We all tell ourselves the versions of the story

00:14:41.361 --> 00:14:44.216
that we can best live with.

00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:46.743
Each generation builds up an edifice

00:14:46.743 --> 00:14:48.810
which they are reluctant or sometimes unable

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.118
to disassemble,

00:14:51.118 --> 00:14:54.764
but in the writing, my version of the story

00:14:54.764 --> 00:14:56.832
began to change,

00:14:56.832 --> 00:15:00.826
and it was detached from me.
