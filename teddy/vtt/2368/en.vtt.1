00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.200
from fly-killer paper into his coffee,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.055
grounded down glass and sprinkling it

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:38.044
over his breakfast,

00:00:38.044 --> 00:00:39.754
loosening the carpet on the stairs

00:00:39.754 --> 00:00:43.482
so he would trip and break his neck.

00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:45.109
But come the day, he would always

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.361
skip that loose step,

00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:49.190
he would always bow out of the house

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.030
without so much as a swig of coffee

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.818
or a bite to eat.

00:00:53.818 --> 00:00:55.104
And so for many years,

00:00:55.104 --> 00:00:57.064
I feared that my father would die

00:00:57.064 --> 00:00:59.138
before I had a chance to kill him.

00:00:59.138 --> 00:01:03.730
