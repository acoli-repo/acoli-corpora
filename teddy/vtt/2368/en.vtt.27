00:13:28.654 --> 00:13:31.542
may be perceived by my father

00:13:31.542 --> 00:13:35.718
as an act of filial devotion.

00:13:35.718 --> 00:13:39.453
Poor, deluded fool.

00:13:39.453 --> 00:13:43.494
Bageye was stung by what he perceived to be

00:13:43.494 --> 00:13:46.353
the public airing of his shortcomings.

00:13:46.353 --> 00:13:49.254
He was stung by my betrayal,

00:13:49.254 --> 00:13:51.326
and he went to the newspapers the next day

00:13:51.326 --> 00:13:52.510
and demanded a right of reply,

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.742
and he got it with the headline

00:13:54.742 --> 00:13:57.902
"Bageye Bites Back."

00:13:57.902 --> 00:14:00.870
And it was a coruscating account of my betrayal.
