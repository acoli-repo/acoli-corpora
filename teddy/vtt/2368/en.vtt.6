00:02:58.431 --> 00:03:00.495
You are being watched."

00:03:00.495 --> 00:03:03.159
That was his mantra to us, his children.

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.832
Time and time again he would say this to us.

00:03:04.832 --> 00:03:07.935
And this was the 1970s, it was Luton,

00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:09.564
where he worked at Vauxhall Motors,

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:11.391
and he was a Jamaican.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:12.450
And what he meant was,

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.561
you as a child of a Jamaican immigrant

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.479
are being watched

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:18.136
to see which way you turn, to see whether

00:03:18.136 --> 00:03:22.255
you conform to the host nation's stereotype of you,

00:03:22.255 --> 00:03:24.855
of being feckless, work-shy,

00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:27.416
destined for a life of crime.

00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:29.150
You are being watched,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.493
so confound their expectations of you.
