00:06:26.966 --> 00:06:30.956
(Laughter)

00:06:30.956 --> 00:06:32.870
But they do care, actually.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.433
They cross over.

00:06:34.433 --> 00:06:36.940
Somehow they find their way to you.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.544
They shape their lives according
to the narrative of your life,

00:06:40.544 --> 00:06:44.570
as I did with my father and my mother, perhaps,

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.184
and maybe Bageye did with his father.

00:06:47.184 --> 00:06:48.826
And that was clearer to me

00:06:48.826 --> 00:06:51.784
in the course of looking at his life

00:06:51.784 --> 00:06:54.840
and understanding, as they say,

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.152
the Native Americans say,

00:06:56.152 --> 00:06:57.781
"Do not criticize the man until you can walk

00:06:57.781 --> 00:07:00.093
in his moccasins."
