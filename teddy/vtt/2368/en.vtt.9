(Laughter)

00:04:32.236 --> 00:04:35.610
And my all-time favorite was the
guy they called Summerwear.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.444
When Summerwear came to this country

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.563
from Jamaica in the early '60s, he insisted

00:04:39.563 --> 00:04:41.940
on wearing light summer suits,

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.596
no matter the weather,

00:04:43.596 --> 00:04:44.934
and in the course of researching their lives,

I asked my mom, "Whatever
became of Summerwear?"

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.737
And she said, "He caught a cold and died." (Laughter)

00:04:52.737 --> 00:04:54.593

00:04:58.177 --> 00:05:01.393
because they thought that they were not considered
