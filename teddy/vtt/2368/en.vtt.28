00:13:57.902 --> 00:14:00.870
And it was a coruscating account of my betrayal.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.748
I was no son of his.

00:14:03.748 --> 00:14:05.829
He recognized in his mind that his colors

00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:08.197
had been dragged through the
mud, and he couldn't allow that.

00:14:08.197 --> 00:14:10.782
He had to restore his dignity, and he did so,

00:14:10.782 --> 00:14:13.210
and initially, although I was disappointed,

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.890
I grew to admire that stance.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:18.293
There was still fire bubbling through his veins,

00:14:18.293 --> 00:14:21.910
even though he was 82 years old.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.472
And if it meant that we would now return

00:14:24.472 --> 00:14:27.703
to 30 years of silence,

00:14:27.703 --> 00:14:33.663
my father would say, "If it's so, then it's so."
