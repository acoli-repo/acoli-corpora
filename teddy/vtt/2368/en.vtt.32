00:15:58.766 --> 00:16:01.770
was that you are alone,

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.570
you are unsupported.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.842
But there's another way of looking at this photograph.

00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:09.418
This is a photograph that has the potential

00:16:09.418 --> 00:16:11.922
for a reunion,

00:16:11.922 --> 00:16:14.710
a potential to be reunited with my father,

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:18.774
and in my yearning to be held up by my father,

00:16:18.774 --> 00:16:21.274
I held him up to the light.

00:16:21.274 --> 00:16:24.210
In that first reunion,

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:26.512
it was very awkward and tense moments,

00:16:26.512 --> 00:16:27.854
and to lessen the tension,

00:16:27.854 --> 00:16:31.192
we decided to go for a walk.
