This is a photograph

00:00:02.633 --> 00:00:05.449
of a man whom for many years

00:00:05.449 --> 00:00:09.170
I plotted to kill.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.190
This is my father,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.927
Clinton George "Bageye" Grant.

00:00:15.927 --> 00:00:18.198
He's called Bageye because he has

00:00:18.198 --> 00:00:22.358
permanent bags under his eyes.

00:00:22.358 --> 00:00:25.134

00:00:25.134 --> 00:00:29.250

from fly-killer paper into his coffee,
