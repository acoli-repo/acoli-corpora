WEBVTT

00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.998
at 3:30 in the afternoon, we would huddle

00:01:30.998 --> 00:01:34.248
beside the TV, and rather like safe-crackers,

00:01:34.248 --> 00:01:36.734
we would twiddle with the volume control knob

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:39.527
on the TV so it was almost inaudible.

00:01:39.527 --> 00:01:41.838
And at times, when we were like this,

00:01:41.838 --> 00:01:44.270
so much "Shhh," so much "Shhh"

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.135
going on in the house

00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:48.110
that I imagined us to be like

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.610
the German crew of a U-boat

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.102
creeping along the edge of the ocean

00:01:54.102 --> 00:01:55.918
whilst up above, on the surface,

00:01:55.918 --> 00:01:59.663
HMS Bageye patrolled

00:01:59.663 --> 00:02:01.790
ready to drop death charges
