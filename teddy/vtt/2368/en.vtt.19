00:09:28.128 --> 00:09:30.432
or belittled by the policeman —

00:09:30.432 --> 00:09:32.249
as a 10-year-old boy, I saw that —

00:09:32.249 --> 00:09:34.820
but also there was an ambivalence towards authority.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.465
So on the one hand, there was

00:09:36.465 --> 00:09:38.092
a mocking of authority,

00:09:38.092 --> 00:09:40.408
but on the other hand, there was a deference

00:09:40.408 --> 00:09:42.229
towards authority,

00:09:42.229 --> 00:09:44.184
and these Caribbean people

00:09:44.184 --> 00:09:48.321
had an overbearing obedience towards authority,

00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:50.529
which is very striking, very strange in a way,

00:09:50.529 --> 00:09:53.633
because migrants are very courageous people.

00:09:53.633 --> 00:09:56.393
They leave their homes. My father and my mother

00:09:56.393 --> 00:10:00.320
left Jamaica and they traveled 4,000 miles,
