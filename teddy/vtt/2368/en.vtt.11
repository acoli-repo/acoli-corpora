00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.248
and it was a terrifying thing to come to terms with,

00:05:34.248 --> 00:05:36.512
in a way, that maybe you were going

00:05:36.512 --> 00:05:40.656
to be perceived in the same light.

00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:44.428
So that was what needed to be challenged.

00:05:44.428 --> 00:05:48.709
Our father and many of his colleagues

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:52.170
exhibited a kind of transmission but not receiving.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.392
They were built to transmit but not receive.

00:05:54.392 --> 00:05:57.243
We were to keep quiet.

00:05:57.243 --> 00:05:58.596
When our father did speak to us,

00:05:58.596 --> 00:06:01.461
it was from the pulpit of his mind.
