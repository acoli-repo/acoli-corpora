00:10:59.419 --> 00:11:02.140
and as George Lamming would say,

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.919
it was my mother who fathered me.

00:11:05.919 --> 00:11:08.261
Even in his absence, that old mantra remained:

00:11:08.261 --> 00:11:09.948
You are being watched.

00:11:09.948 --> 00:11:13.150
But such ardent watchfulness can lead to anxiety,

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.399
so much so that years later, when I was investigating

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:16.713
why so many young black men

00:11:16.713 --> 00:11:18.844
were diagnosed with schizophrenia,

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:21.351
six times more than they ought to be,

00:11:21.351 --> 00:11:24.623
I was not surprised to hear the psychiatrist say,

00:11:24.623 --> 00:11:29.081
"Black people are schooled in paranoia."

00:11:29.081 --> 00:11:32.952
And I wonder what Bageye would make of that.
