00:03:58.306 --> 00:04:00.552
I think back to my second year teaching.

00:04:00.576 --> 00:04:02.976
I had a student who I'll call "David."

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.194
And I remember feeling like
I'd done a pretty good job

00:04:06.218 --> 00:04:07.506
at teaching that year:

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.069
"Hey, I ain't no first-year teacher.

00:04:10.093 --> 00:04:11.839
I know what I'm doing."

00:04:14.093 --> 00:04:15.934
And it was on the last day of school,

00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.478
I told David to have a great summer.

00:04:19.093 --> 00:04:22.045
And I watched him walk down the hall,

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:23.363
and I thought to myself,

00:04:23.387 --> 00:04:26.061
I don't even know
what his voice sounds like.

00:04:28.085 --> 00:04:31.141
And that's when I realized
I wasn't doing it right.
