It can be something that they love,

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.553
something that they hope for --

00:01:03.577 --> 00:01:06.417

00:01:09.673 --> 00:01:11.741

to make a chain.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.711
And we hang that chain up in our classroom
as a decoration, sure,

00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:21.068
but also as a reminder

So what happens when one
of those links feels weak?

00:01:29.196 --> 00:01:32.085
And what happens when that weakness
