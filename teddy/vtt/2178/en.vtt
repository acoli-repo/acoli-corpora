00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:02.611
Like many teachers,

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:04.635
every year on the first day of school,

00:00:04.659 --> 00:00:07.833
I lead a sort of icebreaker activity
with my students.

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.977
I teach at Lincoln High School
in Lincoln, Nebraska,

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.614
and we are one of the oldest
and most diverse high schools

00:00:15.638 --> 00:00:16.863
in our state.

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:19.367
Also, to our knowledge,

00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:23.580
we're the only high school in the world
whose mascot is the Links.

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:25.855
Like, a chain.

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:27.403
(Laughter)

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.307
And with that being our mascot,

00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:31.649
we have a statue out front of our building
