00:03:00.735 --> 00:03:03.268
And so I wonder
if it's always been this way.

00:03:03.292 --> 00:03:07.291
I think back to my undergraduate training
at the University of Georgia,

00:03:07.315 --> 00:03:09.363
where we were taught
in our methods classes

00:03:09.387 --> 00:03:12.520
that the concept
of good teaching has changed.

00:03:13.247 --> 00:03:15.104
We're not developing learners

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:17.144
who are going to go out into a workforce

00:03:17.168 --> 00:03:20.136
where they'll stand
on a line in a factory.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.720
Rather, we're sending our kids
out into a workforce

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:24.926
where they need to be able to communicate,

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.434
collaborate and problem-solve.

00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:32.156
And that has caused
teacher-student relationships
