00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:31.649
we have a statue out front of our building

00:00:31.673 --> 00:00:34.901
of four links connected like a chain.

00:00:35.665 --> 00:00:37.941
And each link means something.

00:00:38.676 --> 00:00:41.382
Our links stand for tradition,

00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:45.187
excellence, unity and diversity.

00:00:46.724 --> 00:00:48.154
So on the first day of school,

00:00:48.178 --> 00:00:52.895
I teach my new ninth-graders
about the meaning behind those links,

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:55.109
and I give them each a slip of paper.

00:00:55.736 --> 00:00:58.649
On that paper, I ask them
to write something about themselves.

00:00:58.673 --> 00:01:01.156
It can be something that they love,
