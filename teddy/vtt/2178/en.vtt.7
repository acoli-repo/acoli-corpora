00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:32.156
And that has caused
teacher-student relationships

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.617
to morph into something stronger

00:03:34.641 --> 00:03:38.571
than the giver of content
and the receiver of knowledge.

00:03:39.978 --> 00:03:45.676
Lectures and sitting in silent rows
just doesn't cut it anymore.

00:03:46.645 --> 00:03:51.014
We have to be able to build relationships
with and among our students

00:03:51.038 --> 00:03:53.061
to help them feel connected

00:03:53.085 --> 00:03:55.561
in a world that depends on it.

00:03:58.306 --> 00:04:00.552
I think back to my second year teaching.
