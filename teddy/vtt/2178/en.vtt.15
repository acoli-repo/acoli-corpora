00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.696
and one amazing teacher

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:35.193
who loved his kids;

00:07:36.934 --> 00:07:40.791
countless students
experiencing homelessness;

00:07:40.815 --> 00:07:44.749
and kids entering and exiting
the justice system.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.348
When these events happen,

00:07:47.372 --> 00:07:52.116
protocol is to say, "If you need
someone to talk to, then ..."

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.375
And I say that's not enough.

00:07:55.823 --> 00:07:57.402
I am so lucky.

00:07:57.426 --> 00:08:01.164
I work in an amazing school
with great leadership.
