00:04:28.085 --> 00:04:31.141
And that's when I realized
I wasn't doing it right.

00:04:31.165 --> 00:04:34.315
So I changed almost everything
about my teaching.

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:38.867
I built in plenty of opportunities
for my students to talk to me

00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:40.803
and to talk to each other,

00:04:40.827 --> 00:04:44.167
to share their writing
and to verbalize their learning.

00:04:44.748 --> 00:04:49.139
And it was through those conversations
I began not only to know their voice

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.890
but to know their pain.

00:04:53.356 --> 00:04:56.379
I had David in class again that next year,

00:04:56.403 --> 00:04:59.942
and I learned that his father
was undocumented

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.432
and had been deported.
