00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.733
And every year,

00:10:30.757 --> 00:10:35.526
I have seniors come back
to my classroom, room 340,

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.618
and they can still point out
where their link hangs.

00:10:39.887 --> 00:10:42.287
They remember what they wrote on it.

00:10:43.403 --> 00:10:46.863
They feel connected and supported.

00:10:47.452 --> 00:10:48.719
And they have hope.

00:10:49.817 --> 00:10:51.684
Isn't that what we all need?

00:10:52.698 --> 00:10:56.279
Somebody to reach out
and make sure that we're OK.

00:10:57.357 --> 00:10:59.245
To check in with us

00:10:59.269 --> 00:11:03.219
and remind us that we are a link.
