00:07:59.835 --> 00:08:01.573
by exposure to the young blood?"

00:08:02.144 --> 00:08:04.348
And for this purpose, we use young mice

00:08:04.372 --> 00:08:07.825
that are an equivalency
of 20-year-old people,

00:08:07.849 --> 00:08:12.185
and old mice that are roughly
65 years old in human years.

00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.784
What we found is quite remarkable.

00:08:15.808 --> 00:08:19.528
We find there are more neural stem cells
that make new neurons

00:08:19.552 --> 00:08:20.884
in these old brains.

00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:23.933
There's an increased
activity of the synapses,

00:08:23.957 --> 00:08:25.996
the connections between neurons.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.305
There are more genes expressed
that are known to be involved

00:08:29.329 --> 00:08:31.076
in the formation of new memories.
