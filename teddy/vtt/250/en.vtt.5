00:02:29.202 --> 00:02:33.684
and as I look at the young audience
here in the room, we're all still fine.

00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:34.716
(Laughter)

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.547
But it's scary to see
how all these curves go south.

00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:40.160
And as we get older,

00:02:40.184 --> 00:02:44.235
diseases such as Alzheimer's
and others may develop.

00:02:45.004 --> 00:02:48.575
We know that with age,
the connections between neurons --

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.250
the way neurons talk to each other,
the synapses -- they start to deteriorate;

00:02:53.274 --> 00:02:56.580
neurons die, the brain starts to shrink,

00:02:56.604 --> 00:03:00.596
and there's an increased susceptibility
for these neurodegenerative diseases.
