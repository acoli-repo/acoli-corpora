00:04:58.764 --> 00:05:03.806
So there's this unbalance of good
and bad factors, if you will.

00:05:04.988 --> 00:05:07.981
And to illustrate what we can do
potentially with that,

00:05:08.005 --> 00:05:10.657
I want to talk you through
an experiment that we did.

00:05:10.681 --> 00:05:14.330
We had almost 300 blood samples
from healthy human beings

00:05:14.354 --> 00:05:16.871
20 to 89 years of age,

00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:20.790
and we measured over 100
of these communication factors,

00:05:20.814 --> 00:05:24.908
these hormone-like proteins that
transport information between tissues.

00:05:25.266 --> 00:05:26.942
And what we noticed first

00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:29.783
is that between the youngest
and the oldest group,

00:05:29.807 --> 00:05:33.104
about half the factors
changed significantly.
