00:07:28.422 --> 00:07:32.077
but you don't really know
if they do something about aging.

00:07:33.031 --> 00:07:36.079
So what I'm going to show you now
is very remarkable

00:07:36.103 --> 00:07:41.174
and it suggests that these factors
can actually modulate the age of a tissue.

00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:45.143
And that's where we come back
to this model called parabiosis.

00:07:45.167 --> 00:07:47.707
So, parabiosis is done in mice

00:07:47.731 --> 00:07:52.643
by surgically connecting
the two mice together,

00:07:52.667 --> 00:07:55.000
and that leads then
to a shared blood system,

00:07:55.024 --> 00:07:59.811
where we can now ask,
"How does the old brain get influenced

00:07:59.835 --> 00:08:01.573
by exposure to the young blood?"
