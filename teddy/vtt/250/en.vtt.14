00:06:56.987 --> 00:07:01.893
is not even 40,
but has a biological age of 65.

00:07:01.917 --> 00:07:06.315
Is this a person at an increased risk
of developing an age-related disease?

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:09.995
So in our lab, we're trying
to understand these factors better,

00:07:10.019 --> 00:07:12.257
and many other groups
are trying to understand,

00:07:12.281 --> 00:07:14.357
what are the true aging factors,

00:07:14.381 --> 00:07:19.354
and can we learn something about them
to possibly predict age-related diseases?

00:07:20.281 --> 00:07:24.343
So what I've shown you so far
is simply correlational, right?

00:07:24.367 --> 00:07:28.398
You can just say,
"Well, these factors change with age,"

00:07:28.422 --> 00:07:32.077
but you don't really know
if they do something about aging.
