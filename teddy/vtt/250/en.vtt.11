00:05:29.807 --> 00:05:33.104
about half the factors
changed significantly.

00:05:33.128 --> 00:05:36.263
So our body lives in a very
different environment as we get older,

00:05:36.287 --> 00:05:38.038
when it comes to these factors.

00:05:38.062 --> 00:05:41.558
And using statistical
or bioinformatics programs,

00:05:41.582 --> 00:05:46.276
we could try to discover
those factors that best predict age --

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.943
in a way, back-calculate
the relative age of a person.

00:05:50.337 --> 00:05:53.193
And the way this looks
is shown in this graph.

00:05:53.618 --> 00:05:58.987
So, on the one axis you see
the actual age a person lived,

00:05:59.011 --> 00:06:00.316
the chronological age.
