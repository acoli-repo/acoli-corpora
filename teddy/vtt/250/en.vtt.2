that animals -- old mice --
that share a blood supply with young mice

00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:05.625
can get rejuvenated.

00:01:06.148 --> 00:01:10.757
This is similar to what you might see
in humans, in Siamese twins,

00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:12.869
and I know this sounds a bit creepy.

00:01:13.338 --> 00:01:19.285
But what Tom Rando, a stem-cell
researcher, reported in 2007,

00:01:19.309 --> 00:01:22.809
was that old muscle from a mouse
can be rejuvenated

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:27.462
if it's exposed to young blood
through common circulation.

00:01:27.903 --> 00:01:32.546
This was reproduced by Amy Wagers
at Harvard a few years later,
