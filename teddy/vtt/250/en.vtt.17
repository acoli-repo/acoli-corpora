00:08:29.329 --> 00:08:31.076
in the formation of new memories.

00:08:31.659 --> 00:08:34.167
And there's less of this bad inflammation.

00:08:35.427 --> 00:08:41.923
But we observed that there are no cells
entering the brains of these animals.

00:08:41.947 --> 00:08:43.333
So when we connect them,

00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:48.733
there are actually no cells
going into the old brain, in this model.

00:08:49.379 --> 00:08:53.040
Instead, we've reasoned, then,
that it must be the soluble factors,

00:08:53.064 --> 00:08:57.847
so we could collect simply the soluble
fraction of blood which is called plasma,

00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:01.815
and inject either young plasma
or old plasma into these mice,
