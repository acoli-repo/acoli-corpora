00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.894
We test them cognitively,

00:12:30.918 --> 00:12:34.924
and we ask their caregivers
for daily activities of living.

00:12:34.948 --> 00:12:38.867
What we hope is that there are
some signs of improvement

00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:40.255
from this treatment.

00:12:40.758 --> 00:12:43.314
And if that's the case,
that could give us hope

00:12:43.338 --> 00:12:45.758
that what I showed you works in mice

00:12:45.782 --> 00:12:47.560
might also work in humans.

00:12:48.478 --> 00:12:50.836
Now, I don't think we will live forever.

00:12:51.955 --> 00:12:54.292
But maybe we discovered

00:12:54.316 --> 00:12:57.403
that the Fountain of Youth
is actually within us,

00:12:57.427 --> 00:12:59.165
and it has just dried out.

00:12:59.574 --> 00:13:02.402
And if we can turn it
back on a little bit,
