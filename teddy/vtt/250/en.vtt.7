This is what neuropathologists
do, for example.

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:38.000
So, how about we think of the brain
as being part of the larger organism.

00:03:38.024 --> 00:03:40.501
Could we potentially understand more

00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:43.454
about what happens in the brain
at the molecular level

00:03:43.478 --> 00:03:47.064
if we see the brain
as part of the entire body?

00:03:47.088 --> 00:03:51.965
So if the body ages or gets sick,
does that affect the brain?

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.412
And vice versa: as the brain gets older,
does that influence the rest of the body?

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.541
And what connects all the different
tissues in the body
