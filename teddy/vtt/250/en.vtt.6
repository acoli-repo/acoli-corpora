00:02:56.604 --> 00:03:00.596
and there's an increased susceptibility
for these neurodegenerative diseases.

00:03:01.573 --> 00:03:06.482
One big problem we have -- to try
to understand how this really works

00:03:06.506 --> 00:03:09.102
at a very molecular mechanistic level --

00:03:09.126 --> 00:03:13.176
is that we can't study the brains
in detail, in living people.

00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:17.019
We can do cognitive tests,
we can do imaging --

00:03:17.043 --> 00:03:19.739
all kinds of sophisticated testing.

00:03:19.763 --> 00:03:23.381
But we usually have to wait
until the person dies

00:03:23.405 --> 00:03:28.499
to get the brain and look at how it really
changed through age or in a disease.

00:03:28.888 --> 00:03:31.952
This is what neuropathologists
do, for example.
