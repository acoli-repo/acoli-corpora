00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:30.711
So if we look at how the blood
changes in disease or age,

00:04:30.735 --> 00:04:33.098
can we learn something about the brain?

00:04:33.651 --> 00:04:38.487
We know that as we get older,
the blood changes as well,

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:41.470
so these hormone-like factors
change as we get older.

00:04:41.494 --> 00:04:45.693
And by and large,
factors that we know are required

00:04:45.717 --> 00:04:49.138
for the development of tissues,
for the maintenance of tissues --

00:04:49.162 --> 00:04:52.039
they start to decrease as we get older,

00:04:52.063 --> 00:04:56.766
while factors involved in repair,
in injury and in inflammation --

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.740
they increase as we get older.

00:04:58.764 --> 00:05:03.806
So there's this unbalance of good
and bad factors, if you will.
