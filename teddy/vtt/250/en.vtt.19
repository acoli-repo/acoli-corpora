00:09:26.807 --> 00:09:31.340
where we used human plasma,
young human plasma,

00:09:31.364 --> 00:09:33.213
and as a control, saline,

00:09:33.237 --> 00:09:35.113
and injected it into old mice,

00:09:35.137 --> 00:09:39.989
and asked, can we again
rejuvenate these old mice?

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:41.673
Can we make them smarter?

00:09:42.104 --> 00:09:45.393
And to do this, we used a test.
It's called a Barnes maze.

00:09:45.417 --> 00:09:48.572
This is a big table
that has lots of holes in it,

00:09:48.596 --> 00:09:52.079
and there are guide marks around it,

00:09:52.103 --> 00:09:54.709
and there's a bright light,
as on this stage here.

00:09:54.733 --> 00:09:57.866
The mice hate this and they try to escape,

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.146
and find the single hole that you see
pointed at with an arrow,
