00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.146
and find the single hole that you see
pointed at with an arrow,

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.115
where a tube is mounted underneath

00:10:04.139 --> 00:10:07.332
where they can escape
and feel comfortable in a dark hole.

00:10:07.977 --> 00:10:09.779
So we teach them, over several days,

00:10:09.803 --> 00:10:12.706
to find this space
on these cues in the space,

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.524
and you can compare this for humans,

00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:19.778
to finding your car in a parking lot
after a busy day of shopping.

00:10:19.802 --> 00:10:20.803
(Laughter)

00:10:20.827 --> 00:10:24.578
Many of us have probably had
some problems with that.

00:10:24.602 --> 00:10:26.620
So, let's look at an old mouse here.

00:10:26.954 --> 00:10:29.130
This is an old mouse
that has memory problems,

00:10:29.154 --> 00:10:30.843
as you'll notice in a moment.
