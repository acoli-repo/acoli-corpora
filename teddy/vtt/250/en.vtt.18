00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:01.815
and inject either young plasma
or old plasma into these mice,

00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:04.207
and we could reproduce
these rejuvenating effects,

00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:05.945
but what we could also do now

00:09:05.969 --> 00:09:08.419
is we could do memory tests with mice.

00:09:08.443 --> 00:09:12.296
As mice get older, like us humans,
they have memory problems.

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:14.411
It's just harder to detect them,

00:09:14.435 --> 00:09:16.779
but I'll show you in a minute
how we do that.

00:09:16.803 --> 00:09:19.498
But we wanted to take this
one step further,

00:09:19.522 --> 00:09:23.562
one step closer to potentially
being relevant to humans.

00:09:23.586 --> 00:09:26.783
What I'm showing you now
are unpublished studies,

00:09:26.807 --> 00:09:31.340
where we used human plasma,
young human plasma,
