00:01:58.923 --> 00:02:01.105
and a brain that functions better.

00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:03.556
And I repeat:

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.793
an old mouse that gets young blood
through shared circulation

00:02:09.817 --> 00:02:12.801
looks younger and functions
younger in its brain.

00:02:13.998 --> 00:02:15.530
So when we get older --

00:02:15.554 --> 00:02:18.226
we can look at different aspects
of human cognition,

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.003
and you can see on this slide here,

00:02:20.027 --> 00:02:23.410
we can look at reasoning,
verbal ability and so forth.

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:29.178
And up to around age 50 or 60,
these functions are all intact,

00:02:29.202 --> 00:02:33.684
and as I look at the young audience
here in the room, we're all still fine.
