it does not make the mice younger.

00:12:05.071 --> 00:12:08.699
So, is this magic transferable to humans?

00:12:08.723 --> 00:12:12.352
We're running a small
clinical study at Stanford,

00:12:12.376 --> 00:12:16.252
where we treat Alzheimer's patients
with mild disease

00:12:16.276 --> 00:12:22.886
with a pint of plasma
from young volunteers, 20-year-olds,

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.505

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.894
We test them cognitively,
