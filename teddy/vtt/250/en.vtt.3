00:01:27.903 --> 00:01:32.546
This was reproduced by Amy Wagers
at Harvard a few years later,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.165
and others then showed that similar
rejuvenating effects could be observed

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.975
in the pancreas, the liver and the heart.

00:01:40.974 --> 00:01:45.071
But what I'm most excited about,
and several other labs as well,

00:01:45.095 --> 00:01:47.514
is that this may even apply to the brain.

00:01:48.715 --> 00:01:54.046
So, what we found is that an old mouse
exposed to a young environment

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.083
in this model called parabiosis,

00:01:57.107 --> 00:01:58.899
shows a younger brain --

00:01:58.923 --> 00:02:01.105
and a brain that functions better.
