00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.209
we find the old mouse, and its brain
in particular, are malleable.

00:11:30.233 --> 00:11:33.684
They're not set in stone;
we can actually change them.

00:11:33.708 --> 00:11:35.181
It can be rejuvenated.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.277
Young blood factors can reverse aging,

00:11:38.301 --> 00:11:40.013
and what I didn't show you --

00:11:40.037 --> 00:11:45.259
in this model, the young mouse actually
suffers from exposure to the old.

00:11:45.283 --> 00:11:48.663
So there are old-blood factors
that can accelerate aging.

00:11:49.725 --> 00:11:54.042
And most importantly,
humans may have similar factors,

00:11:54.066 --> 00:11:58.144
because we can take young human
blood and have a similar effect.

00:11:58.592 --> 00:12:02.148
Old human blood, I didn't show you,
does not have this effect;
