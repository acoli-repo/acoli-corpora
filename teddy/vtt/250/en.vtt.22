00:10:59.988 --> 00:11:02.895
and then walks straight
to that hole and escapes.

00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:05.783
So, it could remember where that hole was.

00:11:06.742 --> 00:11:10.430
So by all means, this old mouse
seems to be rejuvenated --

00:11:10.454 --> 00:11:12.833
it functions more like a younger mouse.

00:11:12.857 --> 00:11:15.563
And it also suggests
that there is something

00:11:15.587 --> 00:11:20.578
not only in young mouse plasma,
but in young human plasma

00:11:20.602 --> 00:11:24.262
that has the capacity
to help this old brain.

00:11:24.834 --> 00:11:25.986
So to summarize,

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.209
we find the old mouse, and its brain
in particular, are malleable.
