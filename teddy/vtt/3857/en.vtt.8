In short, can we carve out a future

00:04:07.605 --> 00:04:11.044
which is peaceful and mutually prosperous,

00:04:11.044 --> 00:04:12.948
or are we looking at a great challenge

00:04:12.948 --> 00:04:15.316
of war or peace?

00:04:15.316 --> 00:04:17.940
And I have 15 minutes

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.493

00:04:26.486 --> 00:04:30.664
People ask me, why is it that a kid
