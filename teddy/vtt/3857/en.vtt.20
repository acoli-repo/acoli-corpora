00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.719
of economic integration and globalization

00:10:02.719 --> 00:10:05.290
was in 1914,

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:09.423
just before that happened, World War I,

00:10:09.423 --> 00:10:12.511
a sobering reflection from history.

00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:15.065
So if we are engaged
in this great question

00:10:15.065 --> 00:10:18.270
of how China thinks, feels,

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.147
and positions itself
towards the United States,

00:10:22.147 --> 00:10:23.633
and the reverse,

00:10:23.633 --> 00:10:25.514
how do we get to the baseline

00:10:25.514 --> 00:10:28.904
of how these two countries
and civilizations

00:10:28.904 --> 00:10:31.830
can possibly work together?
