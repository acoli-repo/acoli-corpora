People ask me, why is it that a kid
growing up in rural Australia

00:04:30.664 --> 00:04:32.452
got interested in learning Chinese?

00:04:32.452 --> 00:04:34.310
Well, there are two reasons for that.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.936
Here's the first of them.

00:04:35.936 --> 00:04:37.955
That's Betsy the cow.

00:04:37.955 --> 00:04:41.880
Now, Betsy the cow was one
of a herd of dairy cattle

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.050
that I grew up with on a farm
in rural Australia.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.543
See those hands there?
These are not built for farming.

00:04:48.543 --> 00:04:52.281
So very early on, I discovered
that in fact, working in a farm

00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:55.927
was not designed for me,
and China was a very safe remove

00:04:55.927 --> 00:04:58.318
from any career in Australian farm life.

00:04:58.318 --> 00:05:00.013
Here's the second reason.
