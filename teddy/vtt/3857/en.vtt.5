WEBVTT

00:02:27.694 --> 00:02:30.021
a non-liberal democratic country.

00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:32.314
And if you don't think
that's going to affect

00:02:32.314 --> 00:02:35.077
the way in which the world
happens in the future,

00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:38.305
then personally, I think
you've been smoking something,

00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:42.925
and it doesn't mean you're from Colorado.

00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:45.711
So in short, the question
we have tonight is,

00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:48.707
how do we understand this mega-change,

00:02:48.707 --> 00:02:53.490
which I believe to be the biggest change
for the first half of the 21st century?

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.415
It'll affect so many things.

00:02:56.415 --> 00:02:58.157
It will go to the absolute core.

00:02:58.157 --> 00:03:00.804
It's happening quietly.
It's happening persistently.
