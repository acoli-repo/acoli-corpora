So if China does become
the world's largest economy,

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.495
think about this:

00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:09.513
It'll be the first time

00:02:09.513 --> 00:02:14.180
since this guy was on
the throne of England --

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.663
George III, not a good friend
of Napoleon's --

00:02:17.663 --> 00:02:23.102
that in the world we will have
as the largest economy

00:02:23.102 --> 00:02:25.488
a non-English speaking country,

00:02:25.488 --> 00:02:27.694
a non-Western country,

00:02:27.694 --> 00:02:30.021
a non-liberal democratic country.
