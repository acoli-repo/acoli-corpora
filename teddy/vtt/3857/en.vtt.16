00:07:59.428 --> 00:08:03.050
That was the last time
I was asked to interpret.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.558
But in that little story,
there's a wisdom, which is,

00:08:05.558 --> 00:08:09.412
as soon as you think you know something
about this extraordinary civilization

00:08:09.412 --> 00:08:11.618
of 5,000 years of continuing history,

00:08:11.618 --> 00:08:14.090
there's always something new to learn.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.678
History is against us

00:08:17.678 --> 00:08:19.907
when it comes to the U.S. and China

00:08:19.907 --> 00:08:22.206
forging a common future together.

00:08:22.206 --> 00:08:23.644
This guy up here?

00:08:23.644 --> 00:08:25.573
He's not Chinese and he's not American.

00:08:25.573 --> 00:08:27.802
He's Greek. His name's Thucydides.

00:08:27.802 --> 00:08:30.286
He wrote the history
of the Peloponnesian Wars.
