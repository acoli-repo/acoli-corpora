A couple of hundred years ago,

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:03.083
he made this extraordinary projection:

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.707
"China is a sleeping lion,
and when she awakes,

00:01:05.707 --> 00:01:07.913
the world will shake."

00:01:07.913 --> 00:01:10.096
Napoleon got a few things wrong;

00:01:10.096 --> 00:01:12.789
he got this one absolutely right.

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.061
Because China is today
not just woken up,

00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:20.521
China has stood up
and China is on the march,

00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:22.541
and the question for us all

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:24.515
is where will China go

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:28.563
and how do we engage
this giant of the 21st century?
