China,

00:03:37.374 --> 00:03:39.929
and the United States,

00:03:42.343 --> 00:03:45.547

00:03:45.547 --> 00:03:48.890
which in Chinese, by the way,
means "the beautiful country."

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.514

00:03:52.514 --> 00:03:54.254
for more than a hundred years.

00:03:54.254 --> 00:03:57.853

can in fact carve out a common future
