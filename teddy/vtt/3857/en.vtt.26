00:12:57.877 --> 00:13:01.453
Furthermore, the United States
says that the Chinese political system

00:13:01.453 --> 00:13:04.332
is fundamentally wrong

00:13:04.332 --> 00:13:07.629
because it's at such fundamental variance

00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:10.880
to the human rights, democracy,
and rule of law that we enjoy

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.504
in the U.S. and the collective West.

00:13:13.504 --> 00:13:16.661
And on top of all the above,
what does the United States say?

00:13:16.661 --> 00:13:21.769
That they fear that China will,
when it has sufficient power,

00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:25.786
establish a sphere of influence
in Southeast Asia and wider East Asia,

00:13:25.786 --> 00:13:27.690
boot the United States out,

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.710
and in time, when it's powerful enough,

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.719
unilaterally seek to change
the rules of the global order.
