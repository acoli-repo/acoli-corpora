00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.719
unilaterally seek to change
the rules of the global order.

00:13:33.719 --> 00:13:36.421
So apart from all of that,
it's just fine and dandy,

00:13:36.421 --> 00:13:37.815
the U.S.-China relationship.

00:13:37.815 --> 00:13:40.020
No real problems there.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:44.942
The challenge, though,
is given those deep-rooted feelings,

00:13:44.942 --> 00:13:47.937
those deep-rooted emotions
and thought patterns,

00:13:47.937 --> 00:13:50.747
what the Chinese call "Sīwéi,"
ways of thinking,

00:13:50.747 --> 00:13:55.205
how can we craft a basis
for a common future between these two?

00:13:55.205 --> 00:13:56.836
I argue simply this:

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.781
We can do it on the basis on a framework

00:13:58.781 --> 00:14:03.356
of constructive realism
for a common purpose.
