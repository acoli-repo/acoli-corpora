And she said, "Understand this, 
learn this,

00:05:31.657 --> 00:05:34.563
because it's going to affect your future."

00:05:34.563 --> 00:05:38.361
So being a very good student of history,

00:05:38.361 --> 00:05:41.032
I decided that the best thing
for me to do was, in fact,

00:05:41.032 --> 00:05:43.284
to go off and learn Chinese.

00:05:43.284 --> 00:05:45.397
The great thing about learning Chinese

00:05:45.397 --> 00:05:48.508
is that your Chinese teacher
gives you a new name.

00:05:48.508 --> 00:05:51.434
And so they gave me this name:

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:56.565
Kè, which means to overcome or to conquer,

00:05:56.565 --> 00:06:01.163
and Wén, and that's the character
for literature or the arts.
