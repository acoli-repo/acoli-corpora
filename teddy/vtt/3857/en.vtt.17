He wrote the history
of the Peloponnesian Wars.

00:08:30.286 --> 00:08:33.064
And he made this extraordinary observation


00:08:33.064 --> 00:08:35.412
about Athens and Sparta.

00:08:35.412 --> 00:08:38.622
"It was the rise of Athens
and the fear that this inspired in Sparta

00:08:38.622 --> 00:08:40.154
that made war inevitable."

00:08:40.154 --> 00:08:45.471
And hence, a whole literature about
something called the Thucydides Trap.

00:08:45.471 --> 00:08:49.303
This guy here? He's not American
and he's not Greek. He's Chinese.

00:08:49.303 --> 00:08:51.674
His name is Sun Tzu.
He wrote "The Art of War,"

00:08:51.674 --> 00:08:55.197
and if you see his statement underneath,
it's along these lines:

00:08:55.197 --> 00:09:00.424
"Attack him where he is unprepared,
appear where you are not expected."
