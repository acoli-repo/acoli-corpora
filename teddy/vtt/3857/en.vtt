G'day, my name's Kevin.

00:00:02.923 --> 00:00:05.616
I'm from Australia. I'm here to help.

00:00:05.616 --> 00:00:08.147
(Laughter)

00:00:08.147 --> 00:00:12.814
Tonight, I want to talk about
a tale of two cities.

00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:18.248
One of those cities is called Washington,
and the other is called Beijing.

00:00:18.248 --> 00:00:24.284
Because how these two capitals
shape their future

00:00:24.284 --> 00:00:27.489
and the future of the United States
and the future of China

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.578
doesn't just affect those two countries,

00:00:29.578 --> 00:00:31.900
it affects all of us
