of constructive realism
for a common purpose.

00:14:03.356 --> 00:14:05.329
What do I mean by that?

00:14:05.329 --> 00:14:07.674
Be realistic about the things
that we disagree on,

00:14:07.674 --> 00:14:09.949
and a management approach
that doesn't enable

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:12.805
any one of those differences
to break into war or conflict

00:14:12.805 --> 00:14:16.358
until we've acquired
the diplomatic skills to solve them.

00:14:16.358 --> 00:14:20.014
Be constructive in areas of the
bilateral, regional and global engagement

00:14:20.014 --> 00:14:21.386
between the two,

00:14:21.386 --> 00:14:24.113
which will make a difference
for all of humankind.

00:14:24.113 --> 00:14:28.106
Build a regional institution
capable of cooperation in Asia,

00:14:28.106 --> 00:14:30.034
an Asia-Pacific community.
