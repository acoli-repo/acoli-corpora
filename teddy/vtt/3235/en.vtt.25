Those are things that AI cannot do.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.216
So as AI takes away the routine jobs,

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:39.200
I like to think we can, we should
and we must create jobs of compassion.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.136
You might ask how many of those there are,

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.776
but I would ask you:

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.616
Do you not think that we are going
to need a lot of social workers

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.240
to help us make this transition?

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.216
Do you not think we need
a lot of compassionate caregivers

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.936
to give more medical care to more people?

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.216
Do you not think we're going to need
10 times more teachers

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.016
to help our children find their way
