while Ke Jie was crying
and loving the game of go,

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.136
AlphaGo felt no happiness from winning

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.640
and certainly no desire
to hug a loved one.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.256
So how do we differentiate ourselves

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.816
as humans in the age of AI?

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.936
We talked about the axis of creativity,

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.816
and certainly that is one possibility,

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.136
and now we introduce a new axis

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.776
that we can call compassion,
love, or empathy.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.376
Those are things that AI cannot do.
