00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.856
My mother had dementia
and no longer recognized me,

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.800
and my children had grown up.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.056
During my chemotherapy,

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.536
I read a book by Bronnie Ware

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:14.056
who talked about dying wishes and regrets
of the people in the deathbed.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.336
She found that facing death,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.960
nobody regretted that they didn't
work hard enough in this life.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:26.056
They only regretted that they didn't
spend enough time with their loved ones

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.840
and that they didn't spread their love.
