00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.056
was made by three
North American scientists,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.680
and it's known as deep learning.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.096
Deep learning is a technology
that can take a huge amount of data

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.856
within one single domain

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.816
and learn to predict or decide
at superhuman accuracy.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.616
For example, if we show
the deep learning network

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.456
a massive number of food photos,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.056
it can recognize food

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.376
such as hot dog or no hot dog.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.536
(Applause)

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.576
Or if we show it many pictures
and videos and sensor data
