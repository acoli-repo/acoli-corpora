are incredible workers,

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.176
amazing work ethic.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.496
My example in the delivery room is nothing
compared to how hard people work in China.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.216
As an example, one startup
tried to claim work-life balance:

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.936
"Come work for us because we are 996."

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.216
And what does that mean?

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.640
It means the work hours
of 9am to 9pm, six days a week.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.240
That's contrasted
with other startups that do 997.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.416
And the Chinese product quality
has consistently gone up
