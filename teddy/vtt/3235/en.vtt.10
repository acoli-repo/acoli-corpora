In such a brutal environment,
entrepreneurs learn to grow very rapidly,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.976
they learn to make their products
better at lightning speed,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.336
and they learn
to hone their business models

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.760
until they're impregnable.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.256
As a result, great Chinese products
like WeChat and Weibo

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.696
are arguably better

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.200
than the equivalent American products
from Facebook and Twitter.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.016
And the Chinese market
embraces this change

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.056
and accelerated change
and paradigm shifts.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.176
As an example, if any of you go to China,

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.216
you will see it's almost cashless
and credit card-less,
