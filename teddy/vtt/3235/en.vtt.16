00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.456
in the assembly line with robots.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.416
And it's not just in factories,

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.496
but truckers, drivers

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.616
and even jobs like telesales,
customer service

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.616
and hematologists as well as radiologists

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.736
over the next 15 years

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.296
are going to be gradually replaced

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.760
by artificial intelligence.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.416
And only the creative jobs --

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.416
(Laughter)

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.640
I have to make myself safe, right?

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.936
Really, the creative jobs
are the ones that are protected,

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.000
because AI can optimize but not create.
