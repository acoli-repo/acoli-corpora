00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.536
for letting my work ethic
take precedence over love for my family.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.296
(Applause)

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.936
My AI talk, however, went off brilliantly.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.696
(Laughter)

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.856
Apple loved my work
and decided to announce it

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.576
at TED1992,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.616
26 years ago on this very stage.
