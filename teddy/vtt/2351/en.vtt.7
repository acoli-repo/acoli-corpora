00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.471
Current research from
the World Health Organization

00:03:30.495 --> 00:03:34.720
puts global spending on health
at 7.8 trillion dollars.

00:03:35.696 --> 00:03:37.934
Research from the Global
Wellness Institute

00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:42.085
suggests that the 4.5-trillion-dollar
global wellness industry

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.988
grew from 3.7 to 4.2 trillion
between 2015 and 2017,

00:03:47.012 --> 00:03:49.297
and sees that growth into 2022.

00:03:50.004 --> 00:03:51.742
So what, why do you care?

00:03:51.766 --> 00:03:55.143
Because that growth is nearly
twice as fast as the global economy,

00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:58.024
averaging about 3.3 percent
in the same period.

00:03:58.048 --> 00:03:59.683
So what does all that mean?

00:03:59.707 --> 00:04:02.119
Every year, we're spending
more per year on health,
