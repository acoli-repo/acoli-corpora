00:00:00.643 --> 00:00:03.897
Stress -- we all know what it is
and we all handle it differently.

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:06.461
Whether it's our thoughts
speeding up or slowing down,

00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:08.443
eating our emotions or not at all,

00:00:08.467 --> 00:00:11.410
difficulty sleeping
or just getting out of bed.

00:00:11.434 --> 00:00:13.926
Frankly, it sucks.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.951
(Laughter)

00:00:14.975 --> 00:00:16.910
But there's good stress too, you know,

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:20.308
like preparing for the biggest
public speaking event you've ever given.

00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:21.721
(Laughter)

00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:26.509
(Applause)

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.938
On a global platform.

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:29.438
(Laughter)

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:31.486
No, even the good stress
can mess with you,
