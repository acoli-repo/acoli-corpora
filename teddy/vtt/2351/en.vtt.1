No, even the good stress
can mess with you,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.875
but it's the bad stress
that I came to talk about.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.055
And probably not
for the reason you'd expect.

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.515
I'm a relationship manager
for affluent individuals.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.657
Meaning, I work with wealthy folks
and their families, hip to hip,

00:00:41.681 --> 00:00:43.707
helping them achieve
their financial goals.

00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:46.143
I like to keep the economy
in mind, because I know

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:48.739
that whatever impacts the economy,
impacts my clients,

00:00:48.763 --> 00:00:51.900
and it turns out stress is impacting
the economy in a massive way.

00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:54.155
What if I told you that by some estimates,

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.167
the cost of work-related stress in the US
is close to 300 billion dollars annually?
