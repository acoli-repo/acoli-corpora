00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:30.689
The DNA of a company
is its culture, right?

00:05:30.713 --> 00:05:31.870
It sets the tone,

00:05:31.894 --> 00:05:34.216
even goes as far as defining the company.

00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:36.466
But I think companies should invest

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.362
in the overall mental, physical
and emotional well-being

00:05:39.386 --> 00:05:40.569
of their employees

00:05:40.593 --> 00:05:43.537
the way they invest
in innovation, R and D, right?

00:05:43.561 --> 00:05:46.910
And do I think that this would increase
productivity and reduce stress?

00:05:46.934 --> 00:05:48.092
I really do.

00:05:48.116 --> 00:05:49.649
But for it to really stick,

00:05:49.673 --> 00:05:51.704
a company has to figure out a way

00:05:51.728 --> 00:05:54.515
to measure the overall
well-being of its employees

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.299
with the same accuracy and precision
that they project growth and earnings.

00:05:58.323 --> 00:06:00.798
And if this sounds
like a tall order, ask yourself
