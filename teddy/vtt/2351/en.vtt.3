Now I know what you're thinking,
"That is a lot of money, and how?"

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:31.963
Stress is this deeply personal thing,

00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:34.543
it's crazy to think
it can have such a massive impact.

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:37.291
But consider this thought
experiment to explain how.

00:01:37.315 --> 00:01:40.098
Imagine a single mother
working a stressful job,

00:01:40.122 --> 00:01:41.661
in a stress-filled environment,

00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:43.947

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:45.725
Maybe she doesn't have time to cook,

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.225
which usually means what?

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:51.512
Overly processed, high-sugar foods.

00:01:51.536 --> 00:01:54.956
Over time, this poor diet,
mixed with stress from work,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.654
leads to a chronic disease.

00:01:56.678 --> 00:01:58.212
Let's call it diabetes.

00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:01.244
Medical care cost her
and the company more money,
