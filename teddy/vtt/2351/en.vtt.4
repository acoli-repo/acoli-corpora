00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:01.244
Medical care cost her
and the company more money,

00:02:01.268 --> 00:02:02.814
which means more stress.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.094
Now, she's worried about her health
and making ends meet,

00:02:07.118 --> 00:02:09.618
so she's probably distracted
and less productive.

00:02:09.642 --> 00:02:11.094
But she can't be, remember?

00:02:11.118 --> 00:02:12.625
She's a single mother.

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:14.427
Now she's thinking,

00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:16.245
"What if something happens to me?

00:02:16.705 --> 00:02:18.538
Who is going to take care of my child?

00:02:18.562 --> 00:02:20.444
Who is going to take care of my baby?"

00:02:20.468 --> 00:02:21.626
More stress.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.417
Now take that scenario,
tweak it whichever way you'd like,

00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:25.749
and lay it over the nation,

00:02:25.773 --> 00:02:27.051
and you might start to see

00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:29.767
how we run up against
that multitrillion dollar cost.
