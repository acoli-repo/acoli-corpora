00:09:29.293 --> 00:09:30.466
I see a common trend.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.934
Mastery of their mental game.

00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.585
Which includes stress management.

00:09:33.609 --> 00:09:35.823
It's all about developing awareness,

00:09:35.847 --> 00:09:37.371
acknowledgment and acceptance

00:09:37.395 --> 00:09:40.856
of your current thoughts, emotions,
environment and physical state.

00:09:41.927 --> 00:09:43.100
Right?

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:45.474
Now I didn't say never facing stress.

00:09:45.498 --> 00:09:47.213
But the management of that stress --

00:09:47.237 --> 00:09:50.506
that's the benefit,
again, for you and the economy.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:52.672
I'll leave you with this thought.

00:09:52.696 --> 00:09:56.498
We all know that retirement
is all about saving more now

00:09:56.522 --> 00:09:57.926
for later.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.720
What if we treated our mental health
and overall well-being
