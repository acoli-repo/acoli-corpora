Every year, we're spending
more per year on health,

00:04:02.143 --> 00:04:04.945
and the industries all about
developing overall well-being

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:06.585
and living a healthier lifestyle

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.379
are growing almost twice as fast
as the global economy,

00:04:09.403 --> 00:04:13.010
and yet, we're losing
trillions of dollars per year in output.

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:15.597
So what's up?

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:16.844
(Laughter)

00:04:16.868 --> 00:04:18.193
Well, stress levels are up,

00:04:18.217 --> 00:04:19.908
and I believe that needs to change.

00:04:19.932 --> 00:04:22.861
I also believe the way we think
about stress needs to change.

00:04:22.885 --> 00:04:24.849
So let's try by reframing how we view it.

00:04:24.873 --> 00:04:27.983
See, we tend to think about stress
as a consequence,

00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:29.801
but I see it as a culture.

00:04:29.825 --> 00:04:31.738
Where do most of us spend our time?
