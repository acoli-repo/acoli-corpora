Look folks, I'm not a psychologist, OK?

00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:04.537
But I have taken steps
to develop my own mental health

00:08:04.561 --> 00:08:05.791
and overall well-being,

00:08:05.815 --> 00:08:07.298
so here's my last two cents.

00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:09.951
I think a crucial first step
is for everyone

00:08:09.975 --> 00:08:11.712
is to be honest with themselves.

00:08:11.736 --> 00:08:12.918
About what?

00:08:12.942 --> 00:08:15.784
About putting your mental,
physical and emotional well-being

00:08:15.808 --> 00:08:16.959
in the rear view

00:08:16.983 --> 00:08:18.760
and the damage it has caused.

00:08:18.784 --> 00:08:22.502
Honest about placing public opinion
above self-preservation.

00:08:23.228 --> 00:08:24.495
Think social media.

00:08:24.895 --> 00:08:28.450
Honest about how we define ourselves
and what actually does.

00:08:28.474 --> 00:08:31.331
Sure, your career contributes
to a portion of who you are.
