Now I'm happy to report
that he did get a kidney transplant

00:03:01.268 --> 00:03:02.419
just last year.

00:03:02.443 --> 00:03:03.594
However --

00:03:03.618 --> 00:03:07.858
(Applause and cheers)

00:03:07.882 --> 00:03:09.882
However, for nearly a decade,

00:03:09.906 --> 00:03:13.153
neither the economy nor my family
got the benefit from his work ethic

00:03:13.177 --> 00:03:14.359
or his intelligence,

00:03:14.383 --> 00:03:15.565
and as he would say,

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:17.644
that's just really sad commentary.

00:03:17.668 --> 00:03:19.002
All I'm saying is,

00:03:19.026 --> 00:03:22.090
I think stress impacts the economy
by reducing productivity

00:03:22.114 --> 00:03:23.737
and increasing health care costs.

00:03:23.761 --> 00:03:24.911
Makes sense?

00:03:25.498 --> 00:03:26.656
Right?

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.926
But here's what doesn't.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.471
