00:02:30.546 --> 00:02:32.673
This all hits very close to home for me.

00:02:32.697 --> 00:02:36.427
My father's one of the hardest-working
and most intelligent people that I know.

00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:38.729
Don't get me wrong,
mom worked and provided too,

00:02:38.753 --> 00:02:42.134
but he definitely embraced the role
of being the primary breadwinner.

00:02:42.158 --> 00:02:45.070
And I'm sure most of us
can understand the stress and pressure

00:02:45.094 --> 00:02:47.183
that comes with taking care
of our families.

00:02:47.207 --> 00:02:49.476
But when you combine that
with workplace stress,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.971
do you know what could happen?

00:02:50.995 --> 00:02:53.871
Developing irreversible
high blood pressure,

00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:55.958
eventually losing function of your kidneys

00:02:55.982 --> 00:02:58.442
and spending a decade
on dialysis -- his fate.

00:02:58.466 --> 00:03:01.244
Now I'm happy to report
that he did get a kidney transplant
