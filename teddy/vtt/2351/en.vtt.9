00:04:29.825 --> 00:04:31.738
Where do most of us spend our time?

00:04:31.762 --> 00:04:33.499
At work, right?

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:36.558
Where we face that scale of finding
that work-life balance.

00:04:36.582 --> 00:04:40.185
So the bonds between work,
stress, health and wellness

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:41.407
have never been closer.

00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:43.479

laser focus on shareholder returns,

00:04:53.184 --> 00:04:55.390
or my favorite, keeping up

00:04:55.414 --> 00:04:57.215
and taking pictures while we try.

00:04:57.665 --> 00:04:58.926
But at the end of the day,

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.918
I'm afraid that we've created a culture
