00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.918
I'm afraid that we've created a culture

00:05:00.942 --> 00:05:04.228
where personal care and overall well-being
are given the back seat.

00:05:04.252 --> 00:05:05.881
So how do we move forward?

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:08.936
I believe the answer lies
in three fundamental pillars.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.698
And if you find yourselves thinking,

00:05:10.722 --> 00:05:13.667
"Rob, I've heard this before,
tell me something I don't know,"

00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:14.842
ask yourself,

00:05:14.866 --> 00:05:17.012
if we already know what to do,

00:05:17.036 --> 00:05:19.146
then what have we been doing?

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.138
First, corporations.

00:05:21.162 --> 00:05:24.940
Specifically, how a corporation's
culture and communication style

00:05:24.964 --> 00:05:28.012
play a pivotal role in the stress
and well-being of a workplace.

00:05:28.036 --> 00:05:30.689
The DNA of a company
is its culture, right?
