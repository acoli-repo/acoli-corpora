00:05:58.323 --> 00:06:00.798
And if this sounds
like a tall order, ask yourself

00:06:00.822 --> 00:06:04.449
what really is a company's
most competitive advantage.

00:06:04.473 --> 00:06:05.631
Its people.

00:06:05.655 --> 00:06:06.813
We know this.

00:06:06.837 --> 00:06:09.886
And just like anything in a company,
it has to start at the top.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.109
So if you're a leader,

00:06:11.133 --> 00:06:13.522
openly showing how you care
for your mental health

00:06:13.546 --> 00:06:14.776
and overall well-being

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.069
is a huge catalyst.

00:06:16.093 --> 00:06:17.664
It's no secret I'm a soccer fan,

00:06:17.688 --> 00:06:19.641
so growing up, I had a couple of coaches.

00:06:19.665 --> 00:06:22.641
And I always had one who would lead
the heavy cardio workouts.

00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:24.981
He would not stand
on the side and spectate.

00:06:25.005 --> 00:06:26.188
He would participate.

00:06:26.212 --> 00:06:27.506
And that did three things.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.489
It made it difficult for me to complain.

00:06:29.513 --> 00:06:30.624
(Laughter)
