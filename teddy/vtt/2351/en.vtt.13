00:06:29.513 --> 00:06:30.624
(Laughter)

00:06:30.648 --> 00:06:32.704
I always made sure to keep up,

00:06:32.728 --> 00:06:35.045
and I always felt more dialed in
to the exercise.

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:36.252
It's the same idea.

00:06:36.276 --> 00:06:37.704
And finally, communication.

00:06:37.728 --> 00:06:41.172
In order for me to really help my clients
achieve their financial goals,

00:06:41.196 --> 00:06:44.291
requires that I actively
listen and then respond.

00:06:44.315 --> 00:06:47.041
Let your employees tell you
what stresses them out.

00:06:47.434 --> 00:06:50.157
Let them tell you
what wellness benefits they need.

00:06:50.517 --> 00:06:51.668
And then act.

00:06:51.692 --> 00:06:53.232
And acting on what they tell you

00:06:53.256 --> 00:06:55.352
will show how serious
you take that feedback,

00:06:55.376 --> 00:06:58.358
and I can't help but feel
the company will win in the long run.

00:06:58.382 --> 00:06:59.548
Why?

00:06:59.572 --> 00:07:03.254
Because properly equipped employees
will be more productive and less stressed.
