00:02:28.647 --> 00:02:31.358
taking something that wasn't mine;

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.109
receiving a gift,

00:02:33.544 --> 00:02:35.571
but with someone else's name on it.

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:39.433
All these amazing things
that I was being exposed to

00:02:39.457 --> 00:02:41.155
and experiencing,

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:44.454
I felt I wasn't really supposed to have.

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.216
I wasn't supposed to have a library,
fully equipped athletic facilities,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.712
or safe fields to play in.

00:02:52.208 --> 00:02:54.455
I wasn't supposed to have
theatre departments

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:56.844
with seasonal plays and concerts --

00:02:56.868 --> 00:02:59.105
digital, visual, performing arts.

00:02:59.603 --> 00:03:04.259
I wasn't supposed to have
fully resourced biology or chemistry labs,
