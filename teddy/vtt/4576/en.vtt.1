Any student I've had the honor of teaching
in my classroom is my kid.

00:00:30.702 --> 00:00:34.521
However, because their "real"
parents aren't rich

00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:37.421
and, I argue, because they
are mostly of color,

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:39.951
they will seldom get to see in themselves

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:42.391
the awesomeness that I see in them.

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:45.353
Because what I see in them is myself --

00:00:45.896 --> 00:00:48.336
or what would have been myself.

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:52.038
I am the daughter of two hardworking,

00:00:52.062 --> 00:00:54.680
college-educated, African-American parents

00:00:54.704 --> 00:00:57.418
who chose careers as public servants:

00:00:57.442 --> 00:01:01.054
my father, a minister;
my mother, an educator.
