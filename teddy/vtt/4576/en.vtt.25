00:12:30.253 --> 00:12:32.556
goes to an affluent school,

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.754
challenge your school committee
to adopt an impoverished school

00:12:35.778 --> 00:12:37.817
or an impoverished classroom.

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:41.238
Close the divide by engaging
in communication

00:12:41.262 --> 00:12:43.459
and relationships that matter.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.004
When resources are shared,

00:12:46.028 --> 00:12:47.720
they're not divided;

00:12:47.744 --> 00:12:49.201
they're multiplied.

00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:51.710
And on a micro level:

00:12:51.734 --> 00:12:53.554
if you're a human being,

00:12:53.985 --> 00:12:55.151
donate.

00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:59.587
Time, money, resources, opportunities --

00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:01.974
whatever is in your heart.
