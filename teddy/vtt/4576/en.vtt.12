00:05:56.651 --> 00:06:00.614
While African-Americans were enslaved
and prohibited from schooling,

00:06:00.638 --> 00:06:03.797
their labor established
the very institution

00:06:03.821 --> 00:06:05.509
from which they were excluded.

00:06:06.042 --> 00:06:11.121
Ever since then, every court case,
educational policy, reform,

00:06:11.145 --> 00:06:14.399
has been an attempt
to retrofit the design,

00:06:14.423 --> 00:06:17.083
rather than just stopping
and acknowledging:

00:06:17.107 --> 00:06:19.715
we've had it all wrong from the beginning.

00:06:21.243 --> 00:06:25.286
An oversimplification
of American educational history.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.822
All right, just bear with me.

00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:30.758
Blacks were kept out -- you know,
the whole slavery thing.
