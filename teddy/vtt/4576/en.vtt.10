00:05:04.664 --> 00:05:06.931
I think we've got it all wrong.

00:05:06.955 --> 00:05:08.116
I think we,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.222
as Gloria Ladson-Billings says,

00:05:10.246 --> 00:05:14.988
should flip our paradigm and our language
and call it what it really is.

00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:17.135
It's not an achievement gap;

00:05:17.878 --> 00:05:19.806

00:05:20.417 --> 00:05:25.695
for all of the foregone schooling
resources that were never invested

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:29.564
in the education of the black
and brown child over time.
