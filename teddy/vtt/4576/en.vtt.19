00:09:29.211 --> 00:09:30.910
cares this much about me

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.935
is pretty cool."

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.495
Knowing that strangers
will take care of you

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:38.545
is a privilege my kids aren't afforded.

00:09:40.342 --> 00:09:41.784
Ever since the donation,

00:09:41.808 --> 00:09:45.666
there has been a steady stream of kids
signing out books to take home,

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:48.350
and then returning them
with the exclamation,

00:09:48.374 --> 00:09:49.962
"This one was good!"

00:09:49.986 --> 00:09:51.034
(Laughter)

00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:53.360
Now when I say,
"Take out a book and read,"

00:09:53.384 --> 00:09:55.603
kids rush to my library.

00:09:56.849 --> 00:09:58.896
It wasn't that they didn't want to read,

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.470
but instead, they'd gladly read
if the resources were there.
