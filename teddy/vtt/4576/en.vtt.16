00:07:57.416 --> 00:08:00.280
I'd amassed a modest classroom library

00:08:00.304 --> 00:08:03.601
of books I'd accumulated
from secondhand shops,

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:06.088
thrift stores, attics -- you know.

00:08:06.112 --> 00:08:08.572
But whenever I said those dreadful words,

00:08:08.596 --> 00:08:10.792
"Take out a book and read,"

00:08:10.816 --> 00:08:13.249
you'd think I'd just declared war.

00:08:13.273 --> 00:08:14.966
It was torture.

00:08:15.693 --> 00:08:16.857
One day,

00:08:17.184 --> 00:08:20.314
after I'd heard about this website
called DonorsChoose,

00:08:20.338 --> 00:08:22.654
where classroom teachers create wish lists

00:08:22.678 --> 00:08:24.782
of items they need for their classroom

00:08:24.806 --> 00:08:27.333
and anonymous donors fulfill them,

00:08:27.357 --> 00:08:31.358
I figured I'd go out on a limb
and just make a wish list
