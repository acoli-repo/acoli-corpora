If we really, as a country, believe
that education is the "great equalizer,"

00:12:01.855 --> 00:12:05.686
then it should be just that:
equal and equitable.

00:12:06.158 --> 00:12:10.501
Until then, there's no democracy
in our democratic education.

00:12:11.493 --> 00:12:13.000
On a mezzo level:

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.842
historically speaking, the education
of the black and brown child

00:12:16.866 --> 00:12:20.337
has always depended
on the philanthropy of others.

00:12:20.361 --> 00:12:23.155
And unfortunately, today it still does.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.135
If your son or daughter or niece
or nephew or neighbor
