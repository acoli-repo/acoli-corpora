I want to talk to you about my kids.

00:00:03.743 --> 00:00:08.391
Now, I know everyone thinks
that their kid is the most fantastic,

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:10.490
the most beautiful kid that ever lived.

00:00:11.352 --> 00:00:12.601
But mine really are.

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:13.932
(Laughter)

00:00:13.956 --> 00:00:16.330
I have 696 kids,

00:00:16.354 --> 00:00:20.806
and they are the most intelligent,
inventive, innovative,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.676
brilliant and powerful kids
that you'll ever meet.

00:00:25.263 --> 00:00:30.086
Any student I've had the honor of teaching
in my classroom is my kid.
