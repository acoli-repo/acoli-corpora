And then they'd say, almost suspiciously,

00:09:02.474 --> 00:09:04.201
"But they're brand-new."

00:09:04.225 --> 00:09:05.227
(Laughter)

00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:06.830
To which I'd reply,

00:09:06.854 --> 00:09:08.634
"You deserve brand-new books."

00:09:10.137 --> 00:09:13.560
The whole experience hit home
for me when one of my girls,

00:09:13.584 --> 00:09:16.654
as she peeled open a crisp paperback said,

00:09:17.582 --> 00:09:21.960
"Ms. Sumner -- you know,
I figured you bought these books,

00:09:21.984 --> 00:09:24.722
'cause you teachers
are always buying us stuff.

00:09:25.158 --> 00:09:29.187
But to know that a stranger,
someone I don't even know,

00:09:29.211 --> 00:09:30.910
cares this much about me
