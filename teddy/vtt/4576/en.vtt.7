00:03:27.137 --> 00:03:30.507
There are thousands
of other kids just like me,

00:03:30.531 --> 00:03:32.267
who deserve this, too.

00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.429
Why doesn't everyone get this?

00:03:34.453 --> 00:03:38.793
Why is a high-quality education
only exclusive to the rich?

00:03:39.634 --> 00:03:43.198
It was like I had some sort
of survivor's remorse.

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:45.954
All of my neighborhood friends
were experiencing

00:03:45.978 --> 00:03:47.803
an educational train wreck

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:51.516
that I was saved from through a bus ride.

00:03:52.067 --> 00:03:54.561
I was like an educational Moses screaming,

00:03:54.585 --> 00:03:56.194
"Let my people go ...

00:03:56.218 --> 00:03:58.055
to high-quality schools!"

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.496
(Laughter)

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.080
I'd seen firsthand how the other half
was being treated and educated.
