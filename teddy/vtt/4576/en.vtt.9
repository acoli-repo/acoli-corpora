00:04:29.451 --> 00:04:34.026
There have been countless nights
when I've cried in frustration,

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.326
anger

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.741
and sorrow,

00:04:36.765 --> 00:04:40.056
because I can't teach my kids
the way that I was taught,

00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:44.772
because I don't have access
to the same resources or tools

00:04:44.796 --> 00:04:46.686
that were used to teach me.

00:04:47.393 --> 00:04:49.564
My kids deserve so much better.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.133
We sit and we keep banging
our heads against this term:

00:04:53.157 --> 00:04:55.722
"Achievement gap, achievement gap!"

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:59.394
Is it really that hard to understand

00:04:59.418 --> 00:05:02.643
why these kids perform well
and these kids don't?
