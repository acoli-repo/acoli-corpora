00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.063
It's graduation day

00:00:03.097 --> 00:00:05.997
at the small New England college
where my dad taught.

00:00:06.597 --> 00:00:09.463
It's a burst of color and excitement.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.197
When I was little,
he'd carry me up on his shoulders

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.497
and I'd marvel at the pageantry.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.497
I loved the wizard-like academic robes
that all the professors wore.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.763
My father explained how you could tell
what degree someone had

00:00:24.797 --> 00:00:26.497
and the school they'd gone to,

00:00:26.497 --> 00:00:30.097
based on the color and design
of their gown and hood.
