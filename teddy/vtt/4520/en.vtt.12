Luckily, they say -- I still am not sure --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
but luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
in the Buddhist literature, they say, "Oh who would really want to be compassionate?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
How awful! I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
My bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
I never have enough, even if I'm a billionaire, I don't have enough.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I need a hundred billion." So I'm like that.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Imagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
It would be terrible.
