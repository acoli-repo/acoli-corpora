Because our egocentric perception -- from the Buddha's point of view, misperception --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
is that all we are is what is inside our skin.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And it's inside and outside, self and other,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and other is all very different.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
a little bit, right?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
You know, someone sitting next to you in a seat -- that's OK because you're in a theater,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
you'd freak out.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
What do they want from me? Like, who's that?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And so you wouldn't sit that close to another person

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
because of your notion that it's you versus the universe -- that's all Buddha discovered.
