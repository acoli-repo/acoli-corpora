somehow by that opening, you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.000
you get away from this terrible iron circle of I, me, me, mine,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
like the Beatles used to sing.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
You know, we really learned everything in the '60s.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Too bad nobody ever woke up to it,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and they've been trying to suppress it since then.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I, me, me, mine. It's like a perfect song, that song. A perfect teaching.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
But when we're relieved from that,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
we somehow then become interested in all the other beings.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange.
