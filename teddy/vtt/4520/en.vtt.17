He once told me -- he looked kind of sad;

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
he worries very much about the haves and have-nots.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
He looked a little sad, because he said, well, a hundred years ago,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
they went and took everything away from the haves.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
You know, the big communist revolutions, Russia and China and so forth.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
They took it all away by violence,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
saying they were going to give it to everyone, and then they were even worse.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
They didn't help at all.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And so then he looks at me.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
So I said, "Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity,"
