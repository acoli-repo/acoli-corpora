we somehow then become interested in all the other beings.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It's totally strange.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
The Dalai Lama always likes to say --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
are finally too small a theater for your intelligence.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
It's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that, or what, you know --

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and the more you focus on how you feel, by the way, the worse it gets.
