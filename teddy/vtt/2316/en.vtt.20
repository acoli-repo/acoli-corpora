00:09:59.912 --> 00:10:02.232
for its survival, it will be the same

00:10:02.232 --> 00:10:06.983
in all of those different lineages, species, taxa.

00:10:06.983 --> 00:10:10.260
So therefore, if we were to do this,

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.729
what we'd need to do is sequence that region

00:10:11.729 --> 00:10:14.844
in all these different mammals and ascertain if it's the same

00:10:14.844 --> 00:10:18.851
or if it's different. So if it is the same,

00:10:18.851 --> 00:10:21.960
this indicates that that site is important for a function,

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:25.823
so a disease mutation should fall within that site.

00:10:25.823 --> 00:10:29.560
So in this case here, if all the mammals that we look at

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.824
have a yellow-type genome at that site,
