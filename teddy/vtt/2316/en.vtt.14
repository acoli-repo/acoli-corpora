00:06:57.247 --> 00:07:00.487
It's working its way slowly across the U.S. and wiping out

00:07:00.487 --> 00:07:04.247
populations of bats, and scientists have estimated

00:07:04.247 --> 00:07:09.204
that 1,300 metric tons of insects a year are now

00:07:09.204 --> 00:07:12.918
remaining in the ecosystems due to the loss of bats.

00:07:12.918 --> 00:07:15.330
Bats are also threatened in the U.S.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.169
by their attraction to wind farms. Again, right now

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:20.893
bats are looking at a little bit of a problem.

00:07:20.893 --> 00:07:23.191
They're going to -- They are very threatened

00:07:23.191 --> 00:07:26.736
in the United States of America alone.

00:07:26.736 --> 00:07:28.277
Now how can this help us?

00:07:28.277 --> 00:07:31.942
Well, it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats
