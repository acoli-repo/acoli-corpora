00:15:27.392 --> 00:15:31.283
Just imagine what that would be like.

00:15:31.283 --> 00:15:34.168
So really, I don't think we should be thinking of them

00:15:34.168 --> 00:15:39.222
as flying demons of the night, but more as our superheroes.

00:15:39.222 --> 00:15:43.068
And the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit

00:15:43.068 --> 00:15:45.620
if we just look in the right place. They're good for our ecosystem,

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.526
they allow us to understand how our genome functions,

00:15:48.526 --> 00:15:51.755
and they potentially hold the secret to everlasting youth.

00:15:51.755 --> 00:15:54.370
So tonight, when you walk out of here and you look up

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.869
in the night skies, and you see this beautiful flying mammal,

00:15:57.869 --> 00:16:01.869
I want you to smile. Thank you. (Applause)
