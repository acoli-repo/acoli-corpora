00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:30.465
and they turn this information into an acoustic image.

00:02:30.465 --> 00:02:35.093
And this enables them to orient in complete darkness.

00:02:35.093 --> 00:02:38.518
Indeed, they do look very strange. We're humans.

00:02:38.518 --> 00:02:41.713
We're a visual species. When scientists first realized

00:02:41.713 --> 00:02:45.654
that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly

00:02:45.654 --> 00:02:48.629
and orient and move at night, we didn't believe it.

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.653
For a hundred years, despite evidence to show

00:02:51.653 --> 00:02:54.892
that this is what they were doing, we didn't believe it.

00:02:54.892 --> 00:02:58.860
Now, if you look at this bat, it looks a little bit alien.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.158
Indeed, the very famous philosopher Thomas Nagel
