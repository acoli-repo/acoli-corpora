00:07:59.297 --> 00:08:01.953
for our ecosystems.

00:08:01.953 --> 00:08:05.953
And what about the second? What about health?

00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:10.615
Inside every cell in your body lies your genome.

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:13.265
Your genome is made up of your DNA,

00:08:13.265 --> 00:08:16.457
your DNA codes for proteins that enable you to function

00:08:16.457 --> 00:08:19.377
and interact and be as you are.

00:08:19.377 --> 00:08:23.839
Now since the new advancements in modern molecular technologies,

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:27.962
it is now possible for us to sequence our own genome

00:08:27.962 --> 00:08:32.091
in a very rapid time and at a very, very reduced cost.
