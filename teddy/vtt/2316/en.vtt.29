00:14:25.646 --> 00:14:30.582
So therefore, they must have something within their DNA

00:14:30.582 --> 00:14:33.427
that ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses,

00:14:33.427 --> 00:14:37.333
particularly of flight. They expend three times more energy

00:14:37.333 --> 00:14:38.873
than a mammal of the same size,

00:14:38.873 --> 00:14:42.485
but don't seem to suffer the consequences or the effects.

00:14:42.485 --> 00:14:45.830
So right now, in my lab, we're combining

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.741
state-of-the-art bat field biology, going out and catching

00:14:49.741 --> 00:14:52.550
the long-lived bats, with the most up-to-date,

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.021
modern molecular technology to understand better

00:14:56.021 --> 00:15:00.549
what it is that they do to stop aging as we do.
