How about 40? Okay, it's a whole varied response.

00:13:33.019 --> 00:13:36.670
This bat is myotis brandtii. It's the longest-living bat.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.858
It lived for up to 42 years,

00:13:38.858 --> 00:13:41.193
and this bat's still alive in the wild today.

00:13:41.193 --> 00:13:43.775
But what would be so amazing about this?

00:13:43.775 --> 00:13:48.857
Well, typically, in mammals there is a relationship

00:13:48.857 --> 00:13:51.357
between body size, metabolic rate,

00:13:51.357 --> 00:13:53.493
and how long you can live for, and you can predict

00:13:53.493 --> 00:13:56.720
how long a mammal can live for given its body size.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.415
So typically, small mammals live fast, die young.
