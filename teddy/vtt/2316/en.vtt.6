00:03:05.663 --> 00:03:09.403
on this planet, you should lock yourself inside a room

00:03:09.403 --> 00:03:13.528
with a flying, echolocating bat in complete darkness."

00:03:13.528 --> 00:03:16.599
And if you look at the actual physical characteristics

on the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat,

00:03:19.556 --> 00:03:22.350

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.689
to be able to make sound and perceive it.

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:30.253
Very big ears, strange nose leaves, but teeny-tiny eyes.
