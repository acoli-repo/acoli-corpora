00:11:56.731 --> 00:12:01.721
and now we can predict which sites are most likely to cause disease.

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.602
So bats are also important for our health,

00:12:04.602 --> 00:12:09.492
to enable us to better understand how our genome functions.

00:12:09.492 --> 00:12:11.911
So this is where we are right now,

00:12:11.911 --> 00:12:13.811
but what about the future?

00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:15.467
What about longevity?

00:12:15.467 --> 00:12:19.208
This is where we're going to go, and as I said before,

00:12:19.208 --> 00:12:22.287
I really believe that the secret of everlasting youth

00:12:22.287 --> 00:12:23.996
lies within the bat genome.

00:12:23.996 --> 00:12:28.112
So why should we be interested in aging at all?

00:12:28.112 --> 00:12:30.600
Well, really, this is a picture drawn from the 1500s
