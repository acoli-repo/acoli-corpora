00:10:57.519 --> 00:11:00.894
what's causing this disease.

00:11:00.894 --> 00:11:05.087
So in my lab, we've been using bats to look at two different

00:11:05.087 --> 00:11:08.435
types of diseases of the senses.

00:11:08.435 --> 00:11:11.243
We're looking at blindness. Now why would you do this?

00:11:11.243 --> 00:11:16.189
Three hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired, and

00:11:16.189 --> 00:11:19.780
45 million of these are blind. So blindness is a big problem,

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.995
and a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases,

00:11:23.995 --> 00:11:26.166
so we want to try and better understand

00:11:26.166 --> 00:11:29.771
which mutations in the gene cause the disease.

00:11:29.771 --> 00:11:33.679
Also we look at deafness. One in every 1,000
