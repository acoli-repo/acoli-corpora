00:08:58.068 --> 00:09:00.979
or does this variation just make you different?

00:09:00.979 --> 00:09:03.385
Again, what does it mean here? What does this variation

00:09:03.385 --> 00:09:07.204
actually mean? So if we are to capitalize on all of this

00:09:07.204 --> 00:09:11.098
new molecular data and personalized genomic information

00:09:11.098 --> 00:09:13.499
that is coming online that we will be able to have

00:09:13.499 --> 00:09:16.571
in the next few years, we have to be able to differentiate

00:09:16.571 --> 00:09:19.787
between the two. So how do we do this?

00:09:19.787 --> 00:09:23.115
Well, I believe we just look at nature's experiments.

00:09:23.115 --> 00:09:27.960
So through natural selection, over time,

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.077
mutations, variations that disrupt the function of a protein
