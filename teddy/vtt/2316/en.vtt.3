00:01:27.946 --> 00:01:31.929
for about 64 million years.

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.394
One of the most unique things that bats do

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:38.195
as a mammal is that they fly.

00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:41.530
Now flight is an inherently difficult thing.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.473
Flight within vertebrates has only evolved three times:

00:01:45.473 --> 00:01:48.833
once in the bats, once in the birds,

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:50.928
and once in the pterodactyls.

00:01:50.928 --> 00:01:54.774
And so with flight, it's very metabolically costly.

00:01:54.774 --> 00:01:58.704
Bats have learned and evolved how to deal with this.

00:01:58.704 --> 00:02:03.090
But one other extremely unique thing about bats
