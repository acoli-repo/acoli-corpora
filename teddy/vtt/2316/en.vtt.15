00:07:28.277 --> 00:07:31.942
Well, it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats

00:07:31.942 --> 00:07:34.336
from the equation, we're going to have to then use

00:07:34.336 --> 00:07:37.277
insecticides to remove all those pest insects

00:07:37.277 --> 00:07:40.352
that feed on our agricultural crops.

00:07:40.352 --> 00:07:44.000
And for one year in the U.S. alone, it's estimated

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.942
that it's going to cost 22 billion U.S. dollars,

00:07:46.942 --> 00:07:51.465
if we remove bats. So indeed, bats then do bring us wealth.

00:07:51.465 --> 00:07:53.921
They maintain the health of our ecosystems,

00:07:53.921 --> 00:07:56.410
and also they save us money.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.297
So again, that's the first blessing. Bats are important

00:07:59.297 --> 00:08:01.953
for our ecosystems.
