00:01:58.704 --> 00:02:03.090
But one other extremely unique thing about bats

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.139
is that they are able to use sound

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:09.935
to perceive their environment. They use echolocation.

00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:12.599
Now, what I mean by echolocation --

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.104
they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth

00:02:16.104 --> 00:02:20.000
or through their nose. This sound wave comes out

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.087
and it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment,

00:02:24.087 --> 00:02:26.947
and the bats then hear these echoes

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:30.465
and they turn this information into an acoustic image.
