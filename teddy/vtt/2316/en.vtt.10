Also, if you think about it, demons

00:05:01.752 --> 00:05:05.467
always have bat wings, whereas birds, they typically --

00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:08.336
or angels have bird wings.

00:05:08.336 --> 00:05:13.445
Now, this is Western society, and what I hope to do tonight

00:05:13.445 --> 00:05:18.144
is to convince you of the Chinese traditional culture,

00:05:18.144 --> 00:05:21.073
that they perceive bats as

00:05:21.073 --> 00:05:24.657
creatures that bring good luck, and indeed, if you walk

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:29.001
into a Chinese home, you may see an image such as this.

00:05:29.001 --> 00:05:31.183
This is considered the Five Blessings.
