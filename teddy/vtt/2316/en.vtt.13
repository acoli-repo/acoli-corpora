00:06:31.717 --> 00:06:34.109
for our ecosystems to function properly.

00:06:34.109 --> 00:06:36.844
Without them, it's going to be a problem.

00:06:36.844 --> 00:06:42.366
But most bats are voracious insect predators.

00:06:42.366 --> 00:06:45.242
It's been estimated in the U.S., in a tiny colony

00:06:45.242 --> 00:06:47.393
of big brown bats, that they will feed

00:06:47.393 --> 00:06:50.963
on over a million insects a year,

bats are being threatened by a disease known as white-nose syndrome.

00:06:57.247 --> 00:07:00.487
It's working its way slowly across the U.S. and wiping out
