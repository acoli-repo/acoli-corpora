As we age, we deteriorate, and this deterioration

00:13:02.456 --> 00:13:07.218
causes problems for our society, so we have to address it.

00:13:07.218 --> 00:13:11.732
So how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie

00:13:11.732 --> 00:13:14.413
within the bat genome? Does anybody want to hazard

00:13:14.413 --> 00:13:18.371
a guess over how long this bat could live for?

00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:21.396
Who -- put up your hands -- who says two years?

00:13:21.396 --> 00:13:25.292
Nobody? One? How about 10 years?

00:13:25.292 --> 00:13:29.144
Some? How about 30?

00:13:29.144 --> 00:13:33.019
How about 40? Okay, it's a whole varied response.
