00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.824
have a yellow-type genome at that site,

00:10:32.824 --> 00:10:35.486
it probably suggests that purple is bad.

00:10:35.486 --> 00:10:38.960
This could be even more powerful if you look at mammals

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.632
that are doing things slightly differently.

00:10:41.632 --> 00:10:43.710
So say, for example, the region of the genome

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:47.239
that I was looking at was a region that's important for vision.

00:10:47.239 --> 00:10:50.913
If we look at that region in mammals that don't see so well,

00:10:50.913 --> 00:10:54.747
such as bats, and we find that bats that don't see so well

00:10:54.747 --> 00:10:57.519
have the purple type, we know that this is probably

00:10:57.519 --> 00:11:00.894
what's causing this disease.
