00:08:27.962 --> 00:08:32.091
in a very rapid time and at a very, very reduced cost.

00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:34.631
Now when we've been doing this, we've realized

00:08:34.631 --> 00:08:38.448
that there's variations within our genome.

00:08:38.448 --> 00:08:41.642
So I want you to look at the person beside you.

00:08:41.642 --> 00:08:43.721
Just have a quick look. And what we need to realize

00:08:43.721 --> 00:08:48.365
is that every 300 base pairs in your DNA, you're a little bit different.

00:08:48.365 --> 00:08:50.630
And one of the grand challenges right now

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.226
in modern molecular medicine is to work out

00:08:53.226 --> 00:08:58.068
whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases,

00:08:58.068 --> 00:09:00.979
or does this variation just make you different?
