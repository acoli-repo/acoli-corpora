00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.077
mutations, variations that disrupt the function of a protein

00:09:33.077 --> 00:09:35.698
will not be tolerated over time.

00:09:35.698 --> 00:09:39.892
Evolution acts as a sieve. It sieves out the bad variation.

00:09:39.892 --> 00:09:42.153
And so therefore, if you look at the same region

00:09:42.153 --> 00:09:45.304
of a genome in many mammals that have been

00:09:45.304 --> 00:09:48.808
evolutionarily distant from each other

00:09:48.808 --> 00:09:52.271
and are also ecologically divergent, you will get a better

00:09:52.271 --> 00:09:56.033
understanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is,

00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:59.912
i.e., if it is important for the mammal to function,

00:09:59.912 --> 00:10:02.232
for its survival, it will be the same
