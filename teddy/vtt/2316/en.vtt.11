00:05:29.001 --> 00:05:31.183
This is considered the Five Blessings.

00:05:31.183 --> 00:05:33.845
The Chinese word for "bat" sounds like the Chinese word

00:05:33.845 --> 00:05:36.936
for "happiness," and they believe that bats

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:41.297
bring wealth, health, longevity, virtue and serenity.

00:05:41.297 --> 00:05:44.657
And indeed, in this image, you have a picture of longevity

00:05:44.657 --> 00:05:46.755
surrounded by five bats.

00:05:46.755 --> 00:05:50.438
And what I want to do tonight is to talk to you

00:05:50.438 --> 00:05:54.024
and to show you that at least three of these blessings

00:05:54.024 --> 00:05:57.393
are definitely represented by a bat, and that if we study bats

00:05:57.393 --> 00:06:01.656
we will get nearer to getting each of these blessings.
