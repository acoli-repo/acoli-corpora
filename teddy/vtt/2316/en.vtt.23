00:11:29.771 --> 00:11:33.679
Also we look at deafness. One in every 1,000

00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:37.195
newborn babies are deaf, and when we reach 80,

00:11:37.195 --> 00:11:40.253
over half of us will also have a hearing problem.

00:11:40.253 --> 00:11:44.530
Again, there's many underlying genetic causes for this.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:47.177
So what we've been doing in my lab

00:11:47.177 --> 00:11:50.291
is looking at these unique sensory specialists, the bats,

00:11:50.291 --> 00:11:52.839
and we have looked at genes that cause blindness

00:11:52.839 --> 00:11:54.188
when there's a defect in them,

00:11:54.188 --> 00:11:56.731
genes that cause deafness when there's a defect in them,

00:11:56.731 --> 00:12:01.721
and now we can predict which sites are most likely to cause disease.
