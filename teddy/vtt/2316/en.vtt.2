00:00:57.779 --> 00:01:00.881
magnificent creature, isn't it?

00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:04.233
Who here thought of a bat?

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:06.864
Ah, I can see half the audience agrees with me,

00:01:06.864 --> 00:01:10.087
and I have a lot of work to do to convince the rest of you.

00:01:10.087 --> 00:01:14.345
So I have had the good fortune for the past 20 years

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:18.744
to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals.

00:01:18.744 --> 00:01:22.506
One fifth of all living mammals is a bat,

00:01:22.506 --> 00:01:24.918
and they have very unique attributes.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.946
Bats as we know them have been around on this planet

00:01:27.946 --> 00:01:31.929
for about 64 million years.
