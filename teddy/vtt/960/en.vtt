"What I Will"

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I will not dance to your war drum.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I will not dance to that beating.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I know that beat.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It is lifeless.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I know intimately that skin you are hitting.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It was alive once,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
hunted, stolen,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
stretched.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I will not dance to your drummed-up war.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I will not pop, spin, break for you.
