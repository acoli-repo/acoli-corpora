00:02:56.966 --> 00:03:00.012
And the World Health
Organization also tells us

00:03:00.036 --> 00:03:03.153
that every 40 seconds,

00:03:03.177 --> 00:03:07.227
someone somewhere in the world
commits suicide

00:03:07.251 --> 00:03:08.522
because they are unhappy,

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:12.612
largely due to depression or kufungisisa.

00:03:12.636 --> 00:03:16.216
And most of these deaths are occurring
in low- and middle-income countries.

00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:18.621
In fact,

00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:21.548
the World Health Organization
goes as far as to say

00:03:22.425 --> 00:03:26.333
that when you look at the age group
between 15 to 29,

00:03:26.357 --> 00:03:30.805
a leading cause of death
now is actually suicide.
