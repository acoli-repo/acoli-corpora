00:07:29.661 --> 00:07:30.904
And I thought,

00:07:31.753 --> 00:07:34.147
grandmothers are in every community.

00:07:34.171 --> 00:07:35.764
There are hundreds of them.

00:07:36.183 --> 00:07:37.349
And --

00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:38.583
(Laughter)

00:07:38.607 --> 00:07:43.967
And they don't leave their communities
in search of greener pastures.

00:07:43.991 --> 00:07:45.189
(Laughter)

00:07:45.495 --> 00:07:47.015
See, the only time they leave

00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:49.608
is when they go to a greener
pasture called heaven.

00:07:49.632 --> 00:07:50.756
(Laughter)

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.743
So I thought, how about
training grandmothers

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.680
in evidence-based talk therapy,

00:07:57.704 --> 00:08:00.806
which they can deliver on a bench?
