00:00:00.813 --> 00:00:03.579
On a warm August morning in Harare,

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:05.500
Farai,

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.120
a 24-year-old mother of two,

00:00:09.144 --> 00:00:11.864
walks towards a park bench.

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:16.079
She looks miserable and dejected.

00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:21.904
Now, on the park bench
sits an 82-year-old woman,

00:00:21.928 --> 00:00:25.478
better known to the community
as Grandmother Jack.

00:00:27.392 --> 00:00:33.912
Farai hands Grandmother Jack
an envelope from the clinic nurse.
