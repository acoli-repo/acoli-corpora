00:04:28.352 --> 00:04:30.342
Now, let me just put that into context.

00:04:31.107 --> 00:04:33.759
One evening while I was at home,

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.967
I get a call from the ER,

00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:38.514
or the emergency room,

00:04:39.308 --> 00:04:42.327
from a city which is some
200 kilometers away

00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:44.173
from where I live.

00:04:44.197 --> 00:04:45.845
And the ER doctor says,

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:47.058
"One of your patients,

00:04:47.082 --> 00:04:48.956
someone you treated four months ago,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.172
has just taken an overdose,

00:04:51.196 --> 00:04:53.245
and they are in the ER department.

00:04:53.673 --> 00:04:55.809
Hemodynamically, they seem to be OK,

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:59.595
but they will need
neuropsychiatric evaluation."

00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:02.944
Now, I obviously can't get into my car
in the middle of the night
