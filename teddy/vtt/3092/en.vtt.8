00:03:59.055 --> 00:04:00.413
to do the job.

00:04:00.437 --> 00:04:03.461
In most low- and middle-income
countries, for instance,

00:04:03.485 --> 00:04:06.265
the ratio of psychiatrists
to the population

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:10.449
is something like one for every
one and a half million people,

00:04:10.473 --> 00:04:14.050
which literally means
that 90 percent of the people

00:04:14.074 --> 00:04:16.094
needing mental health services

00:04:16.118 --> 00:04:17.606
will not get it.

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.229
In my country,

00:04:19.918 --> 00:04:22.547
there are 12 psychiatrists,

00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:23.815
and I'm one of them,

00:04:24.414 --> 00:04:28.328
for a population
of approximately 14 million.

00:04:28.352 --> 00:04:30.342
Now, let me just put that into context.
