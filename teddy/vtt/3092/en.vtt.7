00:03:26.357 --> 00:03:30.805
a leading cause of death
now is actually suicide.

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.505
But there are wider events
that lead to depression

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:37.324
and in some cases, suicide,

00:03:37.348 --> 00:03:38.634
such as abuse,

00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:41.194
conflict, violence,

00:03:41.865 --> 00:03:44.208
isolation, loneliness --

00:03:44.232 --> 00:03:45.583
the list is endless.

00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:49.910
But one thing that we do know

00:03:49.934 --> 00:03:53.883
is that depression can be treated
and suicides averted.

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.557
But the problem is

00:03:55.581 --> 00:03:59.031
we just don't have enough psychiatrists
or psychologists in the world

00:03:59.055 --> 00:04:00.413
to do the job.
