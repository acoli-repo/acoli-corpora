00:11:27.719 --> 00:11:30.185
she's cheering on
all the other grandmothers --

00:11:30.209 --> 00:11:34.802
the increasing number of grandmothers
who are making a difference

00:11:34.826 --> 00:11:37.330
in the lives of thousands of people.

00:11:38.118 --> 00:11:40.627
And I'm sure she's in awe

00:11:40.651 --> 00:11:45.500
when she realizes that something
that she helped to pioneer

00:11:45.524 --> 00:11:48.128
is now spreading to other countries,

00:11:48.152 --> 00:11:49.374
like Malawi,

00:11:49.398 --> 00:11:50.866
the island of Zanzibar

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:54.501
and coming closer to home
here in the Unites States

00:11:54.525 --> 00:11:55.982
in the city of New York.

00:11:57.039 --> 00:11:59.379
May her soul rest in peace.
