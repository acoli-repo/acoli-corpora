Baldur— son of All Father Odin 
and Queen Frigg,

00:00:11.786 --> 00:00:16.862
husband of Nanna the Peaceful, 
and God of truth and light—

00:00:16.862 --> 00:00:21.725
was the gentlest and most beloved being 
in all of Asgard.

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:23.845
In his great hall of Breidablik,

00:00:23.845 --> 00:00:27.645
Baldur’s soothing presence 
eased his subject’s woes.

00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:31.210
But lately, he was plagued 
by troubles of his own.
