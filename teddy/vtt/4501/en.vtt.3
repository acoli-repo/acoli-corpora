00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:33.357
all living things on Earth are connected
through evolutionary history --

00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:35.628
the origin of species
through natural selection

00:01:35.652 --> 00:01:37.976
and divergence
from an ancestral population.

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:39.976
Even as a scientist,

00:01:40.388 --> 00:01:42.901
I used to go to lectures
by molecular biologists

00:01:42.925 --> 00:01:45.650
and find them completely incomprehensible,

00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:47.942
with all the fancy technical
language and jargon

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:50.090
that they would use
in describing their work,

00:01:50.114 --> 00:01:53.165
until I encountered
the artworks of David Goodsell,

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.930
who is a molecular biologist
at the Scripps Institute.

00:01:55.954 --> 00:01:59.523
And his pictures -- everything's accurate
and it's all to scale.

00:01:59.547 --> 00:02:01.976
And his work illuminated for me
