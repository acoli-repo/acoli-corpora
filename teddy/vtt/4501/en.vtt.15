00:07:27.943 --> 00:07:30.177
when the chromosome
is correctly positioned.

00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:34.014
It's turning green here because it feels
that everything is just right.

00:07:34.038 --> 00:07:36.296
And you'll see,
there's this one little last bit

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.753
that's still remaining red.

00:07:37.777 --> 00:07:40.310
And it's walked away
down the microtubules.

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:45.068
That is the signal broadcasting system
sending out the stop signal.

00:07:45.092 --> 00:07:47.788
And it's walked away --
I mean, it's that mechanical.

00:07:47.812 --> 00:07:49.380
It's molecular clockwork.

00:07:49.404 --> 00:07:51.976
This is how you work
at the molecular scale.

00:07:52.609 --> 00:07:54.873
So with a little bit
of molecular eye candy,

00:07:54.897 --> 00:07:56.095
(Laughter)

00:07:56.119 --> 00:07:58.069
we've got kinesins, the orange ones.

00:07:58.093 --> 00:08:00.866
They're little molecular courier
molecules walking one way.
