00:05:59.222 --> 00:06:01.464
and look at its structure and describe it.

00:06:01.988 --> 00:06:04.413
So again, here we are
at that equator moment.

00:06:05.394 --> 00:06:06.594
The chromosomes line up.

00:06:06.618 --> 00:06:08.445
And if we isolate just one chromosome,

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:11.286
we're going to pull it out
and have a look at its structure.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.372
So this is one of the biggest
molecular structures that you have,

00:06:14.396 --> 00:06:17.451
at least as far as we've discovered
so far inside of us.

00:06:18.026 --> 00:06:20.002
So this is a single chromosome.

00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:22.627
And you have two strands of DNA
in each chromosome.

00:06:22.651 --> 00:06:24.372
One is bundled up into one sausage.

00:06:24.396 --> 00:06:27.129
The other strand is bundled up
into the other sausage.

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:30.715
These things that look like whiskers
that are sticking out from either side
