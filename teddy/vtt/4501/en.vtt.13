00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:30.715
These things that look like whiskers
that are sticking out from either side

00:06:30.739 --> 00:06:32.645
are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell.

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.580
They're called microtubules,
that name's not important.

00:06:35.604 --> 00:06:38.335
But we're going to focus on
the region labeled red here --

00:06:38.359 --> 00:06:40.896
and it's the interface between
the dynamic scaffolding

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.087
and the chromosomes.

00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:45.216
It is obviously central
to the movement of the chromosomes.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.812
We have no idea, really,
as to how it's achieving that movement.

00:06:48.836 --> 00:06:51.483
We've been studying this thing
they call the kinetochore

00:06:51.507 --> 00:06:53.579
for over a hundred years
with intense study,

00:06:53.603 --> 00:06:56.429
and we're still just beginning
to discover what it's about.

00:06:56.453 --> 00:06:59.207
It is made up of about
200 different types of proteins,

00:06:59.231 --> 00:07:00.942
thousands of proteins in total.
