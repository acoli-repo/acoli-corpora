00:07:58.093 --> 00:08:00.866
They're little molecular courier
molecules walking one way.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:04.036
And here are the dynein,
they're carrying that broadcasting system.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.604
And they've got their long legs

00:08:05.628 --> 00:08:07.694
so they can step around
obstacles and so on.

00:08:07.718 --> 00:08:10.745
So again, this is all derived
accurately from the science.

00:08:10.769 --> 00:08:13.319
The problem is we can't show it
to you any other way.

00:08:13.343 --> 00:08:18.177
Exploring at the frontier of science,
at the frontier of human understanding,

00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:19.436
is mind-blowing.

00:08:20.714 --> 00:08:21.892
Discovering this stuff

00:08:21.916 --> 00:08:25.444
is certainly a pleasurable
incentive to work in science.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.688
But most medical researchers --

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:32.854
discovering the stuff is simply steps
along the path to the big goals,
