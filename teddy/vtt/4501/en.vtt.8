00:03:56.221 --> 00:04:00.265
and copied one section at a time,
creating two new DNA molecules.

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:05.572
Now you have billions of this machine
right now working away inside you,

00:04:05.596 --> 00:04:07.813
copying your DNA with exquisite fidelity.

00:04:08.676 --> 00:04:10.210
It's an accurate representation,

00:04:10.234 --> 00:04:13.763
and it's pretty much at the correct speed
for what is occurring inside you.

00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:16.604
I've left out error correction
and a bunch of other things.

00:04:16.628 --> 00:04:18.387
(Laughter)

00:04:18.411 --> 00:04:20.532
This was work from a number of years ago--

00:04:20.556 --> 00:04:21.725
Thank you.

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:23.121
(Applause)

00:04:23.145 --> 00:04:25.074
This is work from a number of years ago,

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:27.365
but what I'll show you next
is updated science,

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:28.551
it's updated technology.

00:04:28.575 --> 00:04:29.935
So again, we begin with DNA.

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:31.677
And it's jiggling and wiggling there
