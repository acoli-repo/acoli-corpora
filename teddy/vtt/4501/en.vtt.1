00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.837
but we don't really have a direct way
of showing you the molecules.

00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:35.111
One way around this is to draw pictures.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:37.675
And this idea is actually nothing new.

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.987
Scientists have always created pictures

00:00:40.011 --> 00:00:42.797
as part of their thinking
and discovery process.

00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:45.696
They draw pictures
of what they're observing with their eyes,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.112
through technology
like telescopes and microscopes,

00:00:48.136 --> 00:00:50.575
and also what they're thinking
about in their minds.

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:52.202
I picked two well-known examples,

00:00:52.226 --> 00:00:55.831
because they're very well-known
for expressing science through art.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.883
And I start with Galileo,
who used the world's first telescope

00:00:59.907 --> 00:01:01.093
to look at the Moon.
