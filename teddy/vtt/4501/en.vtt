00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:05.642
What I'm going to show you
are the astonishing molecular machines

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.966
that create the living
fabric of your body.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.773
Now molecules are really, really tiny.

00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:15.677
And by tiny, I mean really.

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:18.647
They're smaller
than a wavelength of light,

00:00:18.671 --> 00:00:20.976
so we have no way
to directly observe them.

00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:24.094
But through science,
we do have a fairly good idea

00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:26.330
of what's going on
down at the molecular scale.

00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:29.576
So what we can do is actually
tell you about the molecules,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.837
but we don't really have a direct way
of showing you the molecules.
