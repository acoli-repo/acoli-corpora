I was very much inspired
by this image many years ago,

00:02:31.622 --> 00:02:34.173
and I wondered whether
we could use computer graphics

00:02:34.197 --> 00:02:35.801
to represent the molecular world.

00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:36.976
What would it look like?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.440
And that's how I really began.

00:02:38.863 --> 00:02:40.476
So let's begin.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.885
This is DNA in its classic
double helix form.

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.265
And it's from X-ray crystallography,
so it's an accurate model of DNA.

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:49.260
If we unwind the double helix
and unzip the two strands,

00:02:49.284 --> 00:02:51.303
you see these things that look like teeth.

00:02:51.327 --> 00:02:53.144
Those are the letters of genetic code,

00:02:53.168 --> 00:02:55.437
the 25,000 genes
you've got written in your DNA.

00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:58.397
This is what they typically talk about --
the genetic code --

00:02:58.421 --> 00:03:00.112
this is what they're talking about.
