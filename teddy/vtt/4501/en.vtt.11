00:05:29.327 --> 00:05:30.908
The nuclear envelope breaks down.

00:05:30.932 --> 00:05:33.177
These sausage-shaped things
are the chromosomes,

00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:34.382
and we'll focus on them.

00:05:34.406 --> 00:05:38.444
They go through this very striking motion
that is focused on these little red spots.

00:05:39.068 --> 00:05:43.303
When the cell feels it's ready to go,
it rips apart the chromosome.

00:05:43.327 --> 00:05:45.368
One set of DNA goes to one side,

00:05:45.392 --> 00:05:47.415
the other side gets
the other set of DNA --

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:49.276
identical copies of DNA.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.260
And then the cell splits down the middle.

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:54.143
And again, you have billions of cells
undergoing this process

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:55.524
right now inside of you.

00:05:56.342 --> 00:05:59.198
Now we're going to rewind
and just focus on the chromosomes,

00:05:59.222 --> 00:06:01.464
and look at its structure and describe it.
