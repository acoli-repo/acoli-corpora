00:01:59.547 --> 00:02:01.976
And his work illuminated for me

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.315
what the molecular world
inside us is like.

00:02:04.815 --> 00:02:06.840
So this is a transection through blood.

00:02:06.864 --> 00:02:09.841
In the top left-hand corner,
you've got this yellow-green area.

00:02:09.865 --> 00:02:13.081
The yellow-green area is the fluid
of blood, which is mostly water,

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:16.092
but it's also antibodies, sugars,
hormones, that kind of thing.

00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:18.604
And the red region is a slice
into a red blood cell.

00:02:18.628 --> 00:02:20.494
And those red molecules are hemoglobin.

00:02:20.518 --> 00:02:23.213
They are actually red;
that's what gives blood its color.

00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:25.204
And hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:26.905
to soak up the oxygen in your lungs

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.042
and then carry it
to other parts of the body.

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:31.598
I was very much inspired
by this image many years ago,
