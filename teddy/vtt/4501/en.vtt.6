00:02:58.421 --> 00:03:00.112
this is what they're talking about.

00:03:00.136 --> 00:03:02.906
But I want to talk about
a different aspect of DNA science,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.819
and that is the physical nature of DNA.

00:03:04.843 --> 00:03:07.428
It's these two strands
that run in opposite directions

00:03:07.452 --> 00:03:09.622
for reasons I can't go into right now.

00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:11.854
But they physically run
in opposite directions,

00:03:11.878 --> 00:03:15.509
which creates a number of complications
for your living cells,

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:16.762
as you're about to see,

00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:19.148
most particularly
when DNA is being copied.

00:03:19.172 --> 00:03:21.090
And so what I'm about to show you

00:03:21.114 --> 00:03:25.130
is an accurate representation
of the actual DNA replication machine

00:03:25.154 --> 00:03:27.211
that's occurring right now
inside your body,

00:03:27.235 --> 00:03:29.047
at least 2002 biology.

00:03:29.357 --> 00:03:32.368
So DNA's entering the production line
from the left-hand side,
