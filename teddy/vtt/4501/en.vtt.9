00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:31.677
And it's jiggling and wiggling there

00:04:31.701 --> 00:04:33.882
because of the surrounding
soup of molecules,

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:36.289
which I've stripped away
so you can see something.

00:04:36.313 --> 00:04:39.288
DNA is about two nanometers across,
which is really quite tiny.

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:40.746
But in each one of your cells,

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.947
each strand of DNA is about
30 to 40 million nanometers long.

00:04:44.414 --> 00:04:48.230
So to keep the DNA organized
and regulate access to the genetic code,

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:50.337
it's wrapped around these
purple proteins --

00:04:50.361 --> 00:04:51.943
or I've labeled them purple here.

00:04:51.967 --> 00:04:53.551
It's packaged up and bundled up.

00:04:53.575 --> 00:04:55.976
All this field of view
is a single strand of DNA.

00:04:56.511 --> 00:04:59.593
This huge package of DNA
is called a chromosome.

00:04:59.617 --> 00:05:01.976
And we'll come back
to chromosomes in a minute.
