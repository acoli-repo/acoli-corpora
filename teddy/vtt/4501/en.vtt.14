00:06:59.231 --> 00:07:00.942
thousands of proteins in total.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.550
It is a signal broadcasting system.

00:07:04.574 --> 00:07:06.738
It broadcasts through chemical signals,

00:07:06.762 --> 00:07:09.506
telling the rest of the cell
when it's ready,

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.361
when it feels that everything
is aligned and ready to go

00:07:12.385 --> 00:07:14.363
for the separation of the chromosomes.

00:07:14.387 --> 00:07:17.719
It is able to couple onto the growing
and shrinking microtubules.

00:07:17.743 --> 00:07:20.942
It's involved with the growing
of the microtubules,

00:07:20.966 --> 00:07:23.369
and it's able to transiently
couple onto them.

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:25.919
It's also an attention-sensing system.

00:07:25.943 --> 00:07:27.919
It's able to feel when the cell is ready,

00:07:27.943 --> 00:07:30.177
when the chromosome
is correctly positioned.
