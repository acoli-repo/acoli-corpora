00:04:59.617 --> 00:05:01.976
And we'll come back
to chromosomes in a minute.

00:05:02.415 --> 00:05:04.481
We're pulling out, we're zooming out,

00:05:04.505 --> 00:05:05.976
out through a nuclear pore,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.660
which is the gateway to this compartment
that holds all the DNA,

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:11.103
called the nucleus.

00:05:11.657 --> 00:05:15.888
All of this field of view
is about a semester's worth of biology,

00:05:15.912 --> 00:05:17.277
and I've got seven minutes,

00:05:17.301 --> 00:05:19.989
So we're not going to be
able to do that today?

00:05:20.013 --> 00:05:21.975
No, I'm being told, "No."

00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:25.781
This is the way a living cell
looks down a light microscope.

00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:29.303
And it's been filmed under time-lapse,
which is why you can see it moving.

00:05:29.327 --> 00:05:30.908
The nuclear envelope breaks down.
