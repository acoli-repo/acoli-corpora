00:03:29.357 --> 00:03:32.368
So DNA's entering the production line
from the left-hand side,

00:03:32.734 --> 00:03:35.901
and it hits this collection,
these miniature biochemical machines,

00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:39.069
that are pulling apart the DNA strand
and making an exact copy.

00:03:39.093 --> 00:03:42.602
So DNA comes in and hits this blue,
doughnut-shaped structure

00:03:42.626 --> 00:03:44.933
and it's ripped apart
into its two strands.

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.043
One strand can be copied directly,

00:03:47.067 --> 00:03:49.990
and you can see these things
spooling off to the bottom there.

00:03:50.014 --> 00:03:52.274
But things aren't so simple
for the other strand

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.063
because it must be copied backwards.

00:03:54.087 --> 00:03:56.197
So it's thrown out
repeatedly in these loops

00:03:56.221 --> 00:04:00.265
and copied one section at a time,
creating two new DNA molecules.
