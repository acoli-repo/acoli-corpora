00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's just start by looking at some great photographs.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is an icon of National Geographic,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
with a parody of National Geographic,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and I shudder to think what they're going to do to this photograph.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Oh, the wrath of Photoshop.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is a jet landing at San Francisco, by Bruce Dale.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
He mounted a camera on the tail.
