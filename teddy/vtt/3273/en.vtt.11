I believe this creates
a virtuous cycle of capital

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.536
that allows many more
entrepreneurs to succeed.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.096
Because access to capital
is access to opportunity.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.096
And we have only just begun to imagine

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.200
what democratizing
access to capital will do.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.056
I would have never thought
that my own search for funding

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.896
would lead me to this stage,

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.520
having helped nearly
30 companies get investment.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.536
Imagine if other entrepreneurs tried
to invent new ways to access capital
