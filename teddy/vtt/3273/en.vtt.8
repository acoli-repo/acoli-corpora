00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.960
I was sold.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.256
The idea, though, of doing it together
still seemed a little crazy.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.816
Startups compete
with each other for investment,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.640
it takes hundreds of meetings
to get a check.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.495
That I would spend my precious 15 minutes
in front of an investor

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.536
talking not just about my own company,
but all the companies in the batch,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.760
was unprecedented.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.496
But the idea caught on.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.800
And we decided to cooperate,
rather than compete.
