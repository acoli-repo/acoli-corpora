00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.536
Imagine if other entrepreneurs tried
to invent new ways to access capital

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.296
rather than following
the traditional route.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.376
It would change
what gets built, who builds it

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.176
and the long-term impact on the economy.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.136
And I believe that's way more exciting

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.096
than just trying to invest
in the next billion-dollar startup.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.336
Thank you.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.080
