00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.056
And the founders couldn't stop talking.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.496
"I'm going to raise an ICO."

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.056
"I'm going to raise an ICO."

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.696
Until one guy goes,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.536
"How cool if we did this all together?

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.136
We should do an ICO that combines
the value of all of our companies

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.296
and raise money as a group."

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.656
At that point, I had to ask
the obvious question,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.296
"Guys, what's an ICO?"

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.296
ICOs were a way for young
companies to raise money

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.776
by issuing a digital currency

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.096
tied to the value and services
that the company provides.
