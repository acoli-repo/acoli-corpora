I remember just being dumbstruck.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.176
Who would be unhappy

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.856
with putting four or five
million dollars into a company

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.680
and having it sell for 50 to 70 million?

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.976
I was a first-time founder.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.456
I didn't have a wealthy network
of individuals to turn to for investment,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.056
so I went to venture capitalists

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.440
the most common form of investor
in a technology company.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.616
But I'd never taken the time to understand

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.440
what was motivating that VC to invest.
