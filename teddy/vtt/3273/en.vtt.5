In the summer of 2017,
I went out to San Francisco,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.376
to join a tech accelerator
with 30 other companies.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.616
The accelerator was supposed to teach us
how to raise venture capital.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.096
But when I got out there,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.896
the startup community was buzzing
about ICOs, or Initial Coin Offerings.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.896
For the first time, ICOs had raised
more money for young startups

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.600
than venture capital had.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.416
It was the first week of the program.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.016
Tequila Friday.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.056
And the founders couldn't stop talking.
