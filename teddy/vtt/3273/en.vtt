00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.096
When I was raising investment
for my startup,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.216
a venture capitalist said to me,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.416
"Ashwini, I think you're going to raise
a few million dollars.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.496
And your company --
it's going to sell for 50 to 70 million.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.976
You're going to be really excited.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.496
Your early investors
are going to be really excited.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.896
And I'm going to be really upset.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.880
So I'm not going to invest in this deal."

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.000
I remember just being dumbstruck.
