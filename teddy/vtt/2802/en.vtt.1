00:00:29.564 --> 00:00:31.326
but this long-standing joke

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.723
about our perpetual lateness to church,

00:00:33.747 --> 00:00:35.429
to cookouts, to family events

00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:38.070
and even to our own funerals, remains.

00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:41.930
I personally am a stickler for time.

00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:44.642
It's almost as if my mother,
when I was growing up, said,

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.592
"We will not be those black people."

00:00:46.616 --> 00:00:49.281
So we typically arrive to events
30 minutes early.

00:00:50.198 --> 00:00:55.075
But today, I want to talk to you
more about the political nature of time,

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:57.018
for if time had a race,

00:00:57.042 --> 00:00:58.380
it would be white.

00:00:59.063 --> 00:01:01.327
White people own time.
