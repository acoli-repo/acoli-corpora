00:03:28.882 --> 00:03:33.882
first thought to conceptualize
time and history, one famously declared,

00:03:33.906 --> 00:03:37.449
"[Africa] is no historical
part of the World."

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.044
He was essentially saying

00:03:40.068 --> 00:03:42.435
that Africans were people
outside of history

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.945
who had had no impact on time

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:46.618
or the march of progress.

00:03:47.103 --> 00:03:51.548
This idea, that black people
have had no impact on history,

00:03:51.572 --> 00:03:55.044
is one of the foundational ideas
of white supremacy.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:59.902
It's the reason that Carter G. Woodson
created "Negro History Week" in 1926.

00:03:59.926 --> 00:04:03.041
It's the reason that we continue
to celebrate Black History Month
