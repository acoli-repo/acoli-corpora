to which we are not entitled.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.657
Time and the march of progress
is used to justify

00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:40.096
a stunning degree of violence
towards our most vulnerable populations,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.195
who, being perceived as space-takers
rather than world-makers,

00:08:45.219 --> 00:08:47.536
are moved out of the places
where they live,

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.608
in service of bringing them
into the 21st century.

00:08:51.868 --> 00:08:55.998
Shortened life span according to zip code
is just one example of the ways

00:08:56.022 --> 00:08:58.749
that time and space cohere
in an unjust manner

00:08:58.773 --> 00:09:00.433
in the lives of black people.
