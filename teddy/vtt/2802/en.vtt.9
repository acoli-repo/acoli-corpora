We have a black president.

00:04:32.015 --> 00:04:33.441

William Faulkner famously said,

00:04:36.984 --> 00:04:39.079
"The past is never dead.

00:04:39.103 --> 00:04:40.615
It's not even past."

00:04:41.996 --> 00:04:45.085
But my good friend
Professor Kristie Dotson says,

00:04:45.109 --> 00:04:48.358
"Our memory is longer than our lifespan."

00:04:49.204 --> 00:04:51.506
We carry, all of us,

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.231
family and communal
hopes and dreams with us.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.962
We don't have the luxury
of letting go of the past.
