00:01:57.204 --> 00:02:00.260
in the ways we attempt to argue
that the future that we hope for

00:02:00.284 --> 00:02:02.496
is the present in which
we're currently living.

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.531
Now, when Barack Obama
became President of the US in 2008,

00:02:06.555 --> 00:02:09.545
many Americans declared
that we were post-racial.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.629
I'm from the academy

00:02:11.653 --> 00:02:14.084
where we're enamored

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:21.805
"Post" has become
a simple academic appendage

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.769
that we apply to a range of terms

00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:25.407
to mark the way we were.

00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:30.487
But prefixes alone don't have the power
to make race and racism
