00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.962
We don't have the luxury
of letting go of the past.

00:05:01.986 --> 00:05:03.905
But sometimes,

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:05.914
our political conditions are so troubling

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:08.127
that we don't know
if we're living in the past

00:05:08.151 --> 00:05:10.244
or we're living in the present.

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:12.943
Take, for instance,
when Black Lives Matter protesters

00:05:12.967 --> 00:05:16.988
go out to protest unjust killings
of black citizens by police,

00:05:17.012 --> 00:05:20.113
and the pictures that emerge
from the protest

00:05:20.137 --> 00:05:22.700
look like they could have been
taken 50 years ago.

00:05:23.795 --> 00:05:25.993
The past won't let us go.

00:05:26.696 --> 00:05:30.647
But still, let us press our way
into the present.
