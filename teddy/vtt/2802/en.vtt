What if I told you that time has a race,

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:08.562
a race in the contemporary way
that we understand race

00:00:08.586 --> 00:00:10.136
in the United States?

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.522
Typically, we talk about race
in terms of black and white issues.

00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:18.402
In the African-American communities
from which I come,

00:00:18.426 --> 00:00:21.218
we have a long-standing
multi-generational joke

00:00:21.242 --> 00:00:23.779
about what we call "CP time,"

00:00:23.803 --> 00:00:25.676
or "colored people's time."

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.540
Now, we no longer refer
to African-Americans as "colored,"

00:00:29.564 --> 00:00:31.326
but this long-standing joke
