00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:32.562
but we can decide that the time
we do get is just and free.

00:11:32.586 --> 00:11:35.231
We can stop making your zip code
the primary determinant

00:11:35.255 --> 00:11:36.477
of your lifespan.

00:11:37.024 --> 00:11:39.744
We can stop stealing learning time
from black children

00:11:39.768 --> 00:11:42.824
through excessive use
of suspensions and expulsions.

00:11:42.848 --> 00:11:44.917
We can stop stealing time
from black people

00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:48.260
through long periods
of incarceration for nonviolent crimes.

00:11:48.947 --> 00:11:51.943
The police can stop
stealing time and black lives

00:11:51.967 --> 00:11:54.059
through use of excessive force.

00:11:55.177 --> 00:11:57.917
I believe the future is what we make it.

00:11:58.424 --> 00:12:02.439
But we can't get there
on colored people's time
