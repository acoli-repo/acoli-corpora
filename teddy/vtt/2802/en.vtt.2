White people own time.

00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:04.039
I know, I know.

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:07.935
Making such "incendiary statements"
makes us uncomfortable:

00:01:08.614 --> 00:01:12.351
Haven't we moved past the point
where race really matters?

00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:15.462
Isn't race a heavy-handed concept?

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.017
Shouldn't we go ahead
with our enlightened, progressive selves

00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:22.676
and relegate useless concepts like race
to the dustbins of history?

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.772
How will we ever get over racism
if we keep on talking about race?

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:33.363
Perhaps we should lock up our concepts
of race in a time capsule,
