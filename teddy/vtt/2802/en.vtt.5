00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:30.487
But prefixes alone don't have the power
to make race and racism

00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:32.271
a thing of the past.

00:02:32.295 --> 00:02:34.257
The US was never "pre-race."

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.830
So to claim that we're post-race when we

our post-racial future,

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.325
our political conditions became
the most racial they've been

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:52.691
in the last 50 years.

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:56.962
So today, I want to offer to you
three observations,

00:02:56.986 --> 00:03:00.372
about the past, the present
and the future of time,
