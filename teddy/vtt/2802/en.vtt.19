Ta-Nehisi Coates argues

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:38.020
that, "The defining feature
of being drafted into the Black race

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:40.948
is the inescapable robbery of time."

00:09:41.698 --> 00:09:43.490
We experience time discrimination,

00:09:43.514 --> 00:09:44.741
he tells us,

00:09:44.765 --> 00:09:46.245
not just as structural,

00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:47.720
but as personal:

00:09:47.744 --> 00:09:49.568
in lost moments of joy,

00:09:49.592 --> 00:09:51.808
lost moments of connection,

00:09:51.832 --> 00:09:54.329
lost quality of time with loved ones

00:09:54.353 --> 00:09:57.429
and lost years of healthy quality of life.
