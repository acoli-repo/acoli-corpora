00:10:58.633 --> 00:11:01.165
Time is used to displace us,

00:11:01.189 --> 00:11:04.199
or conversely, we are urged
into complacency

00:11:04.223 --> 00:11:07.344
through endless calls to just be patient.

00:11:07.985 --> 00:11:10.437
But if past is prologue,

00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:13.714
let us seize upon the ways in which
we're always out of time anyway

00:11:13.738 --> 00:11:15.386
to demand with urgency

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.728
freedom now.

00:11:17.767 --> 00:11:20.622
I believe the future is what we make it.

00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:25.091
But first, we have to decide
that time belongs to all of us.

00:11:25.817 --> 00:11:28.520
No, we don't all get equal time,

00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:32.562
but we can decide that the time
we do get is just and free.
