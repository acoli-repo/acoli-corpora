that white people even dictate
the pace of social inclusion.

00:06:00.074 --> 00:06:02.830
They dictate how long
it will actually take

00:06:02.854 --> 00:06:06.838
for minority groups to receive the rights
that they have been fighting for.

00:06:07.315 --> 00:06:10.173
Let me loop back to the past quickly
to give you an example.

00:06:11.101 --> 00:06:13.244
If you think about
the Civil Rights Movement

00:06:13.268 --> 00:06:16.201
and the cries of its leaders
for "Freedom Now,"

00:06:16.225 --> 00:06:19.594
they were challenging the slow pace
of white social inclusion.

00:06:20.317 --> 00:06:24.345
By 1965, the year
the Voting Rights Act was passed,

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:25.999
there had been a full 100 years

00:06:26.023 --> 00:06:27.866
between the end of the Civil War

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.036
and the conferral of voting rights
on African-American communities.
