00:03:59.926 --> 00:04:03.041
It's the reason that we continue
to celebrate Black History Month

00:04:03.065 --> 00:04:05.633
in the US every February.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.130
Now, we also see this idea

00:04:09.154 --> 00:04:13.677
that black people are people either
alternately outside of the bounds of time

00:04:13.701 --> 00:04:15.209
or stuck in the past,

00:04:15.233 --> 00:04:18.108
in a scenario where,
much as I'm doing right now,

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:22.258
a black person stands up and insists
that racism still matters,

00:04:22.282 --> 00:04:24.608
and a person, usually white,

00:04:24.632 --> 00:04:25.798
says to them,

00:04:25.822 --> 00:04:27.386
"Why are you stuck in the past?

00:04:27.782 --> 00:04:29.259
Why can't you move on?
