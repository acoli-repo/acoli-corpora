00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.306
he was diagnosed with cancer.

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:05.392
You see,

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:08.012
what the robot we were trying
to build was telling him

00:02:08.036 --> 00:02:10.192
was not about doing the heavy lifting.

00:02:10.216 --> 00:02:11.367
It was a warning

00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:13.895
about his exposure to the toxic chemicals.

00:02:15.184 --> 00:02:17.477
He didn't recognize that at the time,

00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:19.187
and he contracted leukemia.

00:02:19.827 --> 00:02:21.719
And he died at the age of 45.

00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:25.130
I was devastated by this.

00:02:25.703 --> 00:02:28.465
And I never forgot the robot
that he and I tried to build.
