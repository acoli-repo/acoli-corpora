00:03:30.413 --> 00:03:32.943
we decided to build a planter,

00:03:32.967 --> 00:03:34.918
put the robot into the center of it,

00:03:34.942 --> 00:03:36.620
and we called it the Telegarden.

00:03:37.736 --> 00:03:42.253
And we had put a camera
in the gripper of the hand of the robot,

00:03:42.277 --> 00:03:45.208
and we wrote some
special scripts and software,

00:03:45.232 --> 00:03:47.266
so that anyone in the world could come in,

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.074
and by clicking on the screen,

00:03:49.098 --> 00:03:52.719
they could move the robot around
and visit the garden.

00:03:53.416 --> 00:03:57.267
But we also set up some other software

00:03:57.291 --> 00:04:01.207
that lets you participate
and help us water the garden, remotely.
