Many of the subtasks in surgery are very
routine and tedious, like suturing,

00:12:06.555 --> 00:12:08.822
and currently, all of these are performed

00:12:08.846 --> 00:12:12.713
under the specific and immediate
control of the surgeon.

00:12:13.374 --> 00:12:15.642
So the surgeon becomes fatigued over time.

00:12:16.086 --> 00:12:17.522
And we've been wondering,

00:12:17.546 --> 00:12:21.917
what if we could program the robot
to perform some of these subtasks,

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:23.322
and thereby free the surgeon

00:12:23.346 --> 00:12:26.581
to focus on the more complicated
parts of the surgery,

00:12:26.605 --> 00:12:29.405
and also cut down on the time
that the surgery would take

00:12:29.429 --> 00:12:32.268
if we could get the robot
to do them a little bit faster?
