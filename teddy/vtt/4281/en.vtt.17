(Laughter)

00:08:34.004 --> 00:08:35.876
So he loved the concept,

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.153
and when the Tele-Actor walked onstage,
she walked right up to him,

00:08:40.177 --> 00:08:42.636
and she gave him a big kiss
right on the lips.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.612
(Laughter)

00:08:44.636 --> 00:08:47.558
We were totally surprised --
we had no idea that would happen.

00:08:47.582 --> 00:08:50.200
And he was great, he just gave her
a big hug in return,

00:08:50.224 --> 00:08:51.881
and it worked out great.

00:08:51.905 --> 00:08:53.945
But that night, as we were packing up,

00:08:53.969 --> 00:08:58.524
I asked the Tele-Actor,
how did the Tele-Directors decide

00:08:58.548 --> 00:09:01.548
that they would give
a kiss to Sam Donaldson?
