00:07:27.565 --> 00:07:30.157
people could experience
what she was experiencing.

00:07:30.736 --> 00:07:33.707
So they could see what she was seeing,

00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:37.014
but then, more importantly,
they could participate,

00:07:37.038 --> 00:07:41.788
by interacting with each other
and coming up with ideas

00:07:41.812 --> 00:07:45.781
about what she should do next
and where she should go,

00:07:45.805 --> 00:07:48.011
and then conveying those
to the Tele-Actor.

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:51.490
So we got a chance to take the Tele-Actor

00:07:51.514 --> 00:07:54.322
to the Webby Awards in San Francisco.

00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:58.369
And that year, Sam Donaldson was the host.
