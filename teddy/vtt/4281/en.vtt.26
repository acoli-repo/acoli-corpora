00:12:58.082 --> 00:13:00.622
We started working with Pieter
and his students.

00:13:00.646 --> 00:13:04.826
And we asked a surgeon
to perform a task --

00:13:06.761 --> 00:13:07.912
with the robot.

00:13:07.936 --> 00:13:10.961
So what we're doing is asking
the surgeon to perform the task,

00:13:10.985 --> 00:13:13.021
and we record the motions of the robot.

00:13:13.045 --> 00:13:14.471
So here's an example.

00:13:14.495 --> 00:13:17.616
I'll use tracing out
a figure eight as an example.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.804
So here's what it looks like
when the robot --

00:13:21.828 --> 00:13:24.896
this is what the robot's path
looks like, those three examples.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.056
Now, those are much better
than what a novice like me could do,

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.774
but they're still jerky and imprecise.
