00:10:58.811 --> 00:11:01.078
and engineers at Johns Hopkins,

00:11:01.102 --> 00:11:05.064
and we're building a robot
that has a number of --

00:11:05.088 --> 00:11:07.687
it's a specialized design
with different joints

00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:12.034
that can allow the needles to come in
at an infinite variety of angles.

00:11:12.483 --> 00:11:16.205
And as you can see here,
they can avoid delicate organs

00:11:16.229 --> 00:11:18.893
and still reach the targets
they're aiming for.

00:11:20.019 --> 00:11:25.004
So, by questioning this assumption
that all the needles have to be parallel,

00:11:25.028 --> 00:11:27.654
this project also taught me
an important lesson:

00:11:28.114 --> 00:11:32.869
When in doubt, when your path
is blocked, pivot.
