00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.980
Just before the curtain went
up, I had about 30 seconds

00:08:03.004 --> 00:08:06.746
to explain to Mr. Donaldson
what we were going to do.

00:08:08.119 --> 00:08:11.636
And I said, "The Tele-Actor
is going to be joining you onstage.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.014
This is a new experimental project,

00:08:14.038 --> 00:08:16.633
and people are watching her
on their screens,

00:08:16.657 --> 00:08:19.948
there's cameras involved
and there's microphones

00:08:19.972 --> 00:08:21.758
and she's got an earbud in her ear,

00:08:21.782 --> 00:08:24.099
and people over the network
are giving her advice

00:08:24.123 --> 00:08:25.281
about what to do next."

00:08:25.305 --> 00:08:26.700
And he said, "Wait a second.

00:08:27.806 --> 00:08:28.979
That's what I do."

00:08:29.003 --> 00:08:33.980
(Laughter)
