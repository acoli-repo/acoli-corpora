00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:31.545
And I'm happy to say, it remained
online there, 24 hours a day,

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.400
for almost nine years.

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:38.144
That robot was operated by more people

00:04:38.168 --> 00:04:40.065
than any other robot in history.

00:04:41.303 --> 00:04:42.930
Now, one day,

00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:46.302
I got a call out of the blue
from a student,

00:04:47.211 --> 00:04:51.369
who asked a very simple
but profound question.

00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:55.187
He said, "Is the robot real?"

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.885
Now, everyone else had assumed it was,

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:01.425
and we knew it was,
because we were working with it.
