00:15:27.312 --> 00:15:32.819
And the field of robotics
has gotten much better over time.

00:15:34.319 --> 00:15:36.595
Nowadays, high school students
can build robots,

00:15:36.619 --> 00:15:39.503
like the industrial robot
my dad and I tried to build.

00:15:40.675 --> 00:15:43.445
But, it's very -- now ...

00:15:43.954 --> 00:15:47.255
And now, I have a daughter,

00:15:47.857 --> 00:15:49.014
named Odessa.

00:15:49.673 --> 00:15:50.926
She's eight years old.

00:15:51.682 --> 00:15:53.331
And she likes robots, too.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.366
Maybe it runs in the family.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.630
(Laughter)

00:15:56.654 --> 00:15:58.749
I wish she could meet my dad.
