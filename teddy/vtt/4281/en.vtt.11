00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:31.756
who's a world-renowned
professor of philosophy,

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:35.312
And I talked with him
about this and he said,

00:05:35.336 --> 00:05:39.438
"This is one of the oldest
and most central problems in philosophy.

00:05:39.462 --> 00:05:43.479
It goes back to the Skeptics
and up through Descartes.

00:05:43.503 --> 00:05:46.685
It's the issue of epistemology,

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:49.577
the study of how do we know
that something is true."

00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:52.625
So he and I started working together,

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:55.520
and we coined a new term:
"telepistemology,"

00:05:56.757 --> 00:05:58.893
the study of knowledge at a distance.

00:05:59.303 --> 00:06:03.794
We invited leading artists,
engineers and philosophers
