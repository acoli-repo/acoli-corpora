00:12:29.429 --> 00:12:32.268
if we could get the robot
to do them a little bit faster?

00:12:32.958 --> 00:12:36.380
Now, it's hard to program a robot
to do delicate things like this.

00:12:36.943 --> 00:12:41.149
But it turns out my colleague
Pieter Abbeel, who's here at Berkeley,

00:12:41.173 --> 00:12:46.653
has developed a new set of techniques
for teaching robots from example.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.913
So he's gotten robots to fly helicopters,

00:12:49.937 --> 00:12:53.191
do incredibly interesting,
beautiful acrobatics,

00:12:53.215 --> 00:12:55.182
by watching human experts fly them.

00:12:56.152 --> 00:12:58.058
So we got one of these robots.

00:12:58.082 --> 00:13:00.622
We started working with Pieter
and his students.
