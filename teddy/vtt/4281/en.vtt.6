WEBVTT

00:02:59.844 --> 00:03:02.662
and I was just building up
my own robotics lab,

00:03:02.686 --> 00:03:05.907
and this was the year
the World Wide Web came out.

00:03:06.487 --> 00:03:09.472
And I remember my students
were the ones who told me about it,

00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:11.813
and we would -- we were just amazed.

00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:15.220
We started playing with this,
and that afternoon,

00:03:15.244 --> 00:03:19.522
we realized that we could use
this new, universal interface

00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:23.974
to allow anyone in the world
to operate the robot in our lab.

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:29.381
So, rather than have it fight
or do industrial work,
