00:06:28.023 --> 00:06:30.844
As it was operating, my students
and I were very interested

00:06:30.868 --> 00:06:33.209
in how people were interacting
with each other,

00:06:33.233 --> 00:06:35.290
and what they were doing with the garden.

00:06:35.314 --> 00:06:36.465
So we started thinking:

00:06:36.489 --> 00:06:38.457
what if the robot could leave the garden

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:41.295
and go out into some other
interesting environment?

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:44.060
Like, for example,
what if it could go to a dinner party

00:06:44.084 --> 00:06:45.545
at the White House?

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:47.068
(Laughter)

00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:51.970
So, because we were interested
more in the system design

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:54.937
and the user interface
than in the hardware,

00:06:54.961 --> 00:06:56.112
we decided that,

00:06:56.136 --> 00:07:00.623
rather than have a robot replace
the human to go to the party,
