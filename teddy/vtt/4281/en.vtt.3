00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:33.462
and they had to move heavy steel parts
between tanks of chemicals.

00:01:33.486 --> 00:01:36.859
And so he needed
an industrial robot like this,

00:01:36.883 --> 00:01:38.986
that could basically do the heavy lifting.

00:01:39.684 --> 00:01:43.275
But my dad didn't get
the kind of robot he wanted, either.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.300
He and I worked on it for several years,

00:01:46.324 --> 00:01:51.069
but it was the 1970s, and the technology
that was available to amateurs

00:01:51.093 --> 00:01:52.419
just wasn't there yet.

00:01:53.992 --> 00:01:56.777
So Dad continued to do
this kind of work by hand.

00:01:57.595 --> 00:01:59.023
And a few years later,

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.306
he was diagnosed with cancer.
