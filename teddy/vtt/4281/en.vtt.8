that lets you participate
and help us water the garden, remotely.

00:04:01.643 --> 00:04:03.932
And if you watered it a few times,

00:04:03.956 --> 00:04:06.231
we'd give you your own seed to plant.

00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:10.643
Now, this was an engineering project,

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:14.779
and we published some papers
on the system design of it,

00:04:14.803 --> 00:04:17.448
but we also thought of it
as an art installation.

00:04:18.638 --> 00:04:20.787
It was invited, after the first year,

00:04:20.811 --> 00:04:23.831
by the Ars Electronica Museum in Austria,

00:04:23.855 --> 00:04:26.677
to have it installed in their lobby.

00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:31.545
And I'm happy to say, it remained
online there, 24 hours a day,
