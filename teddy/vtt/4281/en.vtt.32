WEBVTT

00:16:00.303 --> 00:16:03.043
And now I get to teach her
how things work,

00:16:03.067 --> 00:16:05.297
and we get to build projects together.

00:16:05.321 --> 00:16:08.527
And I wonder what kind of lessons
she'll learn from them.

00:16:10.147 --> 00:16:14.154
Robots are the most human of our machines.

00:16:14.983 --> 00:16:17.937
They can't solve all
of the world's problems,

00:16:17.961 --> 00:16:21.484
but I think they have something
important to teach us.

00:16:22.276 --> 00:16:24.277
I invite all of you

00:16:24.301 --> 00:16:27.879
to think about the innovations
that you're interested in,

00:16:28.712 --> 00:16:30.955
the machines that you wish for.
