00:10:27.632 --> 00:10:30.041
which leads to trauma and side effects.

00:10:30.581 --> 00:10:32.225
So my students and I wondered:

00:10:32.249 --> 00:10:36.771
what if we could modify the system,

00:10:36.795 --> 00:10:39.420
so that the needles
could come in at different angles?

00:10:40.395 --> 00:10:42.238
So we simulated this;

00:10:42.262 --> 00:10:45.707
we developed some optimization
algorithms and we simulated this.

00:10:45.731 --> 00:10:46.882
And we were able to show

00:10:46.906 --> 00:10:49.468
that we are able to avoid
the delicate organs,

00:10:49.492 --> 00:10:54.545
and yet still achieve the coverage
of the tumors with the radiation.

00:10:55.313 --> 00:10:58.787
So now, we're working with doctors at UCSF

00:10:58.811 --> 00:11:01.078
and engineers at Johns Hopkins,
