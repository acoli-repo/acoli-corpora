00:09:28.422 --> 00:09:32.351
And so that project taught me
another lesson about life,

00:09:32.375 --> 00:09:36.022
which is that, when in doubt, improvise.

00:09:36.046 --> 00:09:37.712
(Laughter)

00:09:38.664 --> 00:09:43.583
Now, the third project
grew out of my experience

00:09:43.607 --> 00:09:45.456
when my father was in the hospital.

00:09:47.284 --> 00:09:50.637
He was undergoing a treatment --
chemotherapy treatments --

00:09:50.661 --> 00:09:54.931
and there's a related treatment
called brachytherapy,

00:09:54.955 --> 00:09:58.743
where tiny, radioactive seeds
are placed into the body

00:09:58.767 --> 00:10:00.501
to treat cancerous tumors.
