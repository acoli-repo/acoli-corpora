00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:01.425
and we knew it was,
because we were working with it.

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:02.847
But I knew what he meant,

00:05:02.871 --> 00:05:04.313
because it would be possible

00:05:04.337 --> 00:05:07.122
to take a bunch of pictures
of flowers in a garden

00:05:07.146 --> 00:05:10.785
and then, basically, index them
in a computer system,

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:13.436

This was right about the time

00:05:24.774 --> 00:05:26.419
And when I got here,

00:05:26.443 --> 00:05:28.805
I looked up Hubert Dreyfus,

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:31.756
who's a world-renowned
professor of philosophy,
