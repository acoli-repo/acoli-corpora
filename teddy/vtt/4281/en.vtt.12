We invited leading artists,
engineers and philosophers

00:06:03.818 --> 00:06:05.137
to write essays about this,

00:06:05.161 --> 00:06:08.865
and the results are collected
in this book from MIT Press.

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:12.055
So thanks to this student,

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:15.398
who questioned what everyone else
had assumed to be true,

00:06:15.422 --> 00:06:19.399
this project taught me
an important lesson about life,

00:06:19.423 --> 00:06:22.410
which is to always question assumptions.

00:06:23.807 --> 00:06:25.983

00:06:28.023 --> 00:06:30.844
As it was operating, my students
and I were very interested
