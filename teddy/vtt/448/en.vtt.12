(Applause)

00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.559
Now, for lesson number two:

00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:08.458
start with who you know.

00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:12.018
Oftentimes, it could be quite exciting,

00:06:12.042 --> 00:06:14.101
especially if you're
an expert in something

00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:15.518
and you want to have impact,

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:18.934
to swoop into a community
and think you have the magic recipe.

00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.351
But very early on I learned

00:06:21.375 --> 00:06:25.601
that, as esteemed philosopher
Kendrick Lamar once said,

00:06:25.625 --> 00:06:29.167
it's really important
to be humble and to sit down.
