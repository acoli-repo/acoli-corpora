00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.768
and I started teaching 13 young women
in that community center basement

00:05:02.792 --> 00:05:04.101
self-defense.

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:06.226
And with every single self-defense move,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.643
for eight sessions
over the course of that summer,

00:05:08.667 --> 00:05:11.393
we began to understand
the power of our bodies,

00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:14.018
and we began to share our experiences

00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:15.393
about our identities.

00:05:15.417 --> 00:05:18.934
And sometimes there were
shocking realizations,

00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:20.643
and other times there were tears,

00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:22.434
but mostly it was laughs.

00:05:22.458 --> 00:05:25.851
And I ended that summer
with this incredible sisterhood,

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:29.059
and I began to feel
much safer in my own skin.

00:05:29.083 --> 00:05:31.976
And it was because of these women
that we just kept teaching.
