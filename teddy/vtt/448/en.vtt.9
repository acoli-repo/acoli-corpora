00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:30.518
spoke to community leaders,
to parents, to young women,

00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:34.893
and finally was able to secure
a free community center basement

00:04:34.917 --> 00:04:38.059
and convince enough young women
that they should come to my class.

00:04:38.083 --> 00:04:40.559
And it actually all worked out,

00:04:40.583 --> 00:04:42.809
because when I pitched the idea,

00:04:42.833 --> 00:04:44.768
most of the responses were, like,

00:04:44.792 --> 00:04:46.226
"All right, cute,

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.559
this 5'1" hijabi girl who knows karate.

00:04:49.583 --> 00:04:51.184
How nice."

00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:56.059
But in reality, I became the Queens,
New York version of Mr. Miyagi

00:04:56.083 --> 00:04:57.726
at 16 years old,

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.768
and I started teaching 13 young women
in that community center basement
