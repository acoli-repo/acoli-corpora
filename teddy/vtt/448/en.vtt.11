00:05:29.083 --> 00:05:31.976
And it was because of these women
that we just kept teaching.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.101
I never thought that I would continue,
but we just kept teaching.

00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:37.726
And today, nine years, 17 cities,

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.476
12 countries, 760 courses

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.518
and thousands of women and girls later,

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:45.018
I'm still teaching.

00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:47.309
And what started as a self-defense course

00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:49.518
in the basement of a community center

00:05:49.542 --> 00:05:52.684
is now an international
grassroots organization

00:05:52.708 --> 00:05:56.559
focused on building safety and power
for women around the world:

00:05:56.583 --> 00:05:57.851
Malikah.

00:05:57.875 --> 00:06:03.934
