00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:32.058
the feeling, an overwhelming
feeling of insecurity,

00:08:32.082 --> 00:08:34.476
is oftentimes with us constantly.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.808
I mean, imagine this:

00:08:35.832 --> 00:08:39.167
walking home late at night,
hearing footsteps behind you.

00:08:40.042 --> 00:08:43.683
You wonder if you should walk faster
or if you should slow down.

00:08:43.707 --> 00:08:46.809
You keep your keys in your hand
in case you need to use them.

00:08:46.833 --> 00:08:50.768
You say, "Text me when you get home.
I want to make sure you are safe."

00:08:50.792 --> 00:08:52.476
And we mean those words.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.684
We're afraid to put down our drinks.

00:08:54.708 --> 00:08:58.393
We're afraid to speak
too much or too little in a meeting.

00:08:58.417 --> 00:09:02.809
And imagine being woman and black
and trans and queer and Latinx
