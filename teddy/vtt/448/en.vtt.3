00:01:29.917 --> 00:01:31.768
And these women are the reason why,

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:34.893
regardless of these statements
that my mom faced,

00:01:34.917 --> 00:01:37.476
she remained unapologetic.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.101
And these women were
some of the most powerful women

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:42.768
I have ever met in my entire life.

00:01:42.792 --> 00:01:45.851
I mean, they had networks for everything.

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:48.809
They had rotations
for who watched whose kids when,

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:50.643
for saving extra cash,

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:52.601
for throwing belly dance parties

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:55.393
and memorizing Koran and learning English.

00:01:55.417 --> 00:01:58.184
And they would collect small gold tokens

00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:00.208
to fundraise for the local mosque.
