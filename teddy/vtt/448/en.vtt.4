00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:00.208
to fundraise for the local mosque.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.726
And it was these same women,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.893
when I decided to wear my hijab,

00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:06.809
who supported me through it.

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:09.226
And when I was bullied for being Muslim,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.476
I always felt like I had an army
of unapologetic North African aunties

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.750
who had my back.

00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:18.518
And so every morning at 15,

00:02:18.542 --> 00:02:21.184
I would wake up
and stand in front of a mirror,

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:23.976
and wrap beautiful
bright silk around my head

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.018
the way my mother does
and my grandmother did.

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:29.643
And one day that summer 2009,

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:31.934
I stepped out into
the streets of New York City
