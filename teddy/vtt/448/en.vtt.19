00:09:29.042 --> 00:09:30.726
day in and day out.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.726
So whether I was in
a refugee camp in Jordan

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.184
or a community center in Dallas, Texas

00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:38.684
or a corporate office in Silicon Valley,

00:09:38.708 --> 00:09:41.768
women gathered in beautifully magical ways

00:09:41.792 --> 00:09:44.059
and they built together
and supported each other

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:45.726
in ways that shifted culture

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.226
to empower and build safety for women.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.226
And that is how the change happens.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.934
It was through those relationships
we built together.

00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.059
That's why we don't
just teach self-defense,

00:09:55.083 --> 00:09:56.768
but we also throw dance parties

00:09:56.792 --> 00:09:58.101
and host potlucks

00:09:58.125 --> 00:10:00.476
and write love notes to each other
