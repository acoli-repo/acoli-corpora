So my story starts on July 4, 1992,

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:08.101
the day my mother followed
her college sweetheart

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:10.184
to New York City from Egypt.

00:00:10.208 --> 00:00:13.018
As fireworks exploded behind the skyline,

00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:16.143
my father looked
at my mother jokingly and said,

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:17.476
"Look, habibti,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.875
Americans are celebrating your arrival."

00:00:19.944 --> 00:00:21.624
(Laughter)

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:25.309
Unfortunately, it didn't feel
much like a celebration

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:29.143
when, growing up, my mother and I
would wander past Queens

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:30.934
into New York City streets,
