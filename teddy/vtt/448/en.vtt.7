00:03:26.417 --> 00:03:30.184
given the visibility
of Muslim women in our hijabs.

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:32.018
And so I was not alone,

00:03:32.042 --> 00:03:33.851
and that horrified me.

00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:35.518
It made me want to do something.

00:03:35.542 --> 00:03:38.934
It made me want to go out there
and make sure that no one I loved,

00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.167
that no woman would have to feel
this insecure in her own skin.

00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:47.226
So I started to think about
how the women in my own neighborhood

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.851
were able to build
community for themselves,

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:53.476
and how they were able to use
the very little resources they had

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.893
to actually offer something.

00:03:54.917 --> 00:03:57.601
And I began to think
about what I could potentially offer

00:03:57.625 --> 00:04:00.184
to build safety and power for women.
