So like my mother
and the women in her neighborhood,

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.893
they had these really strong
social networks,

00:07:03.917 --> 00:07:06.059
and it was about providing capacity

00:07:06.083 --> 00:07:09.476
and believing in other women's
definition of safety.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.643
Even though I was
a self-defense instructor,

00:07:11.667 --> 00:07:13.518
I couldn't come into a community

00:07:13.542 --> 00:07:15.809
and define safety for any other woman

00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:17.792
who was not part of my own community.

00:07:19.042 --> 00:07:21.559
And it was because,
as our network expanded,

00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:24.309
I learned that self-defense
is not just physical.

00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:26.434
It's actually really emotional work.

00:07:26.458 --> 00:07:30.018
I mean, we would do
a 60-minute self-defense class,
