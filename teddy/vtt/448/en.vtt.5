00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:31.934
I stepped out into
the streets of New York City

00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:35.351
on my way to volunteer
at a domestic violence organization

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:37.809
that a woman in
my neighborhood had started.

00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:41.851
And I remember at that moment
I felt a yank at the back of my head.

00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:43.768
Then someone pulled and grabbed me,

00:02:43.792 --> 00:02:46.809
trying to remove my hijab
from off of my head.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.976
I turned around
to a tall, broad-shouldered man,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.750
pure hate in his eyes.

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:54.351
I struggled and fought back,

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:56.809
and finally was able to get away,

00:02:56.833 --> 00:03:00.750
hid myself in the bathroom
of that organization and cried and cried.
