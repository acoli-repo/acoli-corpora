00:06:30.083 --> 00:06:32.976
So, basically, at 15 years old,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.559
the only community that I had
any business doing work with

00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:39.101
were the 14-year-old girls
in my neighborhood,

00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:41.226
and that's because
I was friends with them.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.018
Other than that, I didn't know
what it meant to be a child

00:06:44.042 --> 00:06:46.184
of Bengali immigrants in Brooklyn

00:06:46.208 --> 00:06:48.226
or to be Senegalese in the Bronx.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.726
But I did know young women
who were connected to those communities,

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.643
and it was quite remarkable
how they already had

00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:58.476
these layers of trust and awareness
and relationship with their communities.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.226
So like my mother
and the women in her neighborhood,
