00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For the last 10 years, I've been spending my time trying to figure out

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
how and why human beings

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
assemble themselves into social networks.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And the kind of social network I'm talking about

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is not the recent online variety,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but rather, the kind of social networks

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
ever since we emerged from the African savannah.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, I form friendships and co-worker

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and sibling and relative relationships with other people

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
who in turn have similar relationships with other people.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And this spreads on out endlessly into a distance.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And you get a network that looks like this.
