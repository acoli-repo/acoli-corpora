00:00:58.509 --> 00:01:00.872
using the same structures that
they use to run, their legs.

00:01:00.872 --> 00:01:02.476
They can run upside down

00:01:02.476 --> 00:01:05.608
very rapidly on rods, branches and wires,

00:01:05.608 --> 00:01:07.087
and if you perturb one of those branches,

00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:08.880
they can do this.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.410
They can perform gymnastic maneuvers

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.988
like no robot we have yet.

00:01:12.988 --> 00:01:14.719
And they have nearly unlimited

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.316
maneuverability with that same structure

00:01:17.316 --> 00:01:21.136
and unprecedented access to a variety

00:01:21.136 --> 00:01:25.406
of different areas.

00:01:25.406 --> 00:01:28.029
They have wings for flying when they get warm,

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:30.643
but they use those same wings to flip over
