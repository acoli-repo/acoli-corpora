00:03:59.877 --> 00:04:02.238
the height of two pennies, two stacked pennies,

00:04:02.238 --> 00:04:03.286
and when they do this,

00:04:03.286 --> 00:04:05.861
they can actually run through those confined spaces

00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:07.618
at high speeds,

00:04:07.618 --> 00:04:10.800
although you never see it.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.862
To understand it better,

00:04:11.862 --> 00:04:13.940
we did a CT scan of the exoskeleton

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.414
and showed that they can compress their body

00:04:15.414 --> 00:04:18.060
by over 40 percent.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.617
We put them in a materials testing machine

00:04:19.617 --> 00:04:21.973
to look at the stress strain analysis

00:04:21.973 --> 00:04:24.091
and showed that they can withstand forces

00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:25.995
800 times their body weight,

00:04:25.995 --> 00:04:27.885
and after this they can fly and run

00:04:27.885 --> 00:04:29.875
absolutely normally.

00:04:29.875 --> 00:04:31.598
So you never know where
