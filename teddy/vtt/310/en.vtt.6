00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.766
My engineering colleague at Berkeley

00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:01.890
designed with his students

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.371
a novel manufacturing technique

00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:06.982
where you essentially origami the exoskeleton,

00:03:06.982 --> 00:03:08.342
you laser cut it, laminate it,

00:03:08.342 --> 00:03:10.737
and you fold it up into a robot.

00:03:10.737 --> 00:03:16.554
And you can do that now in less than 15 minutes.

00:03:16.554 --> 00:03:18.493
These robots, called DASH,

00:03:18.493 --> 00:03:21.103
for Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod,

00:03:21.103 --> 00:03:24.185
are highly compliant robots,

00:03:24.185 --> 00:03:27.887
and they're remarkably robust as a result

00:03:27.887 --> 00:03:29.690
of these features.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.748
They're certainly incredibly damage resistant.
