They're certainly incredibly damage resistant.

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:39.101
(Laughter)

00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:41.570
They even have some of the
behaviors of the cockroaches.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.843
So they can use their smart, compliant body

00:03:43.843 --> 00:03:46.360
to transition up a wall

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.252
in a very simple way.

00:03:49.252 --> 00:03:50.880
They even have some of the beginnings

of the rapid inversion behavior

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.043
where they disappear.

00:03:55.043 --> 00:03:56.520
Now we want to know why they can go anywhere.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.089
We discovered that they can go through

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:59.877
three-millimeter gaps,

00:03:59.877 --> 00:04:02.238
the height of two pennies, two stacked pennies,
