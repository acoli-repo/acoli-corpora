00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:30.643
but they use those same wings to flip over

00:01:30.643 --> 00:01:34.600
if they get destabilized.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.897
Very effective.

00:01:35.897 --> 00:01:39.102
Robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail-safe.

00:01:39.102 --> 00:01:40.242
This is the foot of a cockroach.

00:01:40.242 --> 00:01:43.531
It has spines, gluey pads and claws,

00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:45.122
but if you take off those feet,

00:01:45.122 --> 00:01:46.830
they can still go over rough terrain,

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.727
like the bottom video that you see,

00:01:48.727 --> 00:01:52.098
without hardly slowing down. Extraordinary.

00:01:52.098 --> 00:01:55.271
They can run up mesh without their feet.

00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:57.554
Here's an animal using a normal, alternating tripod:

00:01:57.554 --> 00:01:59.097
three legs, three legs, three legs,

00:01:59.097 --> 00:02:02.789
but in nature, the insects often have lost their legs.
