00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.834
Even nature's most disgusting creatures

00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:06.401
have important secrets,

00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:07.890
but who would want a swarm of cockroaches

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.484
coming towards them?

00:00:09.484 --> 00:00:12.496
Yet one of the greatest differences
between natural and human technologies

00:00:12.496 --> 00:00:14.711
relates to robustness.

00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:17.284
Robust systems are stable in complex

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:19.005
and new environments.

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:20.800
Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.479
running over rough terrain.

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:23.741
When we put a jet pack on them,

00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:25.752
or give them a perturbation like an earthquake,

00:00:25.752 --> 00:00:28.643
we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs

00:00:28.643 --> 00:00:30.268
allow them to self-stabilize
