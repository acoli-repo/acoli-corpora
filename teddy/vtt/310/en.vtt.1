00:00:28.643 --> 00:00:30.268
allow them to self-stabilize

00:00:30.268 --> 00:00:33.930
without using any of their brainpower.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.060
They can go over complex terrain like grass,

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.012
no problem, and not get destabilized.

00:00:39.012 --> 00:00:40.526
We discovered a new behavior where,

00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:41.690
because of their shape,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.768
they actually roll automatically to their side

00:00:43.768 --> 00:00:47.720
to go through this artificial test bit of grass.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.157
Robust systems can perform multiple tasks

00:00:50.157 --> 00:00:52.295
with the same structure.

00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:54.162
Here's a new behavior we've discovered.

00:00:54.162 --> 00:00:56.008
The animals rapidly invert and disappear

00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:58.509
in less than 150 milliseconds — you never see them —

00:00:58.509 --> 00:01:00.872
using the same structures that
they use to run, their legs.
