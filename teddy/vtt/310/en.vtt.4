00:01:59.097 --> 00:02:02.789
but in nature, the insects often have lost their legs.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.799
Here's one moving with two middle legs gone.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.715
It can even lose three legs, in a tripod,

00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:13.642
and adopt a new gait, a hopping gait.

00:02:13.642 --> 00:02:15.600
And I point out that all of these videos

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.304
are slowed down 20 times,

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:19.319
so they're actually really fast, when you see this.

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.830
Robust systems are also damage resistant.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.643
Here's an animal climbing up a wall.

00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:27.139
It looks like a rapid, smooth, vertical climb,

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:28.378
but when you slow it down,

00:02:28.378 --> 00:02:30.872
you see something very different.
