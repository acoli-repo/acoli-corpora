00:02:28.378 --> 00:02:30.872
you see something very different.

00:02:30.872 --> 00:02:32.520
Here's what they do.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.527
They intentionally have a
head-on collision with the wall

00:02:35.527 --> 00:02:37.641
so they don't slow down and can transition up it

00:02:37.641 --> 00:02:40.039
in 75 milliseconds.

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:41.900
And they can do this in part because they have

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.957
extraordinary exoskeletons.

00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:47.766
And they're really just made up of compliant joints

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:49.499
that are tubes and plates

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:51.042
connected to one another.

00:02:51.042 --> 00:02:53.989
Here's a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach.

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.950
You see these plates, and you
see the compliant membrane.
