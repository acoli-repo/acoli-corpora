Democracy.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.296
In the West,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.256
we make a colossal mistake
taking it for granted.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.576
We see democracy

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.096
not as the most fragile
of flowers that it really is,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.960
but we see it as part
of our society's furniture.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.960
We tend to think of it
as an intransigent given.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.896
We mistakenly believe that capitalism
begets inevitably democracy.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.256
It doesn't.
