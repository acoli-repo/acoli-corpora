Or shall we descend
into a Matrix-like dystopia?

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.040

that we shall be making collectively.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.336
It is our choice,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.680
and we'd better make it democratically.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.536
Thank you.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.920

Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:56.320

in your bios as a libertarian Marxist.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.920
What is the relevance
of Marx's analysis today?
