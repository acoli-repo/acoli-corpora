00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.296
in the United States,
in Britain and in the Eurozone,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.736
we have invested, collectively,
3.4 trillion dollars

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.416
on all the wealth-producing goods --

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.456
things like industrial plants, machinery,

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.696
office blocks, schools,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.856
roads, railways, machinery,
and so on and so forth.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.616
$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.496
until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.216
that has been slushing around
in the same countries,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.056
in our financial institutions,

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.280
doing absolutely nothing
during the same period
