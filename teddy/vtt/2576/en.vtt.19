we need to reunite the economic
and the political spheres,

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:38.216
but we'd better do it
by democratizing the reunified sphere,

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.936
lest we end up with
a surveillance-mad hyperautocracy

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.976
that makes The Matrix, the movie,
look like a documentary.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.576
(Laughter)

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.016
So the question is not
whether capitalism will survive

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.360
the technological innovations
it is spawning.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.576
The more interesting question

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:03.336
is whether capitalism will be succeeded
by something resembling a Matrix dystopia
