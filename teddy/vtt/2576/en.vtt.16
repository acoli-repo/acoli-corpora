00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.760
and CEOs of corporations are too scared
to invest the cash of their corporations.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:08.176
So the more capitalism succeeds
in taking the demos out of democracy,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.536
the taller the twin peaks

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.096
and the greater the waste
of human resources

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.560
and humanity's wealth.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.496
Clearly, if this is right,

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.576
we must reunite the political
and economic spheres

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:25.096
and better do it
with a demos being in control,

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.056
like in ancient Athens
except without the slaves

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.040
or the exclusion of women and migrants.
