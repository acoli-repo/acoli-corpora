00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.816
so as to confine the democratic process
fully in the political sphere,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.696
leaving the economic sphere --

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.656
the corporate world, if you want --

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.360
as a democracy-free zone.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.696
Now, in our democracies today,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.216
this separation of the economic
from the political sphere,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.496
the moment it started happening,

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.816
it gave rise to an inexorable,
epic struggle between the two,

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.056
with the economic sphere
colonizing the political sphere,

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.600
eating into its power.
