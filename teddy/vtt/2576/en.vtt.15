the economic sphere has been colonizing
and cannibalizing the political sphere

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.056
to such an extent
that it is undermining itself,

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.816
causing economic crisis.

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.936

aggregate demand is falling

00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:00.760
and CEOs of corporations are too scared
to invest the cash of their corporations.
