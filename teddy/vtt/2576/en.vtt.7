doing absolutely nothing
during the same period

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.296
except inflating stock exchanges
and bidding up house prices.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.576
So a mountain of debt
and a mountain of idle cash

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.296
form twin peaks, 
failing to cancel each other out

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.136
through the normal
operation of the markets.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.480
The result is stagnant wages,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.016
more than a quarter of 25- to 54-year-olds
in America, in Japan and in Europe

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.536
out of work.
