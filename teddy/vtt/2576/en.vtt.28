00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.920
What is the relevance
of Marx's analysis today?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.336
Yanis Varoufakis: Well, if there was
any relevance in what I just said,

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.576
then Marx is relevant.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.096
Because the whole point of reunifying
the political and economic is --

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.336
if we don't do it,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.616
then technological innovation
is going to create

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.936
such a massive fall in aggregate demand,

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.736
what Larry Summers
refers to as secular stagnation.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.616
With this crisis migrating
from one part of the world,

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.176
as it is now,

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.896
it will destabilize
not only our democracies,

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.136
but even the emerging world that is not
that keen on liberal democracy.
