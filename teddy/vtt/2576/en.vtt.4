00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.216
our societies will be nastier,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.376
our future bleak

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.216
and our great, new technologies wasted.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.496
Speaking of waste,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.295
allow me to point out
an interesting paradox

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.096
that is threatening
our economies as we speak.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.416
I call it the twin peaks paradox.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.736
One peak you understand --

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.376
you know it, you recognize it --

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.456
is the mountain of debts
that has been casting a long shadow

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.296
over the United States,
Europe, the whole world.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.200
We all recognize the mountain of debts.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.000
But few people discern its twin.
