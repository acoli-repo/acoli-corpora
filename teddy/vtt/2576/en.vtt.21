00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.696
But what would it take,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.696
what would it look like

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.600
to have this Star Trek-like utopia,
instead of the Matrix-like dystopia?

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.496
In practical terms,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.256
allow me to share just briefly,

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.480
a couple of examples.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.856
At the level of the enterprise,

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.216
imagine a capital market,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.920
where you earn capital as you work,

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.216
and where your capital follows you
from one job to another,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.736
from one company to another,

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.016
and the company --

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.496
whichever one you happen
to work at at that time --
