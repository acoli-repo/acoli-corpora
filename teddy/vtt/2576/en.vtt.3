00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.896
Tonight, here, I want to present to you

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.080
an economic case
for an authentic democracy.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.456
I want to ask you
to join me in believing again

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.480
that Lee Kuan Yew,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.856
the Chinese Communist Party

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.256
and indeed the Eurogroup

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.920
are wrong in believing
that we can dispense with democracy --

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.336
that we need an authentic,
boisterous democracy.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.336
And without democracy,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.216
our societies will be nastier,
