00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
as an educational tool,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I take off from Wisconsin

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and move to Kansas, small town Kansas,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
where I had an opportunity to teach

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
in a lovely, small-town,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
rural Kansas school district,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
where I was teaching my favorite subject,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
American government.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
My first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
loved the political system.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Kids in the 12th grade:

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
not exactly all that enthusiastic

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
about the American government system.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Year two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And I put in front of them an authentic experience
