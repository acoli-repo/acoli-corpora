00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and the school district of Philadelphia.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
We are a nine through 12 public school,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
but we do school quite differently.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I moved there primarily

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
to be part of a learning environment

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that validated the way that I knew that kids learned,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and that really wanted to investigate

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
what was possible

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
when you are willing to let go

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
of some of the paradigms of the past,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and when my father was in school and even when I was in school,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and to a moment when we have information surplus.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So what do you do when the information is all around you?
