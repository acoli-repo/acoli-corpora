00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
We deal right now in the educational landscape

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
with an infatuation

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
with the culture of one right answer

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and I am here to share with you:

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
it is not learning.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
That is the absolute wrong thing to ask,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
to tell kids to never be wrong.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
To ask them to always have the right answer

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
doesn't allow them to learn.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
So we did this project,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and this is one of the artifacts of the project.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I almost never show them off

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
because of the issue of the idea of failure.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
My students produced these info-graphics
