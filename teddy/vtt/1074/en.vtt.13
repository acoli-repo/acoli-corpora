00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
because of the issue of the idea of failure.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
My students produced these info-graphics

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
responding to the oil spill.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
of the info-graphics that existed

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
in a lot of mass media,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and take a look at what were the interesting components of it,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and produce one for themselves

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
of a different man-made disaster from American history.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And they had certain criteria to do it.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
They were a little uncomfortable with it,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
They can talk -- they're very smooth,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and they can write very, very well,
