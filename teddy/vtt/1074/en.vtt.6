It meant something to them.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And they will step up.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
this time with middle school students.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Again, "thrilled" to learn.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
But what was interesting

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
about this position I found myself in in Arizona,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
was I had this really

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
in a truly public school,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities.
