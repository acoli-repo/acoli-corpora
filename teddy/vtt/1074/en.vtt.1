00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because that's how you learned.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Fast-forward a generation:

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And he again had to travel to the school

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to get the information from the teacher,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and take it with him,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
because that is how information was being transported

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
from teacher to student and then used in the world.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
When I was a kid,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we had a set of encyclopedias at my house.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It was purchased the year I was born,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and it was extraordinary,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.
