00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Didn't read anything. "There it is."

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And I said, "Well what makes it great?"

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And there's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And I said, "Go read it."

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome."

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And then we went to another one --

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information --

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and spent an hour talking about the learning process,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
or whether or not it was what I could create.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
It asked them to create for themselves,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and it allowed them to fail,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
process, learn from.
