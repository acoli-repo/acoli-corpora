00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I have been teaching for a long time,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and in doing so

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that I really wish more people would understand

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
about the potential of students.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In 1931, my grandmother --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
bottom left for you guys over here --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
graduated from the eighth grade.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
She went to school to get the information

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because that's where the information lived.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head;

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and she needed to go there to get the information,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because that's how you learned.
