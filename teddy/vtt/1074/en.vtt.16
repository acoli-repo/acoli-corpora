process, learn from.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And when we do another round of this in my class this year,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
they will do better this time,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
has to include an amount of failure,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000

of what learning can look like

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
in a landscape where we let go of the idea

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that kids have to come to school to get the information,
