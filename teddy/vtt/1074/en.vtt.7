00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
in a truly public school,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And one opportunity

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
which is the gentleman

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
that the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
The problem then becomes

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and deal with the subject in a way

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that is responsible and respectful,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and they know what to do with it.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina
