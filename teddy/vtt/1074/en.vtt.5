00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and really had this robust experiential learning.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The older teachers -- more experienced --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
looked at me and went,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
"Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done."

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
(Laughter)

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
"She doesn't know what she's in for."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
But I knew that the kids would show up,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and I believed it,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and I told them every week what I expected out of them.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And that night, all 90 kids --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I had to just sit and watch.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It meant something to them.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And they will step up.
