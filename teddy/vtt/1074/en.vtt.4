00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And I put in front of them an authentic experience

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that allowed them to learn for themselves.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I posed a problem in front of them,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
which was to put on an election forum for their own community.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
They produced flyers. They called offices.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
They produced an election forum booklet

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
for the entire town to learn more about their candidates.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
They invited everyone into the school

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
for an evening of conversation

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
about government and politics

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and whether or not the streets were done well,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and really had this robust experiential learning.
