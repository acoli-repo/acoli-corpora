00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and they can write very, very well,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
was a little uncomfortable for them.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
But I gave them the room to just do the thing.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Go create. Go figure it out.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Let's see what we can do.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And the student that persistently

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
turns out the best visual product did not disappoint.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
This was done in like two or three days.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?"

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And they immediately went, "There it is."

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Didn't read anything. "There it is."
