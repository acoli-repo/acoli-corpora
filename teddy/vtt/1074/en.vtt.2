00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and it was extraordinary,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The information was inside my house

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and it was awesome.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This was different

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
than either generation had experienced before,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and it changed the way I interacted with information

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
even at just a small level.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
But the information was closer to me.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I could get access to it.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
In the time that passes

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
between when I was a kid in high school

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and when I started teaching,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
we really see the advent of the Internet.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Right about the time that the Internet gets going

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
as an educational tool,
