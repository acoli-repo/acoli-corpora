00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and ask them to speak for themselves,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
what they're willing to share.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000

The things that kids will say

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000

which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and the school district of Philadelphia.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
