00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that kids have to come to school to get the information,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
but instead, ask them what they can do with it.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Ask them really interesting questions.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
They will not disappoint.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Ask them to go to places,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
to see things for themselves,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
to actually experience the learning,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
to play, to inquire.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
This is one of my favorite photos,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
because this was taken on Tuesday,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
when I asked the students to go to the polls.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
But this is learning too,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
because we asked them to go out into real spaces.
