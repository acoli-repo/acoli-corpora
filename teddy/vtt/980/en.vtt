00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm a contemporary artist

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
with a bit of an unexpected background.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I was in my 20s before I ever went to an art museum.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And I think it was a great place to grow up as an artist

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
because I grew up around quirky, colorful characters

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
who were great at making with their hands.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And my childhood is more hick

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
than I could ever possibly relate to you,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and also more intellectual than you would ever expect.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
For instance, me and my sister, when we were little,
