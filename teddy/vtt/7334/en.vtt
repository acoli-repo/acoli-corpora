When we're seven, getting older
and turning eight sounds great.

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:08.171
Then once we're in our teens,

00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:12.091
the very idea of getting older
and being 16 is amazing.

00:00:12.967 --> 00:00:15.344
But show me one single person

00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:20.641
who wakes up on their 50th birthday
and says, "Wow, I can't wait till I'm 70."

00:00:21.768 --> 00:00:23.895
"Getting old is not for sissies."

00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:27.899
That's what my 90-year-old
mother-in-law says when she's cross

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:32.028
because something, physically or mentally,
just isn't working the way it should,
