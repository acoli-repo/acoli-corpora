Soon after that,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.416
I could see how Nairobi
was beginning to change,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.376
and it was beginning to feel
more like the fear and terror-weary

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.920
and war-torn cities that I had worked in.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.560
And Nairobi continues to grow
in fear-driven ways.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.856
We see more walls, more barriers,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.120
more security.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.656
And like other parts of the world,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.840
we are experiencing
an erosion of human connection.
