Colour in Faith is literally highlighting
those who mean well in yellow.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.536
Colour in Faith is binding
neighborhoods together,

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.056
and it's our hope
that when threats come knocking,

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.456
they will collectively
sift fact from rumor

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.160
and stand in solidarity.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.976
We've proven that the human family
can come together and send a message

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.376
far brighter and more powerful

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.240
than the voices of those
that wish to do us harm.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.016
Though fear is infectious,

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.240
we are showing that so is hope.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.096
Thank you.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:34.240
