And the group articulated
our challenge as threefold:

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.936
one, to reclaim the city
from the narrative of terrorism

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.176
and back into the hands
of the people that live there;

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.256
two, introduce a language
beyond race, tribe or religion

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.656
that would help us
transcend our differences;

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.216
and three, provide a gesture
that would help restore empathy

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.600
and conversation and trust.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.496
One of the people in this group
was an artist and architect,
