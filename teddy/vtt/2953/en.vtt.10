00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.680
And neighbors, by picking up
a paintbrush with other neighbors,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.736
would engage not just with their heads

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.080
but with their hands
and with their hearts.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.456
And the painted buildings would become
sculptures in the landscape

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.136
that speak of people
from very different backgrounds

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.360
that stand together.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.520
We'd call the project "Colour in Faith."

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.456
We loved the idea and we immediately
began approaching houses of worship:

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.256
churches, temples, mosques, synagogues.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.936
Door to door, we went
to more than 60 rabbis,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.480
imams, pastors and priests.
