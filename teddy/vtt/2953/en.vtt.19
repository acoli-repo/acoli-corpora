00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.456
we had accomplished so much
of the conversation and connection

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.720
that we had hoped for.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.280
And then we began to paint.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.056
Muslims stood by Christians

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.296
and atheists and agnostics and Hindus

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.360
and painted a mosque yellow.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.800
And then they all came together again
and painted a church yellow,

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.216
and then another mosque,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.480
and then another church.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.440
Poets and musicians
performed while we painted.
