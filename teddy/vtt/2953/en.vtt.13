00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.776
And so we would keep going back

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.976
and telling them that we appreciate them,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.816
and of course,

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.880
if we didn't appreciate them,
we wouldn't be here.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.576
And then we learned
painfully late in the game

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.160
that the word "appreciation"
is code for getting paid to participate.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.440
And so we challenged them

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.416
and we asked the question,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.680
"So what will it cost?

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.240
How much could we pay you?

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.480
And if we pay for your faith,
is it really faith?"
