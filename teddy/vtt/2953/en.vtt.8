Yazmany Arboleda.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.816
He and I have collaborated
in other parts of the world

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.416
over many years.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.976
He has a history

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.536
of disrupting urban environments

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.216
and making strangers connect

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.400
in incredible, beautiful
and spectacular ways.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.616
He had an idea.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.776
The idea was to unite people
of different faiths

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.976
by getting them to paint
each other's houses of worship,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.696
mosques, temples, synagogues, churches,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.656
paint them yellow
