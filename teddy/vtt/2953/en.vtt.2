As a fourth-generation
Kenyan Muslim of Indian origin,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.976
it bothered me that in four generations,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.056
there wasn't a single
marriage in my family

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.200
outside of my small religious community.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.560
And I wondered what that was about.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.376
Was it fear?

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.720
Was it racism?

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.800
Was it cultural preservation?

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.856
Did it have something
to do with colonialism?

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.120
Certainly, we didn't share a lot
of the same public spaces with others.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.240
These divisions bothered me deeply,
and they drove my career choices.
