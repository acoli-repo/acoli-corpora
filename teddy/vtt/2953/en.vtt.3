These divisions bothered me deeply,
and they drove my career choices.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.440
When I was 20, the US embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.336
A year later, I was on my way
to the Middle East

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.840
to study conflict resolution.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.256
And then from that point on,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.816
it wasn't very hard for me
to find insecure environments to work in,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.696
because the world was quickly shifting

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.040
in what we now know
as the time of terrorism.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.176
I was in Washington, DC
when 9/11 happened,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.656
and then I moved back home
to Kenya to work with refugees
