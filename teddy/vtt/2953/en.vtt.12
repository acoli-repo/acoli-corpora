00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.416
We're still waiting to hear back.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.296
(Laughter)

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.376
And with other houses of worship,

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.576
we were told that the patrons,
the people that pay for the building

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.136
and the construction
and the painting of the buildings

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.600
would have to make a decision.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.456
And then we came head-to-head

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.176
with the long legacy
of missionary and donor dependence

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.496
that so impedes
unconditional civic action,

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.416
and we learned this the hard way.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.016
There was one community

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.376
that in our repeated conversations
would keep asking us

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.000
to appreciate them.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.776
And so we would keep going back
