And for some, it was to bridge the gap

many faiths are grappling with right now.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:12.016
And for some it was simply
to build neighborhood solidarity

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.240
in advance of feared election violence.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.416

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.936

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.480
It does not discriminate."

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.176
He and others spread the word
through their congregations
