00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.656
and then I moved back home
to Kenya to work with refugees

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.816
and then later worked in Pakistan

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.320
and in Afghanistan.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.776
In all of these places, what I noticed

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.336
was how important physical spaces are

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.736
to making us feel safe

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.056
and well

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.280
and like we belong.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.280
In 2013, I came back home
to Nairobi from Afghanistan.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.776
Al-Shabaab operatives
had besieged Westgate shopping center,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.800
killing 67 people
in a day of utter horror.
