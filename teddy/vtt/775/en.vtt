00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm standing in front of you today

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
in all humility,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
wanting to share with you

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
my journey of the last six years

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
in the field of service

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and education.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And I'm not a trained academic.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Neither am I a veteran social worker.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I was 26 years in the corporate world,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
trying to make organizations profitable.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And then in 2003

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I started Parikrma Humanity Foundation
