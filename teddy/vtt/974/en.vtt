There is nothing bigger
or older than the universe.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.428
The questions
I would like to talk about are:

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.738
one, where did we come from?

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:20.253
How did the universe come into being?

00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:23.976
Are we alone in the universe?

00:00:24.993 --> 00:00:27.144
Is there alien life out there?

00:00:28.136 --> 00:00:30.613
What is the future of the human race?
