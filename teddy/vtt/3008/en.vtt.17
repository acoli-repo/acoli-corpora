What we do is we build bridges for them.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.696
We go into the prisons, train them,

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.775
give them skills, tools and support

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:40.216
to enable them to be able
to change their mindsets,

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.559
their behaviors and their attitudes.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.816
We also build bridges into the prisons

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.816

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.416

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.496
