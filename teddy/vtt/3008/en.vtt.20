00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.616
whom I have met within the prisons,

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.176
some of whom are now
embracing their second chances,

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.440
and others who are still
on that bridge of life's journey.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.280
I embody a line

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.880
from the great Maya Angelou.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.576
"I come as one,

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.480
but I stand as 10,000."

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.200
(Applause)
