Developer Majora Carter once said to me,

00:07:03.087 --> 00:07:05.509
"Poor people don't hate gentrification.

00:07:05.533 --> 00:07:08.817
They just hate that they rarely get
to hang around long enough

00:07:08.841 --> 00:07:10.107
to enjoy its benefits."

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:17.277
Why is it that we treat culture erasure
and economic displacement as inevitable?

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.377
We could approach development

00:07:20.401 --> 00:07:23.019
with an acknowledgment
of past injustices --

00:07:23.043 --> 00:07:25.006
find value not only in those new stories

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.180
but the old ones, too.

00:07:27.145 --> 00:07:30.391
And make a commitment to build
people's capacity to stay --
