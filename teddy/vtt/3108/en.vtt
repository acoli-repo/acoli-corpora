00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.060
I grew up in a family
of social scientists,

00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.535
but I was the weird child who drew.

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:09.354
(Laughter)

00:00:09.796 --> 00:00:13.701
From making sketches of the models
in my mom's Sears catalog ...

00:00:15.187 --> 00:00:17.963
to a bedroom so full of my craft projects

00:00:17.987 --> 00:00:20.203
that it was like my own
personal art gallery,

00:00:21.164 --> 00:00:22.973
I lived to make.

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:28.652
I don't think anyone in my family
was surprised when I became an architect.

00:00:29.844 --> 00:00:32.129
But to be honest with you,
