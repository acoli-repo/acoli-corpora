00:12:59.969 --> 00:13:02.186
For those of us with privilege,

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:05.833
we have to have a reckoning
with our own guilt,

00:13:05.857 --> 00:13:08.319
discomfort and complicity.

00:13:09.574 --> 00:13:12.074
As non-profit leader
Anne Marks once observed,

00:13:12.098 --> 00:13:14.301
"Hurt people hurt people;

00:13:14.325 --> 00:13:16.669
healed people heal people."

00:13:18.424 --> 00:13:19.574
And third --

00:13:20.611 --> 00:13:22.802
healing is not about the erasure of pain.

00:13:23.822 --> 00:13:27.292
We often have a tendency to want
to put a clean slate over our pain,

00:13:27.316 --> 00:13:30.194
much like that asphalt on the soil
in Bayview Hunters Point.
