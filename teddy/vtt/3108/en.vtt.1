00:00:29.844 --> 00:00:32.129
But to be honest with you,

00:00:32.153 --> 00:00:34.607
the real foundation
of the architect I became

00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:37.283
was not laid in that bedroom art gallery

00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:40.346
but by the conversations
around my family's dinner table.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.927
There were stories of how people
lived and connected to one another,

00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:49.644
from the impact of urban migration
on a village in Zambia

00:00:49.668 --> 00:00:51.196
to the complex health care needs

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.470
of the homeless
in the streets of San Francisco.

00:00:54.574 --> 00:00:55.764
Now, it would be fair

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:57.735
if you're looking over at your seatmate

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:01.709
and wondering, "What the hell
does that have to do with architecture?"
