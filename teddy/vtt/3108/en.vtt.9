that we hope has transformed
their relationship to it.

00:04:32.115 --> 00:04:33.628
But lately,

00:04:33.652 --> 00:04:37.218
I'm starting to realize
that events are not enough.

00:04:38.538 --> 00:04:39.688
A few months ago,

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:42.277
there was a community meeting
in this neighborhood.

00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:45.366
The utility company was finally ready
to talk concretely

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.141
about long-term redevelopment.

00:04:48.028 --> 00:04:51.377
That meeting was kind of a disaster.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.562
There was a lot of yelling and anger.

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.166
People asked things like,

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.190
"If you're going
to sell it to a developer,

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:01.126
wouldn't they just build
luxury condos like everyone else?"
