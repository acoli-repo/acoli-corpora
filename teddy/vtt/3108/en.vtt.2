00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:01.709
and wondering, "What the hell
does that have to do with architecture?"

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:05.272
Well, all of these stories involved space

00:01:06.497 --> 00:01:09.425
and how it did or didn't accommodate us.

00:01:11.134 --> 00:01:12.285
The fact is,

00:01:12.309 --> 00:01:14.235
we share some of our deepest connections

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:15.523
in physical space.

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:17.712
And our stories play out,

00:01:17.736 --> 00:01:21.443
even in this crazy age
of texting and tweeting,

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:22.730
in physical space.

00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:28.034
Unfortunately, architecture
hasn't done a great job

00:01:28.058 --> 00:01:30.740
of telling all of our stories equally.
