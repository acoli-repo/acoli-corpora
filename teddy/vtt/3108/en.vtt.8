WEBVTT

00:03:59.164 --> 00:04:00.501
and for the last four years,

00:04:00.525 --> 00:04:02.525
we've been collaborating
with those mothers

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:03.700
and other residents,

00:04:03.724 --> 00:04:06.694
as well as local organizations
and the utility company.

00:04:07.394 --> 00:04:10.190
We've been experimenting
with all types of events

00:04:10.214 --> 00:04:12.730
to try and address issues
of spatial justice.

00:04:12.754 --> 00:04:15.883
Everything from job training workshops

00:04:15.907 --> 00:04:17.635
to an annual circus

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.958
to even a beautiful, new shoreline trail.

00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:22.979
In the four years
that we've been operational,

00:04:23.003 --> 00:04:26.964
over 12,000 people have come
and done something on this site

00:04:26.988 --> 00:04:30.422
that we hope has transformed
their relationship to it.
