WEBVTT

00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:31.915
we were then able
to brainstorm ideas for a site --

00:11:31.939 --> 00:11:36.700
amazing ideas that then became the seeds
of what we did over the next four years.

00:11:37.486 --> 00:11:39.544
So why the radically
different meeting now?

00:11:40.212 --> 00:11:41.362
Well ...

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.337
the pain and grief woven into these spaces
was not created in a day.

00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:48.910
Healing also takes time.

00:11:50.328 --> 00:11:54.620
After all, who here thinks you can
go to therapy just once and be cured?

00:11:54.644 --> 00:11:56.016
(Laughter)

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.190
Anyone?

00:11:58.181 --> 00:11:59.352
I didn't think so.
