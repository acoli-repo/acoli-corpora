00:10:28.252 --> 00:10:30.584
and have their stories
recorded for posterity.

00:10:31.515 --> 00:10:34.124
After a few days of recording,

00:10:34.148 --> 00:10:35.449
we held a listening party

00:10:36.695 --> 00:10:37.846
where we played clips,

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.419
much like what you hear
on NPR every Friday morning.

00:10:41.625 --> 00:10:43.363
That party --

00:10:43.387 --> 00:10:45.773
it was one of the most amazing
community meetings

00:10:45.797 --> 00:10:47.171
I've ever been a part of.

00:10:47.925 --> 00:10:50.163
In part because we didn't
just talk about joy

00:10:51.238 --> 00:10:52.461
but also pain.

00:10:53.833 --> 00:10:55.635
Two stories that I remember well --

00:10:55.659 --> 00:10:58.756
AJ talked about what it was like
to grow up in the neighborhood.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.505
There was always a kid to play with.
