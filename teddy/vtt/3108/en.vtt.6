00:02:58.592 --> 00:03:01.335
The utility company finally tore it down,

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:02.707
cleaned the soil

00:03:02.731 --> 00:03:04.852
and capped most of the site with asphalt

00:03:04.876 --> 00:03:07.115
so that the clean soil wouldn't blow away.

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.956
Sounds like a success story, right?

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:11.381
Well, not so fast.

00:03:12.342 --> 00:03:15.127
You see, because of various issues
like land entitlements,

00:03:15.151 --> 00:03:17.180
lease agreements, etc.,

00:03:17.204 --> 00:03:21.155
the land actually couldn't be redeveloped
for at least five to 10 years.

00:03:22.337 --> 00:03:25.507
What that meant is that this community

00:03:25.531 --> 00:03:28.793
that had been living
near a power plant for decades,

00:03:28.817 --> 00:03:34.642
now had 30 acres of asphalt
in their backyard.
