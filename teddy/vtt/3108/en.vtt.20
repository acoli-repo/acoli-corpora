00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:00.354
To those activists,

00:10:00.378 --> 00:10:02.793
no one was going to know
the amazing things

00:10:02.817 --> 00:10:04.970
that had happened in this community,

00:10:04.994 --> 00:10:07.373
because to everyone on the outside,

00:10:07.397 --> 00:10:08.547
it was the ghetto.

00:10:09.468 --> 00:10:10.953
At worst, a place of violence;

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:13.389
at best, a blank slate.

00:10:14.682 --> 00:10:16.192
Neither was true, of course.

00:10:17.344 --> 00:10:20.421
So my colleagues and I,
we reached out to StoryCorps.

00:10:21.425 --> 00:10:22.576
And with their support,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.136
and that of the utility company,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.040
we built a listening booth on our site.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.228
And we invited the residents to come

00:10:28.252 --> 00:10:30.584
and have their stories
recorded for posterity.
