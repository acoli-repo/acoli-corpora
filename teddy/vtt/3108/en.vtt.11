00:05:28.586 --> 00:05:33.288
that this zip code still has
one of the lowest per capita income,

00:05:33.312 --> 00:05:34.621
highest unemployment

00:05:34.645 --> 00:05:36.302
and highest incarceration rates

00:05:36.326 --> 00:05:40.751
in a city which tech giants
like Twitter, Airbnb and Uber call home.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.507
And those tech companies --

00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:44.816
hm --

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.499
they've actually helped to trigger
a gentrification push

00:05:47.523 --> 00:05:49.620
that is rapidly redefining
this neighborhood,

00:05:49.644 --> 00:05:51.867
both in terms of identity and population.

00:05:53.299 --> 00:05:56.860
Now let me pause for a moment
to talk about gentrification.

00:05:58.578 --> 00:06:01.626
I suspect for a lot of us,
it's kind of like a dirty word.
