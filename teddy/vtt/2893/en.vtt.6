00:02:57.374 --> 00:03:00.858
In 2009, I started
a research position with Nokia.

00:03:01.232 --> 00:03:02.390
And at the time,

00:03:02.414 --> 00:03:05.572
Nokia was one of the largest
cell phone companies in the world,

00:03:05.596 --> 00:03:08.798
dominating emerging markets
like China, Mexico and India --

00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:11.324
all places where I had done
a lot of research

00:03:11.348 --> 00:03:14.024
on how low-income people use technology.

00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:16.378
And I spent a lot of extra time in China

00:03:16.402 --> 00:03:18.994
getting to know the informal economy.

00:03:19.018 --> 00:03:21.419
So I did things like working
as a street vendor

00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:24.017
selling dumplings to construction workers.

00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:25.399
Or I did fieldwork,

00:03:25.423 --> 00:03:28.381
spending nights and days
in internet cafés,

00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:30.951
hanging out with Chinese youth,
so I could understand
