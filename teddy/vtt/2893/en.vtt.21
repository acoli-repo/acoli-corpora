You see those people holding her up,

00:10:31.805 --> 00:10:33.522
because she's, like, a little woozy?

00:10:33.546 --> 00:10:35.854
And you see that guy
on your left-hand side

00:10:35.878 --> 00:10:37.476
holding the orange notebook?

00:10:38.105 --> 00:10:39.835
Well, those were the temple guides,

00:10:39.859 --> 00:10:42.875
and they worked hand in hand
with the oracle.

00:10:44.084 --> 00:10:46.600
When inquisitors would come
and get on their knees,

00:10:46.624 --> 00:10:48.964
that's when the temple guides
would get to work,

00:10:48.988 --> 00:10:50.852
because after they asked her questions,

00:10:50.876 --> 00:10:52.877
they would observe their emotional state,

00:10:52.901 --> 00:10:55.225
and then they would ask them
follow-up questions,

00:10:55.249 --> 00:10:58.083
like, "Why do you want to know
this prophecy? Who are you?

00:10:58.107 --> 00:11:00.371
What are you going to do
with this information?"
