Well, we have a new oracle,

00:01:00.714 --> 00:01:02.859
and it's name is big data,

00:01:02.883 --> 00:01:06.822
or we call it "Watson"
or "deep learning" or "neural net."

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.352
And these are the kinds of questions
we ask of our oracle now,

00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:15.298
like, "What's the most efficient way
to ship these phones

00:01:15.322 --> 00:01:17.145
from China to Sweden?"

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:18.969
Or, "What are the odds

00:01:18.993 --> 00:01:22.356
of my child being born
with a genetic disorder?"

00:01:22.952 --> 00:01:26.196
Or, "What are the sales volume
we can predict for this product?"

00:01:28.108 --> 00:01:32.155
I have a dog. Her name is Elle,
and she hates the rain.
