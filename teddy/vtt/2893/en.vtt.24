00:11:58.445 --> 00:12:02.474
is the experience of understanding
the human narrative.

00:12:02.498 --> 00:12:06.137
And that's what helps to see
what's missing in our models.

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:10.896
Thick data grounds our business questions
in human questions,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.482
and that's why integrating
big and thick data

00:12:14.506 --> 00:12:16.195
forms a more complete picture.

00:12:16.772 --> 00:12:19.653
Big data is able to offer
insights at scale

00:12:19.677 --> 00:12:22.324
and leverage the best
of machine intelligence,

00:12:22.348 --> 00:12:25.920
whereas thick data can help us
rescue the context loss

00:12:25.944 --> 00:12:28.042
that comes from making big data usable,

00:12:28.066 --> 00:12:30.247
and leverage the best
of human intelligence.
