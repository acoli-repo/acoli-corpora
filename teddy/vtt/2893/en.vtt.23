our big data systems need them, too.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.229
They need people like ethnographers
and user researchers

00:11:35.253 --> 00:11:37.759
who can gather what I call thick data.

00:11:38.502 --> 00:11:41.493
This is precious data from humans,

00:11:41.517 --> 00:11:45.619
like stories, emotions and interactions
that cannot be quantified.

00:11:45.643 --> 00:11:47.965
It's the kind of data
that I collected for Nokia

00:11:47.989 --> 00:11:50.658
that comes in in the form
of a very small sample size,

00:11:50.682 --> 00:11:53.637
but delivers incredible depth of meaning.

00:11:53.661 --> 00:11:57.341
And what makes it so thick and meaty

00:11:58.445 --> 00:12:02.474
is the experience of understanding
the human narrative.
