00:15:29.185 --> 00:15:31.508
Let's integrate the big data
with the thick data.

00:15:31.532 --> 00:15:33.793
Let's bring our temple guides
with the oracles,

00:15:33.817 --> 00:15:37.193
and whether this work happens
in companies or nonprofits

00:15:37.217 --> 00:15:39.686
or government or even in the software,

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.502
all of it matters,

00:15:41.526 --> 00:15:44.549
because that means
we're collectively committed

00:15:44.573 --> 00:15:46.764
to making better data,

00:15:46.788 --> 00:15:48.624
better algorithms, better outputs

00:15:48.648 --> 00:15:50.291
and better decisions.

00:15:50.315 --> 00:15:53.873
This is how we'll avoid
missing that something.
