and leverage the best
of human intelligence.

00:12:30.271 --> 00:12:33.823
And when you actually integrate the two,
that's when things get really fun,

00:12:33.847 --> 00:12:36.283
because then you're no longer
just working with data

00:12:36.307 --> 00:12:37.503
you've already collected.

00:12:37.527 --> 00:12:40.264
You get to also work with data
that hasn't been collected.

00:12:40.288 --> 00:12:42.007
You get to ask questions about why:

00:12:42.031 --> 00:12:43.348
Why is this happening?

00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:48.216

00:12:49.406 --> 00:12:53.362
Netflix is known for their really great
recommendation algorithm,

00:12:53.386 --> 00:12:58.183
and they had this $1 million prize
for anyone who could improve it.

00:12:58.207 --> 00:12:59.521
And there were winners.
