00:06:59.665 --> 00:07:03.424
comes from quantifying
very specific environments,

00:07:03.448 --> 00:07:08.361
like electricity power grids
or delivery logistics or genetic code,

00:07:08.385 --> 00:07:12.703
when we're quantifying in systems
that are more or less contained.

00:07:12.727 --> 00:07:15.696
But not all systems
are as neatly contained.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.978
When you're quantifying
and systems are more dynamic,

00:07:19.002 --> 00:07:22.801
especially systems
that involve human beings,

00:07:22.825 --> 00:07:25.251
forces are complex and unpredictable,

00:07:25.275 --> 00:07:28.761
and these are things
that we don't know how to model so well.

00:07:29.204 --> 00:07:32.017
Once you predict something
about human behavior,
