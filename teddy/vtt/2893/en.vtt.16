00:07:58.969 --> 00:08:02.660
is that we have this thing
that I call the quantification bias,

00:08:02.684 --> 00:08:06.606
which is the unconscious belief
of valuing the measurable

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.224
over the immeasurable.

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:12.506
And we often experience this at our work.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.180
Maybe we work alongside
colleagues who are like this,

00:08:15.204 --> 00:08:17.632
or even our whole entire
company may be like this,

00:08:17.656 --> 00:08:20.202
where people become
so fixated on that number,

00:08:20.226 --> 00:08:22.293
that they can't see anything
outside of it,

00:08:22.317 --> 00:08:26.265
even when you present them evidence
right in front of their face.

00:08:27.123 --> 00:08:30.494
And this is a very appealing message,
