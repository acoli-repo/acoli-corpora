00:08:27.123 --> 00:08:30.494
And this is a very appealing message,

00:08:30.518 --> 00:08:32.861
because there's nothing
wrong with quantifying;

00:08:32.885 --> 00:08:34.315
it's actually very satisfying.

00:08:34.339 --> 00:08:38.701
I get a great sense of comfort
from looking at an Excel spreadsheet,

00:08:38.725 --> 00:08:40.126
even very simple ones.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.164
(Laughter)

00:08:41.188 --> 00:08:42.340
It's just kind of like,

00:08:42.364 --> 00:08:45.868
"Yes! The formula worked. It's all OK.
Everything is under control."

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:49.182
But the problem is

00:08:49.206 --> 00:08:51.867
that quantifying is addictive.

00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:53.273
And when we forget that

00:08:53.297 --> 00:08:56.335
and when we don't have something
to kind of keep that in check,

00:08:56.359 --> 00:08:58.477
it's very easy to just throw out data

00:08:58.501 --> 00:09:01.219
because it can't be expressed
as a numerical value.
