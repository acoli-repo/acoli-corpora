00:10:58.107 --> 00:11:00.371
What are you going to do
with this information?"

00:11:00.395 --> 00:11:03.577
And then the temple guides would take
this more ethnographic,

00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:05.757
this more qualitative information,

00:11:05.781 --> 00:11:07.856
and interpret the oracle's babblings.

00:11:09.428 --> 00:11:11.720
So the oracle didn't stand alone,

00:11:11.744 --> 00:11:13.892
and neither should our big data systems.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:15.791
Now to be clear,

00:11:15.815 --> 00:11:19.274
I'm not saying that big data systems
are huffing ethylene gas,

00:11:19.298 --> 00:11:21.651
or that they're even giving
invalid predictions.

00:11:21.675 --> 00:11:22.836
The total opposite.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.928
But what I am saying

00:11:24.952 --> 00:11:28.784
is that in the same way
that the oracle needed her temple guides,

00:11:28.808 --> 00:11:31.096
our big data systems need them, too.
