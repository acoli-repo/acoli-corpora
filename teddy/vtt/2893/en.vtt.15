00:07:29.204 --> 00:07:32.017
Once you predict something
about human behavior,

00:07:32.041 --> 00:07:33.896
new factors emerge,

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.285
because conditions
are constantly changing.

00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:38.112
That's why it's a never-ending cycle.

00:07:38.136 --> 00:07:39.600
You think you know something,

00:07:39.624 --> 00:07:41.866
and then something unknown
enters the picture.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.212
And that's why just relying
on big data alone

00:07:45.236 --> 00:07:48.085
increases the chance
that we'll miss something,

00:07:48.109 --> 00:07:51.886
while giving us this illusion
that we already know everything.

00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:56.262
And what makes it really hard
to see this paradox

00:07:56.286 --> 00:07:58.945
and even wrap our brains around it

00:07:58.969 --> 00:08:02.660
is that we have this thing
that I call the quantification bias,
