Now, despite the size of this industry,

00:02:01.406 --> 00:02:03.862
the returns are surprisingly low.

00:02:04.342 --> 00:02:06.836
Investing in big data is easy,

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.793
but using it is hard.

00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:14.021
Over 73 percent of big data projects
aren't even profitable,

00:02:14.045 --> 00:02:16.476
and I have executives
coming up to me saying,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.289
"We're experiencing the same thing.

00:02:18.313 --> 00:02:20.066
We invested in some big data system,

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.058
and our employees aren't making
better decisions.

00:02:23.082 --> 00:02:26.244
And they're certainly not coming up
with more breakthrough ideas."

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:30.098
So this is all really interesting to me,
