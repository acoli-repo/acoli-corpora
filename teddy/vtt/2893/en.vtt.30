00:14:56.743 --> 00:15:02.187
has possibly aided in the deaths
of thousands of civilians in Pakistan

00:15:02.211 --> 00:15:04.932
from misreading cellular device metadata.

00:15:07.131 --> 00:15:10.534
As all of our lives become more automated,

00:15:10.558 --> 00:15:13.638
from automobiles to health insurance
or to employment,

00:15:13.662 --> 00:15:16.012
it is likely that all of us

00:15:16.036 --> 00:15:19.025
will be impacted
by the quantification bias.

00:15:20.972 --> 00:15:23.593
Now, the good news
is that we've come a long way

00:15:23.617 --> 00:15:26.067
from huffing ethylene gas
to make predictions.

00:15:26.091 --> 00:15:29.161
We have better tools,
so let's just use them better.

00:15:29.185 --> 00:15:31.508
Let's integrate the big data
with the thick data.
