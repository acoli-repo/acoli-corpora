In ancient Greece,

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:07.379
when anyone from slaves to soldiers,
poets and politicians,

00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:11.407
needed to make a big decision
on life's most important questions,

00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:12.822
like, "Should I get married?"

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.703
or "Should we embark on this voyage?"

00:00:14.727 --> 00:00:17.655
or "Should our army
advance into this territory?"

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.258
they all consulted the oracle.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.460
So this is how it worked:

00:00:22.484 --> 00:00:25.596
you would bring her a question
and you would get on your knees,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.491
and then she would go into this trance.

00:00:27.515 --> 00:00:29.064
It would take a couple of days,

00:00:29.088 --> 00:00:31.251
and then eventually
she would come out of it,
