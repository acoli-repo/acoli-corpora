00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:30.098
So this is all really interesting to me,

00:02:30.122 --> 00:02:32.132
because I'm a technology ethnographer.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.194
I study and I advise companies

00:02:35.218 --> 00:02:37.701
on the patterns
of how people use technology,

00:02:37.725 --> 00:02:40.403
and one of my interest areas is data.

00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:45.620
So why is having more data
not helping us make better decisions,

00:02:45.644 --> 00:02:48.427
especially for companies
who have all these resources

00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:50.187
to invest in these big data systems?

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.609
Why isn't it getting any easier for them?

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.624
So, I've witnessed the struggle firsthand.

00:02:57.374 --> 00:03:00.858
In 2009, I started
a research position with Nokia.
