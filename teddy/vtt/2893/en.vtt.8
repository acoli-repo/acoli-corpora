and apartments and cars,

00:04:01.844 --> 00:04:03.664
through my conversations with them,

00:04:03.688 --> 00:04:07.529
I found out that the ads
the actually enticed them the most

00:04:07.553 --> 00:04:09.549
were the ones for iPhones,

00:04:09.573 --> 00:04:12.625
promising them this entry
into this high-tech life.

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:16.632
And even when I was living with them
in urban slums like this one,

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:19.652
I saw people investing
over half of their monthly income

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:21.299
into buying a phone,

00:04:21.323 --> 00:04:23.625
and increasingly, they were "shanzhai,"

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:27.037
which are affordable knock-offs
of iPhones and other brands.

00:04:28.303 --> 00:04:29.928
They're very usable.
