Scientists, theologians, and philosophers

00:01:31.815 --> 00:01:35.625
have been trying to get to the bottom of 
this question for centuries—

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:38.225
without reaching any consensus.

00:01:38.225 --> 00:01:39.935
One recent theory is that

00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:44.865
consciousness is the brain’s imperfect 
picture of its own activity.

00:01:44.865 --> 00:01:46.335
To understand this theory,

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:47.965
it helps to have a clear idea

00:01:47.965 --> 00:01:52.795
of one important way the brain processes 
information from our senses.

00:01:52.795 --> 00:01:54.404
Based on sensory input,

00:01:54.404 --> 00:01:55.764
it builds models,

00:01:55.764 --> 00:01:59.164
which are continuously updating,
simplified descriptions

00:01:59.164 --> 00:02:02.104
of objects and events in the world.
