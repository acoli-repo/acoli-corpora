of objects and events in the world.

00:02:02.104 --> 00:02:05.454
Everything we know is based 
on these models.

00:02:05.454 --> 00:02:09.044
They never capture every detail of 
the things they describe,

00:02:09.044 --> 00:02:13.097
just enough for the brain to determine 
appropriate responses.

00:02:13.397 --> 00:02:16.877
For instance, one model built deep 
into the visual system

00:02:16.877 --> 00:02:20.137
codes white light as brightness 
without color.

00:02:20.137 --> 00:02:21.197
In reality,

00:02:21.197 --> 00:02:22.987
white light includes wavelengths

00:02:22.987 --> 00:02:26.337
that correspond to all the 
different colors we can see.

00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:30.027
Our perception of white light is wrong 
and oversimplified,
