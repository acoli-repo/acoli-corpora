00:03:28.657 --> 00:03:31.117
can be perfectly self-descriptive.

00:03:31.117 --> 00:03:32.787
But like the model of the body,

00:03:32.787 --> 00:03:34.897
or our conception of white light,

00:03:34.897 --> 00:03:36.527
it doesn’t have to be.

00:03:36.527 --> 00:03:40.337
Our certainty that we have a 
metaphysical, subjective experience

00:03:40.337 --> 00:03:42.647
may come from one of the brain’s models,

00:03:42.647 --> 00:03:46.377
a cut-corner description of what it means
to process information

00:03:46.377 --> 00:03:49.197
in a focused and deep manner.

00:03:49.197 --> 00:03:51.867
Scientists have already begun trying 
to figure out

00:03:51.867 --> 00:03:54.787
how the brain creates that self model.

00:03:54.787 --> 00:03:59.517
MRI studies are a promising avenue 
for pinpointing the networks involved.

00:03:59.517 --> 00:04:02.497
These studies compare patterns 
of neural activation
