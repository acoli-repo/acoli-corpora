00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:30.027
Our perception of white light is wrong 
and oversimplified,

00:02:30.027 --> 00:02:32.487
but good enough for us to function.

00:02:32.487 --> 00:02:35.127
Likewise, the brain’s model of the 
physical body

00:02:35.127 --> 00:02:37.797
keeps track of the configuration 
of our limbs,

00:02:37.797 --> 00:02:40.987
but not of individual cells 
or even muscles,

00:02:40.987 --> 00:02:44.967
because that level of information 
isn’t needed to plan movement.

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:48.707
If it didn’t have the model keeping track 
of the body’s size, shape,

00:02:48.707 --> 00:02:50.677
and how it is moving at any moment,

00:02:50.677 --> 00:02:53.087
we would quickly injure ourselves.

00:02:53.087 --> 00:02:55.797
The brain also needs models of itself.

00:02:55.797 --> 00:02:56.667
For example,

00:02:56.667 --> 00:03:01.187
the brain has the ability to pay attention
to specific objects and events.
