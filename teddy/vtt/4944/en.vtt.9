00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:32.789
More extensive damage to the network 
can sometimes lead to a vegetative state,

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.719
with no sign of consciousness.

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:38.499
Evidence like this brings us closer 
to understanding

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:41.249
how consciousness is built into the brain,

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:43.149
but there’s still much more to learn.

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:44.009
For instance,

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.859
the way neurons in the networks 
related to consciousness

00:04:46.859 --> 00:04:49.399
compute specific pieces of information

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:52.369
is outside the scope of our 
current technology.

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:55.449
As we approach questions of consciousness 
with science,

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.979
we’ll open new lines of inquiry 
into human identity.
