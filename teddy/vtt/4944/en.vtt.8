00:03:59.517 --> 00:04:02.497
These studies compare patterns 
of neural activation

00:04:02.497 --> 00:04:07.507
when someone is and isn’t conscious 
of a sensory stimulus, like an image.

00:04:07.507 --> 00:04:10.947
The results show that the areas needed 
for visual processing

00:04:10.947 --> 00:04:14.916
are activated whether or not the 
participant is aware of the image,

00:04:14.916 --> 00:04:17.677
but a whole additional network lights up

00:04:17.677 --> 00:04:21.387
only when they are conscious 
of seeing the image.

00:04:21.387 --> 00:04:24.237
Patients with hemispatial neglect, 
like P.S.,

00:04:24.237 --> 00:04:28.467
typically have damage to one particular 
part of this network.

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:32.789
More extensive damage to the network 
can sometimes lead to a vegetative state,
