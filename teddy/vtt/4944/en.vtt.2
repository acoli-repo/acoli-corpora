00:00:58.877 --> 00:01:01.147
known as hemispatial neglect,

00:01:01.147 --> 00:01:05.987
reveals an important distinction between 
the brain’s processing of information

00:01:05.987 --> 00:01:09.164
and our experience of that processing.

00:01:09.164 --> 00:01:13.034
That experience is what 
we call consciousness.

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:18.044
We are conscious of both the external 
world and our internal selves—

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:19.815
we are aware of an image

00:01:19.815 --> 00:01:23.685
in much the same way we are aware of 
ourselves looking at an image,

00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:26.455
or our inner thoughts and emotions.

00:01:26.455 --> 00:01:28.965
But where does consciousness come from?
