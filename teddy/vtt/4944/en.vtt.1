00:00:27.557 --> 00:00:30.947
when researchers asked her 
which she would prefer to live in,

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:33.787
she chose the house that wasn’t burning—

00:00:33.787 --> 00:00:36.897
not once, but again and again.

00:00:36.897 --> 00:00:40.317
P.S.’s brain was still processing 
information

00:00:40.317 --> 00:00:42.437
from her whole field of vision.

00:00:42.437 --> 00:00:44.097
She could see both images

00:00:44.097 --> 00:00:46.077
and tell the difference between them,

00:00:46.077 --> 00:00:47.837
she just didn’t know it.

00:00:47.837 --> 00:00:50.547
If someone threw a ball at her left side,

00:00:50.547 --> 00:00:51.527
she might duck.

00:00:51.527 --> 00:00:54.777
But she wouldn’t have any 
awareness of the ball,

00:00:54.777 --> 00:00:57.457
or any idea why she ducked.

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:58.877
P.S.’s condition,

00:00:58.877 --> 00:01:01.147
known as hemispatial neglect,
