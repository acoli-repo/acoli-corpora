00:02:56.667 --> 00:03:01.187
the brain has the ability to pay attention
to specific objects and events.

00:03:01.187 --> 00:03:03.358
It also controls that focus,

00:03:03.358 --> 00:03:05.268
shifting it from one thing to another,

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:06.758
internal and external,

00:03:06.758 --> 00:03:08.368
according to our needs.

00:03:08.368 --> 00:03:10.578
Without the ability to direct our focus,

00:03:10.578 --> 00:03:15.318
we wouldn’t be able to assess threats, 
finish a meal, or function at all.

00:03:15.318 --> 00:03:17.497
To control focus effectively,

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:20.907
the brain has to construct a model 
of its own attention.

00:03:20.907 --> 00:03:24.867
With 86 billion neurons constantly 
interacting with each other,

00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:28.657
there’s no way the brain’s model of its 
own information processing

00:03:28.657 --> 00:03:31.117
can be perfectly self-descriptive.
