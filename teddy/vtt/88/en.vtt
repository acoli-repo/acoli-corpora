For the past 24 years,
I have been a firefighter

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:07.108
in Huntington, West Virginia.

00:00:07.619 --> 00:00:12.863
As firefighters, my team and I
are tasked with saving lives

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:15.466
and property

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.006
from such disasters
as car wrecks, house fires

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.894
and also life-threatening
medical emergencies.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.877
I am a woman leading a department
in a male-dominated profession.
