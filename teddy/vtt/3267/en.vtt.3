I related to their invisibility,

00:01:31.927 --> 00:01:34.410
which pained me during my childhood

00:01:34.434 --> 00:01:39.506
but has become my greatest asset
as an immersive documentarian,

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.616
because I can just fade into my empathy.

00:01:43.498 --> 00:01:45.569
As we walked down
the streets of Hollywood,

00:01:45.593 --> 00:01:49.061
in a neighborhood of screenwriters,
actors and filmmakers,

00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:53.423
the trio assumed the invisibility
that each senior does.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.680
I would ask myself,

00:01:55.704 --> 00:01:59.974
"How is it that no one else
sees these three human beings?
