00:02:08.514 --> 00:02:12.712
I noticed that people are largely
uncomfortable with this story.

00:02:12.736 --> 00:02:17.315
Perhaps it is because the trio
doesn't assume conventional notions

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:21.156

romance or partnership.

00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:25.579

00:02:25.898 --> 00:02:28.318
