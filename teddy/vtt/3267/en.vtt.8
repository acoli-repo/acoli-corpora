aware of the divide in me.

00:04:03.505 --> 00:04:06.713
The schism that we each often have

00:04:06.737 --> 00:04:11.067
about what we crave
and the actuality of our situation.

00:04:11.847 --> 00:04:13.697
Before shooting this series,

00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:17.386
I was also in love with two different
people who knew about each other,

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.077

00:04:24.427 --> 00:04:26.149
like Jeanie or Adina,

00:04:26.173 --> 00:04:27.831
asking myself,

00:04:27.855 --> 00:04:30.704
"Why aren't I enough?"
