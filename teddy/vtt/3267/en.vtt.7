by spending years with them
as an observer-occupant,

00:03:33.196 --> 00:03:37.679
to create a safe space,
to then become hidden in plain sight.

00:03:38.315 --> 00:03:40.855
I was about 17 when I met the trio,

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.212
and I shadowed them for four years.

00:03:43.784 --> 00:03:46.974
We actually see, in the breakdown
of social development,

00:03:46.998 --> 00:03:51.378
that adolescence and old age
look strikingly alike,

00:03:51.402 --> 00:03:54.744
because both are periods
of identity confusion.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.878
I identified with the women.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.481
But also with Will, who made me
aware of the divide in me.
