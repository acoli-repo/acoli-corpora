00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:30.562
to make satellites ultra-compact


00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:32.849
and small and highly capable.

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:37.860
I'm going to show you what 
our satellite looks like:

00:01:40.363 --> 00:01:42.900
This is our satellite.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.863
This is not a scale model,


00:01:44.863 --> 00:01:46.371
this is the real size.

00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:48.757
It's 10 by 10 by 30 centimeters,

00:01:48.757 --> 00:01:51.046
it weighs four kilograms,

00:01:51.046 --> 00:01:53.583
and we've stuffed the latest 
and greatest electronics

00:01:53.583 --> 00:01:55.840
and sensor systems into 
this little package

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.884
so that even though this is really small,

00:01:57.884 --> 00:02:02.977
this can take pictures 10 times the
resolution of the big satellite here,
