WEBVTT

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.436
is the idea of democratizing
access to satellite information.

00:03:34.436 --> 00:03:37.221
In fact, the founders of our 
company, Chris, Robbie and I,

00:03:37.221 --> 00:03:39.526
we met over 15 years ago 
at the United Nations

00:03:39.526 --> 00:03:42.511
when they were hosting a conference 
about exactly that question:

00:03:42.511 --> 00:03:44.180
How do you use satellites 
to help humanity?

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.932
How do you use satellites to help 
people in developing countries

00:03:45.932 --> 00:03:47.939
or with climate change?

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.405
And this is what has bonded us.

00:03:50.405 --> 00:03:54.970
Our entire team is passionate about
using satellites to help humanity.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.747
You could say 
we're space geeks,

00:03:56.747 --> 00:03:59.284
but not only do we care 
about what's up there,

00:03:59.284 --> 00:04:01.376
we care about what's down here, too.
