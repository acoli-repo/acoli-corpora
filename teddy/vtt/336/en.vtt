00:00:00.583 --> 00:00:03.786
The Earth needs no introduction.

00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:08.596
It needs no introduction in part 
because the Apollo 17 astronauts,

00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:11.324
when they were hurtling 
around the moon in 1972,

00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:15.396
took this iconic image.

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:18.875
It galvanized a whole 
generation of human beings

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:21.553
to realize that we're on 
Spaceship Earth,

00:00:21.553 --> 00:00:23.840
fragile and finite as it is,


00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.643
and that we need 
to take care of it.

00:00:25.643 --> 00:00:28.624
But while this picture
is beautiful, it's static,

00:00:28.624 --> 00:00:31.177
and the Earth is constantly changing.
