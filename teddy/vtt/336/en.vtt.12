00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:01.420
Thank you.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.987
(Applause)

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:05.609
We'll be able to see 
the extent of all water bodies

00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:08.820
around the whole world every day
and help water security.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.992
From water security 
to food security.

00:06:10.992 --> 00:06:13.495
We'll see crops as they 
grow in all the fields

00:06:13.495 --> 00:06:16.520
in every farmer's field around
the planet every day.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.423
and help them to improve crop yield.

00:06:19.423 --> 00:06:21.562
This is a beautiful image that was taken

00:06:21.562 --> 00:06:25.680
just a few hours ago when the 
satellite was flying over Argentina.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.104
The general point is

00:06:27.104 --> 00:06:30.517
there are probably hundreds and 
thousands of applications of this data,
