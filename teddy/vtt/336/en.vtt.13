00:06:27.104 --> 00:06:30.517
there are probably hundreds and 
thousands of applications of this data,

00:06:30.517 --> 00:06:32.469
I've mentioned a few, but there's others:

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:34.193
deforestation, the ice caps melting.

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:37.480
We can track all of these things,
every tree on the planet every day.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.598
If you took the difference between
today's image and yesterday's image,

00:06:40.598 --> 00:06:44.674
you'd see much of the world news —
you'd see floods and fires and earthquakes.

00:06:44.674 --> 00:06:48.283
And we have decided, therefore, that the 
best thing that we could do with our data

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:51.275
is to ensure universal access to it.

00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:53.400
We want to ensure everyone can see it.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.979
Thank you. (Applause)

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.780
We want to empower NGOs and 
companies and scientists and journalists
