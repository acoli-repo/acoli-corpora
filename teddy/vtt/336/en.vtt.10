00:04:58.337 --> 00:05:01.896
Acting in a single-orbit plane that 
stays fixed with respect to the sun,

00:05:01.896 --> 00:05:03.569
the Earth rotates underneath.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.864
They're all cameras pointed down,

00:05:05.864 --> 00:05:08.833
and they slowly scan across as 
the Earth rotates underneath.

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:10.957
The Earth rotates every 24 hours,

00:05:10.957 --> 00:05:13.929
so we scan every point on the 
planet every 24 hours.

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:16.180
It's a line scanner for the planet.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.634
We don't take a picture of 
anywhere on the planet every day,

00:05:19.634 --> 00:05:22.820
we take a picture of every single
place on the planet every day.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.513
Even though we launched these
just a couple of weeks ago,

00:05:25.513 --> 00:05:28.278
we've already got some initial
imagery from the satellites

00:05:28.278 --> 00:05:31.694
and I'm going to show it
publicly for the first time right now.
