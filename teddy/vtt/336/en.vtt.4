00:01:57.884 --> 00:02:02.977
this can take pictures 10 times the
resolution of the big satellite here,

00:02:02.977 --> 00:02:07.387
even though it weighs one 
thousandth of the mass.

00:02:07.387 --> 00:02:11.140
And we call this satellite 
"Dove" — Thank you.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.435
(Applause)

00:02:13.435 --> 00:02:15.480
We call this satellite "Dove,"

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.499
and we call it "Dove" because 
satellites are typically named

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:20.865
after birds, but normally birds of prey:

00:02:20.865 --> 00:02:23.702
like Eagle, Hawk, Swoop, 
Kill, I don't know,

00:02:23.702 --> 00:02:25.417
Kestrel, these sort of things.

00:02:25.417 --> 00:02:27.342
But ours have a 
humanitarian mission,

00:02:27.342 --> 00:02:29.175
so we wanted to call them Doves.

00:02:29.175 --> 00:02:31.109
And we haven't just 
built them, though.
