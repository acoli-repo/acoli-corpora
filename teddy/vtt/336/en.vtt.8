WEBVTT

00:03:59.284 --> 00:04:01.376
we care about what's down here, too.

00:04:01.376 --> 00:04:03.102
I'm going to show you a video

00:04:03.102 --> 00:04:05.561
from just four weeks ago 
of two of our satellites

00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:08.450
being launched from the
International Space Station.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.240
This is not an animation, 


00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.490
this is a video taken by the astronaut 
looking out of the window.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.479
It gives you a bit of a sense of 
scale of our two satellites.

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.796
It's like some of the 
smallest satellites ever

00:04:18.796 --> 00:04:21.290
are being launched from 
the biggest satellite ever.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.872
And right at the end, the
solar array glints in the sun.

00:04:23.872 --> 00:04:26.241
It's really cool. Wait for it.

00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:29.854
Boom! Yeah. It's the money shot.

00:04:29.854 --> 00:04:31.864
(Laughter)
