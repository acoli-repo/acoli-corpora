00:04:29.854 --> 00:04:31.864
(Laughter)

00:04:31.864 --> 00:04:34.875
So we didn't just launch 
two of them like this,

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:36.601
we launched 28 of them.

00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:40.214
It's the largest constellation of
Earth-imaging satellites in human history,

00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:43.463
and it's going to provide a
completely radical new data set

00:04:43.463 --> 00:04:45.467
about our changing planet.

00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:47.695
But that's just the beginning.

00:04:47.695 --> 00:04:50.777
You see, we're going to launch
more than 100 of these satellites

00:04:50.777 --> 00:04:53.031
like these over the 
course of the next year.

00:04:53.031 --> 00:04:56.680
It's going to be the largest constellation
of satellites in human history.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.337
And this is what it's going to do:

00:04:58.337 --> 00:05:01.896
Acting in a single-orbit plane that 
stays fixed with respect to the sun,
