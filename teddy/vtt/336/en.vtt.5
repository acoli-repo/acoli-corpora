00:02:29.175 --> 00:02:31.109
And we haven't just 
built them, though.

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.450
We've launched them.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.568
And not just one, but many.

00:02:38.586 --> 00:02:40.953
It all started in our garage.

00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:43.767
Yes, we built our first satellite
prototype in our garage.

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:46.984
Now, this is pretty normal for a
Silicon Valley company that we are,

00:02:46.984 --> 00:02:49.927
but we believe it's the first time 
for a space company.

00:02:49.927 --> 00:02:53.395
And that's not the only trick
we learned from Silicon Valley.

00:02:53.395 --> 00:02:56.587
We rapidly prototype our satellites.

00:02:56.587 --> 00:02:59.472
We use "release early, 
release often" on our software.

00:02:59.472 --> 00:03:01.389
And we take a different 
risk approach.
