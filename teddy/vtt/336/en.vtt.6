WEBVTT

00:02:59.472 --> 00:03:01.389
And we take a different 
risk approach.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.392
We take them outside and test them.

00:03:03.392 --> 00:03:06.281
We even put satellites in space
just to test the satellites,

00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:09.144
and we've learned to manufacture
our satellites at scale.

00:03:09.144 --> 00:03:11.210
We've used modern production techniques

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.923
so we can build large numbers of them,

00:03:13.923 --> 00:03:16.120
I think for the first time.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.120
We call it agile aerospace,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.808
and that's what's enabled us to put
so much capability into this little box.

00:03:24.808 --> 00:03:29.300
Now, what has bonded 
our team over the years

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.436
is the idea of democratizing
access to satellite information.
