00:00:55.908 --> 00:01:00.191
Satellites are big, expensive 
and they're slow.

00:01:00.191 --> 00:01:02.332
This one weighs three tons.

00:01:02.332 --> 00:01:05.097
It's six meters tall, four meters wide.

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:08.330
It took up the entire fairing
of a rocket just to launch it.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.180
One satellite, one rocket.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.380
It cost 855 million dollars.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.614
Satellites like these have 
done an amazing job

00:01:15.614 --> 00:01:18.730
at helping us to understand our planet.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.356
But if we want to understand 
it much more regularly,

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:24.402
we need lots of satellites,

00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:26.373
and this model isn't scalable.

00:01:26.373 --> 00:01:28.476
So me and my friends, 
we started Planet Labs

00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:30.562
to make satellites ultra-compact
