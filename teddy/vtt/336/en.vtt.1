00:00:28.624 --> 00:00:31.177
and the Earth is constantly changing.

00:00:31.177 --> 00:00:34.676
It's changing on days' time
scales with human activity.

00:00:34.676 --> 00:00:37.975
And the satellite imagery we 
have of it today is old.

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:40.470
Typically, years old.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.735
And that's important because
you can't fix what you can't see.

00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:49.595
What we'd ideally want is images
of the whole planet every day.

00:00:49.595 --> 00:00:51.871
So, what's standing in our way?

00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:53.882
What's the problem?

00:00:53.882 --> 00:00:55.908
This is the problem:

00:00:55.908 --> 00:01:00.191
Satellites are big, expensive 
and they're slow.
