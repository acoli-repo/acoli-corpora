00:05:28.278 --> 00:05:31.694
and I'm going to show it
publicly for the first time right now.

00:05:31.694 --> 00:05:34.504
This is the very first picture
taken by our satellite.

00:05:34.504 --> 00:05:36.500
It happened to be over 
UC-Davis' campus

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.544
in California when we 
turned the camera on.

00:05:38.544 --> 00:05:40.073
But what's even cooler is when

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:43.200
we compare it to the previous
latest image of that area,

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.609
which was taken many months ago.

00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:48.174
And the image on the left 
is from our satellite,

00:05:48.174 --> 00:05:50.221
and we see buildings are being built.

00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:54.210
The general point is that we will be able
to track urban growth as it happens

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.052
around the whole world
in all cities, every day.

00:05:58.052 --> 00:05:59.579
Water as well.

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:01.420
Thank you.
