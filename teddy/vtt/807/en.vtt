00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In high school, I took a bus to school

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
an hour each way every day.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I was always absorbed in a book,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
science fiction book,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which took my mind to other worlds,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and satisfied, in a narrative form,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And you know, that curiosity also manifested itself

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school
