00:05:01.256 --> 00:05:03.020
When I made these pictures,

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.824
I believed that I was documenting
the end of violent events in Ukraine.

00:05:06.824 --> 00:05:10.317
But now I understand
that it is a record of the beginning.

00:05:10.317 --> 00:05:13.730
Today, the death toll stands around 3,000,

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.121
while hundreds of thousands
have been displaced.

00:05:17.847 --> 00:05:20.547
I was in Ukraine again six weeks ago.

00:05:20.547 --> 00:05:24.035
In Maidan, the barricades
have been dismantled,

00:05:24.035 --> 00:05:27.917
and the paving stones which were used
as weapons during the protests replaced,

00:05:27.917 --> 00:05:32.129
so that traffic flows freely
through the center of the square.
