00:04:29.113 --> 00:04:31.419
and the blackened men
who were encamped there.

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:35.956
It is clear to me
that these two sets of pictures

00:04:35.956 --> 00:04:38.694
don't make much sense without the other.

00:04:38.694 --> 00:04:41.091
They are about men and women
and the way we are --

00:04:41.091 --> 00:04:43.831
not the way we look,
but the way we are.

00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:46.663
They speak about different
gender roles in conflict,

00:04:46.663 --> 00:04:49.188
not only in Maidan,
and not only in Ukraine.

00:04:50.597 --> 00:04:54.399
Men fight most wars and women mourn them.

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:56.835
If the men showed
the ideal of the warrior,

00:04:56.835 --> 00:04:59.514
then the women showed
the implications of such violence.
