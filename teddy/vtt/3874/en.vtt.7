00:03:27.828 --> 00:03:31.254
were joined by tens of thousands
of ordinary people,

00:03:31.254 --> 00:03:33.825
filling the streets in an act
of collective mourning.

00:03:35.174 --> 00:03:37.588
Many were women who often carried flowers

00:03:37.588 --> 00:03:41.768
that they had brought to lay
as marks of respect for the dead.

00:03:41.768 --> 00:03:43.339
They came day after day

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.076
and they covered the square
with millions of flowers.

00:03:48.517 --> 00:03:51.281
Sadness enveloped Maidan.

00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:53.895
It was quiet and I could hear
the birds singing.

00:03:53.895 --> 00:03:56.141
I hadn't heard that before.

00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:58.639
I stopped women
as they approached the barricades

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.782
to lay their tributes

00:03:59.807 --> 00:04:01.627
and asked to make their picture.
