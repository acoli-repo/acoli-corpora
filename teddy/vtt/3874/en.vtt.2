00:00:53.858 --> 00:01:00.248
I set up a makeshift portrait studio
by the barricades on Hrushevsky Street.

00:01:00.248 --> 00:01:04.551
There, I photographed
the fighters against a black curtain,

00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:08.909
a curtain that obscured
the highly seductive and visual backdrop

00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:11.330
of fire, ice and smoke.

00:01:12.858 --> 00:01:16.242
In order to tell the individual
human stories here,

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.376
I felt that I needed to remove
the dramatic visuals

00:01:19.376 --> 00:01:24.455
that had become so familiar and repetitive
within the mainstream media.

00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:28.593
What I was witnessing
was not only news, but also history.

00:01:28.593 --> 00:01:29.928
With this realization,

00:01:29.928 --> 00:01:32.864
I was free from
the photojournalistic conventions
