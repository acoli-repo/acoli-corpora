00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:32.353
after the president of Ukraine,
Viktor Yanukovych,

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:35.850
rejected a far-reaching accord
with the European Union

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.996
in favor of stronger ties with Russia.

00:00:38.847 --> 00:00:42.204
In response, tens of thousands
of dissatisfied citizens

00:00:42.204 --> 00:00:46.267
poured into central Kiev
to demonstrate against this allegiance.

00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:49.291
As the months passed,

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:52.370
confrontations between police
and civilians intensified.

00:00:53.858 --> 00:01:00.248
I set up a makeshift portrait studio
by the barricades on Hrushevsky Street.
