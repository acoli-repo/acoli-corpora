When I arrived in Kiev,

00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:05.731
on February 1 this year,

00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:08.350
Independence Square was under siege,

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.988
surrounded by police
loyal to the government.

00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:14.529
The protesters who occupied Maidan,

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.361
as the square is known,

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:17.981
prepared for battle,

00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:20.215
stockpiling homemade weapons

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.692
and mass-producing improvised body armor.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.133
The Euromaidan protests began peacefully
at the end of 2013,

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:32.353
after the president of Ukraine,
Viktor Yanukovych,
