00:01:57.483 --> 00:02:00.363
made up of decommissioned
military equipment,

00:02:00.363 --> 00:02:05.725
irregular combat fatigues
and trophies taken from the police.

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:10.297
I became interested in the way they
were choosing to represent themselves,

00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:13.843
this outward expression of masculinity,

00:02:13.843 --> 00:02:15.176
the ideal of the warrior.

00:02:16.724 --> 00:02:20.009
I worked slowly,
using an analog film camera

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:23.739
with a manual focusing loop
and a handheld light meter.

00:02:23.764 --> 00:02:25.505
The process is old-fashioned.

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:29.268
It gives me time to speak with each person

00:02:29.268 --> 00:02:32.977
and to look at them, in silence,
while they look back at me.
