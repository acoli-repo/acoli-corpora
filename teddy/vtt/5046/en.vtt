00:00:07.851 --> 00:00:10.351
On December 7, 1941,

00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:15.841
16 year-old Aki Kurose shared in the 
horror of millions of Americans

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:19.453
when Japanese planes 
attacked Pearl Harbor.

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:20.783
What she did not know,

00:00:20.783 --> 00:00:22.563
was how that shared experience

00:00:22.563 --> 00:00:27.633
would soon leave her family and 
over 120,000 Japanese Americans

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:29.553
alienated from their country,

00:00:29.553 --> 00:00:31.993
both socially and physically.
