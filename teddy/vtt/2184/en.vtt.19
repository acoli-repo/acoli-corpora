00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:30.643
in an area where
it's sustainable to do so.

00:09:30.667 --> 00:09:33.268
We've then traced it throughout
the entire supply chain

00:09:33.292 --> 00:09:37.393
to maintain its identity and all
the information that's attached to it.

00:09:37.417 --> 00:09:39.976
And then, we've shared
that information with consumers

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.809
in a way that gives them a choice

00:09:41.833 --> 00:09:43.976
and lets them make consumption decisions

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.542
that are more in line with their values.

00:09:47.542 --> 00:09:51.643
Now, for this fish example,
this is already rolled out at scale.

00:09:51.667 --> 00:09:52.934
This season,

00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:56.518
the entire fleet of the world's largest
toothfish fishing company,

00:09:56.542 --> 00:09:57.893
Austral Fisheries,

00:09:57.917 --> 00:10:00.768
is tagging every single fish
that they catch
