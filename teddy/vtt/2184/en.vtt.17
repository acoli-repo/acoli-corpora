00:08:29.583 --> 00:08:32.434
is really different
from product to product.

00:08:32.458 --> 00:08:34.768
And different from where you buy it.

00:08:34.792 --> 00:08:37.351
You behave differently
in those situations.

00:08:37.375 --> 00:08:41.018
You are stressed and time-poor
in the supermarket.

00:08:41.042 --> 00:08:43.309
Or with short attention span over dinner,

00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:45.518
because your date is so cute.

00:08:45.542 --> 00:08:48.559
Or you are critical and inquisitive

00:08:48.583 --> 00:08:51.750
when researching
for a larger purchase online.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.351
And so for our fish,

00:08:54.375 --> 00:08:57.309
we've developed a digital experience

00:08:57.333 --> 00:09:03.101
that works when buying the fish
in a freezer in a fish specialty store
