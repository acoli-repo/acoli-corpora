00:11:59.542 --> 00:12:01.601
to choose the right products.

00:12:01.625 --> 00:12:03.851
Not by necessarily doing it yourself

00:12:03.875 --> 00:12:06.184
but by asking an algorithm

00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:09.768
that knows how much you care
about this planet.

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:11.768
Not by necessarily doing it yourself

00:12:11.792 --> 00:12:13.893
but by asking an algorithm

00:12:13.917 --> 00:12:16.708
that is never time-poor or distracted,

00:12:17.792 --> 00:12:21.601
or with short attention span
because of the cute date,

00:12:21.625 --> 00:12:24.351
and that knows how much
you care about this planet

00:12:24.375 --> 00:12:25.809
and the people living on it,

00:12:25.833 --> 00:12:29.684
by asking that algorithm to look
at all of that information for you

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:31.208
and to decide for you.
