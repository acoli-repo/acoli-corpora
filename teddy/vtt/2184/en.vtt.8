00:03:57.042 --> 00:04:00.809
for a specific sustainability
or ethical production claim.

00:04:00.833 --> 00:04:03.684
So for example, in the case of the fish,

00:04:03.708 --> 00:04:07.601
has this fish been caught in an area
where there's enough of them,

00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:09.643
so that it's sustainable
to catch it there

00:04:09.667 --> 00:04:12.351
and not in a marine protected area?

00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:13.726
So what we're doing here

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.643
is we're taking almost real-time
GPS data from the ship --

00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:19.184
the ship that's fishing --

00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:21.434
and that tells us where the ship is

00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:24.018
and where it's going at what speed.

00:04:24.042 --> 00:04:27.184
And we can then combine that
with other types of data,

00:04:27.208 --> 00:04:29.976
like, for example,
how deep the sea floor is.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.643
And combining all of this information,
