to make those decisions for you,
so you don't have to.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.351
And maybe it will even do
a better job at it.

00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:08.809
In a recent study, 85 percent of those

00:11:08.833 --> 00:11:11.851
buying a product
through a virtual assistant

00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:13.684
said that they, on occasion,

00:11:13.708 --> 00:11:16.059
actually went with the top
product recommendation

00:11:16.083 --> 00:11:17.351
of that virtual assistant,

00:11:17.375 --> 00:11:19.434
rather than the specific product or brand

00:11:19.458 --> 00:11:22.184
that they set out
to buy in the first place.

00:11:22.208 --> 00:11:24.018
You just say you need toilet paper,

00:11:24.042 --> 00:11:28.476
it's then an algorithm that decides
which brand, price point

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.559
or whether you go with recycled or not.
