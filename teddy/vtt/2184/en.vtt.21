From dairy to fruit and vegetables,

00:10:30.917 --> 00:10:33.684
to nonfood products made out of wood.

00:10:33.708 --> 00:10:38.226
As a consumer, all of this
may sound like a huge burden,

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.768
because you don't have time
to look at all of this information

00:10:41.792 --> 00:10:44.268
every time you buy something.

00:10:44.292 --> 00:10:46.018
And I don't expect you to,

00:10:46.042 --> 00:10:49.143
because you'll have help with that.

00:10:49.167 --> 00:10:54.518
In the future, we'll leave the decision
of which specific product to buy

00:10:54.542 --> 00:10:56.726
increasingly up to machines.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.976
An algorithm will know enough about you

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.476
to make those decisions for you,
so you don't have to.
