00:00:01.042 --> 00:00:03.101
In almost all aspects of our lives

00:00:03.125 --> 00:00:07.333
we have perfect information
available instantaneously.

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:11.309
My phone can tell me
everything about my finances,

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:13.559
where precisely I am on a map

00:00:13.583 --> 00:00:15.726
and the best way to my next destination,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.309
all with a click of a button.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:21.434
But this availability
of information and transparency

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:25.083
almost completely disappears
when it comes to consumer products.

00:00:26.208 --> 00:00:29.518
If you go to the seafood counter
at your local supermarket,

00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:33.351
you can probably choose
between several different types of fish.
