00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.268
I'm going to use a real product

00:03:30.292 --> 00:03:34.726
and a supply chain where we've made
all of this a reality already:

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.018
a Patagonian toothfish,

00:03:36.042 --> 00:03:39.059
or Chilean sea bass,
as it's called in the US.

00:03:39.083 --> 00:03:40.833
Number one, verify.

00:03:41.792 --> 00:03:44.351
Verify how something is produced.

00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:47.184
But not just by saying,
"Trust me, this is good,

00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:49.393
trust me, we've done
all the right things,"

00:03:49.417 --> 00:03:53.434
but by producing evidence
for that individual physical product,

00:03:53.458 --> 00:03:55.726
and the way it was produced.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.018
By producing evidence

00:03:57.042 --> 00:04:00.809
for a specific sustainability
or ethical production claim.
