in an automated, real-time
and ongoing manner.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.393
And that really lays the basis
for this information revolution.

00:05:07.417 --> 00:05:09.601
So, number two, trace.

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:12.684
Trace those individual physical products,

00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:14.726

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.476
that the claim that we've verified
about a certain product

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.476

all that we've really
verified in the first place

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.101
is that somebody, somewhere, at some point
