WEBVTT

00:09:57.917 --> 00:10:00.768
is tagging every single fish
that they catch

00:10:00.792 --> 00:10:04.125
and that ends up in their premium
branded "Glacier 51" product.

00:10:05.208 --> 00:10:07.351
And you can already buy this fish.

00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:11.268
And with it, you can have all
of the information I talked about today,

00:10:11.292 --> 00:10:12.768
and much more,

00:10:12.792 --> 00:10:17.042
attached to each individual fish
or portion of the fish that you may buy.

00:10:18.583 --> 00:10:22.643
But this is not a fish or seafood thing.

00:10:22.667 --> 00:10:25.851
We're working on many, many
different commodities and products

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:28.268
and their supply chains across the globe.

00:10:28.292 --> 00:10:30.893
From dairy to fruit and vegetables,
