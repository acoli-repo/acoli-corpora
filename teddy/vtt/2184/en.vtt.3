00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:30.518
really wants to buy a product

00:01:30.542 --> 00:01:33.976
that harms the planet
or our fellow humans

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.333
if given the choice.

00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:38.768
But you see, choice is a loaded word.

00:01:38.792 --> 00:01:41.143
Choice means there's another option.

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:44.184
Choice means you can afford that option.

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:45.684
But choice also means

00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:49.768
you have enough information
to make an informed decision.

00:01:49.792 --> 00:01:54.851
And that information nowadays
simply just doesn't exist.

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:58.125
Or at least it's really,
really hard to access.

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:01.643
But I think this is about to change.
