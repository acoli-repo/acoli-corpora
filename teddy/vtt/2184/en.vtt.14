00:06:56.708 --> 00:07:00.934
And so, when it comes to filleting
and packaging the fish,

00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:03.851
we read the RFID tag and then remove it.

00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:08.101
And then we add a unique QR code
to the packaging of the fish.

00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:12.601
And that QR code then points back
to the same information

00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:15.375
that we've verified about the fish
in the first place.

00:07:17.083 --> 00:07:20.934
And so, depending on the type
of product that we're working with,

00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:24.726
we may use QR codes, bar codes, RFID tags

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.518
or other tag technologies.

00:07:26.542 --> 00:07:28.643
But there are also technologies

00:07:28.667 --> 00:07:31.059
that are at the brink
of large-scale breakthrough
