00:08:57.333 --> 00:09:03.101
that works when buying the fish
in a freezer in a fish specialty store

00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:06.934
and that gives you all of the information
about the fish and its journey.

00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:09.601
But we also worked with a restaurant

00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:12.601
and developed a different
digital experience

00:09:12.625 --> 00:09:16.184
that only summarizes the key facts
about the fish and its journey,

00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:18.643
and works better in a dinner setting

00:09:18.667 --> 00:09:22.226
and, hopefully, there
doesn't annoy your date too much.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.601
Now, that brings us full circle.

00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:27.643
We've verified that the fish was caught

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:30.643
in an area where
it's sustainable to do so.
