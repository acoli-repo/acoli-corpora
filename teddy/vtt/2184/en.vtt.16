00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.101
because of that information.

00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:02.809
And so, we use blockchain technology

00:08:02.833 --> 00:08:06.059
where it adds value to what we're doing.

00:08:06.083 --> 00:08:07.351
But importantly,

00:08:07.375 --> 00:08:10.518
we don't let the limitations
that this technology still has today,

00:08:10.542 --> 00:08:12.601
like, for example,
with regards to scaling,

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:14.601
we don't let that stand in our way.

00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:17.101
And that brings us to the third point.

00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:18.393
Share.

00:08:18.417 --> 00:08:22.268
How to share the information
that we've verified and tracked

00:08:22.292 --> 00:08:25.101
about where a product is from,
how it was produced

00:08:25.125 --> 00:08:27.601
and how it got to where it is?

00:08:27.625 --> 00:08:29.559
How to share this information

00:08:29.583 --> 00:08:32.434
is really different
from product to product.
