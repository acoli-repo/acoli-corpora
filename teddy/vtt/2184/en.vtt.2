00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:01.476
And most of the horrible problems
that we're facing today,

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.768
like climate change

00:01:02.792 --> 00:01:05.476
and modern slavery in supply chains,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.226
come down to decisions.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.934
Human decisions to produce something
one way and not another.

00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.184
And that's how we, as consumers,

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:18.184
end up making decisions
that harm the planet

00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:19.851
or our fellow humans.

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:21.958
By choosing the wrong products.

00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:26.518
But I refuse to believe
that anybody here in this room,

00:01:26.542 --> 00:01:28.601
or frankly, anybody on this planet,

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:30.518
really wants to buy a product
