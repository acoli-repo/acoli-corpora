00:06:27.792 --> 00:06:32.018
so the fish are coming up
onto the boat on individual hooks.

00:06:32.042 --> 00:06:34.309
And as soon as the fish is on board,

00:06:34.333 --> 00:06:36.601
it is killed, and then after that,

00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:40.059
we insert a small tag
into the fish's flesh.

00:06:40.083 --> 00:06:44.601
And in that tag, there is an RFID chip
with a unique serial number,

00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:47.643
and that tag follows the fish
throughout the whole supply chain

00:06:47.667 --> 00:06:49.851
and makes it really easy
to sense its presence

00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:53.393
at any port, on any truck
or in any processing plant.

00:06:53.417 --> 00:06:56.684
But consumers can't really read RFID tags.

00:06:56.708 --> 00:07:00.934
And so, when it comes to filleting
and packaging the fish,
