00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.643
And combining all of this information,

00:04:32.667 --> 00:04:36.809
our machine-learning algorithms
can then verify, in an automated way,

00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:40.625
whether the ship is only fishing
where it's supposed to, or not.

00:04:41.875 --> 00:04:44.434
And as sensors become cheaper,

00:04:44.458 --> 00:04:46.476
we can put them in more places.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.851
And that means we can capture more data,

00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:51.684
and combining that
with advancements in data science,

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:54.976
it means that we can now verify

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.018
specific sustainability
and ethical production claims

00:04:59.042 --> 00:05:03.226
in an automated, real-time
and ongoing manner.
