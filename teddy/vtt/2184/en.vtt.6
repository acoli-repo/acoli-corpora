00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:00.518
we need to do three things:

00:03:00.542 --> 00:03:03.809
verify, trace and share.

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:07.309
Verify specific sustainability

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:09.143
and ethical production claims

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:12.018
in a data-based and automated way.

00:03:12.042 --> 00:03:14.893
Then trace those
individual physical products

00:03:14.917 --> 00:03:16.601
throughout their supply chains,

00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:19.643
and finally, share

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:22.101
in a way that truly gives them a choice

00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:24.101
and lets them make consumption decisions

00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:26.934
that are more aligned with their values.

00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:30.268
I'm going to use a real product
