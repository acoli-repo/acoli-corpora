00:00:31.038 --> 00:00:34.284
Until we can raise the age
of criminal responsibility to 18,

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:37.535
we need to focus on changing
the daily lives of these young people.

00:00:38.155 --> 00:00:39.729
I know firsthand.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:41.908
Before I ever turned 18,

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:45.855
I spent approximately
400 days on Rikers Island,

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:47.109
and to add to that

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.963
I spent almost 300 days
in solitary confinement,

00:00:50.963 --> 00:00:52.660
and let me tell you this:

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.768
Screaming at the top of your lungs
all day on your cell door

00:00:56.768 --> 00:00:59.345
or screaming at the top
of your lungs out the window,

00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:01.267
it gets tiring.
