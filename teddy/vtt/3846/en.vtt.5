00:02:28.856 --> 00:02:31.354
One day he pulled me
in between the A and B doors

00:02:31.354 --> 00:02:34.673
which separate the north
and south sides of our housing unit.

00:02:34.673 --> 00:02:37.270
He pulled me there because I had
a physical altercation

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.290
with another young man in my housing unit,

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.773
and he felt, since there was
a female officer working on the floor,

00:02:42.773 --> 00:02:45.258
that I violated his shift.

00:02:45.258 --> 00:02:47.255
So he punched me in my chest.

00:02:47.255 --> 00:02:49.391
He kind of knocked the wind out of me.

00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:52.248
I wasn't impulsive,
I didn't react right away,

00:02:52.248 --> 00:02:54.896
because I know this is their house.

00:02:54.896 --> 00:02:56.746
I have no wins.

00:02:56.746 --> 00:03:02.174
All he has to do is pull his pin
and backup will come immediately.
