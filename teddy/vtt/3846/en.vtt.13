00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:31.586
because you have a young individual
coming in from the street

00:06:31.586 --> 00:06:33.363
thinking that they're tough,

00:06:33.363 --> 00:06:36.683
being surrounded by a bunch
of other young individuals

00:06:36.683 --> 00:06:40.327
from all of the five boroughs,
and everybody feels that they're tough.

00:06:40.327 --> 00:06:44.322
So now you have a bunch of young gentlemen
poking their chests out

00:06:44.322 --> 00:06:47.712
feeling that I have to prove
I'm equally as tough as you

00:06:47.712 --> 00:06:50.146
or I'm tougher than you, you and you.

00:06:50.146 --> 00:06:51.734
But let's be honest:

00:06:51.734 --> 00:06:56.625
That culture is very dangerous
and damaging to our young people.

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:59.579
We need to help institutions
and these teens realize

00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:02.874
that they don't have to lead
the previous lifestyle that they led
