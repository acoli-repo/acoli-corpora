00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:05.013
We need to change the culture
in our jails and prisons,

00:00:05.013 --> 00:00:07.520
especially for young inmates.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.842
New York state is one
of only two in the U.S.

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:14.340
that automatically arrests and tries
16- to 17-year-olds as adults.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.297
This culture of violence
takes these young people

00:00:17.297 --> 00:00:19.339
and puts them in a hostile environment,

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.381
and the correctional officers pretty much
allow any and everything to go on.

00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:26.188
There's not really much
for these young people to do

00:00:26.188 --> 00:00:29.718
to actually enhance their talent
and actually rehabilitate them.
