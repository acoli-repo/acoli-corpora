00:01:31.168 --> 00:01:34.973
And there's not really much for them to do
to keep them from recidivating.

00:01:35.823 --> 00:01:38.005
But it all starts with the C.O.s.

00:01:38.545 --> 00:01:40.513
It's very easy for some people

00:01:40.513 --> 00:01:43.207
to look at these correctional officers
as the good guys

00:01:43.207 --> 00:01:45.482
and the inmates as the bad guys,

00:01:45.482 --> 00:01:47.178
or vice versa for some,

00:01:47.178 --> 00:01:48.849
but it's a little more than that.

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:51.844
See, these C.O.s are normal,
everyday people.

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:56.885
They come from the same neighborhoods
as the population they "serve."

00:01:57.725 --> 00:01:59.597
They're just normal people.

00:01:59.597 --> 00:02:03.261
They're not robots, and there's 
nothing special about them.
