00:04:28.904 --> 00:04:30.325
and that's it.

00:04:30.325 --> 00:04:32.477
Some C.O.s feel that
they're jailing with you.

00:04:32.477 --> 00:04:35.047
This is why they have that mentality
and that attitude

00:04:35.047 --> 00:04:37.078
and they go by that concept.

00:04:37.078 --> 00:04:40.543
In some instances, we're in it
together with the C.O.s.

00:04:40.543 --> 00:04:43.617
However, institutions need to give
these correctional officers

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:46.995
proper trainings on how to properly deal
with the adolescent population,

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.240
and they also need
to give them proper trainings

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.777
on how to deal with 
the mental health population as well.

00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:56.086
These C.O.s play a big factor
in these young people's lives

00:04:56.086 --> 00:04:59.444
for x amount of time until a disposition
is reached on their case.

00:04:59.444 --> 00:05:04.101
So why not try to mentor
these young people while they're there?
