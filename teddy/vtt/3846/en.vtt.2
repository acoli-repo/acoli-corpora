00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:01.267
it gets tiring.

00:01:01.267 --> 00:01:04.064
Since there's not much for you to do
while you're in there,

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:06.347
you start pacing
back and forth in your cell,

00:01:06.347 --> 00:01:08.483
you start talking to yourself,

00:01:08.483 --> 00:01:10.480
your thoughts start running wild,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.963
and then your thoughts
become your own worst enemy.

00:01:13.963 --> 00:01:16.958
Jails are actually supposed
to rehabilitate a person,

00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:19.651
not cause him or her
to become more angry,

00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:22.391
frustrated, and feel more hopeless.

00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:26.294
Since there's not a discharge plan
put in place for these young people,

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:29.889
they pretty much 
reenter society with nothing.
