Some programs that I feel
would benefit our young people

00:06:02.194 --> 00:06:05.245
are art therapy programs

00:06:05.245 --> 00:06:08.310
for the kids that like to draw
and have that talent,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.252

00:06:12.252 --> 00:06:15.139
How about a music program for them
that actually teaches them

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.536
how to write and make music?

00:06:17.536 --> 00:06:18.960
Just a thought.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.029

00:06:25.143 --> 00:06:28.704
That's nicknamed "gladiator school,"

00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:31.586
because you have a young individual
coming in from the street
