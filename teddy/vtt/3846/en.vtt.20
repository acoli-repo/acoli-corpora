00:09:55.794 --> 00:10:00.743
Some people would say
I was a little too smart for my own good.

00:10:00.743 --> 00:10:06.290
I had dreams of becoming
an architect or an archaeologist.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.473
Currently, I'm working
at the Fortune Society,

00:10:08.473 --> 00:10:10.222
which is a reentry program,

00:10:10.222 --> 00:10:14.765
and I work with people as a case manager
that are at high risk for recidivism.

00:10:14.765 --> 00:10:17.171
So I connect them
with the services that they need

00:10:17.171 --> 00:10:19.200
once they're released from jail and prison

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.326
so they can make a positive transition
back into society.

00:10:22.326 --> 00:10:25.121
If I was to see my 15-year-old self today,

00:10:25.121 --> 00:10:28.092
I would sit down and talk to him
and try to educate him

00:10:28.092 --> 00:10:32.037
and I would let him know,
"Listen, this is me. I'm you.
