00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:30.735
or, "My man over here
got this connection for the low price.

00:07:30.735 --> 00:07:32.142
Let's exchange information,"

00:07:32.142 --> 00:07:34.925
and, "When we hit the town,
we're going to do it real big."

00:07:34.925 --> 00:07:37.784
I used to hear these conversations
and think to myself, "Wow,

00:07:37.784 --> 00:07:40.716
these dudes are really talking about
going back in the street

00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:42.248
and committing future crimes."

00:07:42.248 --> 00:07:43.990
So I came up with a name for that:

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.939
I called it a go-back-to-jail-quick scheme

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:50.523
because really, how long
is that going to last?

00:07:50.523 --> 00:07:52.883
You get a retirement plan with that?

00:07:52.883 --> 00:07:56.341
Nice little pension? 401(k)? 403(b)?

00:07:56.341 --> 00:07:59.639
You get health insurance? Dental?

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:01.568
