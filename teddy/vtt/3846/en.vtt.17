00:08:29.304 --> 00:08:31.107
called Elmira Correctional Facility.

00:08:31.107 --> 00:08:33.615
I just came out of the weight shack
from working out,

00:08:33.615 --> 00:08:37.148
and I saw an older gentleman that I knew
standing in the middle of the yard

00:08:37.148 --> 00:08:38.453
just looking up at the sky.

00:08:38.453 --> 00:08:42.649
Mind you, this older gentlemen was serving
a 33-and-a-third-to-life sentence

00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:46.081
in which he already had served
20 years of that sentence.


00:08:46.081 --> 00:08:47.895
So I walk up to him and I said,

00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:49.857
"O.G., what's going on, man, you good?"

00:08:49.857 --> 00:08:52.708
He looked at me, and he said,
"Yeah, I'm good, young blood."

00:08:52.708 --> 00:08:55.441
I'm like, "So what are you looking
up at the sky for, man?

00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:57.139
What's so fascinating up there?"

00:08:57.139 --> 00:08:59.817
He said, "You look up
and you tell me what you see."
