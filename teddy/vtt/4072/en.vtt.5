00:02:30.012 --> 00:02:31.363
in the Anthropocene.

00:02:31.387 --> 00:02:37.435
This slide really shows the framework
with the nine environmental processes

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.775
that regulate the stability
of the earth system,

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.601
providing a safe operating space,

00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:45.032
where we'll have a high chance
of having good human well-being

00:02:45.056 --> 00:02:46.563
and prosperity and equity.

00:02:46.587 --> 00:02:50.938
If we move into the yellow zone,
we enter a dangerous uncertainty zone;

00:02:50.962 --> 00:02:54.419
and into the red, we have a high
likelihood of crossing tipping points

00:02:54.443 --> 00:02:58.491
that could take us irreversibly away
from the ability of the earth system

00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:02.455
to provide social and economic
well-being for humanity.
