00:03:29.145 --> 00:03:31.955
We need to recognize
that the Sustainable Development Goals

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.471
is 12 years away.

00:03:33.495 --> 00:03:35.183
It's only a milestone.

00:03:35.207 --> 00:03:38.161
It is the bull's-eye
that we need to go through

00:03:38.185 --> 00:03:41.084
and zoom ourselves towards transformations

00:03:41.108 --> 00:03:44.834
where we can have a good future
for all co-citizens on earth,

00:03:44.858 --> 00:03:46.123
nine billion plus,

00:03:46.147 --> 00:03:49.749
within a stable earth system
in 2050 and beyond.

00:03:50.405 --> 00:03:52.189
This is a quest,

00:03:52.213 --> 00:03:55.751
and in order to really explore this
and not have only opinions about it,

00:03:55.775 --> 00:03:59.087
we gathered the scientific community,
the best thinkers and modelers

00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:02.933
and started to develop a completely
new complex systems dynamic model,
