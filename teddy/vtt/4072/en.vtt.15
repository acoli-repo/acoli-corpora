00:07:28.754 --> 00:07:31.521
we will be able to deliver
on some of the SDGs,

00:07:31.545 --> 00:07:35.357
but we'll do it at the expense
of the stability of the earth system.

00:07:36.061 --> 00:07:38.775
Now, what if we go faster
on economic growth

00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:43.723
and really ally on one percent
increase per year of income

00:07:43.747 --> 00:07:47.107
and an even tripling
of the world economy by 2050?

00:07:47.131 --> 00:07:49.347
That would give us
the following trajectory.

00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:53.190
We would, yes, go a little bit further
on SDG accomplishments,

00:07:53.214 --> 00:07:57.508
but still at the expense of the risk
of destabilizing the planet.

00:07:58.119 --> 00:08:00.119
But what if we really go harder?
