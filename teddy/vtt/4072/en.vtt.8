00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:02.933
and started to develop a completely
new complex systems dynamic model,

00:04:02.957 --> 00:04:04.123
the Earth-3 model,

00:04:04.147 --> 00:04:08.374
building on models that have been around
for the last 50 years.

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:10.965
And here it is.

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.101
This is a fantastic piece of work.

00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:17.228
This has a climate module, a biosphere
module, a global economic model;

00:04:17.252 --> 00:04:22.342
it has algorithms, it has the whole room
of fantastic accomplishments.

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:24.527
This is what turns us scientists on.

00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:25.613
(Laughter)

00:04:25.637 --> 00:04:27.860
I mean, this is just
a beautiful piece of work?

00:04:27.884 --> 00:04:31.690
And I'd just love to spend the whole
evening walking this through with you,
