00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:31.762
And the results, I can tell you,
really surprised us.

00:06:31.786 --> 00:06:33.844
And this will be
the first time it's shown.

00:06:33.868 --> 00:06:37.021
It should actually not even
be referenced outside of this room.

00:06:37.045 --> 00:06:40.829
Now, it actually is presented
along two axes.

00:06:40.853 --> 00:06:44.807
The y-axis here shows our ability
to stay within planetary boundaries.

00:06:44.831 --> 00:06:48.608
The higher up, the closer you are
to the safe operating space.

00:06:48.632 --> 00:06:51.154
On the x-axis are
the Sustainable Development Goals;

00:06:51.178 --> 00:06:54.303
the further to the right,
the more of the SDGs we fulfill.

00:06:54.327 --> 00:06:56.745
We all want to be in
the upper right-hand corner,

00:06:56.769 --> 00:06:59.784
the safe and just world for the future.

00:06:59.808 --> 00:07:02.285
Now, the point you see there is 1980.
