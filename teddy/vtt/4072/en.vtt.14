00:06:59.808 --> 00:07:02.285
Now, the point you see there is 1980.

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:05.783
We were in a situation where we actually
were in a safe operating space

00:07:05.807 --> 00:07:07.911
but not meeting so many of the SDGs.

00:07:07.935 --> 00:07:10.907
Here's the trend up until 2015.

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:12.757
So this is the conventional world,

00:07:12.781 --> 00:07:15.896
which is actually delivering
on an increasing number of SDGs,

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.128
lifting millions of people out of poverty,

00:07:18.152 --> 00:07:22.845
but doing it at the expense
of the safe operating space on earth.

00:07:23.327 --> 00:07:26.852
Now, this is the scenario
business as usual, into the future.

00:07:26.876 --> 00:07:28.730
If we just move on as today,

00:07:28.754 --> 00:07:31.521
we will be able to deliver
on some of the SDGs,
