00:10:57.899 --> 00:11:00.371
and not only that, we're running the risks

00:11:00.395 --> 00:11:03.722
of future generations having
an even tougher ability,

00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:07.389
because of the risk of pushing
the earth system beyond tipping points.

00:11:07.413 --> 00:11:11.230
In fact, we are facing even
a risk of a hothouse earth,

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:14.865
where we will undermine
and create geopolitical instabilities

00:11:14.889 --> 00:11:17.208
that could actually make life
even more tough

00:11:17.232 --> 00:11:19.646
for billions of people on earth.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.307
This, in all honesty,
really, really scares me.

00:11:23.998 --> 00:11:26.576
But that's also why
I'm standing here tonight,

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.718
because the window
of success is still open.

00:11:29.742 --> 00:11:32.183
The earth system is still resilient.
