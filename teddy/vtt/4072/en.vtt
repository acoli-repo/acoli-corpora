00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.893
In 2015, we saw two fantastic,
hopeful breakthroughs for humanity.

00:00:05.917 --> 00:00:09.115
First, the adoption of
the Sustainable Development Goals,

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.133
the collective, universal
plan for humanity

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:13.461
to eradicate hunger,

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:15.961
[promote] good economic
development and good health,

00:00:15.985 --> 00:00:17.723
within global environmental targets.

00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:20.616
Secondly, after 21 years of negotiations,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.690
we adopted the legally binding
Paris Agreement,

00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:27.267
all nations in the world keeping
global warming under two degrees Celsius,

00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:29.552
aiming at 1.5 degrees Celsius.

00:00:29.576 --> 00:00:35.113
Today, three years down the line,
we're still in the hand-waving business.
