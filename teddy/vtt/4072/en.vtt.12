00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:01.438
all the way until 2050,

00:06:01.462 --> 00:06:06.277
showing the ability along
the lines here to attain the SDGs.

00:06:06.734 --> 00:06:11.367
Now, this gave us the opportunity
of doing several scenarios,

00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:13.906
testing different possible futures:

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.485
business as usual, global transformations,

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:19.878
investment schemes in business,
different governance options,

00:06:19.902 --> 00:06:22.175
policies, finance --

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.345
really, to explore what
the future can look like

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:28.274
in our ability to attain
the SDGs within PBs.

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:31.762
And the results, I can tell you,
really surprised us.
