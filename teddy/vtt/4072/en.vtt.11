00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.039
of really picking on all these
Sustainable Development Goals.

00:05:31.063 --> 00:05:33.075
Now, one example of how
we calibrated this,

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:35.856
here you have [data] for
Sustainable Development Goals

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.417
on eradicating poverty, health,
education and food.

00:05:39.441 --> 00:05:43.412
And here you have in the bubbles
the seven regions of the world,

00:05:43.436 --> 00:05:47.863
how they move up until 2015
in our empirical observations

00:05:47.887 --> 00:05:50.064
in relation to GDP per capita,

00:05:50.088 --> 00:05:52.669
giving these universal convergent trends,

00:05:52.693 --> 00:05:55.778
which enabled us to create regressions

00:05:55.802 --> 00:05:59.457
that could make us able to do
simulations into the future,

00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:01.438
all the way until 2050,
