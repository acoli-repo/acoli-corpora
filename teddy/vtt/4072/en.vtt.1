00:00:29.576 --> 00:00:35.113
Today, three years down the line,
we're still in the hand-waving business.

00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:38.370
Now, I think it's time
to step back one step

00:00:38.394 --> 00:00:42.880
and recognize that I wonder if the world
leaders really knew what they signed

00:00:42.904 --> 00:00:45.018
at the General Assembly three years ago.

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.902
These are universal, aspirational,
transformational goals

00:00:48.926 --> 00:00:53.885
for inclusive, prosperous humanity
on a stable earth system.

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.940
But there are underlying problems.

00:00:55.964 --> 00:00:59.169
We have inherent contradictions
between these goals,

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:04.061
where there's the risk of pursuing
one favored goal at the expense of others.
