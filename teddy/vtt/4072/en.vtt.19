00:09:26.803 --> 00:09:30.152
What if we could have
an economic growth such as in China,

while doing it within
the environmental parameters

00:09:33.223 --> 00:09:35.373
of an ecological civilization?

00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:38.511
Fourth, a redistribution of wealth.

00:09:38.535 --> 00:09:41.613

00:09:48.246 --> 00:09:51.820
reforming the ability
of equity across regions?

00:09:51.844 --> 00:09:55.639
And finally, fifth, a radical increase
in more education, health,

00:09:55.663 --> 00:09:57.196
access to work, contraception,

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.505
investing largely in women
across the world,
