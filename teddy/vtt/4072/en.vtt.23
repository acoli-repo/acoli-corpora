The earth system is still resilient.

00:11:32.207 --> 00:11:36.038
She is still providing us
with ecosystem services and functions

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:39.432
that can allow us a transition
back into a safe operating space.

00:11:39.456 --> 00:11:42.018
But we need radically different thinking.

00:11:42.042 --> 00:11:46.005
We need to see this
as an incredible wake-up call

00:11:46.029 --> 00:11:48.784
but also an opportunity
for transformative change,

00:11:48.808 --> 00:11:50.108
where we shift gears

00:11:50.132 --> 00:11:53.583
and really start thinking
of the SDGs as a transformative agenda

00:11:53.607 --> 00:11:55.912
within a safe operating space on earth.

00:11:55.936 --> 00:12:00.168
In other words, we can build
a safe and just world.
