00:07:58.119 --> 00:08:00.119
But what if we really go harder?

00:08:00.143 --> 00:08:04.844
What if we increase our ability
to deliver on our promises by 30 percent

00:08:04.868 --> 00:08:07.510
across all sectors in society,

00:08:07.534 --> 00:08:10.777
from climate to our trade agreements?

00:08:11.188 --> 00:08:15.428
A harder scenario would take us
a little bit better,

00:08:15.452 --> 00:08:18.423
but still, we're failing on the SDGs,

00:08:18.447 --> 00:08:22.434
and we are not accomplishing
a safe operating space for humanity.

00:08:22.458 --> 00:08:26.984
So this really led us to a quite
disappointing conclusion,

00:08:27.008 --> 00:08:32.457
that we will actually, even if we go
conventional futures, fail on the SDGs
