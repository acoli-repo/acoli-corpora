00:01:58.755 --> 00:02:01.512
Now, citizens across the world
have started to recognize

00:02:01.536 --> 00:02:04.583
that we're facing global
rising environmental risks;

00:02:04.607 --> 00:02:07.564
in fact, that a stable planet
is a prerequisite

00:02:07.588 --> 00:02:10.618
to have good human well-being on earth.

00:02:10.642 --> 00:02:15.119
We need to define a safe operating space
on a stable earth system,

00:02:15.143 --> 00:02:17.997
and the planetary boundary
framework was introduced

00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:20.122
by the scientific community in 2009

00:02:20.146 --> 00:02:21.964
to do exactly that.

00:02:22.393 --> 00:02:25.259
It has now been widely embraced
across the world

00:02:25.283 --> 00:02:27.634
in policy, business and communities

00:02:27.658 --> 00:02:29.988
as a framework for sustainable development
