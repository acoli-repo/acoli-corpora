00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and one of the delights of ethnographic research

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is the opportunity to live amongst those

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
who have not forgotten the old ways,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
who still feel their past in the wind,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
touch it in stones polished by rain,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
taste it in the bitter leaves of plants.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
or that in the Himalaya,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma,
