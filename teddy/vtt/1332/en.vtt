00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Climate change is already a heavy topic,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and it's getting heavier

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
because we're understanding

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that we need to do more than we are.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're understanding, in fact,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that those of us who live in the developed world

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
need to be really pushing towards eliminating our emissions.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That's, to put it mildly, not what's on the table now.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And it tends to feel a little overwhelming

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
when we look at what is there in reality today

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and the magnitude of the problem that we face.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And when we have overwhelming problems in front of us,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
we tend to seek simple answers.
