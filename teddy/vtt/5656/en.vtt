00:00:03.208 --> 00:00:05.976
Picture a world
with a variety of landforms.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.476
It has a dense atmosphere

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.559
within which winds
sweep across its surface

00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:11.143
and rain falls.

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:12.809
It has mountains and plains,

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:14.684
rivers, lakes and seas,

00:00:14.708 --> 00:00:17.976
sand dunes and some impact craters.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.018
Sounds like Earth, right?

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:21.809
This is Titan.

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:23.434
In August 1981,

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:27.684
Voyager 2 captured this image
of Saturn's largest moon.

00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:30.893
The Voyager missions have traveled
farther than ever before,
