00:00:57.793 --> 00:01:01.118
each letter was to represent
a single sound,

00:01:01.142 --> 00:01:06.345
and those which did not represent
any sound should be removed.

00:01:07.517 --> 00:01:09.972
This approach, the phonetic approach,

00:01:09.996 --> 00:01:13.613
which says we have to write
words as we pronounce them,

00:01:13.637 --> 00:01:18.346
both is and isn't at the root of spelling
as we practice it today.

00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:24.402
It is, because the Spanish language,
in contrast to English, French or others,

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:29.737
always strongly resisted
writing words too differently

00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:31.459
to how we pronounce them.
