in etymological dictionaries.

00:13:32.117 --> 00:13:35.124
A second objection will come
from those who say:

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:38.866
"If we simplify spelling,
we'll stop distinguishing

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:42.566
between words that differ
in just one letter."

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.680
That is true, but it's not a problem.

00:13:46.704 --> 00:13:51.680
Our language has homonyms,
words with more than one meaning,

00:13:51.704 --> 00:13:54.466
yet we don't confuse
the "banco" where we sit

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.562
with the "banco" where we deposit money,

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:59.835
or the "traje" that we wear
with the things we "trajimos."

00:13:59.859 --> 00:14:06.498
In the vast majority of situations,
context dispels any confusion.
