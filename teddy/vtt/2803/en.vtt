00:00:00.861 --> 00:00:05.222
We lost a lot of time at school
learning spelling.

00:00:05.964 --> 00:00:11.969
Kids are still losing a lot of time
at school with spelling.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:16.236
That's why I want to share
a question with you:

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.831
Do we need new spelling rules?

00:00:21.572 --> 00:00:23.866
I believe that yes, we do.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.520
Or even better, I think we need
to simplify the ones we already have.

00:00:29.187 --> 00:00:33.465
Neither the question nor the answer
are new in the Spanish language.
