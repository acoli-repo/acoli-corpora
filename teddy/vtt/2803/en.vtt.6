that in spelling, something fundamental
to our upbringing was at stake.

00:03:01.261 --> 00:03:03.562
Yet, I have the feeling

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:07.221
that teachers didn't ask themselves
why it was so important.

00:03:07.245 --> 00:03:10.373
In fact, they didn't ask themselves
a previous question:

00:03:10.397 --> 00:03:12.939
What is the purpose of spelling?

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:16.865
What do we need spelling for?

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:21.536
And the truth is, when someone
asks themselves this question,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.649
the answer is much simpler
and less momentous

00:03:24.673 --> 00:03:26.106
than we'd usually believe.

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:33.391
We use spelling to unify the way we write,
so we can all write the same way,
