Earlier, I mentioned this slightly
thoughtless insistence

00:06:01.635 --> 00:06:04.549
with which teachers pester and pester us

00:06:04.573 --> 00:06:06.073
over spelling.

00:06:06.097 --> 00:06:09.569
But the truth is,
things being as they are,

00:06:09.593 --> 00:06:11.885
this makes perfect sense.

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:17.248
In our society, spelling serves
as an index of privilege,

00:06:17.272 --> 00:06:21.660
separating the cultured from the brute,
the educated from the ignorant,

00:06:21.684 --> 00:06:26.672
independent of the content
that's being written.

00:06:26.696 --> 00:06:30.007
One can get or not get a job
