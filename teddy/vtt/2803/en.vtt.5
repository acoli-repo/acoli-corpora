I'm not here to tell you anything
you don't know from your own experience.

00:02:31.368 --> 00:02:34.317
We all went to school,

00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:38.988
we all invested big amounts
of learning time,

00:02:39.012 --> 00:02:43.710
big amounts of pliant,
childlike brain time

00:02:43.734 --> 00:02:45.341
in dictation,

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:50.396
in the memorization of spelling rules
filled, nevertheless, with exceptions.

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:54.706
We were told in many ways,
implicitly and explicitly,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.420
that in spelling, something fundamental
to our upbringing was at stake.
