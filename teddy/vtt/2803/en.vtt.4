That's how we have B's and V's that,
contrary to what many people believe,

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:06.039
were never differentiated
in Spanish pronunciation.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.508
That's how we wound up with G's,

00:02:08.532 --> 00:02:11.213
that are sometimes aspirated,
as in "gente,"

00:02:11.237 --> 00:02:13.618
and other times unaspirated, as in "gato."

00:02:13.642 --> 00:02:17.152
That's how we ended up
with C's, S's and Z's,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.218
three letters that in some places
correspond to one sound,

00:02:21.242 --> 00:02:24.207
and in others, to two,
but nowhere to three.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.778
I'm not here to tell you anything
you don't know from your own experience.
