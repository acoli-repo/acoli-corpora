The case of C, S and Z is interesting,

00:08:35.793 --> 00:08:39.630
because it shows that the phonetic
approach must be a guide,

00:08:39.654 --> 00:08:42.719
but it can't be an absolute principle.

00:08:42.743 --> 00:08:47.502
In some cases, the differences
in pronunciation must be addressed.

00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:50.432
As I said before, C, S and Z,

00:08:50.456 --> 00:08:53.798
in some places, correspond
to one sound, in others to two.

00:08:53.822 --> 00:08:59.008
If we go from three letters
to two, we're all better off.
