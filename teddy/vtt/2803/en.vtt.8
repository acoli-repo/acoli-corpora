With punctuation, I can impose
a particular rhythm to what I am writing,

00:04:01.546 --> 00:04:03.785
but not with spelling.

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:07.386
When it comes to spelling,
it's either wrong or right,

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.004
according to whether it conforms
or not to the current rules.

00:04:11.694 --> 00:04:17.048
But then, wouldn't it be more sensible
to simplify the current rules

00:04:17.072 --> 00:04:23.044
so it would be easier to teach, learn
and use spelling correctly?

00:04:23.678 --> 00:04:28.185
Wouldn't it be more sensible
to simplify the current rules

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:33.561
so that all the time we devote today
to teaching spelling,
