00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:33.561
so that all the time we devote today
to teaching spelling,

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:36.653
we could devote to other language issues

00:04:36.677 --> 00:04:40.644
whose complexities do, in fact,
deserve the time and effort?

00:04:42.433 --> 00:04:47.397
What I propose is not to abolish spelling,

00:04:47.421 --> 00:04:51.413
and have everyone write however they want.

00:04:51.878 --> 00:04:55.798
Language is a tool of common usage,

00:04:55.822 --> 00:05:01.154
and so I believe it's fundamental
that we use it following common criteria.
