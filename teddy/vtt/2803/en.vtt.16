00:07:57.743 --> 00:08:00.088
B and V, as we said before,

00:08:00.112 --> 00:08:02.982
were never differentiated
in the Spanish language --

00:08:03.006 --> 00:08:04.023
(Applause)

00:08:04.047 --> 00:08:07.352
Let's choose one; it could be either.
We can discuss it, talk it over.

00:08:07.376 --> 00:08:11.006
Everyone will have their preferences
and can make their arguments.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.874
Let's keep one, remove the other.

00:08:13.898 --> 00:08:16.905
G and J, let's separate their roles.

00:08:16.929 --> 00:08:21.351
G should keep the unaspirated sound,
like in "gato," "mago," and "águila,"

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:24.671
and J should keep the aspirated sound,

00:08:24.695 --> 00:08:29.589
as in "jarabe," "jirafa,"
"gente," "argentino."
