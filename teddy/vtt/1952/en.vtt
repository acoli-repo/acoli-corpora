Organic chemists make molecules,

00:00:03.378 --> 00:00:05.194
very complicated molecules,

00:00:05.194 --> 00:00:08.878
by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules

00:00:08.878 --> 00:00:10.739
and reverse engineering.

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:11.778
And as a chemist,

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:15.245
one of the things I wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is,

00:00:15.245 --> 00:00:19.396
could we make a really cool universal chemistry set?

00:00:19.396 --> 00:00:24.429
In essence, could we "app" chemistry?

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.612
Now what would this mean, and how would we do it?

00:00:27.612 --> 00:00:29.583
Well to start to do this,

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:31.315
we took a 3D printer
