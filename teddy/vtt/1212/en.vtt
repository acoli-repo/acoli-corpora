00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.079
I want to talk to you about something

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:04.341
kind of big.

00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:07.896
We'll start here.

00:00:09.577 --> 00:00:11.526
Sixty-five million years ago --

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.587
(Laughter)

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:15.650
the dinosaurs had a bad day.

00:00:15.674 --> 00:00:18.285
(Laughter)

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:21.584
A chunk of rock six miles across,

00:00:21.608 --> 00:00:25.349
moving something like 50 times
the speed of a rifle bullet,

00:00:25.373 --> 00:00:27.154
slammed into the Earth.

00:00:27.178 --> 00:00:29.634
It released its energy all at once,

00:00:29.658 --> 00:00:33.186
and it was an explosion
that was mind-numbing.
