In the next few minutes,

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.930
I hope to change the way you think about
the very nature of reality itself.

00:00:09.563 --> 00:00:12.697
I'm not a physicist,
and I'm not a philosopher.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:13.863
I'm a historian.

00:00:14.363 --> 00:00:18.230
And after studying the ancient Greeks
and many other premodern peoples

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.897
for more than 20 years as a professional,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.230
I've become convinced

00:00:23.197 --> 00:00:26.663
that they all lived in real worlds
very different from our own.

00:00:27.097 --> 00:00:29.630
Now, of course, you and I here today,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.430
we take it for granted
