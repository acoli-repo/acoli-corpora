This program has been
incredibly successful,

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.432
because it helped us overcome
a very difficult barrier

00:07:34.456 --> 00:07:37.601
when it came to getting kids
a nutritious breakfast.

00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:40.342
And that was the barrier of stigma.

00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:46.026
See, schools serve
breakfast before school,

00:07:47.778 --> 00:07:51.826
and it was only available
for the poor kids.

00:07:53.371 --> 00:07:56.700
So everybody knew who was poor
and who needed government help.

00:07:57.597 --> 00:08:02.397
Now, all kids, no matter how much
or how little their parents make,
