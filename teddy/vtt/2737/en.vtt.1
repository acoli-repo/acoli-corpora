00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:32.191
is to ask the right questions.

00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:34.634
So what are the right questions

00:00:34.658 --> 00:00:38.817
when it comes to improving
the educational outcomes for our children?

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:43.628
There's obviously
many important questions,

00:00:43.652 --> 00:00:46.124
but I think the following
is a good place to start:

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.090
What do we think the connection is

00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:52.533
between a child's growing mind

00:00:52.557 --> 00:00:53.949
and their growing body?

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.608
What can we expect our kids to learn

00:00:57.632 --> 00:01:01.641
if their diets are full of sugar
and empty of nutrients?
