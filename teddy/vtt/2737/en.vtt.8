00:03:57.967 --> 00:04:00.568
her kids' hunger pangs were so intense

00:04:00.592 --> 00:04:03.345
that they couldn't even begin
to think about learning.

00:04:04.356 --> 00:04:07.977
Food was the only thing on their mind.

00:04:10.714 --> 00:04:11.884
The only thing.

00:04:12.296 --> 00:04:15.463
And unfortunately, the stats --
they tell the same story.

00:04:16.071 --> 00:04:18.752
So, let's put this
into the context of a child.

00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:21.939
And we're going to focus on

00:04:21.963 --> 00:04:24.207
the most important meal

00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:25.542
Meet Allison.

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:27.070
She's 12 years old,

00:04:27.094 --> 00:04:28.750
she's smart as a whip

00:04:28.774 --> 00:04:31.537
and she wants to be a physicist
when she grows up.
