So I took on the TV accusatory judge thing
that you're supposed to do,

00:03:04.402 --> 00:03:06.240
and I asked her why she did that.

00:03:06.794 --> 00:03:10.113
Cheryl responded, "Well, first,
I don't know what quinoa is."

00:03:10.137 --> 00:03:11.197
(Laughter)

00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:15.237
"But I do know that it's a Monday,

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:18.618
and that in my school,
at High School in the Community,

00:03:18.642 --> 00:03:20.534
I always cook pasta."

00:03:21.116 --> 00:03:23.758
See, Cheryl explained
that for many of her kids,

00:03:24.574 --> 00:03:26.812
there were no meals on the weekends.

00:03:28.728 --> 00:03:30.438
No meals on Saturday.
