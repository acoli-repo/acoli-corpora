00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:09.284

And with all the resources
that we are pouring into schools,

00:01:13.988 --> 00:01:16.140
we should stop and ask ourselves:

00:01:16.164 --> 00:01:19.110
Are we really setting
our kids up for success?

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.824
Now, a few years ago,

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:26.002

competition called "Chopped."

00:01:26.598 --> 00:01:29.578
Four chefs compete
with mystery ingredients

00:01:29.602 --> 00:01:32.246
to see who can cook the best dishes.
