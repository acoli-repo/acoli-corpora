00:00:00.772 --> 00:00:02.312
I am a chef

00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:03.677
and a food policy guy,

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.072
but I come from a whole
family of teachers.

00:00:08.096 --> 00:00:11.391
My sister is a special ed
teacher in Chicago.

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:15.662
My father just retired
after 25 years teaching fifth grade.

00:00:16.177 --> 00:00:18.322
My aunt and uncle were professors.

00:00:18.346 --> 00:00:19.998
My cousins all teach.

00:00:20.022 --> 00:00:23.604
Everybody in my family, basically,
teaches except for me.

00:00:24.778 --> 00:00:29.622
They taught me that the only way
to get the right answers

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:32.191
is to ask the right questions.
