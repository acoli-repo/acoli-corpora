food stamps run out
or hours get cut at work,

00:07:03.346 --> 00:07:06.423
and they don't have the money
to cover the basic cost of food.

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:11.415
But we should be able
to solve this problem, right?

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:13.107
We know what the answers are.

00:07:13.917 --> 00:07:18.048
As part of my work at the White House,
we instituted a program

00:07:18.072 --> 00:07:21.566
that for all schools that had
40 percent more low-income kids,

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.514
we could serve breakfast and lunch
to every kid in that school.

00:07:26.272 --> 00:07:27.431
For free.

00:07:28.305 --> 00:07:30.356
This program has been
incredibly successful,
