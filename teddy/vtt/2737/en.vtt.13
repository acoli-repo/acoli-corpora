00:06:28.503 --> 00:06:32.612
diet and nutrition is the number one cause
of preventable death and disease

00:06:32.636 --> 00:06:34.339
in this country, by far.

00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:38.492
And fully a third of the kids
that we've been talking about tonight

00:06:38.516 --> 00:06:41.290
are on track to have diabetes
in their lifetime.

00:06:42.807 --> 00:06:45.189

to put together but is true

00:06:45.213 --> 00:06:47.756

these are the same children.

00:06:48.855 --> 00:06:51.754
So they fill up on the unhealthy
and cheap calories

00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:55.968
that surround them in their communities
and that their families can afford.

00:06:56.752 --> 00:06:58.709
But then by the end of the month,

00:06:59.757 --> 00:07:03.322
food stamps run out
or hours get cut at work,
