00:02:26.957 --> 00:02:30.174
But the dish that I will never forget
was cooked by a woman

00:02:30.198 --> 00:02:31.855
named Cheryl Barbara.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.613
Cheryl was the nutrition director

00:02:33.637 --> 00:02:36.001
at High School in the Community
in Connecticut.

00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:38.182
She cooked this delicious pasta.

00:02:38.206 --> 00:02:39.432
It was amazing.

00:02:39.456 --> 00:02:42.099
It was a pappardelle with Italian sausage,

00:02:42.123 --> 00:02:43.895
kale, Parmesan cheese.

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:47.178
It was delicious, like,
restaurant-quality good, except --

00:02:47.202 --> 00:02:50.962
she basically just threw the quinoa,
pretty much uncooked,

00:02:50.986 --> 00:02:52.164
into the dish.

00:02:52.553 --> 00:02:54.273
It was a strange choice,

00:02:54.297 --> 00:02:56.770
and it was super crunchy.

00:02:56.794 --> 00:02:59.436
(Laughter)

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.378
So I took on the TV accusatory judge thing
that you're supposed to do,
