00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.216
we still have very little new information.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.256
I do not know how much more
I will know in my lifetime.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.016
Yet as a scientist it is my duty

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.376
that I know so much new science
and I can tell people

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.640
so that the next generation
is able to discover further.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.756
There is only one criterion to check
the progress of man: science.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.656
If you know the universe closely

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.096
it’s a society that is close to science.
