16 square km so 4 kms
and 4 kms in a L shape.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.776
It takes a minimum
of seven to eight years to make one.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.176
But students today,

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.496
by the time you get
to the age of doing your PhD,

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.520
the detector would have begun.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.296
All those boys and girls in class
10, 11, 12 who are listening,

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.816
by the time you start your PhD
our LIGO observatory or lab

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.780
would be ready and you must
come and be a part of it.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.461
Thanks for coming here and sharing
such wonderful things.
