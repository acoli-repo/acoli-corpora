00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.556
but in that half second it
pulled the earth a bit.

00:03:33.736 --> 00:03:37.992
Which means all of us and all the animate

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.680
and inanimate things around us, living
and non-living got pulled a bit.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.496
If you could have heard these waves,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.920
the sound would have been scary,
something like this.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.260
(Blip, blip)

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.680
In the entire world, there
are just two recorders

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.100
that could hear this sound.
