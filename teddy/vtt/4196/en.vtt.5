00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.336
This black hole was about the size
of our Rajasthan,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.540
but it’s weight was sixty times
that of the Sun.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.776
Just think about it, it was so dense
that if you or even light went in,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.160
no power in the universe
could pull it out.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.896
What’s more, during this collision

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.336
so much energy was emitted that if we put
together all the stars in the universe

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.200
they would not be able
to create that much energy.
