00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.230
to understand all these questions,
an important way is through gravity.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.976
This is useful because only five percent
of the universe gives out light

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.056
which we can see and identify
as stars and galaxies.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.016
The other 95 percent is steeped
in complete darkness.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.496
No light can pass through that,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.360
no x-ray, no temperature sensor, no
kind of electromagnetic radiation.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.120
And the key to understanding
this dark universe is gravity.
