00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.470
roaming in the universe 
for millions of years.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.616
Finally on September 14, 2015

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.520

this wave from space came to earth.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.736
This wave lasted about half a second

but in that half second it
pulled the earth a bit.
