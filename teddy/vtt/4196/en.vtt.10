00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.496
When the universe
was created, the first cry,

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.680
the first sound
was through gravitational waves.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.656
We will be able to hear this
first song of the universe.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.480
Maybe we will finally get to know
how this great universe was created.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.280
Finding gravitational waves is a big,
significant step in the history of mankind

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.096
But of the 95 percent of the universe
still in darkness,

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.216
we still have very little new information.
