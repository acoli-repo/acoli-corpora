00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.096
it’s a society that is close to science.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.270
Thank you.

00:06:04.318 --> 00:06:08.998
(Applause)

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.536
SRK: So tell us this LIGO observatory or lab

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.136
by when will it get
created in our country?

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.536
KJ: LIGO detectors are at a very
large, extreme scale.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.216
One detector is 16 square kilometers.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.736
16 square km so 4 kms
and 4 kms in a L shape.
