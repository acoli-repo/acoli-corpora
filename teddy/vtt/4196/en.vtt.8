that could hear this sound.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.048
We call them LIGO, which stands for

00:04:04.048 --> 00:04:08.588
Laser Interferometer 
Gravitational Wave Observatory.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.336
They were waiting for these waves to come.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.959
These are the most sensitive
instruments created so far by mankind.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.560
Gravitational waves were predicted 


00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.560
100 years ago by the 
famous scientist, Albert Einstein.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.720
For our team to find both these things has
been the biggest find of this century.
