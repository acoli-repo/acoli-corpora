00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.696
One of the biggest advantages I had by
growing up in a small town in India was

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.856
that I could lie on the roof
at night and gaze at the stars

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.760
and look for answers
to the questions I had.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.976
Since then I have one question in life,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.870
that I am normal ordinary guy
with a life span of about 70-80 years,

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.976
how much will I understand
of this universe?

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.880
Will I be able to understand
why was this universe even born?

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.296
And then I realized

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.230
to understand all these questions,
an important way is through gravity.
