00:00:01.372 --> 00:00:07.295
So what you're seeing here
are pearl ponds in rural Zhejiang.

00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:09.964
And on the day that I visited,

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:14.218
the owner of these ponds was surprised
that anyone outside of her town,

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.054
let alone the pearl farming business,

00:00:16.054 --> 00:00:18.056
would want to know more about these ponds.

00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:23.436
70 percent of the world's pearls
are cultured and produced here.

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:28.733
And so each of these mussels,
they contain 40 to 50 pearls.

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.903
And the higher end ones are taken out,
sold as jewelry,
