00:01:26.697 --> 00:01:30.759
upon which you can add rhymes
and rhythms and chants.

00:01:30.783 --> 00:01:32.831
Those ropes created a space

00:01:32.855 --> 00:01:35.077
where we were able
to contribute to something

00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:37.211
that was far greater
than the neighborhood.

00:01:37.602 --> 00:01:41.288
Double Dutch jump rope remains
a powerful symbol of culture and identity

00:01:41.312 --> 00:01:42.465
for black women.

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:44.807
Back from the 1950s to the 1970s,

00:01:44.831 --> 00:01:46.966
girls weren't supposed to play sports.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.791
Boys played baseball,
basketball and football,

00:01:49.815 --> 00:01:51.156
and girls weren't allowed.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.704
A lot has changed, but in that era,

00:01:53.728 --> 00:01:55.569
girls would rule the playground.

00:01:55.593 --> 00:01:58.013
They'd make sure
that boys weren't a part of that.

00:01:58.037 --> 00:02:00.283
It's their space, it's a girl-power space.
