00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.243
That's the beginning of "Down down, baby,
down down the roller coaster,

00:02:32.267 --> 00:02:34.696
sweet, sweet baby, I'll never let you go."

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.569
All people who grew up
in any black urban community

00:02:37.593 --> 00:02:39.878
would know that music.

00:02:39.902 --> 00:02:42.124
And so, it was a ready-made hit.

00:02:42.656 --> 00:02:46.775
The Double Dutch rope playing
helped maintain these songs

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.800
and helped maintain the chants
and the gestures that go along with it,

00:02:50.824 --> 00:02:54.831
which is very natural
to what I call "kinetic orality" --

00:02:54.855 --> 00:02:56.656
word of mouth and word of body.

00:02:57.133 --> 00:03:00.006
It's the thing that gets
passed down over generations.
