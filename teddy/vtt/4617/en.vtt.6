It's the thing that gets
passed down over generations.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.961
In some ways, the rope
is the thing that helps carry it.

00:03:03.696 --> 00:03:06.569
You need some object
to carry memory through.

00:03:06.943 --> 00:03:10.887
So, a jump rope, you can use it
for all different kinds of things.

00:03:10.911 --> 00:03:12.466
It crosses cultures.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.495
And I think it lasted
because people need to move.

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.906
And I think sometimes the simplest objects
can make the most creative uses.
