00:00:00.206 --> 00:00:02.666
If you do it right, it should sound like:

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.569
TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat,
TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat.

00:00:06.593 --> 00:00:08.300
If you do it wrong, it sounds like:

00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:09.823
Tick-TAT, tick-TAT, tick-TAT.

00:00:09.848 --> 00:00:12.699
[Small thing. Big idea.]

00:00:13.574 --> 00:00:15.460
[Kyra Gaunt on
the Jump Rope]

00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.754
The jump rope is such a simple object.

00:00:19.918 --> 00:00:22.517
It can be made out of rope,
a clothesline, twine.

00:00:22.541 --> 00:00:25.067
It has, like, a twirl on it. (Laughs)

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:26.863
I'm not sure how to describe that.

00:00:26.887 --> 00:00:29.392
What's important
is that it has a certain weight,

00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:32.793
and that they have
that kind of whip sound.
