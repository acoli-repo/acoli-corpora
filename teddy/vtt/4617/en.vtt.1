00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:32.793
and that they have
that kind of whip sound.

00:00:32.817 --> 00:00:36.615
It's not clear what the origin
of the jump rope is.

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:40.575
There's some evidence
that it began in ancient Egypt, Phoenicia,

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:44.671
and then it most likely traveled
to North America with Dutch settlers.

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:49.333
The rope became a big thing
when women's clothes became more fitted

00:00:49.357 --> 00:00:51.635
and the pantaloon came into being.

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:54.539
And so, girls were able to jump rope

00:00:54.563 --> 00:00:57.269
because their skirts
wouldn't catch the ropes.

00:00:57.293 --> 00:01:01.173
Governesses used it
to train their wards to jump rope.
