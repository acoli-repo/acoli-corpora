Governesses used it
to train their wards to jump rope.

00:01:01.197 --> 00:01:04.438
Even formerly enslaved African children
in the antebellum South

00:01:04.462 --> 00:01:05.904
jumped rope, too.

00:01:05.928 --> 00:01:10.539
In the 1950s, in Harlem,
Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens,

00:01:10.563 --> 00:01:15.039
you could see on the sidewalk,
lots of girls playing with ropes.

00:01:15.063 --> 00:01:18.785
Sometimes they would take two ropes
and turn them as a single rope together,

00:01:18.809 --> 00:01:22.595
but you could separate them and turn
them in like an eggbeater on each other.

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.132
The skipping rope
was like a steady timeline --

00:01:25.156 --> 00:01:26.673
tick, tick, tick, tick --

00:01:26.697 --> 00:01:30.759
upon which you can add rhymes
and rhythms and chants.
