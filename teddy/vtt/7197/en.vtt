Have you ever taken
your 3-D glasses off at the cinema?

00:00:06.596 --> 00:00:07.996
The picture looks blurry

00:00:07.996 --> 00:00:11.836
and it can be difficult to see
exactly what is happening.

00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:18.796
This is because 3-D glasses
trick our brain into forming a 3-D image

00:00:18.836 --> 00:00:22.156

of the light that each sees

00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:24.996
using a different filter in each lens.
