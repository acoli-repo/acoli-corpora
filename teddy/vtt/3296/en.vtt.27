inadvertently favoring
male entrepreneurs over female ones.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.456
So to my investors out there,

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.296
I would offer that you have
an opportunity here

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.816
to approach Q&amp;A sessions
more even-handedly,

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.296
not just so that you
could do the right thing,

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.280
but so that you can improve
the quality of your decision making.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.176
By flashing the same light
on every start-up's potential

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.056
for gains and losses,

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.016
you enable all deserving
start-ups to shine

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.600
and you maximize returns in the process.
