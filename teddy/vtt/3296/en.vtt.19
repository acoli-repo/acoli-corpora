00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.560
but also how much funding the start-ups
went on to raise in the open market.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.936
Those start-ups who were asked
predominantly promotion questions

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.056
went on to raise
seven times as much funding

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.040
as those asked prevention questions.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.056
But I didn't stop there.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.736
I then moved on to analyze entrepreneurs'
responses to those questions,

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.696
and I found that entrepreneurs
are apt to respond in kind

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.296
to the questions they get,

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.456
meaning a promotion question
begets a promotion response

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.616
and a prevention question
begets a prevention response.
