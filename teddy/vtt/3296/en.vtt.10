your investors' money.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.656
So it makes sense that women
would be getting less funding than men

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.936
if they're engaging

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.776
in prevention as opposed to
promotion-oriented dialogues.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.336
Well, I got the chance
to test this hypothesis

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.416
on companies with similar quality
and funding needs across all years

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.856

known as TechCrunch Disrupt

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.576
Startup Battlefield has run
in New York City

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.920
since its inception in 2010.
