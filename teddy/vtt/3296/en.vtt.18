00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.176
and then turned around and asked
female entrepreneurs prevention questions

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.840
just like the male VCs did.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.496
So given the fact
that both male and female VCs

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.576
are displaying this implicit gender bias,

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.480
what effect, if any, does this have
on start-up funding outcomes?

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.560
My research shows
it has a significant effect.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.816
The regulatory focus of investor questions

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.496
not only predicted
how well the start-ups would perform

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.176
at the TechCrunch Disrupt competitions

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.560
but also how much funding the start-ups
went on to raise in the open market.
