00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.016
I also gathered background information

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.096
on the start-ups and entrepreneurs
that can affect their funding outcomes,

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.176
like the start-up's age,
quality and funding needs

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.376
and the entrepreneur's past experience,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.040
so I could use these data points
as controls in my analysis.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.976
Well, the very first thing that I found

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.616
is that there's no difference in the way
entrepreneurs present their companies.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.736
In other words, both male
and female entrepreneurs

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.056
use similar degrees
of promotion and prevention language

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.976
in their actual pitches.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.016
So having ruled out this difference
on the entrepreneur's side,
