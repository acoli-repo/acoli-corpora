I had each of the questions
and answers manually coded

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.200
by the Tory Higgins
Research Lab at Columbia.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.936
Regardless of the topic at hand,

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.816
an intention can be framed
in promotion or prevention.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.400
Let's take that topic of customers
I mentioned briefly earlier.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.416
A promotion-coded question sounds like,

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.776
"How many new customers
do you plan to acquire this year?"

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.016
while a prevention-coded one sounds like,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.360
"How do you plan to retain
your existing customers?"

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.576
During the same time,

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.016
I also gathered background information
