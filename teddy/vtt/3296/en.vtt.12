Well, it took a while,

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.216
but I got my hands on all the videos of
both the pitches and the Q and A sessions

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.840
from TechCrunch,
and I had them transcribed.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.456
I first analyzed the transcripts

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.136
by loading a dictionary
of regulatory-focused terms

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.216
into the Linguistic Inquiry
and Word Count software called LIWC.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.856
This LIWC software
generated the frequencies

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.896
of promotion and prevention words
in the transcribed text.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.416
As a second method,

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.376
I had each of the questions
and answers manually coded
