00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.936
A promotion focus is concerned with gains

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.096
and emphasizes hopes, accomplishments
and advancement needs,

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.776
while a prevention focus
is concerned with losses

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.480
and emphasizes safety,
responsibility and security needs.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.256
Since the best-case scenario
for a prevention focus

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.096
is to simply maintain the status quo,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.776
this has us treading water
just to stay afloat,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.616
while a promotion focus instead
has us swimming in the right direction.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.640
It's just a matter
of how far we can advance.
