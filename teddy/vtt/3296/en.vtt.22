WEBVTT

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.976
went on to raise 14 times more funding

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.256
than those who responded
to prevention questions

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.520
with prevention answers.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.336
So what this means
is that if you're asked a question

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.136
about defending
your start-up's market share,

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.816
you'd be better served
to frame your response

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.736
around the size and growth potential
of the overall pie

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.016
as opposed to how you merely plan
to protect your sliver of that pie.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.936
So if I get asked this question,

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.216
I would say,

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.976
"We're playing in such a large
and fast-growing market

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.416
that's bound to attract new entrants.
