and at least have a chance

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.376
But what if there are subtle differences

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.720
in the interactions
between investors and entrepreneurs

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.936
that can affect their outcomes,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.056
differences that we're not conscious of,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.160
that we can't directly see or hear?

I spent five years running
and raising money for my own start-up.
