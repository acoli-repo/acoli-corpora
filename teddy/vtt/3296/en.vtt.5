00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.376
I got asked just about everything
that could go wrong with the venture

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.536
to induce investor losses,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.376
while my male cofounder was asked
about our venture's home run potential

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.776
to maximize investor gains,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.656
essentially everything
that could go right with the venture.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.856
He got asked how many new customers
we were going to bring on,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.816
while I got asked how we were going
to hang on to the ones we already had.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.216
Well, as the CEO of the company,
I found this to be rather odd.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.080
In fact, I felt like
I was taking crazy pills.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.416
But I eventually
rationalized it by thinking,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.896
maybe this has to do
with how I'm presenting myself,
