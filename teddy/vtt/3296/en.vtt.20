00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.616
and a prevention question
begets a prevention response.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.456
Now, this might make
intuitive sense to all of us here,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.880
but it has some unfortunate consequences
in this context of venture funding.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.056
So what ends up happening

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.416
is that a male entrepreneur
gets asked a promotion question,

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.096
granting him the luxury
to reinforce his association

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.216
with the favorable domain
of gains by responding in kind,

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.576
while a female entrepreneur
gets asked a prevention question

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.376
and inadvertently
aggravates her association

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.496
with the unfavorable domain
of losses by doing so.
