I expected the birds-of-a-feather
theory of homophily to hold here,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.456
meaning that male VCs
would favor male entrepreneurs

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.216
with promotion questions

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.880
and female VCs would do the same
for female entrepreneurs.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:47.056
But instead, all VCs displayed
the same implicit gender bias

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.656
manifested in the regulatory focus
of the questions they posed

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.720
to male versus female candidates.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.496
So female VCs asked
male entrepreneurs promotion questions

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.176
and then turned around and asked
female entrepreneurs prevention questions
