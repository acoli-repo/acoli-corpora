00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.336
We can use that buffer.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.056
Instead of lashing out,
we can pause, breathe,

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.256
change the subject or walk away,

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.720
and then come back to it when we're ready.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.400
And finally ...

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.960
make the argument.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.416
This might seem obvious,

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.016
but one side effect
of having strong beliefs

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.656
is that we sometimes assume

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.776
that the value of our position
is or should be obvious and self-evident,

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.016
that we shouldn't
have to defend our positions

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.136
because they're so clearly right and good
