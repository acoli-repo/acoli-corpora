00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.616
I was a blue-eyed,
chubby-cheeked five-year-old

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.760
when I joined my family
on the picket line for the first time.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.960
My mom made me leave
my dolls in the minivan.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.896
I'd stand on a street corner
in the heavy Kansas humidity,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.536
surrounded by a few dozen relatives,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.680
with my tiny fists clutching
a sign that I couldn't read yet:

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.280
"Gays are worthy of death."

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.320
This was the beginning.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.256
Our protests soon became
a daily occurrence

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.216
and an international phenomenon,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.696
and as a member
of Westboro Baptist Church,
