00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.416
the same rabbi that I'd protested
three years earlier

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.640
with a sign that said,
"Your rabbi is a whore."

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.856
We spent long hours talking
about theology and Judaism and life

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.096
while we washed dishes
in their kosher kitchen

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.840
and chopped vegetables for dinner.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.160
They treated us like family.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.736
They held nothing against us,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.600
and again I was astonished.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.456
That period was full of turmoil,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.776
but one part I've returned to often

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.680
is a surprising realization
I had during that time --

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.776
that it was a relief and a privilege
to let go of the harsh judgments
