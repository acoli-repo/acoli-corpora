00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.176
would come out
to the picket line to see me

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.680
when I protested in their city.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.880
A man named David was one such person.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.960
He ran a blog called "Jewlicious,"

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.896
and after several months
of heated but friendly arguments online,

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.320
he came out to see me
at a picket in New Orleans.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.576
He brought me a Middle Eastern dessert
from Jerusalem, where he lives,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.856
and I brought him kosher chocolate

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.936
and held a "God hates Jews" sign.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.016
(Laughter)

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.096
There was no confusion
about our positions,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.280
but the line between friend and foe
was becoming blurred.
