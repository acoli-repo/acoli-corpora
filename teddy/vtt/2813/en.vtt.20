00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.480
we give our minds a much stronger
framework for dialogue.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.000
The second is ask questions.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.336
When we engage people
across ideological divides,

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.816
asking questions
helps us map the disconnect

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.640
between our differing points of view.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.096
That's important because
we can't present effective arguments

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.480
if we don't understand where
the other side is actually coming from

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.440
and because it gives them an opportunity
to point out flaws in our positions.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.536
But asking questions
serves another purpose;

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.040
it signals to someone
that they're being heard.
