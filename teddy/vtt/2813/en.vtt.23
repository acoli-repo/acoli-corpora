00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.536

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.760
or gently excuse himself
from the conversation.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.416
We knew the discussion wasn't over,

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.760
just paused for a time
to bring us back to an even keel.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.776
People often lament that digital
communication makes us less civil,

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.040
but this is one advantage that online
conversations have over in-person ones.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.296

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.640
between us and the people
whose ideas we find so frustrating.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.336
We can use that buffer.
