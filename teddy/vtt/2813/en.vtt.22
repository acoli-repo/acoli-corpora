At Westboro, I learned not to care
how my manner of speaking affected others.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.096
I thought my rightness
justified my rudeness --

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:07.856
harsh tones, raised voices,
insults, interruptions --

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.320
but that strategy
is ultimately counterproductive.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.736
Dialing up the volume and the snark
is natural in stressful situations,

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.760
but it tends to bring the conversation
to an unsatisfactory, explosive end.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.856
When my husband was still
just an anonymous Twitter acquaintance,

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.736
our discussions frequently
became hard and pointed,

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.720
but we always refused to escalate.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.296
Instead, he would change the subject.
