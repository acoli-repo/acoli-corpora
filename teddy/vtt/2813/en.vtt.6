00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.280
but the line between friend and foe
was becoming blurred.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.056
We'd started to see each other
as human beings,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.280
and it changed the way

It took time,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.560

the death penalty for gays

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.600
when Jesus said, "Let he who is
without sin cast the first stone?"

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.736
How could we claim to love our neighbor
