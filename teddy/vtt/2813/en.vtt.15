00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.296
Even when someone does call for empathy
and understanding for the other side,

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.216
the conversation nearly always devolves

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.480
into a debate about
who deserves more empathy.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.216
And just as I learned to do,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.776
we routinely refuse to acknowledge
the flaws in our positions

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.440
or the merits in our opponent's.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.000
Compromise is anathema.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.720
We even target people on our own side
when they dare to question the party line.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.296
This path has brought us cruel,
sniping, deepening polarization,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.920
and even outbreaks of violence.
