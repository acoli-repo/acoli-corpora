00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.776
that we were constantly
at odds with the world,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.599
and that reinforced
our otherness on a daily basis.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.256
"Make a difference
between the unclean and the clean,"

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.616
the verse says,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.976
and so we did.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.136
From baseball games to military funerals,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.936
we trekked across the country
with neon protest signs in hand

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.936
to tell others exactly
how "unclean" they were

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.680
and exactly why
they were headed for damnation.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.800
This was the focus of our whole lives.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.520
This was the only way for me to do good
in a world that sits in Satan's lap.
