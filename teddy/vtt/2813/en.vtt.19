that even when my words
were aggressive and offensive,

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.576
I sincerely believed
I was doing the right thing.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.576
Assuming ill motives
almost instantly cuts us off

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.896
from truly understanding
why someone does and believes as they do.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.656
We forget that they're a human being

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.656
with a lifetime of experience
that shaped their mind,

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.376
and we get stuck
on that first wave of anger,

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.000
and the conversation has a very hard time
ever moving beyond it.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.456
But when we assume good or neutral intent,

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.480
we give our minds a much stronger
framework for dialogue.
