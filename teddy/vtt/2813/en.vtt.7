How could we claim to love our neighbor

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.360
while at the same time
praying for God to destroy them?

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.696
The truth is that the care shown to me
by these strangers on the internet

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.440
was itself a contradiction.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.456
It was growing evidence

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.960

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.200
These realizations were life-altering.

the ultimate arbiters of divine truth

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.296
but flawed human beings,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.880
I couldn't pretend otherwise.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.896
I couldn't justify our actions --
