00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.696
and as a member
of Westboro Baptist Church,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.856
I became a fixture
on picket lines across the country.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.216
The end of my antigay picketing career

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.656
and life as I knew it,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.336
came 20 years later,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.856
triggered in part by strangers on Twitter

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.560
who showed me the power
of engaging the other.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.496
In my home,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.640
life was framed as an epic
spiritual battle between good and evil.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.776
The good was my church and its members,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.720
and the evil was everyone else.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.336
My church's antics were such

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.776
that we were constantly
at odds with the world,
