that it was a relief and a privilege
to let go of the harsh judgments

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.720
that instinctively ran through my mind
about nearly every person I saw.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.400
I realized that now I needed to learn.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.280
I needed to listen.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.656
This has been at the front
of my mind lately,

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.616
because I can't help but see
in our public discourse

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.640
so many of the same destructive impulses
that ruled my former church.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.496
We celebrate tolerance and diversity
more than at any other time in memory,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.760
and still we grow more and more divided.
