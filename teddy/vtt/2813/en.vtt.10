00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.600
but so many embraced me
with open arms anyway.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.896
I wrote an apology
for the harm I'd caused,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.360
but I also knew that an apology
could never undo any of it.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.216
All I could do was try to build a new life

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.640
and find a way somehow
to repair some of the damage.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.936
People had every reason
to doubt my sincerity,

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.200
but most of them didn't.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.080

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.896
given my history,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.856
it was more than I could've hoped for --

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.336
forgiveness and the benefit of the doubt.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.600
It still amazes me.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.080
I spent my first year away from home
