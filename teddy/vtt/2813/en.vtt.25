because they're so clearly right and good

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.736
that if someone doesn't get it,
it's their problem --

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.680
that it's not my job to educate them.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.896
But if it were that simple,

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.720
we would all see things the same way.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.816
As kind as my friends on Twitter were,

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.216
if they hadn't actually
made their arguments,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.800
it would've been so much harder for me
to see the world in a different way.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.376
We are all a product of our upbringing,

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.920
and our beliefs reflect our experiences.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.080
We can't expect others
to spontaneously change their own minds.
