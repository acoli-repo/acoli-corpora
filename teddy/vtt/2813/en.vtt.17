00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.576
that sense of certainty
that ours is the right side,

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.159
is so seductive.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.256
It's hard because it means
extending empathy and compassion

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.799
to people who show us
hostility and contempt.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.559
The impulse to respond in kind
is so tempting,

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.296
but that isn't who we want to be.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.976
We can resist.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.456
And I will always be inspired to do so
by those people I encountered on Twitter,

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.176
apparent enemies
who became my beloved friends.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.616
And in the case of one particularly
understanding and generous guy,

00:08:58.640 --> 00:08:59.840
my husband.
