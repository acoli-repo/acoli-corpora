I know that some might not have
the time or the energy or the patience

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.816
for extensive engagement,

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.896
but as difficult as it can be,

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.416
reaching out to someone we disagree with

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.720
is an option that is
available to all of us.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.096
And I sincerely believe
that we can do hard things,

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.760
not just for them
but for us and our future.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.976
Escalating disgust
and intractable conflict

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.136
are not what we want for ourselves,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.416
or our country

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.640
or our next generation.
