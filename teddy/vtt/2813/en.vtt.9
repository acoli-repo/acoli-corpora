00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.576
I wanted to hide
from the judgement of my family,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.816
who I knew would never
speak to me again --

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.760
people whose thoughts and opinions
had meant everything to me.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.656
And I wanted to hide from the world
I'd rejected for so long --

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.416
people who had no reason at all
to give me a second chance

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.400
after a lifetime of antagonism.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.176
And yet, unbelievably,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.656
they did.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.056
The world had access to my past
because it was all over the internet --

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.456
thousands of tweets
and hundreds of interviews,

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.976
everything from local TV news
to "The Howard Stern Show" --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.600
but so many embraced me
with open arms anyway.
