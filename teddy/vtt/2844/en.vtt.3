00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:30.937
The first time I heard "mental health,"

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.843
I was a boarding school student
fresh off the boat from Ghana,

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:37.798
at the Peddie School in New Jersey.

00:01:39.067 --> 00:01:42.473
I had just gone through
the brutal experience

00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:45.050
of losing seven loved ones
in the same month.

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.025
The school nurse,

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.113
concerned about what I'd gone
through -- God bless her soul --

00:01:52.137 --> 00:01:54.087
she inquired about my mental health.

00:01:55.426 --> 00:01:57.409
"Is she mental?" I thought.

00:01:58.214 --> 00:02:00.658
Does she not know I'm an African man?
