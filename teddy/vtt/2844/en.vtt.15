00:07:29.878 --> 00:07:32.065
but we Africans especially --

00:07:32.955 --> 00:07:38.862
need to realize that our mental struggles
do not detract from our virility,

00:07:38.886 --> 00:07:41.777
nor does our trauma taint our strength.

00:07:42.936 --> 00:07:47.645
We need to see mental health
as important as physical health.

00:07:48.583 --> 00:07:52.986
We need to stop suffering in silence.

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:57.577
We must stop stigmatizing disease

00:07:57.601 --> 00:07:59.807
and traumatizing the afflicted.
