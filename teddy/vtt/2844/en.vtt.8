00:03:57.812 --> 00:04:00.833
in a country of almost 200 million.

00:04:02.422 --> 00:04:03.891
In all of Africa,

00:04:03.915 --> 00:04:07.818
90 percent of our people
lack access to treatment.

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:10.434
As a result,

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:13.462
we suffer in solitude,

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:15.930
silenced by stigma.

00:04:17.498 --> 00:04:22.173
We as Africans often respond
to mental health with distance,

00:04:22.844 --> 00:04:24.046
ignorance,

00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:25.713
guilt,

00:04:26.134 --> 00:04:27.340
fear

00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.220
and anger.
