On other days,

00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:35.545
I just wanted to lay in my bed and cry.

00:00:36.658 --> 00:00:41.907
My doctor asked if I'd like to speak
with a mental health professional

00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:44.034
about my stress and anxiety.

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.071
Mental health?

00:00:46.972 --> 00:00:50.862
I clammed up and violently
shook my head in protest.

00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:56.997
I felt a profound sense of a shame.

00:00:58.413 --> 00:01:01.851
I felt the weight of stigma.
