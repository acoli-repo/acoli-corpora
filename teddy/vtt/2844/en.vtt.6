According to the World
Health Organization,

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:13.280
mental health is about being able to cope

00:03:13.304 --> 00:03:15.003
with the normal stressors of life;

00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:19.364
to work productively and fruitfully;

00:03:19.388 --> 00:03:23.015
and to be able to make
a contribution to your community.

00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:30.113
Mental health includes our emotional,
psychological and social well-being.
