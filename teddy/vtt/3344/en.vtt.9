00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.256
we were able to persevere through them
to get the test results that we wanted.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.216
And moreover, not only were we able
to create activated carbon

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.496
for purifying water,

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.976
but we were also able
to reduce Styrofoam waste,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.760
solving two global problems
with just one solution.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.256
So from then on, we were inspired
to take our project further,

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.496
performing more tests
to make it more effective

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.856
and testing it in real world situations.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.616
We then proceeded to receive funding

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.616
from the NSTA's eCYBERMISSION
STEM-in-Action program

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.376
sponsored by the US Army,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.776
as well as FIRST Global Innovation Awards

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.080
sponsored by XPRIZE.
