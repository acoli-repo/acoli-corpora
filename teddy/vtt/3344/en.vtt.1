Flames were pouring out,

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.936
smoke was in the air

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.176
and it looked like our wooden deck
was about to catch fire.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.016
I immediately started yelling.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.536
My mom was freaking out,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.656
my dad ran around to put out the fire

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.816

started recording a Snapchat video.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.736

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.960
This was just the beginning
of my team's science project.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.136
My team is composed of me
and three other students

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.840
who are here in the audience today.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.296
We competed in FIRST LEGO League

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.856
which is an international
LEGO robotics competition for kids,
