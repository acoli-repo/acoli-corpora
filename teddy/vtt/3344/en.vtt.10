00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.080
sponsored by XPRIZE.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.896
And we were also honored

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.696
with the Scientific American
Innovator Award

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.960
from Google Science Fair.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.936
And using these funds, we plan
to file a full patent on our process

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.840
and to continue to work on our project.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.616
So yes, although we started
with catching my dad's grill on fire

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.136
and failing so many times
that we almost quit,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.696
it was well worth it
when we look back at it now.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.536
We took a problem
that many people said was impossible

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.056
and we made it possible,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.336
and we persevered when it looked
like nothing that we did would work.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.456
We learned that you can't have success
