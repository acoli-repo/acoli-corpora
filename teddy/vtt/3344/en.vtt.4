00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.440
So why do we have these ghost
accumulations of Styrofoam waste?

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.840
Why can't we just recycle them
like many plastics?

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.816
Well, simply put, recycled
polystyrene is too expensive

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.416
and potentially contaminated,

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.656
so there is very little market demand
for Styrofoam that has to be recycled.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.216
And as a result, Styrofoam
is considered a nonrenewable material,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.000
because it is neither feasible
nor viable to recycle polystyrene.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.176
And in fact, many cities across the US

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.616
have even passed ordinances

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.256
that simply ban the production
of many products containing polystyrene,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.336
which includes disposable utensils,
