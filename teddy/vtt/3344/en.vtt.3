00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.520
You end up with a block of Styrofoam
bigger than the TV itself.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.536
Drink a cup of coffee?

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.736
Well, those Styrofoam coffee cups
are sure going to add up.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.136
And where do all these items go
after their one-time use?

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.576
Since there aren't any good
existing solutions for used Styrofoam,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.136
almost all of them
end up right in the landfill,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.496
or the oceans and beaches,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.216
taking over 500 years to degrade.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.456
And in fact, every year, the US alone

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.136
produces over two billion
pounds of Styrofoam,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.336
filling up a staggering
25 percent of landfills.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.440
So why do we have these ghost
accumulations of Styrofoam waste?
