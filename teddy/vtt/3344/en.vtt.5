00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.336
which includes disposable utensils,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.536
packing peanuts, takeout containers

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.696
and even plastic beach toys,

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.696
all products that are very useful
in today's society.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.896
And now France
has become the first country

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.176
to completely ban all plastic utensils,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.800
cups and plates.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.696
But what if we could keep using Styrofoam

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.456
and keep benefiting
from its cheap, lightweight, insulating

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.216
and excellent packing ability,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.576
while not having to suffer
from the repercussions

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.920
of having to dispose of it?

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.816
What if we could turn it into
something else that's actually useful?
