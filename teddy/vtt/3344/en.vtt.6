What if we could turn it into
something else that's actually useful?

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.400
What if we could make
the impossible possible?

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.976
My team hypothesized that we could use
the carbon that's already in Styrofoam

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.696
to create activated carbon,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.080
which is used in almost
every water filter today.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.096
And activated carbon works
by using very small micropores

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.080
to filter out contaminants
from water or even air.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.016
So we started out
by doing a variety of heating tests,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.120
and unfortunately, we had many failures.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.176
Literally, nothing worked.
