00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.176
Literally, nothing worked.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.456
Besides my dad's grill catching on fire,

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.136
most of our samples
vaporized into nothing,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.576
or exploded inside expensive furnaces,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.840
leaving a horribly sticky mess.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.040
In fact, we were so saddened
by our failures that we almost gave up.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.696
So why did we keep trying

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.096
when all the adults
said it was impossible?

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.040
Well, maybe it's because we're kids.
We don't know any better.

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:56.256
But the truth is, we kept trying
because we thought it was still possible.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.976
We knew that if we were successful,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.416
we would be helping the environment
and making the world a better place.
