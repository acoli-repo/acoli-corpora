00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.416
we would be helping the environment
and making the world a better place.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.096
So we kept trying

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.856
and failing

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.536
and trying

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.136
and failing.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.800
We were so ready to give up.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.216
But then it happened.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.936
With the right temperatures,
times and chemicals,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.216
we finally got that successful test result

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.055
showing us that we had created
activated carbon from Styrofoam waste.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.656
And at that moment,
the thing that had been impossible

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.920
all of a sudden wasn't.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.536
It showed us that although we had
many failures at the beginning,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.256
we were able to persevere through them
to get the test results that we wanted.
