00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.856
which is an international
LEGO robotics competition for kids,

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.736
and in addition to a robotics game,

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.136
we also worked
on a separate science project,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.856
and this was the project
that we were working on.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.856
So the idea for this project all started

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.136
when a few months earlier,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.976
a couple of my teammates
took a trip to Central America

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.496
and saw beaches littered with Styrofoam,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.480
or expanded polystyrene foam.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.176
And when they came back
and told us about it,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.896
we really started thinking about the ways
in which we see Styrofoam every day.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.536
Get a new flat-screen TV?

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.520
You end up with a block of Styrofoam
bigger than the TV itself.
