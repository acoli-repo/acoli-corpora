00:00:00.754 --> 00:00:02.810
Growing up in Taiwan

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.422
as the daughter of a calligrapher,

00:00:04.422 --> 00:00:06.790
one of my most treasured memories

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.883
was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape

00:00:09.883 --> 00:00:12.516
and the form of Chinese characters.

00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:15.023
Ever since then, I was fascinated

00:00:15.023 --> 00:00:17.685
by this incredible language.

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:20.420
But to an outsider, it seems to be

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.929
as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China.

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.304
Over the past few years, I've been wondering

00:00:26.304 --> 00:00:28.356
if I can break down this wall,

00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:30.950
so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate
