Though, I do know what this means --
I think you do too.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.375
[it's a penis]

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.760
(Laughter)

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.696
I have been studying sexting since
the media attention to it began in 2008.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.696
I wrote a book on the moral
panic about sexting.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.336
And here's what I found:

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.576
most people are worrying
about the wrong thing.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.776
They're trying to just prevent
sexting from happening entirely.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.336
But let me ask you this:

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.216
As long as it's completely consensual,
what's the problem with sexting?
