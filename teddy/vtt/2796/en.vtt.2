As long as it's completely consensual,
what's the problem with sexting?

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.256
People are into all sorts of things
that you may not be into,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.576
like blue cheese or cilantro.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.240
(Laughter)

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.736
Sexting is certainly risky,
like anything that's fun,

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.456
but as long as you're not sending an image
to someone who doesn't want to receive it,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.256
there's no harm.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.896
What I do think is a serious problem

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.176
is when people share
private images of others

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.720
without their permission.
