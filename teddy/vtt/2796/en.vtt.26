If you're trying to figure out
what to say instead, try this.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.680
Imagine you've run into your friend
who broke their leg skiing.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.816
They took a risk to do something fun,
and it didn't end well.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.376
But you're probably
not going to be the jerk who says,

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.840
"Well, I guess you shouldn't
have gone skiing then."

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.216
If we think more about consent,

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.496
we can see that victims
of privacy violations

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.256
deserve our compassion,

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.880
not criminalization, shaming,
harassment or punishment.
