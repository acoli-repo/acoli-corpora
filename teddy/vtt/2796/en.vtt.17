I still hear people
asking me all the time,

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:37.416
isn't a digital image somehow blurring
the line between public and private

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.080
because it's digital, right?

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.936
No! No!

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.296
Everything digital
is not just automatically public.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.216
That doesn't make any sense.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.736
As NYU legal scholar
Helen Nissenbaum tells us,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.376
we have laws and policies and norms

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.536
that protect all kinds
of information that's private,

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.976
and it doesn't make a difference
if it's digital or not.
