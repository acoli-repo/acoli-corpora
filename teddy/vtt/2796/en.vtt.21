These individual changes can really
help us protect each other's privacy,

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.840
but we need technology companies
on board as well.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.856
These companies have very little
incentive to help protect our privacy

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.176
because their business models
depend on us sharing everything

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.440
with as many people as possible.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.016
Right now, if I send you an image,

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.136
you can forward that
to anyone that you want.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.416
But what if I got to decide
if that image was forwardable or not?

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.496
This would tell you, you don't
have my permission to send this image out.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.656
We do this kind of thing all the time
to protect copyright.
