It's like you wouldn't
leave your wallet on a park bench

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.240
and you expect it's going to get stolen
if you do that, right?

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.336
Here's how I think about it:

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.296
sexting is like leaving your wallet
at your boyfriend's house.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.096
If you come back the next day

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.400
and all the money is just gone,

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.160
you really need to dump that guy.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.860
(Laughter)

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.680
So instead of criminalizing sexting

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.336
to try to prevent
these privacy violations,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.656
instead we need to make consent central

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.760
to how we think about the circulation
of our private information.
