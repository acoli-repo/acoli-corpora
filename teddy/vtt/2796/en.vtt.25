Our gender norms tell her

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.656
that by producing
this nude image of herself,

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.880
she somehow did the most
horrible, shameful thing.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.616
And when we assume that privacy
is impossible in digital media,

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:48.160
we completely write off and excuse
her boyfriend's bad, bad behavior.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.936
People are still saying all the time
to victims of privacy violations,

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.216
"What were you thinking?

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.720
You should have never sent that image."

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.640

what to say instead, try this.
