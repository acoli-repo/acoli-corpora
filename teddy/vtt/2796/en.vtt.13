We could design the car to make it safer.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.336
So in the 1920s, we got
shatter-resistant windshields.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.856
In the 1950s, seat belts.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.960
And in the 1990s, airbags.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.816
All three of these areas:

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.616
laws, individuals and industry
came together over time

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.416
to help solve the problem
that a new technology causes.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.680
And we can do the same thing
with digital privacy.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.920
Of course, it comes back to consent.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.576
Here's the idea.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.416
