00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.096
and it doesn't even matter

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.320
if they took that image of themselves
and shared it willingly.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.776
So we end up with this
bizarre legal situation

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.336
where two 17-year-olds
can legally have sex in most US states

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.240
but they can't photograph it.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.816
Some states have also tried
passing sexting misdemeanor laws

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.856
but these laws repeat the same problem

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.640
because they still
make consensual sexting illegal.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.776
It doesn't make sense

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.536
to try to ban all sexting
to try to address privacy violations.
