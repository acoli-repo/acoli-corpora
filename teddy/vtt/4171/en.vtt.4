Back in our family home when we woke up
it was to the sound of the tanpura.

00:02:02.144 --> 00:02:05.430
My maternal grandfather used to play
the tanpura early in the morning.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.398
That sound of the tanpura,
that memory, I have placed here.

00:02:11.335 --> 00:02:13.186
(Sound of tanpura)

00:02:13.285 --> 00:02:16.525
(Applause)

00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:23.425
(Music continues)

00:02:23.425 --> 00:02:27.919
(Singing)
