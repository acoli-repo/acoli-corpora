Family members, when they try to connect,

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:35.601
most commonly will invoke a shared past.

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:37.351
We say things like,

00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:39.643
"Do you remember that time?"

00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:41.226
But nine times out of 10,

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.809
the pathway for that one answer
to travel in the brain is broken,

00:04:45.833 --> 00:04:48.268
and we're left alone with a loved one

00:04:48.292 --> 00:04:49.542
in the fog.

00:04:50.208 --> 00:04:51.917
But there is another way in.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:56.059
I call them beautiful questions.

00:04:56.083 --> 00:05:02.101
A beautiful question is one
that opens a shared path of discovery.
