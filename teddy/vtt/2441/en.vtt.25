00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:36.726
My funny and beautiful and feisty mother

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.125
had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:43.768
And I found myself in that place
that everyone dreads.

00:12:43.792 --> 00:12:45.333
She didn't recognize me.

00:12:46.542 --> 00:12:50.393
And I had to figure out fast
if I could do what I'd been coaching

00:12:50.417 --> 00:12:52.684
thousands of other people to do,

00:12:52.708 --> 00:12:54.500
to connect across that gap.

00:12:56.292 --> 00:12:58.726
"Do you mean Ellen?" I said,

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.667
because my sister's empty chair
was just right across the table from us.
