00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:31.893
whom I met on a rather dreary winter day
in their tiny, little kitchen

00:03:31.917 --> 00:03:35.101
in a humble duplex over by Lake Michigan.

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:36.476
And when I walked in,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.684
Fran and a caregiver and a care manager

00:03:39.708 --> 00:03:42.059
greeted me really warmly,

00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:45.851
and Jim stood staring straight ahead,

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:47.601
silent.

00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:50.934
He was on a long,
slow journey into dementia

00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.000
and was now beyond words.

00:03:55.458 --> 00:03:58.476
I was there as part of a project team.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.268
We were doing what we called
"artistic house calls,"
