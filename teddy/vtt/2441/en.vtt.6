00:02:59.542 --> 00:03:01.559
set in motion by Alice

00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:05.851
and then later on by really
countless elders in nursing homes

00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:07.184
and day centers

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:10.268
and those struggling to stay at home.

00:03:10.292 --> 00:03:12.750
And it comes down to the question of how.

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:16.000
How do you meaningfully connect?

00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:21.184
I got a big part of that answer
from a long-married couple

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:23.934
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where I'm from,

00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.625
Fran and Jim,

00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:31.893
whom I met on a rather dreary winter day
in their tiny, little kitchen
