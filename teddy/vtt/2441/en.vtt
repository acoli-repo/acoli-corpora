00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:03.143
Thirty years ago,

00:00:03.167 --> 00:00:04.833
I walked into a nursing home,

00:00:05.917 --> 00:00:07.667
and my life changed forever.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:12.518
I was there to visit my grandmother Alice.

00:00:12.542 --> 00:00:15.726
She was a very powerful woman

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.083
who had lost a battle with a stroke
that stole her ability to speak.

00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:24.476
Alice had just three forms
of communication left.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.643
She had this sound
that was like, "tss, tss, tss,"

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:31.851
that she could shift in tone
