that that moment had been
a turning point for her,

00:07:30.333 --> 00:07:32.393
that she learned how to connect with him

00:07:32.417 --> 00:07:35.333
even as he progressed
through the dementia.

00:07:36.417 --> 00:07:39.476
And it really became
a turning point for me, too.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.518
I learned that this creative,
open-ended approach

00:07:43.542 --> 00:07:46.184
could help families shift,

00:07:46.208 --> 00:07:49.018
expand their understanding of dementia

00:07:49.042 --> 00:07:53.542
as more than just
tragic emptiness and loss

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.684
into also meaningful connection

00:07:57.708 --> 00:07:59.434
and hope

00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:00.708
and love.
