in the assisted living dining room,

00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:33.934
and finally in the chapel

00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:35.809
for the final scene

00:11:35.833 --> 00:11:37.684
where a chorus of elders

00:11:37.708 --> 00:11:40.101
all playing Penelope

00:11:40.125 --> 00:11:45.250
lovingly welcomed Odysseus
and the audience home.

00:11:46.708 --> 00:11:50.518
Together, we had dared
to make something beautiful,

00:11:50.542 --> 00:11:53.601
to invite elders, some with dementia,

00:11:53.625 --> 00:11:55.559
some on hospice,

00:11:55.583 --> 00:11:58.726
into making meaning over time,

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.518
to learn and grow as artists.
