over to that trunk

00:06:03.833 --> 00:06:08.476
and he picked up a piece of the driftwood

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.083
and he held it out,

00:06:11.208 --> 00:06:15.542
and then very slowly
he began to move his arm,

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:18.542
leading with that driftwood.

00:06:21.042 --> 00:06:24.042
In his hand, it became buoyant,

00:06:25.208 --> 00:06:29.708
in sync with the motion of the waves
that he made with his arms.
