Now, Alzheimer's and dementia,

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:33.184
these are two words that,
when you say them in front of people,

00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:36.875
you can watch a cloud descend over them.

00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:39.893
You can imagine me at dinner parties.

00:01:39.917 --> 00:01:41.518
"What do you do?"

00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:45.393
"Well, I invite people with Alzheimer's
and dementia into expression.

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:46.726
Where are you going?"

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.684
(Laughter)

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:54.518
Fear and stigma wrap themselves
so tightly around an experience

00:01:54.542 --> 00:01:57.809
that affects 47 million people
across the world,

00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:02.851
and they can live with this diagnosis
for between 10 and 15 years,
