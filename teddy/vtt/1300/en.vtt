00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So since I was here last in '06,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we discovered that global climate change

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is turning out to be a pretty serious issue,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so we covered that fairly extensively

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in Skeptic magazine.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We investigate all kinds

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
of scientific and quasi-scientific controversies,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but it turns out we don't have to worry about any of this

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
because the world's going to end in 2012.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Another update:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You will recall I introduced you guys

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to the Quadro Tracker.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's like a water dowsing device.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around.
