00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:03.970
and originally that was
so that we could harvest their honey,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.725
but over time we started losing
our native pollinators,

00:05:06.725 --> 00:05:08.420
our wild pollinators,

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.485
and there are many places now
where those wild pollinators

00:05:11.485 --> 00:05:15.284
can no longer meet the pollination
demands of our agriculture,

00:05:15.284 --> 00:05:20.508
so these managed bees have become
an integral part of our food system.

00:05:20.508 --> 00:05:23.227
So when people talk about saving bees,

00:05:23.227 --> 00:05:25.360
my interpretation of that

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.588
is we need to save
our relationship to bees,

00:05:28.588 --> 00:05:33.592
and in order to design new solutions,
