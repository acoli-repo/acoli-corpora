00:02:57.907 --> 00:03:00.461
the mites were running around
on the baby bees,

00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:04.390
and the way that beekeepers
typically manage these mites

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.404
is they treat their hives with chemicals.

00:03:07.404 --> 00:03:09.670
In the long run, that's bad news,

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.223
so researchers are working
on finding alternatives

00:03:13.223 --> 00:03:15.387
to control these mites.

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:18.963
This is one of those alternatives.

00:03:18.963 --> 00:03:23.328
It's an experimental breeding program
at the USDA Bee Lab in Baton Rouge,

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:27.045
and this queen and her attendant bees
are part of that program.

00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:31.430
Now, the researchers figured out
