00:01:29.624 --> 00:01:32.248
so I teamed up
with a bee lab at U.C. Davis

00:01:32.248 --> 00:01:35.343
and figured out how to raise bees
in front of a camera.

00:01:35.993 --> 00:01:38.981
I'm going to show you
the first 21 days of a bee's life

00:01:38.981 --> 00:01:41.770
condensed into 60 seconds.

00:01:43.763 --> 00:01:48.567
This is a bee egg
as it hatches into a larva,

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:53.012
and those newly hatched larvae
swim around their cells

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:57.335
feeding on this white goo
that nurse bees secrete for them.

00:01:59.616 --> 00:02:04.159
Then, their head and their legs
slowly differentiate
