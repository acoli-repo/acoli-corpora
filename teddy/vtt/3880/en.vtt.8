00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.627
but there's a tradeoff
in having this much control.

00:04:01.627 --> 00:04:04.832
They succeeded in breeding
mite-resistant bees,

00:04:04.832 --> 00:04:07.920
but in that process, those bees
started to lose traits

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.685
like their gentleness
and their ability to store honey,

00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:14.194
so to overcome that problem,

00:04:14.194 --> 00:04:17.742
these researchers are now collaborating
with commercial beekeepers.

00:04:18.252 --> 00:04:23.120
This is Bret Adee opening
one of his 72,000 beehives.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.750
He and his brother run the largest
beekeeping operation in the world,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.409
and the USDA is integrating their
mite-resistant bees into his operation
