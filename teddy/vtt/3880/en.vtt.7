00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:31.430
Now, the researchers figured out

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.152
that some of the bees have
a natural ability to fight mites,

00:03:35.152 --> 00:03:39.322
so they set out to breed
a line of mite-resistant bees.

00:03:40.782 --> 00:03:43.418
This is what it takes
to breed bees in a lab.

00:03:43.418 --> 00:03:46.158
The virgin queen is sedated

00:03:46.158 --> 00:03:51.200
and then artificially inseminated
using this precision instrument.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.478
Now, this procedure allows the researchers

00:03:53.478 --> 00:03:58.500
to control exactly
which bees are being crossed,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.627
but there's a tradeoff
in having this much control.
