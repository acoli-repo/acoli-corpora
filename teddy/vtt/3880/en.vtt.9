00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.409
and the USDA is integrating their
mite-resistant bees into his operation

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:35.052
with the hope that over time,

00:04:35.052 --> 00:04:38.723
they'll be able to select the bees
that are not only mite-resistant

00:04:38.723 --> 00:04:43.707
but also retain all of these qualities
that make them useful to us.

00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:45.860
And to say it like that

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.157
makes it sound like we're manipulating
and exploiting bees,

00:04:49.157 --> 00:04:52.593
and the truth is, we've been doing that
for thousands of years.

00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:57.747
We took this wild creature
and put it inside of a box,

00:04:57.747 --> 00:04:59.861
practically domesticating it,

00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:03.970
and originally that was
so that we could harvest their honey,
