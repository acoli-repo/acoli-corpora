00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:18.822
These bees are in my backyard
in Berkeley, California.

00:00:18.822 --> 00:00:21.221
Until last year,
I'd never kept bees before,

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:25.270
but National Geographic asked me
to photograph a story about them,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.769
and I decided, to be able
to take compelling images,

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.253
I should start keeping bees myself.
