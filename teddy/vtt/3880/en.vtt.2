00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:04.146
but the single greatest threat
is a parasitic mite from Asia,

00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:06.475
Varroa destructor.

00:01:06.475 --> 00:01:09.354
And this pinhead-sized mite
crawls onto young bees

00:01:09.354 --> 00:01:11.699
and sucks their blood.

00:01:11.699 --> 00:01:13.696
This eventually destroys a hive

00:01:13.696 --> 00:01:16.940
because it weakens
the immune system of the bees,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.476
and it makes them more vulnerable
to stress and disease.

00:01:21.776 --> 00:01:23.773
Now, bees are the most sensitive

00:01:23.773 --> 00:01:26.513
when they're developing
inside their brood cells,

00:01:26.513 --> 00:01:29.624
and I wanted to know
what that process really looks like,

00:01:29.624 --> 00:01:32.248
so I teamed up
with a bee lab at U.C. Davis
