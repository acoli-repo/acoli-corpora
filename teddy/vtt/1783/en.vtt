00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
A year ago, I spoke to you about a book

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that I was just in the process of completing,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that has come out in the interim, and I would like to talk to you today

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
about some of the controversies that that book inspired.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The book is called "The Blank Slate,"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
based on the popular idea

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that the human mind is a blank slate,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and that all of its structure comes from

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
socialization, culture, parenting, experience.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The "blank slate" was an influential idea in the 20th century.
