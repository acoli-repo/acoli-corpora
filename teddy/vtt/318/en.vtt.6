00:02:58.285 --> 00:03:02.700
and I was hoping that we'd find
a partial skeleton at some point.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.357
Finally, very recently,

00:03:05.357 --> 00:03:08.467
we were able to track down a dig site

00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:13.431
where a local fossil hunter found
several bones of Spinosaurus.

00:03:13.431 --> 00:03:16.291
We returned to the site,
we collected more bones.

00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:20.364
And so after 100 years we finally
had another partial skeleton

00:03:20.364 --> 00:03:22.525
of this bizarre creature.

00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:24.196
And we were able to reconstruct it.

00:03:24.196 --> 00:03:26.090
We now know that 
Spinosaurus had a head

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.886
a little bit like a crocodile,

00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:30.081
very different from other 
predatory dinosaurs,
