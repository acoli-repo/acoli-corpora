He decided that in [the] future,

00:06:34.974 --> 00:06:37.685
he would start each meeting
with an agenda alignment,

00:06:37.685 --> 00:06:40.855
to make sure there was clarity
on what needed to be achieved.

00:06:41.188 --> 00:06:45.025
And then, he'd resolve to make sure
that he would take greater control

00:06:45.067 --> 00:06:46.444
over the meeting

00:06:46.444 --> 00:06:49.822
so that if topics came up
beyond the scope of the agenda,

00:06:49.822 --> 00:06:52.491
that he’d note that a separate
discussion should be had.

00:06:54.493 --> 00:06:57.997
Reflection helps to improve performance.
