He had just led a client meeting

It was to give a progress update

00:05:33.162 --> 00:05:36.499

he was responsible for in this project.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.045

faced or the decisions required.

00:05:54.266 --> 00:05:55.893
He felt

00:05:55.893 --> 00:05:58.562
angst, uneasy, upset.

00:05:59.647 --> 00:06:03.776
He was concerned about what the client
had thought of him and the meeting,
