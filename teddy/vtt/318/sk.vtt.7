00:03:27.453 --> 00:03:31.290
it’s not just about
how ... the individual performs,

00:03:31.332 --> 00:03:34.085
but about how the team performs
collectively together.

00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:40.466
Cricketers reflect during a game,
after a game and over time.

00:03:41.217 --> 00:03:43.928
During a game, they might think
about a missed catch

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.306
or how they could bat or bowl better
the next delivery.

00:03:47.848 --> 00:03:51.727
After a game, they might come together
to watch video replays,

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.647
to look at what worked and what didn't,

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:57.233
which might differ
from what they actually experienced

00:03:57.233 --> 00:03:59.068
during the game itself.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.656
And then, over time, they might look
to the patterns of their wins and losses,
