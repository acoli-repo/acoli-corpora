He was concerned about what the client
had thought of him and the meeting,

00:06:03.818 --> 00:06:05.277
but more importantly,

00:06:05.277 --> 00:06:08.280
what the client felt
about the work that was going on

00:06:08.322 --> 00:06:09.782
in the work stream.

00:06:11.283 --> 00:06:14.120
It would have been so easy for him
to have pushed past this,

00:06:14.161 --> 00:06:16.539
to try and suppress the emotions,

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:19.625
but that would have missed
a massive opportunity.

00:06:20.876 --> 00:06:23.421
We took a few moments to think

00:06:23.462 --> 00:06:26.298
and objectively reflect
over what took place,

00:06:26.298 --> 00:06:28.384
and then to put in place some commitments

00:06:28.384 --> 00:06:31.387
as to what and how he could do things
differently next time.
