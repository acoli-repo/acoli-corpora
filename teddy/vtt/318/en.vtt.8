00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:01.377
the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones,

00:04:01.377 --> 00:04:04.136
and it turns out that they're
very dense and compact.

00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:07.994
Again, this is something we see in animals
that spend a lot of time in the water,

00:04:07.994 --> 00:04:11.186
it's useful for buoyancy 
control in the water.

00:04:11.186 --> 00:04:16.559
We C.T.-scanned all of our bones
and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton.

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:18.770
And when we looked 
at the digital skeleton,

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.206
we realized that yes, this was
a dinosaur unlike any other.

00:04:23.206 --> 00:04:24.805
It's bigger than a T. rex,

00:04:24.805 --> 00:04:27.530
and yes, the head has "fish-eating"
written all over it,

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.629
but really the entire skeleton has
"water-loving" written all over it --
