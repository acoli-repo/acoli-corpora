00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:31.760
with conical teeth,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.647
that may have been used 
to catch slippery prey, like fish.

00:01:36.647 --> 00:01:38.704
But that was pretty much 
all we knew

00:01:38.704 --> 00:01:42.303
about this animal for the next 100 years.

00:01:46.563 --> 00:01:51.365
My fieldwork took me to the border region
between Morocco and Algeria,

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:53.938
a place called the Kem Kem.

00:01:53.938 --> 00:01:56.251
It's a difficult place to work in.

00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:59.940
You have to deal with sandstorms
and snakes and scorpions,

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.084
and it's very difficult to find
good fossils there.
