00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.629
but really the entire skeleton has
"water-loving" written all over it --

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:36.464
dense bone, paddle-like feet,
and the hind limbs are reduced in size,

00:04:36.464 --> 00:04:38.672
and again, this is something
we see in animals

00:04:38.672 --> 00:04:41.551
that spend a substantial amount 
of time in the water.

00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:46.104
So, as we fleshed out our Spinosaurus --

00:04:46.104 --> 00:04:50.268
I'm looking at muscle attachments
and wrapping our dinosaur in skin --

00:04:50.268 --> 00:04:54.148
we realize that we're dealing
with a river monster,

00:04:54.148 --> 00:04:56.477
a predatory dinosaur, bigger than T. rex,

00:04:56.477 --> 00:04:59.253
the ruler of this ancient river of giants,

00:04:59.253 --> 00:05:02.503
feeding on the many aquatic animals
I showed you earlier on.
