I want to share how this practice
helps to improve performance,

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:06.122
to make better decisions,
both big and small,

00:02:06.164 --> 00:02:08.416
and to build better relationships.

00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:14.046
Interestingly, in a 2020 survey
of some 4,000 respondents,

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:16.382
conducted by BCG and BVA,

00:02:16.382 --> 00:02:18.176
the question was asked,

00:02:18.176 --> 00:02:20.928
"What makes a good leader?

00:02:20.928 --> 00:02:23.764
What are their main qualities and skills?"

00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:28.394
Notably, possessing
a good capacity for reflection

00:02:28.436 --> 00:02:32.440
was listed as one of the top five skills,
