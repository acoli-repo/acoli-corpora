00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:33.941
with my desire to travel to 
far-flung corners of the world.

00:00:33.941 --> 00:00:36.964
And now, a few years later,
I've led several expeditions

00:00:36.964 --> 00:00:42.146
to the ultimate far-flung corner 
on this planet, the Sahara.

00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:46.195
I've worked in the Sahara because
I've been on a quest

00:00:46.195 --> 00:00:51.300
to uncover new remains of
a bizarre, giant predatory dinosaur

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.451
called Spinosaurus.

00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:57.804
A few bones of this animal
have been found

00:00:57.804 --> 00:00:59.184
in the deserts of Egypt

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:04.537
and were described about 100 years ago
by a German paleontologist.
