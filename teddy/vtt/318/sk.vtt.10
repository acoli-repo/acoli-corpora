When we practice reflection as a habit,
we gain even more meaningful insight,

00:05:00.546 --> 00:05:05.426
because we see patterns that reflection
on stand-alone events doesn't provide.

00:05:06.427 --> 00:05:09.388
I truly think reflection
can help everyone --

00:05:09.388 --> 00:05:13.267
people in every industry,
at every stage in one's career,

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:15.895
and in every point in one's life.

00:05:17.646 --> 00:05:21.400
Let me share with you an example
that I think most people can connect with.

00:05:22.109 --> 00:05:24.070
Most of us have meetings.

00:05:25.196 --> 00:05:27.573
I was due for a daily catch-up
with a colleague.

00:05:27.615 --> 00:05:30.993
He had just led a client meeting
for the first time.
