00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.084
and it's very difficult to find
good fossils there.

00:02:03.084 --> 00:02:05.900
But our hard work paid off.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.115
We discovered many incredible specimens.

00:02:08.115 --> 00:02:09.867
There's the largest dinosaur bone

00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:12.375
that had ever been found
in this part of the Sahara.

00:02:13.475 --> 00:02:16.969
We found remains of giant
predatory dinosaurs,

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.632
medium-sized predatory dinosaurs,

00:02:19.632 --> 00:02:25.231
and seven or eight different kinds
of crocodile-like hunters.

00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:28.233
These fossils were deposited
in a river system.

00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:32.403
The river system was also home 
to a giant, car-sized coelacanth,
