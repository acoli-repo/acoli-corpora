Reflection helps to make better decisions.

00:07:03.335 --> 00:07:04.670
Imagine, for a moment,

00:07:04.712 --> 00:07:07.131
you've been in your current role
for five years.

00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:09.216
It's a creative role,

00:07:09.258 --> 00:07:11.510
but you don't quite feel
you've got that zing,

00:07:11.552 --> 00:07:13.053
that energy for it, anymore.

00:07:13.804 --> 00:07:17.224
You've been offered
another opportunity in the organization.

00:07:17.266 --> 00:07:21.061
It’s actually a promotion.
It’s a more senior role, managerial.

00:07:21.103 --> 00:07:25.024
But you'll have responsibility
for looking after 12 direct reports.

00:07:27.109 --> 00:07:30.154
A competitor has also
recently reached out to you.
