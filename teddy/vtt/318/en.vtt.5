00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:32.403
The river system was also home 
to a giant, car-sized coelacanth,

00:02:32.403 --> 00:02:35.863
a monster sawfish,

00:02:35.863 --> 00:02:39.563
and the skies over the river system
were filled with pterosaurs,

00:02:39.563 --> 00:02:41.591
flying reptiles.

00:02:41.591 --> 00:02:43.210
It was a pretty dangerous place,

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.929
not the kind of place where you'd want
to travel to if you had a time machine.

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.079
So we're finding all these 
incredible fossils of animals

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.769
that lived alongside Spinosaurus,

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.538
but Spinosaurus itself proved
to be very elusive.

00:02:56.538 --> 00:02:58.285
We were just finding bits and pieces

00:02:58.285 --> 00:03:02.700
and I was hoping that we'd find
a partial skeleton at some point.
