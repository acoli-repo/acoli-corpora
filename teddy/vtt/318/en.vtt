These dragons from deep time
are incredible creatures.

00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:07.146
They're bizzarre,

00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:08.856
they're beautiful,

00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:11.841
and there's very little
we know about them.

00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:14.131
These thoughts were going
through my head

00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:18.574
when I looked at the pages of
my first dinosaur book.

00:00:18.574 --> 00:00:21.078
I was about five years old at the time,

00:00:21.078 --> 00:00:23.031
and I decided there and then


00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:25.876
that I would become a paleontologist.

00:00:25.876 --> 00:00:29.213
Paleontology allowed me 
to combine my love for animals

00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:33.941
with my desire to travel to 
far-flung corners of the world.
