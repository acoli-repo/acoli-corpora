00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:30.081
very different from other 
predatory dinosaurs,

00:03:30.081 --> 00:03:32.818
very different from the T. rex.

00:03:32.818 --> 00:03:37.671
But the really interesting information
came from the rest of the skeleton.

00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:39.004
We had long spines,

00:03:39.004 --> 00:03:41.632
the spines forming the big sail.

00:03:41.632 --> 00:03:43.877
We had leg bones, we had skull bones,

00:03:43.877 --> 00:03:47.325
we had paddle-shaped feet, wide feet --

00:03:47.325 --> 00:03:50.140
again, very unusual, no other
dinosaur has feet like this --

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.251
and we think they may have been
used to walk on soft sediment,

00:03:53.251 --> 00:03:55.943
or maybe for paddling in the water.

00:03:55.943 --> 00:03:59.381
We also looked at the fine
microstructure of the bone,

00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:01.377
the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones,
