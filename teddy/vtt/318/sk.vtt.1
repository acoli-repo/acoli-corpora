00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:31.611
I knew, in discerning ministry,

00:00:31.652 --> 00:00:35.281
that celibacy, not getting married,
was part of the package.

00:00:36.365 --> 00:00:38.785
But I don't know
if I can do this any longer.

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:44.248
I'm rarely alone,
but I feel bitterly lonely."

00:00:47.376 --> 00:00:49.087
I wrote this when I was on the cusp

00:00:49.128 --> 00:00:54.383
of making one of the biggest
and most significant decisions of my life:

00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:56.844
whether to leave ministry
as a Catholic priest.

00:00:58.888 --> 00:01:02.683
I think my life has been
a reasonably unique and unusual one.
