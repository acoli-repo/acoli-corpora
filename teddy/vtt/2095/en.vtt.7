so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000

They also gave us a way to run power

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo, in October.
