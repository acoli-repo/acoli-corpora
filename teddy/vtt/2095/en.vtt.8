Teruo Kurosaki, who owns a furniture company called Idee,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
He said one he would like to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
make a real trailer, functioning, and we would sell that one.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Trailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
We came up with a fantasy scenario

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
of a DJ traveling around the States,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that would collect records and go on tours.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
This trailer housed two turntables,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
mixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It's got a huge couch, fits quite a few people,
