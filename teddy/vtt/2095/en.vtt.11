00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me --

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and there's no money for tooling or molding.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
The trailers themselves are actually hand-built.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
All the casework is hand-scribed in, uniquely,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
so you can't just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
you have to cut them big, and every single one is hand-fit.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
They didn't want to go to a componentized system.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And there it is, that's the Bambi 16.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
