00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the material of choice, laminate,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that I was trying to highlight,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
only bends in two dimensions.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It's a compound curve interior.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
What I had to devise was

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
a way of fooling the eye

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
into believing that all these panels

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
are curved with the shell.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
What I came up with was

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
a series of second skins

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
that basically float over the aluminum shell.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And what I was trying to do there was

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
direct your eye in the space,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way,
