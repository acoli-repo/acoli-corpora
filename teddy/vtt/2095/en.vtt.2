optimize it in its most idealistic fashion.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I decided I had to do some research

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and really figure out what had gone wrong

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
somewhere along the history of Airstream.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
What I discovered in these interiors is that

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
there was a disconnect between the exterior shell

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and the interior architecture of the pieces.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
In that the shell was originally conceived

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
as a lightweight, modern, futuristic,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway, and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
the interiors were completely out of sync with that.
