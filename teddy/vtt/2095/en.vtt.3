00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway, and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
the interiors were completely out of sync with that.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
In fact it appeared like they

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
referenced a mountain cabin.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
That seemed really like a crisis to me,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that they had never been able to

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
develop a vocabulary

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
about escape, and about travel, and modernity

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
in this trailer that was consistent with the shell.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We really needed to do some archeology

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
in an Airstream trailer,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and what feels like it has true purpose and utility.
