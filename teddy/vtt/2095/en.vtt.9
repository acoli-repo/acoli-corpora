WEBVTT

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It's got a huge couch, fits quite a few people,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and basically we'd had a great time with this.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and escape, in an idiosyncratic sense.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
A lot of these ideas migrated into

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
the production trailers for Airstream.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
They came to me and said,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
"Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
rock climbers, would use these things?"
