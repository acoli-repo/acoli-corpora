00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
transportation design,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
interiors and furniture,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
we came up with the solution of taking

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
an old Airstream trailer and gutting it,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and trying to portray laminate,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and a trailer, in kind of a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
fresh, new contemporary look.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
When this trailer showed up at my shop

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in Berkeley, I'd actually never stepped foot in

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
an Airstream trailer, or any other trailer.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So I can be somebody that can look at this

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
optimize it in its most idealistic fashion.
