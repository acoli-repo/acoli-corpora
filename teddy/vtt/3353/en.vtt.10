00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.171
there's relatively few studies
about emotional factors.

00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:05.339
Why is it that we underestimate
feelings and perceptions?

00:05:05.363 --> 00:05:09.353
I think it's going to be one
of our biggest intellectual challenges,

00:05:09.377 --> 00:05:14.677
because our political systems
are replete with emotions.

00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:16.507
In country after country,

00:05:16.531 --> 00:05:21.943
we have seen illiberal politicians
exploiting these emotions.

00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:25.585
And yet within the academia
and among the intelligentsia,

00:05:25.609 --> 00:05:29.175
we are yet to take emotions seriously.

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:30.473
I think we should.
