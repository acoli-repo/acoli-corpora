And through social media
and social networking,

00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:35.981
these sentiments are further amplified,

00:04:36.005 --> 00:04:39.731
polarized, and they travel
around the world quite fast.

00:04:40.315 --> 00:04:44.230
Ours is the age of anxiety, anger,

00:04:44.254 --> 00:04:46.768
distrust, resentment

00:04:46.792 --> 00:04:48.416
and, I think, lots of fear.

00:04:49.112 --> 00:04:50.407
But here's the thing:

00:04:50.431 --> 00:04:55.206
even though there's plenty of research
about economic factors,

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.171
there's relatively few studies
about emotional factors.
