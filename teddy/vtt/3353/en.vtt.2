And, actually, it did make sense,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.187
because ever since my childhood,

00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:06.884
each letter in the alphabet
has a different color,

00:01:06.908 --> 00:01:09.437
and colors bring me flavors.

00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:15.067
So for instance, the color purple
is quite pungent, almost perfumed,

00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:18.908
and any words that I associate with purple

00:01:18.932 --> 00:01:21.098
taste the same way,

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:24.943
such as "sunset" -- a very spicy word.

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:30.149
But I was worried that if I tell
all of this to the teenager,
