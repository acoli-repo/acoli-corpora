00:12:29.294 --> 00:12:33.446
All these figures, at first glance --
they seem disconnected.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.870
But I think they feed each other,

00:12:35.894 --> 00:12:37.937
and they need each other.

00:12:38.687 --> 00:12:39.903
And all around the world,

00:12:39.927 --> 00:12:45.692
when we look at how demagogues talk
and how they inspire movements,

00:12:45.716 --> 00:12:50.046
I think they have one
unmistakable quality in common:

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:54.556
they strongly, strongly dislike plurality.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.322
They cannot deal with multiplicity.

00:12:57.848 --> 00:12:59.446
Adorno used to say,

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:05.582
"Intolerance of ambiguity is the sign
of an authoritarian personality."
