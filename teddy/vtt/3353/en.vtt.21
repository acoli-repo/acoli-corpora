00:10:26.102 --> 00:10:30.537
and then writers from the UK,
where I live and where I call my home,

00:10:30.561 --> 00:10:33.496
and then writers from the USA.

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:36.710
Suddenly, there were more of us

00:10:36.734 --> 00:10:39.517
feeling worried about
the fate of our nations

00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:41.803
and the future of the world.

00:10:41.827 --> 00:10:44.333
And maybe there were more of us now

00:10:44.357 --> 00:10:47.801
feeling like strangers
in our own motherlands.

00:10:48.624 --> 00:10:50.801
And then this bizarre thing happened.

00:10:50.825 --> 00:10:54.312
Those of us who used to be
very depressed for a long time,

00:10:54.336 --> 00:10:57.058
we started to feel less depressed,

00:10:57.082 --> 00:11:00.784
whereas the newcomers,
they were so not used to feeling this way
