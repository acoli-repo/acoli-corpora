because, you know, you live in Turkey."

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:03.687
And I said to her,

00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:05.959
"I don't understand
why you're not a feminist,

00:06:05.983 --> 00:06:08.235
because, you know, you live in America."

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:10.779
(Laughter)

00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:13.765
(Applause)

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.655
And she laughed.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.874
She took it as a joke,

00:06:17.898 --> 00:06:19.717
and the moment passed.

00:06:19.741 --> 00:06:21.638
(Laughter)

00:06:21.662 --> 00:06:26.572
But the way she had divided the world
into two imaginary camps,

00:06:26.596 --> 00:06:28.539
into two opposite camps --

00:06:28.563 --> 00:06:31.203
it bothered me and it stayed with me.
