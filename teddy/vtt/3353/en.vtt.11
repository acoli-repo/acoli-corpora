00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:30.473
I think we should.

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:34.362
And just like we should focus
on economic inequality worldwide,

00:05:34.386 --> 00:05:41.002
we need to pay more attention
to emotional and cognitive gaps worldwide

00:05:41.026 --> 00:05:42.836
and how to bridge these gaps,

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.263
because they do matter.

00:05:45.734 --> 00:05:48.484
Years ago, when I was still
living in Istanbul,

00:05:48.508 --> 00:05:52.544
an American scholar working on
women writers in the Middle East

00:05:52.568 --> 00:05:53.972
came to see me.

00:05:54.504 --> 00:05:57.029
And at some point
in our exchange, she said,

00:05:57.053 --> 00:05:59.009
"I understand why you're a feminist,

00:05:59.033 --> 00:06:01.998
because, you know, you live in Turkey."
