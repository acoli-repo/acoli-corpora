for the basics of democracy anymore,

00:07:30.902 --> 00:07:33.549
because they were beyond that stage.

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:37.149
I think in the year 2016,

00:07:37.173 --> 00:07:41.491
this hierarchical geography
was shattered to pieces.

00:07:42.324 --> 00:07:46.414
Our world no longer follows
this dualistic pattern

00:07:46.438 --> 00:07:49.547
in the scholar's mind, if it ever did.

00:07:50.056 --> 00:07:54.415
Now we know that history
does not necessarily move forward.

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:56.362
Sometimes it draws circles,

00:07:56.386 --> 00:07:58.343
even slides backwards,

00:07:58.367 --> 00:08:01.314
and that generations
can make the same mistakes
