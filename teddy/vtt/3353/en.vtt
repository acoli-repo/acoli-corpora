"Can you taste words?"

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.036
It was a question
that caught me by surprise.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.171
This summer, I was giving a talk
at a literary festival,

00:00:10.195 --> 00:00:12.871
and afterwards, as I was signing books,

00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:15.574
a teenage girl came with her friend,

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:17.631
and this is what she asked me.

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:22.472
I told her that some people
experience an overlap in their senses

00:00:22.496 --> 00:00:24.323
so that they could hear colors

00:00:24.347 --> 00:00:25.875
or see sounds,

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:31.337
and many writers were fascinated
by this subject, myself included.
