00:06:28.563 --> 00:06:31.203
it bothered me and it stayed with me.

00:06:31.227 --> 00:06:33.723
According to this imaginary map,

00:06:33.747 --> 00:06:37.269
some parts of the world
were liquid countries.

00:06:37.293 --> 00:06:40.563
They were like choppy waters
not yet settled.

00:06:40.587 --> 00:06:43.898
Some other parts of the world,
namely the West,

00:06:43.922 --> 00:06:47.227
were solid, safe and stable.

00:06:47.251 --> 00:06:50.565
So it was the liquid lands
that needed feminism

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:52.986
and activism and human rights,

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.408
and those of us who were
unfortunate enough

00:06:55.432 --> 00:06:57.244
to come from such places

00:06:57.268 --> 00:07:02.042
had to keep struggling
for these most essential values.
