But I was worried that if I tell
all of this to the teenager,

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:32.323

and there wasn't enough time anyhow,

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.160
because people were waiting in the queue,

00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:43.716
so it suddenly felt like
what I was trying to convey

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.789

in similar situations:

00:01:55.823 --> 00:01:59.428
I stammered, I shut down,
and I stopped talking.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:03.618
I stopped talking because
the truth was complicated,
