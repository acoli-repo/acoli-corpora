00:15:28.724 --> 00:15:31.699
and when the book was published,
I did lots of events.

00:15:31.723 --> 00:15:33.333
I went to many primary schools,

00:15:33.357 --> 00:15:37.249
which gave me a chance to observe
younger kids in Turkey.

00:15:37.273 --> 00:15:42.115
And it was always amazing to see
how much empathy, imagination

00:15:42.139 --> 00:15:43.579
and chutzpah they have.

00:15:43.603 --> 00:15:47.630
These children are much more inclined
to become global citizens

00:15:47.654 --> 00:15:50.160
than nationalists at that age.

00:15:50.184 --> 00:15:52.281
And it's wonderful to see,
when you ask them,

00:15:52.305 --> 00:15:55.396
so many of them want
to be poets and writers,

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.818
and girls are just as confident as boys,

00:15:58.842 --> 00:16:00.228
if not even more.
