00:03:24.734 --> 00:03:30.416
we feel increasingly frustrated
by its politics and politicians,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.383
sometimes to the point
of despair or hurt or anger.

00:03:36.088 --> 00:03:38.216
I want to talk about emotions

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.973
and the need to boost
our emotional intelligence.

00:03:41.997 --> 00:03:43.148
I think it's a pity

00:03:43.172 --> 00:03:49.175
that mainstream political theory
pays very little attention to emotions.

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:54.793
Oftentimes, analysts and experts
are so busy with data and metrics

00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:57.754
that they seem to forget
those things in life

00:03:57.778 --> 00:03:59.612
that are difficult to measure

00:03:59.636 --> 00:04:04.901
and perhaps impossible to cluster
under statistical models.
