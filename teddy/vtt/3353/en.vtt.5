00:02:26.485 --> 00:02:31.152
I like to explore: What does
the word "creativity" taste like,

00:02:31.176 --> 00:02:33.190
or "equality,"

00:02:33.214 --> 00:02:35.660
"love," "revolution?"

00:02:35.684 --> 00:02:37.818
And what about "motherland?"

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:42.602
These days, it's particularly
this last word that troubles me.

00:02:42.626 --> 00:02:45.195
It leaves a sweet taste on my tongue,

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:48.605
like cinnamon, a bit of rose water

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.029
and golden apples.

00:02:50.053 --> 00:02:53.251
But underneath, there's a sharp tang,

00:02:53.275 --> 00:02:55.875
like nettles and dandelion.

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:59.186
The taste of my motherland, Turkey,

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.124
is a mixture of sweet and bitter.
