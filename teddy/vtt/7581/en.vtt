It was January 16th, 1895.

00:00:10.673 --> 00:00:14.594
Two men arrived at Lili’uokalani’s door,
arrested her,

00:00:14.594 --> 00:00:18.014
and led her to the room
where she would be imprisoned.

00:00:18.014 --> 00:00:22.185
A group had recently seized power
and now confiscated her diaries,

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:26.105
ransacked her house, 
claimed her lands, and hid her away.

00:00:26.773 --> 00:00:29.442
Lili’uokalani was Hawaii’s queen.

00:00:29.442 --> 00:00:33.237
And she ruled through one of the most
turbulent periods of its history.
