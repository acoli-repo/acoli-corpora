00:00:00.694 --> 00:00:05.547
What's the scariest thing you've ever done?

00:00:05.547 --> 00:00:08.597
Or another way to say it is,

00:00:08.597 --> 00:00:12.071
what's the most dangerous 
thing that you've ever done?

00:00:12.071 --> 00:00:16.254
And why did you do it?

00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:17.872
I know what the most dangerous thing is

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:19.065
that I've ever done

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:21.349
because NASA does the math.

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.701
You look back to the first five shuttle launches,

00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:26.289
the odds of a catastrophic event

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.869
during the first five shuttle launches

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.793
was one in nine.
