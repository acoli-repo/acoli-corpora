You see, for something
that supposedly holds us back,

00:00:33.261 --> 00:00:36.785
it's quite remarkable how many of us
are quite happy to hold our hands up

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.514
and say we're perfectionists.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.730
But there's an interesting
and serious point

00:00:43.754 --> 00:00:50.236
because our begrudging admiration
for perfection is so pervasive

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.339
that we never really stop to question
that concept in its own terms.

00:00:54.363 --> 00:00:58.133
What does it say about us and our society

00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:02.465
that there is a kind
of celebration in perfection?
