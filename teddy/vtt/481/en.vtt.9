00:04:28.786 --> 00:04:31.882
the idea that we are captains
of our own destiny

00:04:31.906 --> 00:04:34.219
disguises a much darker
reality for young people

00:04:34.243 --> 00:04:37.394
that they are subject to an almost
ongoing economic tribunal.

00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:40.072
Metrics, rankings, lead tables

00:04:40.096 --> 00:04:43.817
have emerged as the yardsticks
for which merit can be quantified

00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:48.824
and used to sort young people
into schools, classes and colleges.

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:51.556
Education is the first arena

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.946
where measurement
is so publicly played out

00:04:54.354 --> 00:04:56.855
and where metrics are being used

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.885
as a tool to improve standards
and performance.
