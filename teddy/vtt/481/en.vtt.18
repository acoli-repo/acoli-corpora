00:08:59.888 --> 00:09:01.966
including things
like heightened depression,

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:03.966
heightened anxiety and suicide ideation.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.829
But, by far, the most problematic
element of perfectionism

00:09:06.853 --> 00:09:08.662
is socially prescribed perfectionism.

00:09:08.686 --> 00:09:12.172
That sense that everyone
expects me to be perfect.

00:09:12.196 --> 00:09:13.633
This element of perfectionism

00:09:13.657 --> 00:09:16.228
has a large correlation
with serious mental illness.

00:09:16.252 --> 00:09:22.347
And with today's emphasis on perfection
at the forefront of my mind,

00:09:22.371 --> 00:09:25.934
I was curious to see whether these
elements of perfectionism were changing.

00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:29.429
To date, research in this area
is focused on immediate family relations,

00:09:29.453 --> 00:09:32.753
but we wanted to look at it
at a broader level.
