00:06:57.359 --> 00:07:00.990
was only serving to expose
what he saw as his inner weakness

00:07:01.014 --> 00:07:03.736
to himself and to others.

00:07:04.212 --> 00:07:07.610
Cases like John's speak
to the harmfulness of perfectionism

00:07:07.634 --> 00:07:09.934
as a way of being in the world.

00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:11.252
Contrary to popular belief,

00:07:11.276 --> 00:07:15.506
perfectionism is never about
perfecting things or perfecting tasks.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.156
It's not about striving for excellence.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.580
John's case highlights this vividly.

00:07:20.893 --> 00:07:24.693
At its root, perfectionism
is about perfecting the self.

00:07:25.505 --> 00:07:28.850
Or, more precisely,
perfecting an imperfect self.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.628
And you can think about it
like a mountain of achievement
