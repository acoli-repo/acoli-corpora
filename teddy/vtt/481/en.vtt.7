of Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat.

00:03:32.982 --> 00:03:35.077
In this new visual culture,

00:03:35.101 --> 00:03:41.609
the appearance of perfection
is far more important than the reality.

00:03:42.396 --> 00:03:45.454
If one side of the modern landscape

00:03:45.478 --> 00:03:48.142
that we have so lavishly
furnished for young people

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:50.444
is this idea that there's
a perfectible life

00:03:50.468 --> 00:03:52.609
and that there's a perfectible lifestyle,

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:54.799
then the other is surely work.

00:03:54.823 --> 00:03:58.069
Nothing is out of reach
for those who want it badly enough.

00:03:58.093 --> 00:03:59.561
Or so we're told.

00:03:59.585 --> 00:04:03.119
This is the idea at the heart
of the American dream.
