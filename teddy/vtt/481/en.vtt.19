00:09:29.453 --> 00:09:32.753
but we wanted to look at it
at a broader level.

00:09:32.777 --> 00:09:35.864
So we took all of the data
that had ever been collected

00:09:35.888 --> 00:09:40.284
in the 27 years since Paul and Gordon
developed that perfectionism measure,

00:09:40.308 --> 00:09:42.410
and we isolated the data
in college students.

00:09:42.911 --> 00:09:45.553
This turned out to be
more than 40,000 young people

00:09:45.577 --> 00:09:47.688
from American, Canadian
and British colleges,

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:51.734
and with so much data available,
we looked to see if there was a trend.

00:09:52.331 --> 00:09:54.395
And in all, it took us
more than three years

00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:57.165
to collate all of this information,
crunch the numbers,

00:09:57.189 --> 00:09:58.397
and write our report.

00:09:58.421 --> 00:10:02.189
But it was worth it because our analysis
uncovered something alarming.
