00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:30.529
We know from clinician case reports

00:01:30.553 --> 00:01:33.811
that perfectionism conceals
a host of psychological difficulties,

00:01:33.835 --> 00:01:37.965
including things like depression,
anxiety, anorexia, bulimia

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:40.228
and even suicide ideation.

00:01:40.252 --> 00:01:44.036
And what's more worrying
is that over the last 25 years,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.719
we have seen perfectionism rise
at an alarming rate.

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:49.610
And at the same time,

00:01:49.634 --> 00:01:53.185
we have seen more mental illness
among young people than ever before.

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:56.379
Rates of suicide in the US alone

00:01:56.403 --> 00:02:00.355
increased by 25 percent
across the last two decades.
