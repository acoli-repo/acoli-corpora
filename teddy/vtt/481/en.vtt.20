But it was worth it because our analysis
uncovered something alarming.

00:10:03.438 --> 00:10:06.816
All three elements of perfectionism
have increased over time.

00:10:07.803 --> 00:10:12.316
But socially prescribed perfectionism
saw the largest increase, and by far.

00:10:12.634 --> 00:10:13.919
In 1989,

00:10:13.943 --> 00:10:17.106
just nine percent of young people
report clinically relevant levels

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.901
of socially prescribed perfectionism.

00:10:18.925 --> 00:10:22.517
Those are levels that we might
typically see in clinical populations.

00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:27.800
By 2017, that figure

00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:32.179
And by 2050, projections
