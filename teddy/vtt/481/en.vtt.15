00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.628
And you can think about it
like a mountain of achievement

00:07:33.652 --> 00:07:36.485
that perfectionism leads us
to imagine ourselves scaling.

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:39.413
And we think to ourselves,
"Once I've reached that summit,

00:07:39.437 --> 00:07:42.762
then people will see I'm not flawed,
and I'll be worth something."

00:07:43.687 --> 00:07:45.536
But what perfectionism doesn't tell us

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.489
is that soon after reaching that summit,

00:07:47.513 --> 00:07:51.711
we will be called down again to the fresh
lowlands of insecurity and shame,

00:07:51.735 --> 00:07:54.387
just to try and scale that peak again.

00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:56.855
This is the cycle of self-defeat.

00:07:56.879 --> 00:08:00.919
In the pursuit of unattainable perfection,
a perfectionist just cannot step off.
