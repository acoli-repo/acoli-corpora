In the pursuit of unattainable perfection,
a perfectionist just cannot step off.

00:08:01.315 --> 00:08:03.411
And it's why it's so difficult to treat.

00:08:04.014 --> 00:08:06.332
Now, we've known for decades and decades

that perfectionism contributes
to a host of psychological problems,

00:08:09.546 --> 00:08:12.228

That was until the late 1980s

00:08:13.738 --> 00:08:16.881
when two Canadians,
Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett,

00:08:16.905 --> 00:08:20.132
came along and developed
a self-report measure of perfectionism.

00:08:20.156 --> 00:08:23.006
So that's right, folks,
you can measure this,

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:28.283
and it essentially captures
three core elements of perfectionism.

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:30.528
The first is self-oriented perfectionism,
