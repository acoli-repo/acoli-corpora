00:05:30.103 --> 00:05:34.127
This is a society that preys
on their insecurities.

00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:36.276
Insecurities about
how they are performing

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.712
and how they are appearing
to other people.

00:05:38.736 --> 00:05:42.248
This is a society that amplifies
their imperfections.

00:05:42.553 --> 00:05:45.252
Every flaw, every unforeseen setback

00:05:45.276 --> 00:05:50.410
increases a need to perform
more perfectly next time, or else,

00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:52.878
bluntly, you're a failure.

00:05:53.188 --> 00:05:56.862
That feeling of being flawed and deficient
is especially pervasive --

00:05:56.886 --> 00:05:58.379
just talk to young people.

00:05:58.403 --> 00:06:00.649
"How should I look, how should I behave?"
