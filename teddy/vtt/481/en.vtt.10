00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.553
And it starts young.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.529
Young people in America's
big city high schools

00:05:05.553 --> 00:05:10.736
take some 112 mandatory standardized tests

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.602
between prekindergarten
and the end of 12th grade.

00:05:14.117 --> 00:05:16.823
No wonder young people report
a strong need to strive,

00:05:16.847 --> 00:05:19.327
perform and achieve
at the center of modern life.

00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:22.231
They've been conditioned
to define themselves

00:05:22.265 --> 00:05:29.367
in the strict and narrow terms
of grades, percentiles and lead tables.
