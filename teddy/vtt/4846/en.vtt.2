Tea only shifted from food
to drink 1,500 years ago

00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:06.252
when people realized that a combination
of heat and moisture

00:01:06.252 --> 00:01:10.992
could create a complex and varied taste
out of the leafy green.

00:01:10.992 --> 00:01:14.032
After hundreds of years of variations
to the preparation method,

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:16.101
the standard became to heat tea,

00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:17.992
pack it into portable cakes,

00:01:17.992 --> 00:01:19.706
grind it into powder,

00:01:19.706 --> 00:01:21.203
mix with hot water,

00:01:21.203 --> 00:01:25.634
and create a beverage 
called muo cha, or matcha.

00:01:25.634 --> 00:01:30.141
Matcha became so popular that a distinct
Chinese tea culture emerged.
