During a long day spent roaming the forest
in search of edible grains and herbs,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.839
the weary divine farmer Shennong
accidentally poisoned himself 72 times.

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:19.139
But before the poisons could end his life,

00:00:19.139 --> 00:00:21.620
a leaf drifted into his mouth.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.130
He chewed on it and it revived him,

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.701
and that is how we discovered tea.

00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:29.562
