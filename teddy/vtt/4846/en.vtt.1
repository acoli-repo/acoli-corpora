00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:31.461
Tea doesn't actually cure poisonings,

00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:33.082
but the story of Shennong,

00:00:33.082 --> 00:00:35.540
the mythical Chinese inventor 
of agriculture,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.682
highlights tea's importance 
to ancient China.

00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:41.811
Archaeological evidence suggests tea
was first cultivated there

00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:44.271
as early as 6,000 years ago,

00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:48.535
or 1,500 years before the pharaohs built
the Great Pyramids of Giza.

00:00:48.535 --> 00:00:50.080
That original Chinese tea plant

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.952
is the same type that's grown 
around the world today,

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:55.631
yet it was originally consumed
very differently.

00:00:55.631 --> 00:00:59.291
It was eaten as a vegetable
or cooked with grain porridge.

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:02.751
Tea only shifted from food
to drink 1,500 years ago
