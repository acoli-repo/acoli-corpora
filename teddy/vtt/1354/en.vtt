00:00:00.843 --> 00:00:02.888
I'd like to show you a video of some of the models

00:00:02.888 --> 00:00:04.477
I work with.

00:00:04.477 --> 00:00:08.015
They're all the perfect size, and they don't have an ounce of fat.

00:00:08.015 --> 00:00:10.553
Did I mention they're gorgeous?

00:00:10.553 --> 00:00:13.683
And they're scientific models? (Laughs)

00:00:13.683 --> 00:00:16.026
As you might have guessed, I'm a tissue engineer,

00:00:16.026 --> 00:00:18.475
and this is a video of some of the beating heart

00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:20.691
that I've engineered in the lab.

00:00:20.691 --> 00:00:22.573
And one day we hope that these tissues

00:00:22.573 --> 00:00:25.517
can serve as replacement parts for the human body.

00:00:25.517 --> 00:00:27.797
But what I'm going to tell you about today

00:00:27.797 --> 00:00:32.244
is how these tissues make awesome models.
