00:00:00.645 --> 00:00:03.196
A herd of wildebeests, a shoal of fish,

00:00:03.196 --> 00:00:04.825
a flock of birds.

00:00:04.825 --> 00:00:06.893
Many animals gather in large groups

00:00:06.893 --> 00:00:08.879
that are among the most wonderful spectacles

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:10.597
in the natural world.

00:00:10.597 --> 00:00:13.321
But why do these groups form?

00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:14.958
The common answers include things like

00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.924
seeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs

00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:20.420
or gathering to mate or breed,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.088
and all of these explanations,

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:23.325
while often true,

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:26.368
make a huge assumption about animal behavior,

00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:29.545
that the animals are in control of their own actions,

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:31.796
that they are in charge of their bodies.
