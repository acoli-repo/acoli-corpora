There's a beautiful statement
on the screen that says,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.056
"Light creates ambiance,
light makes the feel of a space,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.136
and light is also
the expression of structure."

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.976
Well, that was not by me.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.336
That was, of course, by Le Corbusier,
the famous architect.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.976
And here you can see what he meant
in one of his beautiful buildings --

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.176
the chapel Notre Dame Du Haut
De Ronchamp --

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.736
where he creates this light that he could
only make because there's also dark.
