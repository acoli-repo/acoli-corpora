00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.126
So there you have it.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.768
We have scientific evidence
and successes from needle exchanges

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:08.826
methadone and supervised injection sites.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:13.143
These are common-sense,
compassionate approaches to drug use

00:07:13.167 --> 00:07:15.779
that improve health, bring connection

00:07:15.803 --> 00:07:18.834
and greatly reduce suffering and death.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.606
So why haven't harm reduction
programs taken off?

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.883
Why do we still think
that drug use is law enforcement issue?
