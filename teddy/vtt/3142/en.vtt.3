00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.656
in cities like Seattle,
Baltimore and New York

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.013
have been met with stiff opposition:

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.633
opposition that goes against
everything we know about addiction.

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.609
Why is that?

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:44.228
Why are we still stuck on the idea

00:01:44.252 --> 00:01:50.132
that the only option is to stop using --
that any drug use will not be tolerated?

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.756
Why do we ignore
countless personal stories

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.276
and overwhelming scientific evidence

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.303
that harm reduction works?
