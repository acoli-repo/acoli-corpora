but somehow it always
mysteriously reopened,

00:04:00.493 --> 00:04:02.594
often with the aid of a crowbar.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.466
I would go down there some evenings

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.725
to provide medical care
for people who were injecting drugs.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.916
I was always struck with the
commitment and compassion

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.796
of the people who operated
and used the site.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.426
No judgment, no hassles, no fear,

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.431
lots of profound conversation.

00:04:20.455 --> 00:04:23.796
I learned that despite
unimaginable trauma,

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.899
physical pain and mental illness,

00:04:26.923 --> 00:04:30.034
that everyone there thought
that things would get better.
