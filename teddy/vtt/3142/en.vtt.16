00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.881
Virtually millions of people are caught up

00:08:01.905 --> 00:08:06.039
in a hopeless cycle
of incarceration, violence and poverty

00:08:06.063 --> 00:08:11.857
that has been created by our drug laws
and not the drugs themselves.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.027
How do I explain to people
that drug users deserve care and support

00:08:17.051 --> 00:08:18.726
and the freedom to live their lives

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:24.289
when all we see are images of guns
and handcuffs and jail cells?

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.101
Let's be clear:

00:08:27.736 --> 00:08:32.212
criminalization is just a way
to institutionalize stigma.
