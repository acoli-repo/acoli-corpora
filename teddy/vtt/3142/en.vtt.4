00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.766
Critics say that harm
reduction doesn't stop people

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.439
from using illegal drugs.

00:02:07.034 --> 00:02:09.746
Well, actually, that is the whole point.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.626
After every criminal and societal sanction

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.975
that we can come up with,

00:02:14.396 --> 00:02:17.911
people still use drugs,
and far too many die.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.896
Critics also say that
we are giving up on people

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.316
by not focusing our attention
on treatment and recovery.

00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:28.716
In fact, it is just the opposite.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.217
We are not giving up on people.
