After eight years,
the battle to close INSITE

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.946
went all the way up to
Canada's Supreme Court.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.746
It pitted the government of Canada

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.106
against two people with a
long history of drug use

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.593
who knew the benefits of INSITE firsthand:

00:05:10.982 --> 00:05:13.140
Dean Wilson and Shelley Tomic.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.506
The court ruled in favor
of keeping INSITE open by nine to zero.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.347

their response to the government's case.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.005

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:30.664
"The effect of denying the services
of INSITE to the population that it serves
