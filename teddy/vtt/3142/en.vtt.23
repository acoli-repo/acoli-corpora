00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.006
While unintentional overdoses are not new,

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:34.126
the scale of the current
crisis is unprecedented.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.944
The Center for Disease Control estimated

00:11:36.968 --> 00:11:42.111
that 64,000 Americans died
of a drug overdose in 2016,

00:11:42.135 --> 00:11:44.817
far exceeding car crashes or homicides.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.771
Drug-related mortality is now
the leading cause of death

00:11:49.795 --> 00:11:54.310
among men and women between
20 and 50 years old in North America

00:11:55.199 --> 00:11:56.382
Think about that.

00:11:57.133 --> 00:12:01.617
How did we get to this point, and why now?
