00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.217
We are not giving up on people.

00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:32.516
We know that if recovery
is ever going to happen

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.706
we must keep people alive.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.306
Offering someone a clean needle
or a safe place to inject

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.899
is the first step to
treatment and recovery.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.386
Critics also claim that harm reduction

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.864
gives the wrong message to
our children about drug users.

00:02:49.864 --> 00:02:54.244
The last time I looked,
these drug users are our children.

00:02:54.268 --> 00:02:58.316
The message of harm reduction
is that while drugs can hurt you,

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.226
we still must reach out to
people who are addicted.
