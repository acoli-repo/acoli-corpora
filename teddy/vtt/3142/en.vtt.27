00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:33.266
and we would be supporting
the victims and their families.

00:13:34.356 --> 00:13:36.366
But for the drug overdose epidemic,

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.742
we have done none of that.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:42.659
We continue to demonize the drugs
and the people who use them

00:13:42.683 --> 00:13:48.492
and blindly pour even more resources
into law enforcement.

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.818
So where should we go from here?

00:13:53.763 --> 00:13:57.897
First, we should fully embrace,
fund and scale up

00:13:57.921 --> 00:14:00.466
harm reduction programs
across North America.
