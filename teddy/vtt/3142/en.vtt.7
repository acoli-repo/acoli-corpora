is a lot better than
injecting in a dingy alley,

00:03:35.892 --> 00:03:39.153
sharing contaminated needles
and hiding out from police.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.217

a few chairs and a box of clean needles.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.436

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.190
but somehow it always
mysteriously reopened,
