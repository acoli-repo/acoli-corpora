00:12:29.751 --> 00:12:34.314
has provided a steady source
for people wanting to self-medicate.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.092
In response to this prescription epidemic,

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:42.982
people have been cut off, and this
has greatly reduced the street supply

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.502
The unintended but predictable consequence

00:12:46.526 --> 00:12:48.336
is an overdose epidemic.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.685
Many people who were reliant on
a steady supply of prescription drugs

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.161
turned to heroin.

00:12:54.185 --> 00:12:57.717
And now the illegal drug market
has tragically switched

00:12:57.741 --> 00:13:00.167
to synthetic drugs, mainly fentanyl.
