00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.056
People using drugs avoid
the health care system.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.646
They know that once
engaged in clinical care

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.780
or admitted to hospital,
they will be treated poorly.

00:10:08.804 --> 00:10:12.327
And their supply line, be it heroin,
cocaine or crystal meth

00:10:12.351 --> 00:10:13.866
will be interrupted.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.136
On top of that, they will be asked
a barrage of questions

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.326
that only serve
to expose their losses and shame.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.733
"What drugs do you use?"

00:10:23.757 --> 00:10:25.924
"How long have you been
living on the street?"

00:10:25.948 --> 00:10:27.638
"Where are your children?"

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.066
"When were you last in jail?"
