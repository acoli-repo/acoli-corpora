I remember the first time
that I saw people injecting drugs.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.616
I had just arrived in Vancouver
to lead a research project

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.472
in HIV prevention in the
infamous Downtown East Side.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.626
It was in the lobby of the Portland Hotel,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.536
a supportive housing
project that gave rooms

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.936
to the most marginalized
people in the city,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.706
the so-called "difficult to house."

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.190
I'll never forget the young woman
standing on the stairs
