"The effect of denying the services
of INSITE to the population that it serves

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:33.895
and the correlative increase in the risk
of death and disease

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.878
to injection drug users
is grossly disproportionate to any benefit

00:05:38.902 --> 00:05:41.004
that Canada might derive

00:05:41.028 --> 00:05:45.497
from presenting a uniform stance
on the possession of narcotics."

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.913
This was a hopeful moment
for harm reduction.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.802
Yet, despite this strong message
from the Supreme Court,

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.005
it was, until very recently,

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:00.209
impossible to open up
any new sites in Canada.
