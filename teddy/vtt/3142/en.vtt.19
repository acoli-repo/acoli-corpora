At its core, our drug policies

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.399
the majority of the suffering

00:09:41.423 --> 00:09:44.971
happens to people who are
living on the margins,

00:09:44.995 --> 00:09:47.121
the poor and the dispossessed.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.479
They don't vote; they are often alone.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.812
They are society's disposable people.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.946

drug use is highly stigmatized.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.056
People using drugs avoid
the health care system.
