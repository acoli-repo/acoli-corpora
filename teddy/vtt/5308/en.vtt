We're now becoming aware
of a significant relationship

00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:06.236
between sleep and Alzheimer's disease.

Now, Alzheimer's disease
is a form of dementia

00:00:15.277 --> 00:00:19.483
typified usually by memory loss
and memory decline.

00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:21.443
And what we've started to understand

00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:24.435

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.980
One of those proteins
is a sticky, toxic substance
