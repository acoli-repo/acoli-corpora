00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.310
This puzzle is related to 
the Hamiltonian path problem

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.491
named after the 19th century Irish 
mathematician William Rowan Hamilton.

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.050
The challenge 
of the path problem

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.811
is to find whether a given graph
has a Hamiltonian path.

00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:16.081
That's a route that visits 
every point within it exactly once.

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:19.541
This type of problem, classified 
as NP-complete,

00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:24.171
is notoriously difficult when the graph
is sufficiently large.

00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:27.752
Although any proposed solution
can be easily verified,

00:02:27.752 --> 00:02:31.461
we have no reliable formula or shortcut
for finding one,
