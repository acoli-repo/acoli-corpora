00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.734
all the sample vials have broken.

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:32.953
The virus is contained for now,

00:00:32.953 --> 00:00:34.546
but unless you can destroy it,

00:00:34.546 --> 00:00:40.072
the vents will soon open
and unleash a deadly airborne plague.

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:42.640
Without hesitation, you grab
your HazMat suit

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.250
and get ready to save the world.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.041
The lab is a four by four compound
of 16 rooms

00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:54.991
with an entrance on the northwest corner
and an exit at the southeast.

00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:58.412
Each room is connected to the adjacent
ones by an airlock,

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:03.030
and the virus has been released
in every room except the entrance.
