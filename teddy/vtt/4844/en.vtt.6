00:02:55.371 --> 00:03:01.183
That's because the rooms form a grid
with an even number of rooms on each side.

00:03:01.183 --> 00:03:03.442
In any grid with that configuration,

00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:10.222
a Hamiltonian path that starts and 
ends in opposite corners is impossible.

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:12.831
Here's one way of understanding why.

00:03:12.831 --> 00:03:17.562
Consider a checkerboard grid with
an even number of squares on each side.

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:21.012
Every path through it will alternate
black and white.

00:03:21.012 --> 00:03:25.702
These grids will all also have an even
total number of squares

00:03:25.702 --> 00:03:29.653
because an even number times
and even number is even.

00:03:29.653 --> 00:03:34.243
So a Hamiltonian path on an
even-sided grid that starts on black
