It's true that once you activate
the switch in a contaminated room,

00:04:04.504 --> 00:04:07.283

00:04:07.283 --> 00:04:11.473
But there's one room 
that wasn't contaminated - the entrance.

00:04:11.473 --> 00:04:14.994
This means that you can leave it once
without pulling the switch

00:04:14.994 --> 00:04:19.978
and return there when you've
destroyed either of these two rooms.

00:04:19.978 --> 00:04:22.034
The corner room may have
been contaminated

00:04:22.034 --> 00:04:24.983

but that's okay

00:04:24.983 --> 00:04:28.618

That return trip gives you four options
for a successful route,
