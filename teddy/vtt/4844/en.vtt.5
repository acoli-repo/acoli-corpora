00:02:27.752 --> 00:02:31.461
we have no reliable formula or shortcut
for finding one,

00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:33.542
or determining that one exists.

00:02:33.542 --> 00:02:36.091
And we're not even sure
if it's possible for computers

00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:40.351
to reliably find 
such solutions, either.

00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:43.541
This puzzle adds a twist
to the Hamiltonian path problem

00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:47.602
in that you have to start 
and end at specific points.

00:02:47.602 --> 00:02:50.202
But before you waste a ton of graph paper,

00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:52.672
you should know that a true
Hamiltonian path

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:55.371
isn't possible with these end points.

00:02:55.371 --> 00:03:01.183
That's because the rooms form a grid
with an even number of rooms on each side.
