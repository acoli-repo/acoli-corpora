00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:03.030
and the virus has been released
in every room except the entrance.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.040
To destroy it, you must enter each
contaminated room

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.480
and pull its emergency 
self-destruct switch.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.540
But there's a catch.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.822
Because the security system 
is on lockdown,

00:01:13.822 --> 00:01:16.111
once you enter the contaminated room,

00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:19.580
you can't exit without 
activating the switch,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.070
and once you've done so,

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.401
you won't be able to go 
back in to that room.

00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:29.150
You start to draw out possible
routes on a pad of paper,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.324
but nothing seems to get you
to the exit
