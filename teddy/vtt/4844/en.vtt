Your research team has found
a prehistoric virus

00:00:10.778 --> 00:00:12.689
preserved in the permafrost

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:15.170
and isolated it for study.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.859
After a late night working,

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.489
you're just closing up the lab
when a sudden earthquake hits

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.449
and knocks out the power.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.449
As the emergency generators kick in,
an alarm confirms your worst fears:

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.734
all the sample vials have broken.
