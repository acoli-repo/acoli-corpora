00:03:29.653 --> 00:03:34.243
So a Hamiltonian path on an
even-sided grid that starts on black

00:03:34.243 --> 00:03:36.483
will have to end on white.

00:03:36.483 --> 00:03:40.294
And one that starts on white
will have to end on black.

00:03:40.294 --> 00:03:43.152
However, in any grid with even
numbered sides,

00:03:43.152 --> 00:03:46.112
opposite corners are the same color,

00:03:46.112 --> 00:03:52.753
so it's impossible to start and end
a Hamiltonian path on opposite corners.

00:03:52.753 --> 00:03:54.734
It seems like you're out of luck,

00:03:54.734 --> 00:04:00.644
unless you look at the rules carefully
and notice an important exception.
