00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.324
but nothing seems to get you
to the exit

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:34.410
without missing at least one room.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.341
So how can you destroy the virus
in every contaminated room

00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:40.732
and survive to tell the story?

00:01:40.732 --> 00:01:45.592
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself.

00:01:45.592 --> 00:01:47.036
Answer in: 3

00:01:47.036 --> 00:01:48.890
Answer in: 2

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.843
Answer in: 1

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:54.800
If your first instinct is to try to graph
your possible moves on a grid,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.960
you've got the right idea.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.310
This puzzle is related to 
the Hamiltonian path problem
