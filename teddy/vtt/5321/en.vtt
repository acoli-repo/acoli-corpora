In the mid-1970s, after decades 
of political turmoil,

00:00:11.032 --> 00:00:14.692
Greece finally seemed 
to be on the path to stability.

00:00:14.692 --> 00:00:17.092
With the introduction 
of a new constitution

00:00:17.092 --> 00:00:21.092
and negotiations underway 
to enter European institutions,

00:00:21.092 --> 00:00:23.702
many analysts expected Greek politics

00:00:23.702 --> 00:00:27.072
to follow the pattern 
of the larger Western world.

00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:32.398
Then in 1981, a political party 
called PASOK came to power.
