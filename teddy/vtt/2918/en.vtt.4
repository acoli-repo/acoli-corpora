You're quite impatient
with the rest of humanity, in fact.

00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:04.531
So when you get up to immigration
with your shirt collar out

00:02:04.555 --> 00:02:06.044
and a day's growth of beard,

00:02:06.068 --> 00:02:09.407
and you have very little patience,

00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:12.159
and the immigration officer
looked at my passport

00:02:12.183 --> 00:02:14.291
and said, "What do you do, Mr. Whyte?"

00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:19.457
I said, "I work with the conversational
nature of reality."

00:02:19.481 --> 00:02:23.392
(Laughter)

00:02:24.964 --> 00:02:27.233
And he leaned forward over his podium

00:02:27.257 --> 00:02:30.187
and he said, "I needed you last night."
