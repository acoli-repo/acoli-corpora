00:11:30.655 --> 00:11:35.471
You can somehow be immune
to all of the difficulties

00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:39.679
and ill health and losses

00:11:39.703 --> 00:11:44.051
that humanity has been subject to
since the beginning of time.

00:11:44.075 --> 00:11:45.791
If we look out at the natural world,

00:11:45.815 --> 00:11:47.319
there's no part of that world

00:11:47.343 --> 00:11:51.295
that doesn't go through cycles
of, first, incipience,

00:11:51.319 --> 00:11:52.521
or hiddenness,

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:54.974
but then growth, fullness,

00:11:55.713 --> 00:11:59.235
but then a beautiful,
to begin with, disappearance,

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:02.282
and then a very austere,
full disappearance.
