And the second ritual is that you burn
something that you've brought.

00:06:03.168 --> 00:06:05.610
I said, "What did you burn, Marlene?"

00:06:05.634 --> 00:06:08.074
She said, "I burned a letter
and two postcards."

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:09.812
I said, "Astonishing.

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:11.880
Twenty-three years old and you have paper.

00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:13.080
I can't believe it."

00:06:16.113 --> 00:06:20.521

a traumatic text, you know?

00:06:20.545 --> 00:06:22.077
(Laughter)

00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:24.117
It will engage the flashlight,

00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:25.773
imbue it with color

00:06:25.797 --> 00:06:28.941
and disappear in a firework of flames.
