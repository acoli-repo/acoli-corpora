00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:31.455
how little time we spend
at this conversational frontier,

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:37.138
and not abstracted away from it
in one strategy or another.

00:01:37.636 --> 00:01:42.377
I was coming through immigration,

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:45.901
which is quite a dramatic
border at the moment,

00:01:45.925 --> 00:01:48.382
into the US last year,

00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:51.371
and, you know, you get off
an international flight

00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:52.547
across the Atlantic,

00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:54.266
and you're not in the best place;

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.843
you're not at your most
spiritually mature.

00:01:56.867 --> 00:02:00.132
You're quite impatient
with the rest of humanity, in fact.
