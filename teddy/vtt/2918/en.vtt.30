00:15:03.596 --> 00:15:05.270
right from where I'm standing,

00:15:05.294 --> 00:15:06.928
right to the horizon.

00:15:08.221 --> 00:15:10.024
But when you think about it,

00:15:10.048 --> 00:15:13.447

So, no;

00:15:28.342 --> 00:15:29.957
you see the path,

00:15:29.981 --> 00:15:31.863
and then you don't
