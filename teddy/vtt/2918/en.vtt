00:00:00.865 --> 00:00:04.484
The youthful perspective on the future,

00:00:05.128 --> 00:00:07.662
the present perspective on the future

00:00:07.686 --> 00:00:12.233
and the future, mature
perspective on the future --

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.778
I'd like to try and bring
all those three tenses together

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:18.931
in one identity tonight.

00:00:19.517 --> 00:00:22.762
And you could say
that the poet, in many ways,

00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:26.578
looks at what I call
"the conversational nature of reality."

00:00:27.156 --> 00:00:28.858
And you ask yourself:

00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:31.113
What is the conversational
nature of reality?
