00:07:57.418 --> 00:08:01.539
The moon was losing its reflection,

00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:03.827
and my shadow was disappearing.

00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:06.963
The most powerful moment
I had on the whole Camino

00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:12.975
was when I realized I myself
had to walk across that unknown sea

00:08:12.999 --> 00:08:14.406
into my future."

00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:17.653
Well, I was so taken by this story,

00:08:17.677 --> 00:08:19.002
I wrote this piece for her.

00:08:19.026 --> 00:08:20.531
We were driving at the time;

00:08:20.555 --> 00:08:22.228
we got home, I sat on the couch,

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.029
I wrote until two in the morning --

00:08:24.053 --> 00:08:25.447
everyone had gone to bed --

00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:28.318
and I gave it to Marlene
at breakfast time.

00:08:28.342 --> 00:08:31.513
It's called, "Finisterre,"
for Marlene McCormack.
