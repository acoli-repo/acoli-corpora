00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:30.454
Because the scallop shell has been
the icon and badge of your walk,

00:05:30.478 --> 00:05:33.255
and every arrow
that you have seen along that way

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:37.344
has been pointing underneath
a scallop shell.

00:05:37.368 --> 00:05:39.453
So really, this first ritual is saying:

00:05:39.477 --> 00:05:41.385
How did you get to this place?

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.245
How did you follow the path to get here?

00:05:44.963 --> 00:05:50.085
How do you hold the conversation of life
when you feel unbesieged,

00:05:50.109 --> 00:05:51.267
when you're unbullied,

00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:52.699
when you're left to yourself?

00:05:52.723 --> 00:05:57.636
How do you hold the conversation of life
that brings you to this place?

00:05:58.217 --> 00:06:02.629
And the second ritual is that you burn
something that you've brought.
