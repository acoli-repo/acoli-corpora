00:14:29.263 --> 00:14:30.413
Why?

00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:32.264
Because you have to ask for help.

00:14:38.959 --> 00:14:40.347
Heartbreak.

00:14:40.371 --> 00:14:42.483
We don't have a choice about heartbreak,

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:46.482
we only have a choice
of having our hearts broken

00:14:46.506 --> 00:14:51.936
over people and things and projects
that we deeply care about.

00:14:53.404 --> 00:14:55.472
And the last illusion is,

00:14:55.496 --> 00:14:59.933
I can somehow plan enough
and arrange things

00:14:59.957 --> 00:15:03.572
that I will be able to see
the path to the end
