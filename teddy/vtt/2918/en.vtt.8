00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.725
to this place where Marlene stood,
called, in Spanish, Finisterre,

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:06.726
in English, Finisterre,

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.167
from the Latin,
meaning "the ends of the earth,"

00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:13.238
the place where ground turns to ocean;

00:04:13.262 --> 00:04:17.647
the place where your present
turns into the future.

00:04:18.598 --> 00:04:20.256
And Marlene had walked this way --

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.974
she just graduated as a 23-year-old
from the University of Sligo

00:04:23.998 --> 00:04:26.375
with a degree in Irish drama.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:29.791
And she said to me, "I don't think
the major corporations of the world

00:04:29.815 --> 00:04:31.220
will be knocking on my door."
