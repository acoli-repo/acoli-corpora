in which I will not have my heart broken.

00:12:35.102 --> 00:12:37.750

of a new romance or a new marriage,

00:12:41.222 --> 00:12:45.361

who will not break my heart."

00:12:45.805 --> 00:12:47.150

00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:58.081
Because you care about them.

00:12:58.105 --> 00:13:00.271
You look at parenting, yeah?
