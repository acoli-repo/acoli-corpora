00:02:59.228 --> 00:03:02.073
But all of us live
at this conversational frontier

00:03:02.097 --> 00:03:04.185
with the future.

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.963
I'd like to put you in the shoes
of my Irish niece,

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.738
Marlene McCormack,

00:03:09.762 --> 00:03:13.206
standing on a cliff edge
on the western coast of Spain,

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.237
overlooking the broad Atlantic.

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:19.018
Twenty-three years old,
she's just walked 500 miles

00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:22.624
from Saint Jean Pied de Port
on the French side of the Pyrenees,

00:03:22.648 --> 00:03:24.425
all the way across Northern Spain,

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:28.460
on this very famous,
old and contemporary pilgrimage

00:03:28.484 --> 00:03:32.019
called the Camino de Santiago
de Compostela --
