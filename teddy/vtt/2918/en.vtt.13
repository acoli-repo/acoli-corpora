00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:38.905
And of course we know intuitively
what is on those letters and postcards.

00:06:38.929 --> 00:06:44.621
It's a form of affection and love
that is now no longer extant, yeah?

00:06:46.434 --> 00:06:47.993
And then the third ritual:

00:06:49.194 --> 00:06:53.631
between all these fires
are large piles of clothes.

00:06:54.405 --> 00:06:56.858
And you leave an item of clothing

00:06:56.882 --> 00:06:59.270
