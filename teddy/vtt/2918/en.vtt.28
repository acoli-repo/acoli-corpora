And then we hope that our armored,
professional personalities

00:14:05.096 --> 00:14:08.232
will prevent us from having our
heart broken in work.

00:14:08.865 --> 00:14:11.270
But if you're sincere about your work,

00:14:11.977 --> 00:14:13.587
it should break your heart.

00:14:14.173 --> 00:14:15.961
You should get to thresholds

00:14:15.985 --> 00:14:19.504
where you do not know how to proceed.

00:14:20.032 --> 00:14:23.388
You do not know how to get
from here to there.

00:14:24.799 --> 00:14:25.963
What does that do?

00:14:25.987 --> 00:14:29.239
It puts you into a proper
relationship with reality.

00:14:29.263 --> 00:14:30.413
Why?
