00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.334
whatever our partner,
our child, our colleague,

00:01:02.358 --> 00:01:03.547
our industry,

00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:06.258
our future demands of us,

00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:07.976
will also not happen.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.953
And what actually happens

00:01:09.977 --> 00:01:14.357
is this frontier
between what you think is you

00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:16.217
and what you think is not you.

00:01:16.787 --> 00:01:19.378

00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:22.496
between what we call a self
and what we call the world

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.238
is the only place, actually,
where things are real.

00:01:25.664 --> 00:01:27.250
But it's quite astonishing,

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:31.455
how little time we spend
at this conversational frontier,
