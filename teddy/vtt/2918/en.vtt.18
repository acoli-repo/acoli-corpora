00:08:59.395 --> 00:09:01.303
no way to your future now

00:09:01.327 --> 00:09:02.519
no way to your future now

00:09:02.543 --> 00:09:05.306
except the way your shadow could take,

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.643
walking before you across water,
going where shadows go,

00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:13.493
no way to make sense of a world
that wouldn't let you pass

00:09:13.517 --> 00:09:17.232
except to call an end
to the way you had come,

00:09:18.442 --> 00:09:23.561
to take out each letter you had brought

00:09:23.585 --> 00:09:26.050
and light their illumined corners;

00:09:26.074 --> 00:09:31.158
and to read them as they drifted
on the late western light;
