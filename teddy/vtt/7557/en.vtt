It is lovely to be with you
here this evening.

00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:05.835
So as you just heard,
my name is Katherine Maher

00:00:05.877 --> 00:00:10.965
and I used to be, until very recently,
the CEO of the Wikimedia Foundation,

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:14.302
which is the organization
behind Wikipedia.

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:20.475
And my tenure coincided
with a very strange time for information.

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:24.395
A global crisis of fake news
and disinformation,

00:00:24.437 --> 00:00:27.315
which meant that our
free-knowledge movement

00:00:27.356 --> 00:00:29.275
really sort of stood alone.

00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:31.569
At the same time, too,
