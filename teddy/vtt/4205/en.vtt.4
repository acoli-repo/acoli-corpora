00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.456
And often I would bunk classes
to sit in the library

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.376
where I started reading
books on child development.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.576
I became so interested in this
subject that I thought that

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.780
I would at least attain enough
expertise on this subject

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.800
to be able to raise my children well.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.976
When I received my MCA Degree,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.616
it was a chance for me
to make a very good career,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.256
but I had no desire to pursue it.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.176
And yet again I let down my loved ones.
