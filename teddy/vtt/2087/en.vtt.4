00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.236
Let's see how it works in actual practice.

00:02:02.236 --> 00:02:05.024
So what we've got here now is the global footprint

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:07.317
of all the TEDx Talks over the last four years

00:02:07.317 --> 00:02:08.867
exploding out around the world

00:02:08.867 --> 00:02:12.196
from New York all the way down to little old New Zealand in the corner.

00:02:12.196 --> 00:02:16.031
And what we did on this is we analyzed the top 25 percent of these,

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:18.565
and we started to see where the connections occurred,

00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:20.102
where they connected with each other.

00:02:20.102 --> 00:02:21.976
Cameron Russell talking about image and beauty

00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:23.551
connected over into Europe.

00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:25.963
We've got a bigger conversation about Israel and Palestine

00:02:25.963 --> 00:02:28.218
radiating outwards from the Middle East.

00:02:28.218 --> 00:02:29.516
And we've got something a little broader

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:31.672
like big data with a truly global footprint
