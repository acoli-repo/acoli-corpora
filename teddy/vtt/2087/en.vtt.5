00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:31.672
like big data with a truly global footprint

00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:33.851
reminiscent of a conversation

00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:35.867
that is happening everywhere.

00:02:35.867 --> 00:02:38.040
So from this, we kind of run up against the limits

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.570
of what we can actually do with a geographic projection,

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.622
but luckily, computer technology allows us to go out

00:02:42.622 --> 00:02:44.168
into multidimensional space.

00:02:44.168 --> 00:02:46.043
So we can take in our network projection

00:02:46.043 --> 00:02:47.793
and apply a physics engine to this,

00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:49.678
and the similar talks kind of smash together,

00:02:49.678 --> 00:02:51.682
and the different ones fly apart,

00:02:51.682 --> 00:02:53.754
and what we're left with is something quite beautiful.

00:02:53.754 --> 00:02:56.711
EB: So I want to just point out here that every node is a talk,

00:02:56.711 --> 00:02:59.300
they're linked if they share similar ideas,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.384
and that comes from a machine reading
