00:03:57.685 --> 00:04:00.316
What you're getting is a range of smaller conversations,

00:04:00.316 --> 00:04:02.617
each connected to each other through the ideas

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:03.918
and the language they share,

00:04:03.918 --> 00:04:06.368
creating a broader concept of the environment.

00:04:06.368 --> 00:04:07.900
And of course, from here, we can go

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.434
and zoom in and see, well, what are young people looking at?

00:04:11.434 --> 00:04:13.779
And they're looking at energy technology and nuclear fusion.

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:15.453
This is their kind of resonance

00:04:15.453 --> 00:04:17.859
for the conversation around the environment.

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.758
If we split along gender lines,

00:04:19.758 --> 00:04:21.745
we can see females resonating heavily

00:04:21.745 --> 00:04:25.390
with food economy, but also out there in hope and optimism.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.872
And so there's a lot of exciting stuff we can do here,

00:04:27.872 --> 00:04:29.634
and I'll throw to Eric for the next part.

00:04:29.634 --> 00:04:31.236
EB: Yeah, I mean, just to point out here,
