00:00:27.758 --> 00:00:31.525
Sean Gourley: Exactly. So we took 24,000 TEDx Talks

00:00:31.525 --> 00:00:34.571
from around the world, 147 different countries,

00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:36.694
and we took these talks and we wanted to find

00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:38.734
the mathematical structures that underly

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:40.456
the ideas behind them.

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:41.826
And we wanted to do that so we could see how

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:43.879
they connected with each other.

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.555
And so, of course, if you're going to do this kind of stuff,

00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:46.511
you need a lot of data.

00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:50.197
So the data that you've got is a great thing called YouTube,

00:00:50.197 --> 00:00:51.965
and we can go down and basically pull

00:00:51.965 --> 00:00:54.232
all the open information from YouTube,

00:00:54.232 --> 00:00:56.581
all the comments, all the views, who's watching it,

00:00:56.581 --> 00:00:59.360
where are they watching it, what are they saying in the comments.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.652
But we can also pull up, using speech-to-text translation,
