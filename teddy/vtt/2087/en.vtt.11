00:05:29.176 --> 00:05:31.290
Remember, it's that network structure

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.558
that is creating these emergent topics,

00:05:33.558 --> 00:05:35.073
and let's say we could take two of them,

00:05:35.073 --> 00:05:38.120
like cities and genetics, and say, well, are there any talks

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.689
that creatively bridge these two really different disciplines.

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:42.964
And that's -- Essentially, this kind of creative remix

00:05:42.964 --> 00:05:44.804
is one of the hallmarks of innovation.

00:05:44.804 --> 00:05:46.410
Well here's one by Jessica Green

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.789
about the microbial ecology of buildings.

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.799
It's literally defining a new field.

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:52.902
And we could go back to those topics and say, well,

00:05:52.902 --> 00:05:55.670
what talks are central to those conversations?

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.360
In the cities cluster, one of the most central

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.312
was one by Mitch Joachim about ecological cities,
