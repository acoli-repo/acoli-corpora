Eric Berlow: I'm an ecologist, and Sean's a physicist,

00:00:03.623 --> 00:00:05.731
and we both study complex networks.

00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:07.566
And we met a couple years ago when we discovered

00:00:07.566 --> 00:00:09.566
that we had both given a short TED Talk

00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.869
about the ecology of war,

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:13.316
and we realized that we were connected

00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:16.134
by the ideas we shared before we ever met.

00:00:16.134 --> 00:00:17.690
And then we thought, you know, there are thousands

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.804
of other talks out there, especially TEDx Talks,

00:00:19.804 --> 00:00:22.015
that are popping up all over the world.

00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:22.938
How are they connected,

00:00:22.938 --> 00:00:24.948
and what does that global conversation look like?

00:00:24.948 --> 00:00:27.758
So Sean's going to tell you a little bit about how we did that.

00:00:27.758 --> 00:00:31.525
Sean Gourley: Exactly. So we took 24,000 TEDx Talks
