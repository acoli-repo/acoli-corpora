00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.384
and that comes from a machine reading

00:03:01.384 --> 00:03:03.451
of entire talk transcripts,

00:03:03.451 --> 00:03:05.682
and then all these topics that pop out,

00:03:05.682 --> 00:03:07.472
they're not from tags and keywords.

00:03:07.472 --> 00:03:09.197
They come from the network structure

00:03:09.197 --> 00:03:11.365
of interconnected ideas. Keep going.

00:03:11.365 --> 00:03:13.387
SG: Absolutely. So I got a little quick on that,

00:03:13.387 --> 00:03:14.862
but he's going to slow me down.

00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:16.896
We've got education connected to storytelling

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:18.539
triangulated next to social media.

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:21.014
You've got, of course, the human brain right next to healthcare,

00:03:21.014 --> 00:03:22.400
which you might expect,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.795
but also you've got video games, which is sort of adjacent,

00:03:24.795 --> 00:03:27.535
as those two spaces interface with each other.

00:03:27.535 --> 00:03:29.070
But I want to take you into one cluster

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.938
that's particularly important to me, and that's the environment.
