WEBVTT

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.312
was one by Mitch Joachim about ecological cities,

00:06:01.312 --> 00:06:03.032
and in the genetics cluster,

00:06:03.032 --> 00:06:06.225
we have a talk about synthetic biology by Craig Venter.

00:06:06.225 --> 00:06:09.578
These are talks that are linking many talks within their discipline.

00:06:09.578 --> 00:06:11.421
We could go the other direction and say, well,

00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:13.693
what are talks that are broadly synthesizing

00:06:13.693 --> 00:06:15.141
a lot of different kinds of fields.

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:17.674
We used a measure of ecological diversity to get this.

00:06:17.674 --> 00:06:20.410
Like, a talk by Steven Pinker on the history of violence,

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:21.590
very synthetic.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.668
And then, of course, there are talks that are so unique

00:06:23.668 --> 00:06:26.758
they're kind of out in the stratosphere, in their own special place,

00:06:26.758 --> 00:06:29.272
and we call that the Colleen Flanagan index.

00:06:29.272 --> 00:06:32.306
And if you don't know Colleen, she's an artist,
