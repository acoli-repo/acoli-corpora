EB: Yeah, I mean, just to point out here,

00:04:31.236 --> 00:04:32.774
you cannot get this kind of perspective

00:04:32.774 --> 00:04:36.134
from a simple tag search on YouTube.

00:04:36.134 --> 00:04:40.322
Let's now zoom back out to the entire global conversation

00:04:40.322 --> 00:04:42.856
out of environment, and look at all the talks together.

00:04:42.856 --> 00:04:45.783
Now often, when we're faced with this amount of content,

00:04:45.783 --> 00:04:48.214
we do a couple of things to simplify it.

00:04:48.214 --> 00:04:49.528
We might just say, well,

00:04:49.528 --> 00:04:52.357
what are the most popular talks out there?

00:04:52.357 --> 00:04:53.754
And a few rise to the surface.

00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:55.582
There's a talk about gratitude.

00:04:55.582 --> 00:04:58.926
There's another one about personal health and nutrition.

00:04:58.926 --> 00:05:01.855
And of course, there's got to be one about porn, right?
