00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.652
But we can also pull up, using speech-to-text translation,

00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:04.780
we can pull the entire transcript,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.460
and that works even for people with kind of funny accents like myself.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.566
So we can take their transcript

00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:11.664
and actually do some pretty cool things.

00:01:11.664 --> 00:01:13.824
We can take natural language processing algorithms

00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:16.453
to kind of read through with a computer, line by line,

00:01:16.453 --> 00:01:18.812
extracting key concepts from this.

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:21.337
And we take those key concepts and they sort of form

00:01:21.337 --> 00:01:24.902
this mathematical structure of an idea.

00:01:24.902 --> 00:01:26.659
And we call that the meme-ome.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.810
And the meme-ome, you know, quite simply,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.236
is the mathematics that underlies an idea,
