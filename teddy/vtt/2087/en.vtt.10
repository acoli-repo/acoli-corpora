And of course, there's got to be one about porn, right?

00:05:01.855 --> 00:05:05.089
And so then we might say, well, gratitude, that was last year.

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:07.611
What's trending now? What's the popular talk now?

00:05:07.611 --> 00:05:10.932
And we can see that the new, emerging, top trending topic

00:05:10.932 --> 00:05:13.598
is about digital privacy.

00:05:13.598 --> 00:05:15.291
So this is great. It simplifies things.

00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:17.118

And I hate that. How do we bubble stuff up to the surface

00:05:22.357 --> 00:05:24.815

00:05:24.815 --> 00:05:27.746
Well, we can go back to the network structure of ideas

00:05:27.746 --> 00:05:29.176
to do that.

00:05:29.176 --> 00:05:31.290
Remember, it's that network structure
