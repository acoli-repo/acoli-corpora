And if you don't know Colleen, she's an artist,

00:06:32.306 --> 00:06:33.849
and I asked her, "Well, what's it like out there

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:35.521
in the stratosphere of our idea space?"

00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:38.776
And apparently it smells like bacon.

00:06:38.776 --> 00:06:40.567
I wouldn't know.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.815
So we're using these network motifs

00:06:42.815 --> 00:06:44.001
to find talks that are unique,

00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:46.711
ones that are creatively synthesizing a lot of different fields,

00:06:46.711 --> 00:06:48.370
ones that are central to their topic,

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.744
and ones that are really creatively bridging disparate fields.

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:53.846
Okay? We never would have found those with our obsession

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:56.159
with what's trending now.

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:59.045
And all of this comes from the architecture of complexity,

00:06:59.045 --> 00:07:02.005
or the patterns of how things are connected.
