00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.938
that's particularly important to me, and that's the environment.

00:03:31.938 --> 00:03:33.431
And I want to kind of zoom in on that

00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:35.794
and see if we can get a little more resolution.

00:03:35.794 --> 00:03:38.141
So as we go in here, what we start to see,

00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:39.645
apply the physics engine again,

00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:41.321
we see what's one conversation

00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.881
is actually composed of many smaller ones.

00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:45.810
The structure starts to emerge

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.880
where we see a kind of fractal behavior

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.499
of the words and the language that we use

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:51.201
to describe the things that are important to us

00:03:51.201 --> 00:03:52.634
all around this world.

00:03:52.634 --> 00:03:54.966
So you've got food economy and local food at the top,

00:03:54.966 --> 00:03:57.685
you've got greenhouse gases, solar and nuclear waste.

00:03:57.685 --> 00:04:00.316
What you're getting is a range of smaller conversations,
