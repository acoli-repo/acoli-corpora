00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.236
is the mathematics that underlies an idea,

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:33.168
and we can do some pretty interesting analysis with it,

00:01:33.168 --> 00:01:35.149
which I want to share with you now.

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.339
So each idea has its own meme-ome,

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:39.290
and each idea is unique with that,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.778
but of course, ideas, they borrow from each other,

00:01:41.778 --> 00:01:42.962
they kind of steal sometimes,

00:01:42.962 --> 00:01:44.789
and they certainly build on each other,

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.405
and we can go through mathematically

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:48.245
and take the meme-ome from one talk

00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:50.699
and compare it to the meme-ome from every other talk,

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:52.672
and if there's a similarity between the two of them,

00:01:52.672 --> 00:01:55.922
we can create a link and represent that as a graph,

00:01:55.922 --> 00:01:58.316
just like Eric and I are connected.

00:01:58.316 --> 00:01:59.710
So that's theory, that's great.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.236
Let's see how it works in actual practice.
