00:06:59.045 --> 00:07:02.005
or the patterns of how things are connected.

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.630
SG: So that's exactly right.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.109
We've got ourselves in a world

00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:08.153
that's massively complex,

00:07:08.153 --> 00:07:11.020
and we've been using algorithms to kind of filter it down

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.806
so we can navigate through it.

00:07:12.806 --> 00:07:15.144
And those algorithms, whilst being kind of useful,

00:07:15.144 --> 00:07:18.620
are also very, very narrow, and we can do better than that,

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.186
because we can realize that their complexity is not random.

00:07:21.186 --> 00:07:23.140
It has mathematical structure,

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.943
and we can use that mathematical structure

00:07:24.943 --> 00:07:27.157
to go and explore things like the world of ideas

00:07:27.157 --> 00:07:30.157
to see what's being said, to see what's not being said,
