What we're doing is taking
this artificial smartness

00:03:03.117 --> 00:03:05.540
and we're making it smarter and smarter.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.605
There are three aspects
to this general trend

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.318
that I think are underappreciated;

00:03:12.342 --> 00:03:14.619
I think we would understand
AI a lot better

00:03:14.643 --> 00:03:16.944
if we understood these three things.

00:03:16.968 --> 00:03:20.251
I think these things also would
help us embrace AI,

00:03:20.275 --> 00:03:23.283
because it's only by embracing it
that we actually can steer it.

00:03:23.887 --> 00:03:27.044
We can actually steer the specifics
by embracing the larger trend.

00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:30.446
So let me talk about
those three different aspects.
