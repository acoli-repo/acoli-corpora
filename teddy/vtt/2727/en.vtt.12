00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.934
it's not worrying about whether
it left the stove on,

00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.096
or whether it should have
majored in finance.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.273
It's just driving.

00:06:05.297 --> 00:06:06.439
(Laughter)

00:06:06.463 --> 00:06:08.304
Just driving, OK?

00:06:08.328 --> 00:06:11.265
And we actually might even
come to advertise these

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:12.834
as "consciousness-free."

00:06:12.858 --> 00:06:14.632
They're without consciousness,

00:06:14.656 --> 00:06:16.760
they're not concerned about those things,

00:06:16.784 --> 00:06:17.940
they're not distracted.

00:06:17.964 --> 00:06:20.930
So in general, what we're trying to do

00:06:20.954 --> 00:06:25.454
is make as many different
types of thinking as we can.

00:06:25.804 --> 00:06:27.887
We're going to populate the space

00:06:27.911 --> 00:06:32.070
of all the different possible types,
or species, of thinking.
