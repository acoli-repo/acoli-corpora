Productivity is for robots.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.030
What we're really good at
is basically wasting time.

00:11:04.054 --> 00:11:05.082
(Laughter)

00:11:05.106 --> 00:11:07.422
We're really good at things
that are inefficient.

00:11:07.446 --> 00:11:10.471
Science is inherently inefficient.

00:11:10.816 --> 00:11:13.722
It runs on that fact that you have
one failure after another.

00:11:13.746 --> 00:11:17.170
It runs on the fact that you make tests
and experiments that don't work,

00:11:17.194 --> 00:11:18.636
otherwise you're not learning.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.822
It runs on the fact

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:21.929
that there is not
a lot of efficiency in it.

00:11:21.953 --> 00:11:24.732
Innovation by definition is inefficient,

00:11:24.756 --> 00:11:26.147
because you make prototypes,

00:11:26.171 --> 00:11:28.878
because you try stuff that fails,
that doesn't work.

00:11:28.902 --> 00:11:32.014
Exploration is inherently inefficiency.
