00:00:58.377 --> 00:01:02.949
And so these baked-in
tendencies and urgencies

00:01:02.973 --> 00:01:04.449
in technological systems

00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:08.660
give us a sense of where things
are going at the large form.

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:10.550
So in a large sense,

00:01:10.574 --> 00:01:13.935
I would say that telephones
were inevitable,

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:16.347
but the iPhone was not.

00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:18.572
The Internet was inevitable,

00:01:19.274 --> 00:01:20.560
but Twitter was not.

00:01:21.036 --> 00:01:24.964
So we have many ongoing
tendencies right now,

00:01:24.988 --> 00:01:27.708
and I think one of the chief among them

00:01:27.732 --> 00:01:31.454
is this tendency to make things
smarter and smarter.
