00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:30.446
So let me talk about
those three different aspects.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.143
The first one is: our own intelligence
has a very poor understanding

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:35.657
of what intelligence is.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.763
We tend to think of intelligence
as a single dimension,

00:03:39.787 --> 00:03:42.537
that it's kind of like a note
that gets louder and louder.

00:03:42.561 --> 00:03:45.168
It starts like with IQ measurement.

00:03:45.192 --> 00:03:49.284
It starts with maybe a simple
low IQ in a rat or mouse,

00:03:49.308 --> 00:03:51.442
and maybe there's more in a chimpanzee,

00:03:51.887 --> 00:03:54.078
and then maybe there's more
in a stupid person,

00:03:54.102 --> 00:03:56.198
and then maybe an average
person like myself,

00:03:56.222 --> 00:03:57.512
and then maybe a genius.

00:03:57.536 --> 00:04:01.969
And this single IQ intelligence
is getting greater and greater.
