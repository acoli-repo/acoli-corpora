or species, of thinking.

00:06:32.094 --> 00:06:34.162
And there actually may be some problems

00:06:34.186 --> 00:06:36.986
that are so difficult
in business and science

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.052
that our own type of human thinking
may not be able to solve them alone.

00:06:41.076 --> 00:06:43.068
We may need a two-step program,

00:06:43.092 --> 00:06:47.295
which is to invent new kinds of thinking

00:06:47.692 --> 00:06:51.426
that we can work alongside of to solve
these really large problems,

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.368
say, like dark energy or quantum gravity.

00:06:56.496 --> 00:06:59.142
What we're doing
is making alien intelligences.

00:06:59.166 --> 00:07:03.235
You might even think of this
as, sort of, artificial aliens
