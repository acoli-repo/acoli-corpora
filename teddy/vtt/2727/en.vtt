00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:06.783
I'm going to talk a little bit
about where technology's going.

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.180
And often technology comes to us,

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.431
we're surprised by what it brings.

00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:16.138
But there's actually
a large aspect of technology

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:17.964
that's much more predictable,

00:00:17.988 --> 00:00:22.076
and that's because technological systems
of all sorts have leanings,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.275
they have urgencies,

00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:24.860
they have tendencies.

00:00:24.884 --> 00:00:29.816
And those tendencies are derived
from the very nature of the physics,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.990
chemistry of wires
and switches and electrons,
