00:04:58.233 --> 00:05:00.963
When we go to make machines,

00:05:00.987 --> 00:05:03.183
we're going to engineer
them in the same way,

00:05:03.207 --> 00:05:08.217
where we'll make some of those types
of smartness much greater than ours,

00:05:08.241 --> 00:05:10.812
and many of them won't be
anywhere near ours,

00:05:10.836 --> 00:05:12.380
because they're not needed.

00:05:12.404 --> 00:05:14.607
So we're going to take these things,

00:05:14.631 --> 00:05:16.712
these artificial clusters,

00:05:16.736 --> 00:05:22.098
and we'll be adding more varieties
of artificial cognition to our AIs.

00:05:22.507 --> 00:05:26.578
We're going to make them
very, very specific.

00:05:26.602 --> 00:05:33.144
So your calculator is smarter
than you are in arithmetic already;
