00:04:26.295 --> 00:04:30.316
we have maybe 100 different types
that are all grouped together,

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.245
and they vary in different strengths
with different people.

00:04:34.269 --> 00:04:38.795
And of course, if we go to animals,
they also have another basket --

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.360
another symphony of different
kinds of intelligences,

00:04:41.384 --> 00:04:44.950
and sometimes those same instruments
are the same that we have.

00:04:44.974 --> 00:04:48.535
They can think in the same way,
but they may have a different arrangement,

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:51.026
and maybe they're higher
in some cases than humans,

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.887
like long-term memory in a squirrel
is actually phenomenal,

00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:56.198
so it can remember
where it buried its nuts.

00:04:56.222 --> 00:04:58.209
But in other cases they may be lower.

00:04:58.233 --> 00:05:00.963
When we go to make machines,
