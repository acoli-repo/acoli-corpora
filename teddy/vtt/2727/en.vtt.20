00:10:00.017 --> 00:10:01.190
we get robots.

00:10:01.214 --> 00:10:02.917
And robots are going to be bots,

00:10:02.941 --> 00:10:06.269
they're going to be doing many
of the tasks that we have already done.

00:10:08.357 --> 00:10:09.885
A job is just a bunch of tasks,

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:11.671
so they're going to redefine our jobs

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:13.954
because they're going to do
some of those tasks.

00:10:13.978 --> 00:10:17.175
But they're also going to create
whole new categories,

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:19.446
a whole new slew of tasks

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.927
that we didn't know
we wanted to do before.

00:10:21.951 --> 00:10:25.588
They're going to actually
engender new kinds of jobs,

00:10:25.612 --> 00:10:27.883
new kinds of tasks that we want done,

00:10:27.907 --> 00:10:31.312
just as automation made up
a whole bunch of new things
