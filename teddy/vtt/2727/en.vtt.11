00:05:26.602 --> 00:05:33.144
So your calculator is smarter
than you are in arithmetic already;

00:05:33.168 --> 00:05:36.865
your GPS is smarter
than you are in spatial navigation;

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:41.595
Google, Bing, are smarter
than you are in long-term memory.

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:46.869
And we're going to take, again,
these kinds of different types of thinking

00:05:46.893 --> 00:05:48.826
and we'll put them into, like, a car.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.907
The reason why we want to put them
in a car so the car drives,

00:05:51.931 --> 00:05:54.233
is because it's not driving like a human.

00:05:54.257 --> 00:05:55.653
It's not thinking like us.

00:05:55.677 --> 00:05:57.597
That's the whole feature of it.

00:05:57.621 --> 00:05:59.156
It's not being distracted,

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.934
it's not worrying about whether
it left the stove on,
