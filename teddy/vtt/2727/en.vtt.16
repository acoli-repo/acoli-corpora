00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.692
250 horsepower --

00:08:00.716 --> 00:08:05.408
which we can use to build skyscrapers,
to build cities, to build roads,

00:08:05.432 --> 00:08:11.221
to make factories that would churn out
lines of chairs or refrigerators

00:08:11.245 --> 00:08:12.899
way beyond our own power.

00:08:12.923 --> 00:08:19.034
And that artificial power can also
be distributed on wires on a grid

00:08:19.058 --> 00:08:22.257
to every home, factory, farmstead,

00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:26.472
and anybody could buy
that artificial power,

00:08:26.496 --> 00:08:27.968
just by plugging something in.

00:08:27.992 --> 00:08:30.431
So this was a source
of innovation as well,
