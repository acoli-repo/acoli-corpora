00:12:28.336 --> 00:12:30.975
We're working with these
rather than against them.

00:12:30.999 --> 00:12:32.476
So, the future:

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.920
Where does that take us?

00:12:33.944 --> 00:12:37.511
I think that 25 years from now,
they'll look back

00:12:37.535 --> 00:12:40.660
and look at our understanding
of AI and say,

00:12:40.684 --> 00:12:43.984
"You didn't have AI. In fact,
you didn't even have the Internet yet,

00:12:44.008 --> 00:12:46.749
compared to what we're going
to have 25 years from now."

00:12:47.849 --> 00:12:50.896
There are no AI experts right now.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.619
There's a lot of money going to it,

00:12:52.643 --> 00:12:54.911
there are billions of dollars
being spent on it;

00:12:54.935 --> 00:12:57.099
it's a huge business,

00:12:57.123 --> 00:13:01.395
but there are no experts, compared
to what we'll know 20 years from now.
