00:08:27.992 --> 00:08:30.431
So this was a source
of innovation as well,

00:08:30.455 --> 00:08:33.873
because a farmer could take
a manual hand pump,

00:08:33.897 --> 00:08:36.813
and they could add this artificial
power, this electricity,

00:08:36.837 --> 00:08:38.334
and he'd have an electric pump.

00:08:38.358 --> 00:08:41.676
And you multiply that by thousands
or tens of thousands of times,

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.859
and that formula was what brought us
the Industrial Revolution.

00:08:44.883 --> 00:08:48.468
All the things that we see,
all this progress that we now enjoy,

00:08:48.492 --> 00:08:50.555
has come from the fact
that we've done that.

00:08:50.579 --> 00:08:52.927
We're going to do
the same thing now with AI.

00:08:52.951 --> 00:08:55.026
We're going to distribute that on a grid,

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.424
and now you can take that electric pump.

00:08:57.448 --> 00:09:00.416
You can add some artificial intelligence,
