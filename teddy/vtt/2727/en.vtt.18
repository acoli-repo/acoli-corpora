00:08:57.448 --> 00:09:00.416
You can add some artificial intelligence,

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.921
and now you have a smart pump.

00:09:01.945 --> 00:09:03.873
And that, multiplied by a million times,

00:09:03.897 --> 00:09:06.260
is going to be this second
Industrial Revolution.

00:09:06.284 --> 00:09:08.666
So now the car is going down the highway,

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.984
it's 250 horsepower,
but in addition, it's 250 minds.

00:09:13.008 --> 00:09:14.777
That's the auto-driven car.

00:09:14.801 --> 00:09:16.190
It's like a new commodity;

00:09:16.214 --> 00:09:17.517
it's a new utility.

00:09:17.541 --> 00:09:20.582
The AI is going to flow
across the grid -- the cloud --

00:09:20.606 --> 00:09:22.173
in the same way electricity did.

00:09:22.197 --> 00:09:24.577
So everything that we had electrified,

00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:26.324
we're now going to cognify.

00:09:26.693 --> 00:09:28.078
And I would suggest, then,

00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:31.834
that the formula
for the next 10,000 start-ups
