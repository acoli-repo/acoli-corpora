00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.990
chemistry of wires
and switches and electrons,

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:37.261
and they will make reoccurring
patterns again and again.

00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:42.619
And so those patterns produce
these tendencies, these leanings.

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:45.474
You can almost think of it
as sort of like gravity.

00:00:45.498 --> 00:00:47.817
Imagine raindrops falling into a valley.

00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:50.929
The actual path of a raindrop
as it goes down the valley

00:00:50.953 --> 00:00:52.122
is unpredictable.

00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:54.169
We cannot see where it's going,

00:00:54.193 --> 00:00:56.470
but the general direction
is very inevitable:

00:00:56.494 --> 00:00:57.728
it's downward.

00:00:58.377 --> 00:01:02.949
And so these baked-in
tendencies and urgencies
