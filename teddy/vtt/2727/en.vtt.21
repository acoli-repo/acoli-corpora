00:10:27.907 --> 00:10:31.312
just as automation made up
a whole bunch of new things

00:10:31.336 --> 00:10:33.170
that we didn't know we needed before,

00:10:33.194 --> 00:10:35.150
and now we can't live without them.

00:10:35.174 --> 00:10:39.130
So they're going to produce
even more jobs than they take away,

00:10:39.154 --> 00:10:42.588
but it's important that a lot of the tasks
that we're going to give them

00:10:42.612 --> 00:10:47.184
are tasks that can be defined
in terms of efficiency or productivity.

00:10:47.676 --> 00:10:49.504
If you can specify a task,

00:10:49.528 --> 00:10:51.763
either manual or conceptual,

00:10:51.787 --> 00:10:56.567
that can be specified in terms
of efficiency or productivity,

00:10:56.591 --> 00:10:58.368
that goes to the bots.

00:10:58.758 --> 00:11:00.936
Productivity is for robots.
