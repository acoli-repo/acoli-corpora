00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.976
where it's used to diagnose X-rays
better than a human doctor.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.726
It's in legal offices,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.118
where it's used to go
through legal evidence

00:02:05.142 --> 00:02:06.997
better than a human paralawyer.

00:02:07.506 --> 00:02:11.162
It's used to fly the plane
that you came here with.

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.546
Human pilots only flew it
seven to eight minutes,

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.523
the rest of the time the AI was driving.

00:02:16.547 --> 00:02:18.720
And of course, in Netflix and Amazon,

00:02:18.744 --> 00:02:21.274
it's in the background,
making those recommendations.

00:02:21.298 --> 00:02:22.559
That's what we have today.

00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:27.384
And we have an example, of course,
in a more front-facing aspect of it,

00:02:27.408 --> 00:02:34.037
with the win of the AlphaGo, who beat
the world's greatest Go champion.
