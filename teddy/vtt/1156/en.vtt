00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So it was about four years ago, five years ago,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia, I think it was,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
with a bag similar to this.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I was saying, you don't know this molecule really well,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but your body knows it extremely well.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And I was thinking that your body hated it, at the time,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because we are very immune to this. This is called alpha-gal epitope.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily.
