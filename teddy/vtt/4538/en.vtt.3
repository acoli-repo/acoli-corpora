00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.520
showering them with towels and toasters
and drinking their free booze

00:01:32.544 --> 00:01:35.905
and throwing birdseed at them
every single time ...

00:01:36.718 --> 00:01:40.404
even though we know, statistically,

00:01:40.428 --> 00:01:43.523
half of them will be divorced
within a decade.

00:01:43.547 --> 00:01:45.198
(Laughter)

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:48.809
Of course, the other half won't, right?

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:51.808
They'll keep forgetting anniversaries

00:01:51.832 --> 00:01:54.320
and arguing about where to spend holidays

00:01:54.344 --> 00:01:55.507
and debating --

00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:56.599
(Laughter)

00:01:56.623 --> 00:02:00.053
Which way the toilet paper
should come off of the roll.
