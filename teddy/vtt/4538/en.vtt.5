00:02:29.727 --> 00:02:32.471
respect, excitement,

00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:34.666
a broken Internet connection,

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.786
mind-numbing monogamy --

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.303
and the thing still can go
to hell in a handbasket.

00:02:41.723 --> 00:02:44.257
So, what's going on when it doesn't?

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.230
What do the folks who make it all the way
to side-by-side burial plots

00:02:49.254 --> 00:02:50.817
have in common?

00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:52.551
What are they doing right?

00:02:52.575 --> 00:02:54.801
What can we learn from them?

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:59.258
And if you're still happily sleeping solo,

00:02:59.282 --> 00:03:03.694
why should you stop what you're doing
and make it your life's work
