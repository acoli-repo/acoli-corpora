00:09:27.982 --> 00:09:30.385
of the approximately ideal size
and attractiveness,

00:09:30.409 --> 00:09:31.687
who prefers horror movies

00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:34.876
and doesn't have a lot of friends
hovering on the brink of divorce,

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.976
but I can only encourage you to try,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.844
because the benefits, as I've pointed out,

00:09:39.868 --> 00:09:41.018
are significant.

00:09:41.928 --> 00:09:45.174
The bottom line is: whether you're in it
or you're searching for it,

00:09:45.198 --> 00:09:49.607
I believe marriage is an institution
worth pursuing and protecting.

00:09:50.448 --> 00:09:53.133
So I hope you'll use the information
I've given you today

00:09:53.157 --> 00:09:56.185
to weigh your personal strengths
against your own risk factors.

00:09:56.695 --> 00:10:00.384
For instance, in my marriage,
I'd say I'm doing OK.
