00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:31.675
And it turns out, the success stories
share a few similarities,

00:03:31.802 --> 00:03:34.381
beyond that they don't have sex
with other people.

00:03:34.928 --> 00:03:37.953
For instance, in the happiest marriages,

00:03:37.977 --> 00:03:39.815
the wife is thinner and better-looking

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:41.005
than the husband.

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:42.119
(Laughter)

00:03:42.143 --> 00:03:44.360
Obvious. Right?

00:03:44.384 --> 00:03:46.896
It's obvious that this leads
to marital bliss,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.573
because women -- we care a great deal
about being thin and good-looking,

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:52.976
whereas men mostly care about sex,

00:03:54.122 --> 00:03:57.634
ideally, with women who are thinner
and better looking than they are.

00:03:58.241 --> 00:03:59.988
The beauty of this research, though,
