is that no one is suggesting
that women have to be thin to be happy.

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:06.699
We just have to be thinner
than our partners.

00:04:06.723 --> 00:04:11.223
So instead of all that laborious
dieting and exercising,

00:04:11.247 --> 00:04:13.454
we just need to wait
for them to get fat --

00:04:13.478 --> 00:04:14.750
(Laughter)

00:04:14.774 --> 00:04:16.648
Maybe bake a few pies.

00:04:16.672 --> 00:04:20.025
This is good information to have,
and it's not that complicated.

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.075
(Laughter)

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.211
Research also suggests

00:04:23.235 --> 00:04:28.426
that the happiest couples are the ones
that focus on the positives.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.014
For example: the happy wife.
