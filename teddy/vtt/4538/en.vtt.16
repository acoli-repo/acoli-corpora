That's right, when you have
a close couple friend split up,

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:06.011
it increases your chances
of getting a divorce by 75 percent.

00:08:07.023 --> 00:08:09.731
Now, I have to say,
I don't get this one at all.

00:08:10.213 --> 00:08:14.873
My husband and I have watched
quite a few friends divide their assets

00:08:14.897 --> 00:08:19.511
and then struggle
with being our age and single

00:08:19.535 --> 00:08:23.847
in an age of sexting
and Viagra and eHarmony.

00:08:24.362 --> 00:08:26.760
And I'm thinking they've done
more for my marriage

00:08:26.784 --> 00:08:28.934
than a lifetime of therapy ever could.

00:08:29.794 --> 00:08:34.487
So now you may be wondering:
Why does anyone get married ever?
