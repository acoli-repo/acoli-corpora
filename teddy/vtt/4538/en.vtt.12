Now, I don't know how old all of you are,
but when I was a kid,

00:06:02.311 --> 00:06:05.025
your parents took pictures
with a special kind of camera

00:06:05.049 --> 00:06:06.902
that held something called "film."

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.351
And, by God, film was expensive.

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:16.284
They didn't take 300 shots of you
in that rapid-fire digital video mode

00:06:16.308 --> 00:06:20.040
and then pick out the nicest,
smiliest one for the Christmas card.

00:06:20.927 --> 00:06:22.121
Oh, no.

00:06:23.134 --> 00:06:25.009
They dressed you up, they lined you up,

00:06:25.033 --> 00:06:27.830
and you smiled for the fucking camera
like they told you to

00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:30.039
or you could kiss
your birthday party goodbye.
