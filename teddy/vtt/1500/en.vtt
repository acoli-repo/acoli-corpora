People love their automobiles.

00:00:01.912 --> 00:00:04.976
They allow us to go
where we want to when we want to.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.615
They're a form of entertainment,

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.640
they're a form of art,

00:00:08.664 --> 00:00:10.346
a pride of ownership.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.039
Songs are written about cars.

00:00:12.063 --> 00:00:14.398
Prince wrote a great song:
"Little Red Corvette."

00:00:14.422 --> 00:00:17.872
He didn't write "Little Red Laptop

00:00:17.896 --> 00:00:19.090
He wrote about a car.

00:00:19.114 --> 00:00:20.976
One of my favorites has always been:

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.975
"Make Love to Your Man in a Chevy Van,"

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:26.355
because that was my vehicle
when I was in college.

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:29.788
The fact is, when we do
our market research around the world,

00:00:29.812 --> 00:00:33.805
we see there's a nearly universal
aspiration on the part of people
