00:00:00.996 --> 00:00:03.746
There I was, an American woman,

00:00:03.787 --> 00:00:09.121
up to my knees in muck,
wielding these strange metal boxes.

00:00:09.163 --> 00:00:10.496
I was in rural Bangladesh,

00:00:10.538 --> 00:00:12.538
deploying sensors that we'd built

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.204
in order to understand why
the ground water was making people sick.

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:19.663
And I attracted some attention.

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:25.663
But my tech simply measured the problem.

00:00:25.704 --> 00:00:28.996
The local communities
that I'd really come to connect with

00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:31.079
were expecting a solution.
