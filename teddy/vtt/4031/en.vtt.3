00:01:30.816 --> 00:01:33.459
And there, at the city school,

00:01:33.483 --> 00:01:37.514
I would experience
what it was to be unequal.

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.777
You see, in the village,

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:42.070
we were all equal.

00:01:43.094 --> 00:01:46.261
But in the eyes and the minds
of the other kids,

00:01:46.285 --> 00:01:48.220
I was not their equal.

00:01:49.165 --> 00:01:51.498
I couldn't speak English,

00:01:51.522 --> 00:01:55.831
and I was way behind
in terms of reading and writing.

00:01:57.197 --> 00:02:01.752
But this feeling of inequality
would get even more complex.
