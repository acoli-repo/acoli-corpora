00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:30.386
We were hungry.

00:00:31.586 --> 00:00:35.077
And that's when the girl
in the blue uniform

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:38.657
came to my village with the United Nations

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:40.459
to feed the children.

00:00:41.784 --> 00:00:44.363
As she handed me my porridge,

00:00:44.387 --> 00:00:47.648
I asked her why she was there,

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:51.362
and without hesitation, she said,

00:00:51.386 --> 00:00:58.044
"As Africans, we must uplift
all the people of Africa."

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:02.737
I had absolutely no idea what she meant.
