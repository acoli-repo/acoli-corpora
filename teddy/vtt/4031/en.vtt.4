But this feeling of inequality
would get even more complex.

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:04.761
Every school holiday

00:02:04.785 --> 00:02:07.920
spent back in the village
with my grandmother

00:02:07.944 --> 00:02:10.412
made me consciously aware

00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:13.975
of the inequalities
this incredible opportunity

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.641
had created within my own family.

00:02:18.086 --> 00:02:22.324
Suddenly, I had much more
than the rest of my village.

00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:27.546
And in their eyes,
I was no longer their equal.

00:02:29.213 --> 00:02:30.443
I felt guilty.
