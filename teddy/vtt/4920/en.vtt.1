00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:31.091
by tricking the male with 
her promise of partnership,

00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:32.601
she lures him in–

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:35.061
and turns him into an easy meal.

00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:37.281
He’s been deceived.

00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:42.286
Behavioral biologists have identified 
three defining hallmarks of deception

00:00:42.286 --> 00:00:44.506
by non-human animals:

00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:46.576
it must mislead the receiver,

00:00:46.576 --> 00:00:48.546
the deceiver must benefit,

00:00:48.546 --> 00:00:51.286
and it can’t simply be an accident.

00:00:51.286 --> 00:00:55.810
In this case we know that the predatory 
firefly’s signal isn’t an accident

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.990
because she flexibly 
adjusts her flash pattern

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.080
to match males of different species.
