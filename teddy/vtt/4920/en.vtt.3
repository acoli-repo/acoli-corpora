00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:31.945
resembling those of the venomous 
eastern coral snake

00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:36.475
to benefit from the protective warnings 
these markings convey.

00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:38.483
Even some plants use mimicry:

00:01:38.483 --> 00:01:44.353
there are orchids that look and smell like
female wasps to attract hapless males,

00:01:44.353 --> 00:01:47.233
who end up pollinating the plant.

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:50.723
Some of these animals benefit 
by having fixed characteristics

00:01:50.723 --> 00:01:54.163
that are evolutionary suited 
to their environments.

00:01:54.163 --> 00:01:55.473
But in other cases,

00:01:55.473 --> 00:01:59.553
the deceiver seems to anticipate 
the reactions of other animals

00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:02.443
and to adjust its behavior accordingly.
