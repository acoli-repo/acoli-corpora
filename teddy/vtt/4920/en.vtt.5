00:02:28.062 --> 00:02:32.612
surveying the landscape for predators 
and calling when it senses a threat.

00:02:32.612 --> 00:02:37.622
That sends meerkats, pied babblers, 
and others dashing for cover.

00:02:37.622 --> 00:02:40.432
But the drongo will also sound 
a false alarm

00:02:40.432 --> 00:02:43.452
when those other species 
have captured prey.

00:02:43.452 --> 00:02:45.932
As the meerkats and babblers flee,

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:49.612
the drongo swoops down 
to steal their catches.

00:02:49.612 --> 00:02:52.022
This tactic works about half the time–

00:02:52.022 --> 00:02:55.602
and it provides drongos 
with much of their food.

00:02:55.602 --> 00:02:56.962
There are fewer solid cases

00:02:56.962 --> 00:03:01.056
of animals using signals to trick members 
of their own species,
