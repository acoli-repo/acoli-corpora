Sensing a threat,

00:02:03.543 --> 00:02:08.103
the octopus will rapidly change its colors
to match its surroundings.

00:02:08.103 --> 00:02:11.812
Dwarf chameleons color-match their 
environments more closely

00:02:11.812 --> 00:02:14.952
when they see a bird predator 
rather than a snake–

00:02:14.952 --> 00:02:18.392
birds, after all,

00:02:28.062 --> 00:02:32.612
surveying the landscape for predators 
and calling when it senses a threat.
