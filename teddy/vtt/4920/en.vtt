emitting a series of enticing flashes.

00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:17.511
He hopes a nearby female will respond
with her own lightshow

00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:18.741
and mate with him.

00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:20.401
Sadly for this male,

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:23.501
it won’t turn out quite the way he plans.

00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:28.071
A female from a different species

00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:31.091
