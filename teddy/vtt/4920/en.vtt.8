It would seem that instead of just 
threatening reflexively,

00:04:00.302 --> 00:04:05.192
the mantis shrimp is swiftly gauging the 
situation and predicting others’ behavior,

00:04:05.192 --> 00:04:07.272
to get the best result.

00:04:07.282 --> 00:04:09.372
So we know that animals can deceive,

00:04:09.372 --> 00:04:11.372
but do they do so with intent?

00:04:11.372 --> 00:04:12.982
That’s a difficult question,

00:04:12.982 --> 00:04:16.332
and many scientists think 
we'll never be able to answer it.

00:04:16.332 --> 00:04:19.112
We can't observe animals’ 
internal thoughts.

00:04:19.112 --> 00:04:24.042
But we don’t need to know what an animal 
is thinking in order to detect deception.

00:04:24.042 --> 00:04:26.472
By watching behavior and its outcomes,

00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:30.645
we learn that animals manipulate 
predators, prey, and rivals,
