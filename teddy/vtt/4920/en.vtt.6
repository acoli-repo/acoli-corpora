00:02:56.962 --> 00:03:01.056
of animals using signals to trick members 
of their own species,

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.896
but that happens too.

00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:04.945
Consider the mantis shrimp.

00:03:04.945 --> 00:03:06.347
Like other crustaceans,

00:03:06.347 --> 00:03:08.107
it molts as it grows,

00:03:08.107 --> 00:03:11.547
which leaves its soft body 
vulnerable to attack.

00:03:11.547 --> 00:03:15.447
But it’s still driven to protect 
its home against rivals.

00:03:15.447 --> 00:03:18.627
So it has become a masterful bluffer.

00:03:18.627 --> 00:03:20.207
Despite being fragile,

00:03:20.207 --> 00:03:24.997
a newly molted shrimp is actually 
more likely to threaten intruders,

00:03:24.997 --> 00:03:30.508
spreading the large limbs it usually uses 
to strike or stab its opponents.
