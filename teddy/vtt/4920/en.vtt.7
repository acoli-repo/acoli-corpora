spreading the large limbs it usually uses 
to strike or stab its opponents.

00:03:30.508 --> 00:03:31.721
And that works –

00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:36.461
bluffers are more likely to keep 
their homes than non-bluffers.

00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:37.976
In its softened condition,

00:03:37.976 --> 00:03:40.496
a mantis shrimp couldn’t 
withstand a fight–

00:03:40.496 --> 00:03:42.336
which is why we can be confident

00:03:42.336 --> 00:03:44.506
that its behavior is a bluff.

00:03:44.506 --> 00:03:48.472
Biologists have even noticed 
that its bluffs are tactical:

00:03:48.472 --> 00:03:53.502
newly molted mantis shrimp are more likely
to bluff against smaller rivals,

00:03:53.502 --> 00:03:57.032
who are especially likely 
to be driven away.

00:03:57.032 --> 00:04:00.302
It would seem that instead of just 
threatening reflexively,
