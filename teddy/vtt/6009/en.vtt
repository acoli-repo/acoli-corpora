00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.136
In July of 1911,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.416
a 35-year-old Yale graduate and professor
set out from his rainforest camp

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.056
with his team.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.216
After climbing a steep hill

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.656
and wiping the sweat from his brow,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.976
he described what he saw beneath him.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.176
He saw rising from
the dense rainforest foliage

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.776
this incredible interlocking
maze of structures

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.096
built of granite,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.336
beautifully put together.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.976
What's amazing about this project
