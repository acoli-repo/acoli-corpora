00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I love a challenge, and saving the Earth is probably a good one.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We all know the Earth is in trouble.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We have now entered in the 6X,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the sixth major extinction on this planet.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I often wondered, if there was a United Organization of Organisms --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
otherwise known as "Uh-Oh" --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
(Laughter) -- and every organism had a right to vote,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
would we be voted on the planet, or off the planet?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I think that vote is occurring right now.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I want to present to you a suite of six mycological solutions,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
using fungi, and these solutions are based on mycelium.
