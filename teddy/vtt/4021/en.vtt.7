This is a work I made in 2014.

00:03:34.872 --> 00:03:37.971
It's called "Different Kinds
of Air: A Plant's Diary,"

00:03:37.995 --> 00:03:41.903
where I was recreating the air
from different eras in Earth's evolution,

00:03:41.927 --> 00:03:44.927
and inviting the audience
to come in and breathe them with me.

00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:48.565
And it's really surprising,
so drastically different.

00:03:49.845 --> 00:03:51.931
Now, I'm not a scientist,

00:03:51.955 --> 00:03:54.931
but atmospheric scientists
will look for traces

00:03:54.955 --> 00:03:57.713
in the air chemistry in geology,

00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.054
a bit like how rocks can oxidize,
