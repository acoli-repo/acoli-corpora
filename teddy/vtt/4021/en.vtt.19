00:09:27.738 --> 00:09:33.178
Like air, climate change is simultaneously
at the scale of the molecule,

00:09:33.202 --> 00:09:35.607
the breath and the planet.

00:09:37.139 --> 00:09:40.618
It's immediate, vital and intimate,

00:09:40.642 --> 00:09:44.995
as well as being amorphous and cumbersome.

00:09:46.451 --> 00:09:49.740
And yet, it's so easily forgotten.

00:09:51.738 --> 00:09:55.624
Climate change is the collective
self-portrait of humanity.

00:09:55.648 --> 00:09:58.211
It reflects our decisions as individuals,

00:09:58.235 --> 00:10:00.459
as governments and as industries.
