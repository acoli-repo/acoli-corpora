00:05:59.397 --> 00:06:00.990
that a lot of scientists agree

00:06:01.014 --> 00:06:04.151
comes from a simultaneous
eruption of volcanoes

00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:06.105
and a runaway greenhouse effect.

00:06:08.982 --> 00:06:12.585
Oxygen levels at this time go
to below half of what they are today,

00:06:12.609 --> 00:06:13.904
so about 10 percent.

00:06:13.928 --> 00:06:16.809
So this air would definitely not
support human life,

00:06:16.833 --> 00:06:18.855
but it's OK to just have a breath.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:21.915
And to breathe, it's oddly comforting.

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:24.862
It's really calming, it's quite warm

00:06:24.886 --> 00:06:29.034
and it has a flavor a little bit
like soda water.

00:06:29.058 --> 00:06:31.563
It has that kind of spritz,
quite pleasant.
