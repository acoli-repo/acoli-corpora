00:05:29.317 --> 00:05:32.941
that's about 252.5 million years ago,

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:35.007
just before the dinosaurs evolve.

00:05:35.031 --> 00:05:38.763
It's a really short time period,
geologically speaking,

00:05:38.787 --> 00:05:41.746
from about 20- to 200,000 years.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.064
Really quick.

00:05:44.175 --> 00:05:46.867
This is the greatest extinction event
in Earth's history,

00:05:46.891 --> 00:05:49.455
even bigger than when
the dinosaurs died out.

00:05:50.215 --> 00:05:54.172
Eighty-five to 95 percent of species
at this time die out,

00:05:54.196 --> 00:05:59.373
and simultaneous to that is a huge,
dramatic spike in carbon dioxide,

00:05:59.397 --> 00:06:00.990
that a lot of scientists agree
