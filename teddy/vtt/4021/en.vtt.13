00:06:29.058 --> 00:06:31.563
It has that kind of spritz,
quite pleasant.

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:35.353
So with all this thinking
about air of the past,

00:06:35.377 --> 00:06:39.008
it's quite natural to start thinking
about the air of the future.

00:06:40.142 --> 00:06:42.936
And instead of being speculative with air

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.474
and just making up what I think
might be the future air,

00:06:46.498 --> 00:06:49.907
I discovered this human-synthesized air.

00:06:50.737 --> 00:06:53.718
That means that it doesn't occur
anywhere in nature,

00:06:53.742 --> 00:06:56.859
but it's made by humans in a laboratory

00:06:56.883 --> 00:07:00.232
for application in different
industrial settings.
