00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:30.770
like Carboniferous air.

00:04:31.579 --> 00:04:34.979
It's from about 300 to 350
million years ago.

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.514
It's an era known
as the time of the giants.

00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:41.785
So for the first time
in the history of life,

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:43.208
lignin evolves.

00:04:43.232 --> 00:04:45.556
That's the hard stuff
that trees are made of.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.110
So trees effectively invent
their own trunks at this time,

00:04:49.134 --> 00:04:51.180
and they get really big,
bigger and bigger,

00:04:51.204 --> 00:04:52.559
and pepper the Earth,

00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:55.876
releasing oxygen, releasing
oxygen, releasing oxygen,

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.514
such that the oxygen levels
are about twice as high

00:04:59.538 --> 00:05:00.935
as what they are today.
