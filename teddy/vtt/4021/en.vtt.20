as governments and as industries.

00:10:01.586 --> 00:10:04.828
And if there's anything
I've learned from looking at air,

00:10:04.852 --> 00:10:08.111
it's that even though
it's changing, it persists.

00:10:08.785 --> 00:10:12.375
It may not support the kind of life
that we'd recognize,

00:10:12.399 --> 00:10:14.496
but it will support something.

00:10:15.127 --> 00:10:18.613
And if we humans are such a vital
part of that change,

00:10:18.637 --> 00:10:22.376
I think it's important
that we can feel the discussion.

00:10:23.212 --> 00:10:26.519
Because even though it's invisible,

00:10:27.285 --> 00:10:31.977
humans are leaving
a very vibrant trace in the air.
