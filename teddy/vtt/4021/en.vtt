If I asked you to picture the air,

00:00:05.104 --> 00:00:06.451
what do you imagine?

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:12.398
Most people think about either empty space

00:00:12.422 --> 00:00:14.480
or clear blue sky

00:00:14.504 --> 00:00:17.063
or sometimes trees dancing in the wind.

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.530
And then I remember my high school
chemistry teacher with really long socks

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:22.741
at the blackboard,

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:26.169
drawing diagrams of bubbles
connected to other bubbles,

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:30.813
and describing how they vibrate
and collide in a kind of frantic soup.
