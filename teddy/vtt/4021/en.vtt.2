Our air is immediate, vital and intimate.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.745
And yet, it's so easily forgotten.

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.563
So what is the air?

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:13.843
It's the combination of the invisible
gases that envelop the Earth,

00:01:13.867 --> 00:01:16.393
attracted by the Earth's
gravitational pull.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.696
And even though I'm a visual artist,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.006
I'm interested in
the invisibility of the air.

00:01:24.627 --> 00:01:27.202
I'm interested in how we imagine it,

00:01:27.226 --> 00:01:29.274
how we experience it

00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:33.112
and how we all have an innate
understanding of its materiality
