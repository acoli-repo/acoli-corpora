00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:00.054
a bit like how rocks can oxidize,

00:04:00.078 --> 00:04:03.427
and they'll extrapolate
that information and aggregate it,

00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:06.600
such that they can
pretty much form a recipe

00:04:06.624 --> 00:04:08.304
for the air at different times.

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.344
Then I come in as the artist
and take that recipe

00:04:11.368 --> 00:04:14.484
and recreate it using the component gases.

00:04:16.016 --> 00:04:19.746
I was particularly interested
in moments of time

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.812
that are examples
of life changing the air,

00:04:23.836 --> 00:04:27.332
but also the air that can influence
how life will evolve,

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:30.770
like Carboniferous air.
