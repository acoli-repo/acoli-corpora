but it's also the most potent
greenhouse gas

00:08:00.303 --> 00:08:02.049
that has ever been tested.

00:08:03.042 --> 00:08:08.777
Its warming potential is 24,000 times
that of carbon dioxide,

00:08:08.801 --> 00:08:12.346
and it has that longevity
of 12 to 16 generations.

00:08:13.235 --> 00:08:18.097
So this ethical confrontation
is really central to my work.
