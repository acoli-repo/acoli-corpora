00:02:29.822 --> 00:02:34.084
Now, that's equivalent to about 18
Olympic-sized swimming pools.

00:02:36.203 --> 00:02:38.410
For me, air is plural.

00:02:38.434 --> 00:02:41.507
It's simultaneously
as small as our breathing

00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:43.451
and as big as the planet.

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.024
And it's kind of hard to picture.

00:02:48.587 --> 00:02:51.509
Maybe it's impossible,
and maybe it doesn't matter.

00:02:51.984 --> 00:02:54.593
Through my visual arts practice,

00:02:54.617 --> 00:02:58.310
I try to make air, not so much picture it,

00:02:58.334 --> 00:03:02.455
but to make it visceral
and tactile and haptic.
