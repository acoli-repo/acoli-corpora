00:01:58.782 --> 00:02:01.452
That air that you just exhaled,

00:02:01.476 --> 00:02:05.160
you enriched a hundred times
in carbon dioxide.

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:12.495
So roughly five liters of air per breath,
17 breaths per minute

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:18.096
of the 525,600 minutes per year,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.580
comes to approximately
45 million liters of air,

00:02:23.604 --> 00:02:27.598
enriched 100 times in carbon dioxide,

00:02:27.622 --> 00:02:28.928
just for you.

00:02:29.822 --> 00:02:34.084
Now, that's equivalent to about 18
Olympic-sized swimming pools.
