I'd like to tell you about a legal case that I worked on

00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:08.404
involving a man named Steve Titus.

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:11.433
Titus was a restaurant manager.

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:15.523
He was 31 years old, he lived in Seattle, Washington,

00:00:15.523 --> 00:00:17.418
he was engaged to Gretchen,

00:00:17.418 --> 00:00:20.366
about to be married, she was the love of his life.

00:00:20.366 --> 00:00:22.650
And one night, the couple went out

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.655
for a romantic restaurant meal.

00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:27.303
They were on their way home,

00:00:27.303 --> 00:00:30.253
and they were pulled over by a police officer.
