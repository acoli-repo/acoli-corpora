00:00:00.778 --> 00:00:02.674
Ever since I can remember,

00:00:02.698 --> 00:00:06.933
African elephants have filled me
with a sense of complete awe.

00:00:07.532 --> 00:00:11.069
They are the largest land mammal
alive today on planet Earth,

00:00:11.093 --> 00:00:13.252
weighing up to seven tons,

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:16.514
standing three and a half meters
tall at the shoulder.

00:00:16.538 --> 00:00:19.982
They can eat up to 400 kilos
of food in a day,

00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:24.545
and they disperse vital plant seeds
across thousands of kilometers

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.036
during their 50-to-60-year life span.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.863
Central to their compassionate
and complex society are the matriarchs.
