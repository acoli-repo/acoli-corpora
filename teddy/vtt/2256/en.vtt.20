00:09:58.505 --> 00:10:01.974
These beehive fences we're studying
using things like camera traps

00:10:01.998 --> 00:10:04.355
to help us understand
how elephants are responding

00:10:04.379 --> 00:10:05.584
to them at night time,

00:10:05.608 --> 00:10:07.870
which is when most
of the crop raiding occurs.

00:10:07.894 --> 00:10:10.218
And we found in our study farms

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:12.958
that we're keeping
up to 80 percent of elephants

00:10:12.982 --> 00:10:15.466
outside of the boundaries of these farms.

00:10:15.966 --> 00:10:20.720
And the bees and the beehive fences
are also pollinating the fields.

00:10:20.744 --> 00:10:24.410
So we're having a great reduction
both in elephant crop raids

00:10:24.434 --> 00:10:27.097
and a boost in yield
through the pollination services

00:10:27.121 --> 00:10:29.791
that the bees are giving
to the crops themselves.
