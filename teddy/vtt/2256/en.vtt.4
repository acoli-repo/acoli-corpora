00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:01.632
It really was quite a challenge to me
at that young age.

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:05.355
It was only when I moved to Kenya
at the age of 14,

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:10.101
when I got to connect to the vast,
wild open spaces of East Africa.

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:13.879
And it is here now
that I feel truly, instinctively,

00:02:13.903 --> 00:02:15.188
really at home.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:19.585
I spent many, many happy years
studying elephant behavior in a tent,

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.615
in Samburu National Reserve,

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.876
under the guideship of professor
Fritz Vollrath and Iain Douglas-Hamilton,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.535
studying for my PhD and understanding
the complexities of elephant societies.
