00:11:29.616 --> 00:11:33.060
One of the things we're trying to do
is develop a toolbox of options

00:11:33.084 --> 00:11:36.228
to live in better harmony
with these massive pachyderms.

00:11:36.252 --> 00:11:38.403
One of those issues
is to try and get farmers,

00:11:38.427 --> 00:11:39.649
and women in particular,

00:11:39.673 --> 00:11:41.863
to think different
about what they're planting

00:11:41.887 --> 00:11:43.188
inside their farms as well.

00:11:43.212 --> 00:11:44.860
So we're looking at planting crops

00:11:44.884 --> 00:11:47.764
that elephants don't particularly
want to eat, like chillies,

00:11:47.788 --> 00:11:50.061
ginger, Moringa, sunflowers.

00:11:50.085 --> 00:11:53.308
And of course, the bees and the beehive
fences love these crops too,

00:11:53.332 --> 00:11:55.117
because they have beautiful flowers.

00:11:55.141 --> 00:11:57.831
One of these plants
is a spiky plant called sisal --

00:11:57.855 --> 00:11:59.728
you may know this here as jute.
