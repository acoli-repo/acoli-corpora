00:05:27.463 --> 00:05:31.124
really divisive migratory-blocking fences,

00:05:31.148 --> 00:05:33.757
there must be other ways
to look at this challenge.

00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:36.616
I'm much more interested in holistic
and natural methods

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.520
to keep elephants and people
apart where necessary.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.823
Simply talking to people,

00:05:41.847 --> 00:05:44.109
talking to rural pastoralists
in northern Kenya

00:05:44.133 --> 00:05:46.680
who have so much knowledge about the bush,

00:05:46.704 --> 00:05:50.680
we discovered this story that they had
that elephants would not feed on trees

00:05:50.704 --> 00:05:52.570
that had wild beehives in them.

00:05:52.594 --> 00:05:54.611
Now this was an interesting story.

00:05:54.635 --> 00:05:56.643
As the elephants
were foraging on the tree,

00:05:56.667 --> 00:06:00.270
they would break branches
and perhaps break open a wild beehive.
