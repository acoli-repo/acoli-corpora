00:07:29.577 --> 00:07:31.844
to the sound of African wild bees.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.617
Here we are, playing the bee sounds
back to this amazing group of elephants.

00:07:36.641 --> 00:07:39.362
You can see the ears going up, going out,

00:07:39.386 --> 00:07:41.839
they're turning their heads
from side to side,

00:07:41.863 --> 00:07:44.601
one elephant is flicking her trunk
to try and smell.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.082
There's another elephant
that kicks one of calves on the ground

00:07:48.106 --> 00:07:50.765
to tell it to get up
as if there is a threat.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.829
And one elephant triggers a retreat,

00:07:53.853 --> 00:07:57.903
and soon the whole family of elephants
are running after her

00:07:57.927 --> 00:08:01.126
across the savannah in a cloud of dust.
