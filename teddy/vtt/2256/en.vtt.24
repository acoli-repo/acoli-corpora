00:12:00.075 --> 00:12:02.591
And this amazing plant
can be stripped down

00:12:02.615 --> 00:12:04.956
and turned into a weaving product.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.052
We're working with these amazing women now

00:12:07.076 --> 00:12:09.742
who live daily with
the challenges of elephants

00:12:09.766 --> 00:12:12.735
to use this plant to weave into baskets

00:12:12.759 --> 00:12:15.307
to provide an alternative income for them.

00:12:15.696 --> 00:12:18.180
We've just started construction
only three weeks ago

00:12:18.204 --> 00:12:20.235
on a women's enterprise center

00:12:20.259 --> 00:12:22.577
where we're going to be working
with these women

00:12:22.601 --> 00:12:24.117
not only as expert beekeepers

00:12:24.141 --> 00:12:25.799
but as amazing basket weavers;

00:12:25.823 --> 00:12:28.934
they're going to be processing
chili oils, sunflower oils,

00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.903
making lip balms and honey,
