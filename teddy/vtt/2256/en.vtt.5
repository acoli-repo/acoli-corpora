00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.535
studying for my PhD and understanding
the complexities of elephant societies.

00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:35.729
But now, in my role as head
of the human-elephant coexistence program

00:02:35.753 --> 00:02:37.078
for Save the Elephants,

00:02:37.102 --> 00:02:41.218
we're seeing so much change
happening so fast

00:02:41.242 --> 00:02:45.440
that it's urged a change
in some of our research programs.

00:02:45.464 --> 00:02:48.956
No longer can we just sit
and understand elephant societies

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.782
or study just how to stop the ivory trade,

00:02:51.806 --> 00:02:54.244
which is horrific and still ongoing.

00:02:54.268 --> 00:02:57.022
We're having to change
our resources more and more

00:02:57.046 --> 00:03:01.188
to look at this rising problem
of human-elephant conflict,
