00:04:27.276 --> 00:04:30.371
who are living
on the very edge of poverty?

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:31.796
They don't have big budgets.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.759
How do you resolve this issue?

00:04:35.157 --> 00:04:38.760
Well, one issue is, you can just start
to build electric fences,

00:04:38.784 --> 00:04:40.522
and this is happening across Africa,

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:42.156
we're seeing this more and more.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.822
But they are dividing up areas
and blocking corridors.

00:04:45.846 --> 00:04:49.251
And I'm telling you, these elephants
don't think much of it either,

00:04:49.275 --> 00:04:52.164
particularly if they're blocking
a really special water hole

00:04:52.188 --> 00:04:53.371
where they need water,

00:04:53.395 --> 00:04:56.103
or if there's a very attractive
female on the other side.

00:04:56.127 --> 00:04:58.658
It doesn't take long
to knock down one of these poles.

00:04:58.682 --> 00:05:00.738
And as soon as there's a gap in the fence,
