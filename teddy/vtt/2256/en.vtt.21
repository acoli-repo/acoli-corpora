The strength of the beehive fences
is really important --

00:10:33.282 --> 00:10:35.197
the colonies have to be very strong.

00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:38.173
So we're trying to help farmers
grow pollinator-friendly crops

00:10:38.197 --> 00:10:40.221
to boost their hives,

00:10:40.245 --> 00:10:41.872
boost the strength of their bees

00:10:41.896 --> 00:10:44.767
and, of course, produce
the most amazing honey.

00:10:44.791 --> 00:10:48.926
This honey is so valuable as an extra
livelihood income for the farmers.

00:10:49.244 --> 00:10:51.276
It's a healthy alternative to sugar,

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.014
and in our community,

00:10:53.038 --> 00:10:55.553
it's a very valuable present
to give a mother-in-law,

00:10:55.577 --> 00:10:57.465
which makes it almost priceless.

00:10:57.489 --> 00:10:59.616
(Laughter)

00:10:59.942 --> 00:11:01.607
We now bottle up this honey,
