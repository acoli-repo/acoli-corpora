00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:02.625
We use 12 beehives and 12 dummy hives

00:09:02.649 --> 00:09:05.045
to protect one acre of farmland.

00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:07.363
Now a dummy hive
is simply a piece of plywood

00:09:07.387 --> 00:09:09.625
which we cut into squares, paint yellow

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:11.307
and hang in between the hives.

00:09:11.331 --> 00:09:13.276
We're basically tricking the elephants

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.125
into thinking there are more beehives
than there really are.

00:09:16.149 --> 00:09:18.990
And of course, it literally
halves the cost of the fence.

00:09:19.014 --> 00:09:20.671
So there's a hive and a dummy hive

00:09:20.695 --> 00:09:22.442
and a beehive and now dummy hive,

00:09:22.466 --> 00:09:24.942
every 10 meters
around the outside boundary.

00:09:24.966 --> 00:09:26.601
They're held up by posts

00:09:26.625 --> 00:09:28.745
with a shade roof to protect the bees,

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:31.921
and they're interconnected
with a simple piece of plain wire,
