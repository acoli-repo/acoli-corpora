00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.442
So for my PhD,
I had this unusual challenge

00:07:02.466 --> 00:07:03.848
of trying to work out

00:07:03.872 --> 00:07:07.819
how African elephants
and African bees would interact,

00:07:07.843 --> 00:07:10.716
when the theory was
that they wouldn't interact at all.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.772
How was I going to study this?

00:07:12.796 --> 00:07:16.776
Well, what I did was I took the sound
of disturbed African honey bees,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.220
and I played it back to elephants
resting under trees

00:07:20.244 --> 00:07:21.939
through a wireless speaker system,

00:07:21.963 --> 00:07:26.442
so I could understand how they would react
as if there were wild bees in the area.

00:07:26.466 --> 00:07:29.553
And it turns out that they react
quite dramatically

00:07:29.577 --> 00:07:31.844
to the sound of African wild bees.
