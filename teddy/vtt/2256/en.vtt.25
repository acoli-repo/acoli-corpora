00:12:28.958 --> 00:12:30.903
making lip balms and honey,

00:12:30.927 --> 00:12:34.171
and we're somewhere on our way
to helping these participating farmers

00:12:34.195 --> 00:12:38.592
live with better eco-generating projects
that live and work better

00:12:38.616 --> 00:12:40.456
with living with elephants.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.203
So whether it's matriarchs

00:12:42.227 --> 00:12:45.291
or mothers or researchers like myself,

00:12:45.315 --> 00:12:47.905
I do see more women
coming to the forefront now

00:12:47.929 --> 00:12:51.974
to think differently and more boldly
about the challenges that we face.

00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:54.037
With more innovation,

00:12:54.061 --> 00:12:57.505
and perhaps with some more empathy
towards each other,

00:12:57.529 --> 00:13:00.942
I do believe we can move
from a state of conflict with elephants
