00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.561
that tolerance that people
used to have for elephants.

00:04:03.046 --> 00:04:06.847
And sadly, we're losing
these animals by the day

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:09.855
and, in some countries, by the hour --

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.260
to not only ivory poaching

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:13.895
but this rapid rise
in human-elephant conflict

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.585
as they compete for space and resources.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.156
It's a massive challenge.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.141
I mean, how do you keep
seven-ton pachyderms,

00:04:21.165 --> 00:04:23.242
that often come in groups of 10 or 12,

00:04:23.266 --> 00:04:25.720
out of these very small rural farms

00:04:25.744 --> 00:04:27.252
when you're dealing with people

00:04:27.276 --> 00:04:30.371
who are living
on the very edge of poverty?
