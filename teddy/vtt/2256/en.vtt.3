00:01:29.898 --> 00:01:33.318
And so we used to take
our old Ford Cortina Estate,

00:01:33.342 --> 00:01:35.374
and with my sister, we'd pile in the back,

00:01:35.398 --> 00:01:38.215
take our tents and go camping
in the different game reserves

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:39.501
in Southern Africa.

00:01:39.525 --> 00:01:42.977
It really was heaven for a young,
budding zoologist like myself.

00:01:43.398 --> 00:01:45.747
But I remember even at that young age

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:49.429
that I found the tall electric fences
blocking off the game parks

00:01:49.453 --> 00:01:50.712
quite divisive.

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:53.752
Sure, they were keeping elephants
out of the communities,

00:01:53.776 --> 00:01:57.204
but they also kept communities
out of their wild spaces.

00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:01.632
It really was quite a challenge to me
at that young age.
