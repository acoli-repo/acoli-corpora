00:08:28.792 --> 00:08:32.443
And it turns out they're communicating
to each other in infrasonic rumbles

00:08:32.467 --> 00:08:34.403
to warn each other of the threat of bees

00:08:34.427 --> 00:08:36.493
and to stay away from the area.

00:08:37.038 --> 00:08:38.664
So these behavioral discoveries

00:08:38.688 --> 00:08:41.188
really helped us understand
how elephants would react

00:08:41.212 --> 00:08:43.561
should they hear or see bee sounds.

00:08:43.585 --> 00:08:47.704
This led me to invent a novel design
for a beehive fence,

00:08:47.728 --> 00:08:51.204
which we are now building around small,
one-to-two-acre farms

00:08:51.228 --> 00:08:53.941
on the most vulnerable
frontline areas of Africa

00:08:53.965 --> 00:08:56.609
where humans and elephants
are competing for space.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.349
These beehive fences
are very, very simple.

00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:02.625
We use 12 beehives and 12 dummy hives
