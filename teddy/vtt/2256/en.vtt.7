00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:30.355
Too often, these migrating elephants
end up stuck inside communities,

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:31.673
looking for food and water

00:03:31.697 --> 00:03:34.252
but ending up breaking open water tanks,

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:35.433
breaking pipes

00:03:35.457 --> 00:03:38.387
and, of course, breaking
into food stores for food.

00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:40.344
It's really a huge challenge.

00:03:40.968 --> 00:03:42.491
Can you imagine the terror

00:03:42.515 --> 00:03:46.108
of an elephant literally
ripping the roof off your mud hut

00:03:46.132 --> 00:03:47.428
in the middle of the night

00:03:47.452 --> 00:03:49.516
and having to hold your children away

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.958
as the trunk reaches in,
looking for food in the pitch dark?

00:03:54.585 --> 00:03:57.315
These elephants
also trample and eat crops,

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:59.605
and this is traditionally eroding away

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.561
that tolerance that people
used to have for elephants.
