Central to their compassionate
and complex society are the matriarchs.

00:00:32.252 --> 00:00:35.601
These female, strong leaders
nurture the young

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:38.688
and navigate their way
through the challenges of the African bush

00:00:38.712 --> 00:00:40.912
to find food, water and security.

00:00:41.554 --> 00:00:43.395
Their societies are so complex,

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:45.721
we're yet to still fully tease apart

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:48.332
how they communicate,
how they verbalize to each other,

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:49.982
how their dialects work.

00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:54.077
And we don't really understand yet
how they navigate the landscape,

00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:57.050
remembering the safest places
to cross a river.

00:00:57.728 --> 00:00:59.486
I'm pretty sure that like me,

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.244
most of you in this room
have a similar positive emotional response
