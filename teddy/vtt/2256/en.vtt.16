00:07:57.927 --> 00:08:01.126
across the savannah in a cloud of dust.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.854
(Sound of bees buzzing)

00:08:08.394 --> 00:08:09.679
(Sound of bees ends)

00:08:09.703 --> 00:08:14.028
Now I've done this experiment
many, many times,

00:08:14.052 --> 00:08:16.703
and the elephants almost always flee.

00:08:16.727 --> 00:08:18.479
Not only do they run away,

00:08:18.503 --> 00:08:20.590
but they dust themselves
as they're running,

00:08:20.614 --> 00:08:22.947
as if to knock bees out of the air.

00:08:23.511 --> 00:08:26.991
And we placed infrasonic microphones
around the elephants

00:08:27.015 --> 00:08:28.768
as we did these experiments.

00:08:28.792 --> 00:08:32.443
And it turns out they're communicating
to each other in infrasonic rumbles
