00:06:28.207 --> 00:06:31.073
And it's not really one sting
that they're scared of.

00:06:31.097 --> 00:06:34.065
African bees have a phenomenal ability:

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:36.864
when they sting in one site,
they release a pheromone

00:06:36.888 --> 00:06:40.103
that triggers the rest of the bees
to come and sting the same site.

00:06:40.127 --> 00:06:42.458
So it's not one beesting
that they're scared of --

00:06:42.492 --> 00:06:44.364
it's perhaps thousands of beestings,

00:06:44.388 --> 00:06:47.493
coming to sting in the same area --
that they're afraid of.

00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:49.596
And of course, a good matriarch

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.548
would always keep her young
away from such a threat.

00:06:52.572 --> 00:06:54.509
Young calves have much thinner skins,

00:06:54.533 --> 00:06:56.572
and it's potential
that they could be stung

00:06:56.596 --> 00:06:58.463
through their thinner skins.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:02.442
So for my PhD,
I had this unusual challenge
