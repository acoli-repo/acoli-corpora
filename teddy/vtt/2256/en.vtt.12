00:05:56.667 --> 00:06:00.270
they would break branches
and perhaps break open a wild beehive.

00:06:00.294 --> 00:06:03.651
And those bees would fly out
of their natural nests

00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:05.347
and sting the elephants.

00:06:05.371 --> 00:06:06.958
Now if the elephants got stung,

00:06:06.982 --> 00:06:09.625
perhaps they would remember
that this tree was dangerous

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:11.839
and they wouldn't come back
to that same site.

00:06:11.863 --> 00:06:15.316
It seems impossible that they could be
stung through their thick skin --

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.706
elephant skin is around
two centimeters thick.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.494
But it seems that they sting them
around the watery areas,

00:06:20.518 --> 00:06:24.505
around the eyes, behind the ears,
in the mouth, up the trunk.

00:06:24.946 --> 00:06:28.183
You can imagine they would
remember that very quickly.

00:06:28.207 --> 00:06:31.073
And it's not really one sting
that they're scared of.
