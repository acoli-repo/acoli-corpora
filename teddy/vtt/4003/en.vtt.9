00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.741
We were growing as a team.

00:04:31.374 --> 00:04:33.393
It was us against Brazil in the finals.

00:04:34.406 --> 00:04:36.612
They were the best team in the tournament.

00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:39.176
They won every game by a landslide.

00:04:40.264 --> 00:04:44.803
Hardly anyone believed
we could win that game.

00:04:45.942 --> 00:04:47.689
Hardly anyone -- except for us.

00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:50.809
During pre-game meetings,

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:52.476
in the locker room,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.901
during each warm-up,

00:04:54.592 --> 00:04:56.127
it smelled of victory.

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:59.531
I swear that smell exists.
