00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:03.803
That's why from day one,
I treat them as athletes on the field,

00:12:03.827 --> 00:12:06.437
and off the field, I try
to put myself in their shoes

00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:07.888
and behave without prejudice,

00:12:07.912 --> 00:12:11.869
because treating them naturally
feels best to them.

00:12:13.326 --> 00:12:17.714
Both teams play soccer;
something once unthinkable for them.

00:12:18.303 --> 00:12:22.059
They had to adapt the rules to do so.

00:12:23.129 --> 00:12:25.653
And both teams broke the same rule --

00:12:25.677 --> 00:12:28.449
the one that said
they couldn't play soccer.

00:12:29.589 --> 00:12:33.813
When you see them play,
you see competition, not disability.
