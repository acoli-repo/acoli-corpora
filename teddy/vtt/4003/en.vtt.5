00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:31.778
I started looking for tools
to learn from them,

00:02:31.802 --> 00:02:34.370
from the teachers who worked with them.

00:02:34.394 --> 00:02:39.040
I learned I couldn't explain a play
on a chalkboard like a coach does,

00:02:39.064 --> 00:02:41.844
but I could use a plastic tray
and some bottle caps

00:02:41.868 --> 00:02:44.237
so they could follow me by way of touch.

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.932
I also learned they could run on a track

00:02:47.956 --> 00:02:49.979
if I ran with them, holding a rope.

00:02:50.656 --> 00:02:53.823
So we started looking for volunteers
to help us run with them.

00:02:54.312 --> 00:02:56.381
I was enjoying it,

00:02:57.764 --> 00:03:01.056
and finding purpose and meaning
in what we were doing.
