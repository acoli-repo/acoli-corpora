00:06:59.687 --> 00:07:02.580
That night when I went to sleep,

00:07:02.604 --> 00:07:05.925
I began to dream
about the next day's game,

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:08.628
imagining what could happen,
how we would play.

00:07:08.652 --> 00:07:11.108
And that's when I noticed
that smell of victory

00:07:11.132 --> 00:07:12.346
I mentioned a while ago.

00:07:12.806 --> 00:07:14.969
And it's because
at that moment, I thought:

00:07:14.993 --> 00:07:19.676
if the other players had the same desire
as Diego going into the game,

00:07:20.261 --> 00:07:22.261
it was impossible for us not to win.

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:25.961
The next day was going to be wonderful.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.502
We got up at 9am, the game was at 7pm,

00:07:29.526 --> 00:07:31.747
and we were already eager to play.
