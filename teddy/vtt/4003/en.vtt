00:00:02.063 --> 00:00:04.230
I opened a blind man's head.

00:00:05.363 --> 00:00:09.837
I didn't make him think or reflect --
I cracked his head open, literally.

00:00:10.564 --> 00:00:12.969
We were walking with him
holding onto my shoulder,

00:00:12.993 --> 00:00:15.833
I miscalculated how much space
there was between us,

00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:17.622
and I knocked him into a gate.

00:00:17.646 --> 00:00:18.813
(Laughter)

00:00:18.837 --> 00:00:20.806
Five stitches in his forehead.

00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:24.936
At that moment, I felt like
the worst teacher in the world.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.068
I really didn't know how to apologize.

00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:33.556
Luckily, El Pulga is one of those people
who takes things quite well.
