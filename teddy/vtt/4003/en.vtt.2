00:00:58.736 --> 00:01:00.529
But when I saw them playing soccer --

00:01:00.553 --> 00:01:01.965
that was amazing.

00:01:02.672 --> 00:01:06.547
They had a dirt field,
rusty goalposts and broken nets.

00:01:07.054 --> 00:01:10.201
The blind who attended the institute
would play their games there,

00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:12.800
just like I did at a field near my house.

00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:14.916
But they played without being able to see.

00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:19.015
The ball made a sound
so they could locate it.

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.050
They had a guide
behind the rival team's goal

00:01:22.074 --> 00:01:24.078
to know where to kick the ball.

00:01:24.102 --> 00:01:25.980
And they used eye masks.

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:28.240
There were guys
who could still see a little,

00:01:28.264 --> 00:01:31.419
and they wore eye masks
so everyone was equal.
