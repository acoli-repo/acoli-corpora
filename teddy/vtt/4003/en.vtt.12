00:05:58.076 --> 00:06:00.276
"Coach, let me take
the team to the church,

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.653
and when we return, I guarantee
that half of them will be able to see."

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:07.177
(Laughter)

00:06:08.655 --> 00:06:10.101
Some of the guys laughed,

00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:13.275
but imagine being a blind person
and someone says that to you.

00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:14.684
I didn't know what to say.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:17.352
I said nothing; it was an awkward silence.

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:19.120
I didn't want to make him feel bad,

00:06:19.144 --> 00:06:21.318
because he truly believed
this could happen.

00:06:22.032 --> 00:06:23.994
One of the players saved me,

00:06:24.694 --> 00:06:26.640
when he stood up and confidently said,

00:06:26.664 --> 00:06:28.548
"Juan," -- that was the kid's name --

00:06:28.572 --> 00:06:31.525
Gonza already told you
it's not the best time to go to church.
