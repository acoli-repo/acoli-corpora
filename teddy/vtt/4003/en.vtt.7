00:03:26.823 --> 00:03:30.325
Three hours of training,
playing soccer on that field,

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:31.960
were not going to be enough.

00:03:31.984 --> 00:03:34.119
We would have to train differently.

00:03:34.143 --> 00:03:37.882
We started to train harder,
and the results were great;

00:03:37.906 --> 00:03:39.195
they asked for more.

00:03:39.733 --> 00:03:41.855
I came to understand
that they, too, wondered

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.787
why they couldn't do high-performance.

00:03:45.151 --> 00:03:49.150
When we felt ready,
we knocked at CENARD's door.

00:03:49.174 --> 00:03:51.914
CENARD is the National Center
for High-Performance Sports

00:03:51.938 --> 00:03:53.282
here in Argentina.

00:03:53.306 --> 00:03:55.723
It was hard to get them
to hear what we had to say.

00:03:55.747 --> 00:03:58.203
But it was considerably more difficult

00:03:58.227 --> 00:04:01.993
to get the other athletes training there
to consider us their equals.
