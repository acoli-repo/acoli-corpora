We all know there are people
with disabilities; we see them daily.

00:13:06.644 --> 00:13:09.605
But by having no direct contact with them,

00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:13.179
we're not aware of the problems
they face every day,

00:13:13.203 --> 00:13:15.310
like how hard it is for them
to get on a bus,

00:13:15.334 --> 00:13:16.985
find a job,

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:18.162
take the subway

00:13:18.186 --> 00:13:19.336
or cross the street.

00:13:20.367 --> 00:13:23.538
It's true that there is an increasing
social responsibility

00:13:23.562 --> 00:13:27.408
regarding the inclusion
of people with disabilities.

00:13:28.466 --> 00:13:30.959
But I think it's still not enough.
