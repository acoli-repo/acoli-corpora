When you see them play,
you see competition, not disability.

00:12:34.568 --> 00:12:37.722
The problem starts when the game is over,

00:12:37.746 --> 00:12:39.221
and they leave the field.

00:12:39.245 --> 00:12:41.741
Then they step in to play our game,

00:12:41.765 --> 00:12:45.719
in a society whose rules
don't really take them into account

00:12:45.743 --> 00:12:46.908
or care for them.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.340
I learned from sports

00:12:49.364 --> 00:12:52.996
that disability greatly depends on
the rules of the game.

00:12:53.512 --> 00:12:57.576
I believe that if we change
some of the rules of our game,

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.882
we can make life a little easier for them.
