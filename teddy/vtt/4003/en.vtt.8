00:03:58.227 --> 00:04:01.993
to get the other athletes training there
to consider us their equals.

00:04:02.662 --> 00:04:04.598
In fact, they would let us use the field

00:04:04.622 --> 00:04:06.835
only when no other teams were using it.

00:04:07.367 --> 00:04:09.311
And we were known as "the blind ones."

00:04:09.724 --> 00:04:12.269
Not everyone knew
exactly what we were doing there.

00:04:13.622 --> 00:04:17.663
The 2006 World Championship
was a turning point in the team's history.

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.233
It was held in Buenos Aires
for the first time.

00:04:21.257 --> 00:04:24.056
It was our chance to show everyone

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.003
what we had been doing all that time.

00:04:26.947 --> 00:04:28.494
We made it to the finals.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.741
We were growing as a team.
