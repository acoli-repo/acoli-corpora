and they wore eye masks
so everyone was equal.

00:01:32.524 --> 00:01:37.176
When I was more at ease with them,
I asked for a mask myself.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.846
I put it on and tried to play.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.567
I had played soccer all my life.

00:01:42.272 --> 00:01:44.318
This is where it got even more amazing:

00:01:44.342 --> 00:01:47.162
within two seconds, I didn't know
where I was standing.

00:01:50.126 --> 00:01:53.880
I had studied physical education
because I loved high performance.

00:01:53.904 --> 00:01:56.119
I started working
at the institute by chance.

00:01:56.143 --> 00:01:58.990
My other job was with the Argentinian
National Rowing Team,

00:01:59.014 --> 00:02:00.669
and I felt that was my thing.
