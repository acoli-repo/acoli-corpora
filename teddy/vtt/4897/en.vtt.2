There are 8 points that can act 
as starting or ending points for each cut.

00:01:00.973 --> 00:01:04.193
To use the device, you’ll
have to input pairs of points

00:01:04.193 --> 00:01:07.503
that tell the laser where to begin 
and end each cut,

00:01:07.503 --> 00:01:11.273
and then the laser executes
all the cuts simultaneously.

00:01:11.273 --> 00:01:14.883
It’s okay to cut the square 
into as many pieces as you want,

00:01:14.883 --> 00:01:18.693
as long as you can group them
into 10 gram portions.

00:01:18.693 --> 00:01:21.853
But you can’t fold the square 
or alter it otherwise,

00:01:21.853 --> 00:01:25.273
and you only get one shot 
at using the laser cutter.

00:01:25.273 --> 00:01:26.763
The full moon is rising, 


00:01:26.763 --> 00:01:30.563
and in a moment someone
will transform and tear you all apart
