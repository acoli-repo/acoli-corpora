00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:30.703
Both DG and CH look promising.

00:02:30.703 --> 00:02:33.753
If we make one more cut, from A to F,

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:36.293
we may start to notice something.

00:02:36.293 --> 00:02:40.453
With these four cuts—from B to E, 
D to G, F to A,

00:02:40.453 --> 00:02:43.563
and H to C—we’ve got four triangles

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.103
and a square in the middle.

00:02:45.103 --> 00:02:48.203
But the pieces that make 
each triangle can also be

00:02:48.203 --> 00:02:51.383
rearranged to make a square
identical to the middle one.

00:02:51.383 --> 00:02:55.803
This means that we’ve split
the antidote into perfect fifths!

00:02:55.803 --> 00:02:58.003
What’s interesting about this 
sort of problem

00:02:58.003 --> 00:03:01.583
is that while it’s possible to solve 
it by starting from the geometry,
