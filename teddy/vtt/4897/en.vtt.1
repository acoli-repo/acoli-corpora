into each of their dinners.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.850
Unfortunately, your pet goat
just ate four of the squares,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.210
and you only have one left.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.110
Luckily, the remaining square is 50 grams,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.340
and the minimum effective dose 
is 10 grams.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.593
If you can precisely divide the 
square into fifths

00:00:45.593 --> 00:00:48.763
you’ll have just enough 
antidote for everyone.

00:00:48.763 --> 00:00:52.253
You’ll have to use a laser-cutting tool
to cut up the square;

00:00:52.253 --> 00:00:55.613
every other means available to you
isn’t precise enough.

00:00:55.613 --> 00:01:00.973
There are 8 points that can act 
as starting or ending points for each cut.
