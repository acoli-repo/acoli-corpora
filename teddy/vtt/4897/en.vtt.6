00:02:58.003 --> 00:03:01.583
is that while it’s possible to solve 
it by starting from the geometry,

00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:06.033
it’s actually easier to start 
experimenting and see where that gets you.

00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:10.333
That wouldn’t be as viable if the square 
had, say, 24 cut points,

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:14.823
but with just 8 there
are only so many reasonable options.

00:03:14.823 --> 00:03:17.423
You secretly dose each of the townspeople

00:03:17.423 --> 00:03:19.823
as the full moon emerges in the sky.

00:03:19.823 --> 00:03:23.223
And just as you do, 
a terrible transformation begins.

00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:26.613
Then, just as suddenly, it reverses.

00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:28.263
Your measurements were perfect, 


00:03:28.263 --> 00:03:31.903
and the people and animals of the 
town can rest a little easier.
