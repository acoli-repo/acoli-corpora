If we cut BF and DH we’d get fourths,
but we need fifths.

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:06.843
Maybe there’s a way to shave a bit off
of a quarter to get exactly one fifth.

00:02:06.843 --> 00:02:10.243
Cutting BE looks good at first, 
but that last cut

00:02:10.243 --> 00:02:12.193
takes a off a quarter of a quarter,

00:02:12.193 --> 00:02:17.143
leaving us with a portion of 3/16: 
just smaller than a fifth,

00:02:17.143 --> 00:02:19.673
and not enough to cure a werewolf.

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:22.603
What if we started with BE instead?

00:02:22.603 --> 00:02:24.433
That would also give us a quarter.

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:27.433
And is there a way to shave
just a bit more off?

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:30.703
Both DG and CH look promising.
