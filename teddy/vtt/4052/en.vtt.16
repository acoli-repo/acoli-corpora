Singapore is the eighth most
water-scarce country in the world.

00:08:02.374 --> 00:08:07.339
It depends on imported water
for almost 60 percent of its water needs.

00:08:08.423 --> 00:08:10.230
It's also a very small island.

00:08:10.933 --> 00:08:14.609
As such, it needs to make use
of as much space as possible

00:08:14.633 --> 00:08:15.987
to catch rainfall.

00:08:17.153 --> 00:08:18.720
So in 2008,

00:08:18.744 --> 00:08:20.376
they built the Marina Barrage.

00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:25.714
It's the first-ever urban water reservoir
built in the middle of the city-state.

00:08:26.593 --> 00:08:29.885
It's the largest
water catchment in the country,

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:32.068
almost one-sixth the size of Singapore.
