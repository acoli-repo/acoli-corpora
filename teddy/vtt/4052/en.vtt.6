00:02:59.782 --> 00:03:04.275
might help us all address
what is fast becoming a global crisis.

00:03:06.272 --> 00:03:08.227
I wish to share three lessons today,

00:03:10.297 --> 00:03:12.441
three lessons from water-poor countries

00:03:12.465 --> 00:03:17.160
and how they survived and even thrived
despite their water crisis.

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:19.841
Lesson one:

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:22.202
tell people how much water
they really have.

00:03:23.185 --> 00:03:24.620
In order to solve a problem,

00:03:24.644 --> 00:03:26.636
we need to acknowledge that we have one.

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:28.499
And when it comes to water,

00:03:28.523 --> 00:03:31.009
people can easily turn a blind eye,
