In March 2017,

00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:08.411
the mayor of Cape Town officially
declared Cape Town a local disaster,

00:00:08.435 --> 00:00:11.227
as it had less than four months
left of usable water.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.161
Residents were restricted to 100 liters
of water per person, per day.

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:18.846
But what does that really mean?

00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:21.613
With 100 liters of water per day,

00:00:21.637 --> 00:00:23.401
you can take a five-minute shower,

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.476
wash your face twice

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.922
and probably flush the toilet
about five times.

00:00:29.902 --> 00:00:31.546
You still didn't brush your teeth,
