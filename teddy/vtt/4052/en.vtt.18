it acts as a beautiful

00:09:00.911 --> 00:09:02.759
hosting several events,

00:09:02.783 --> 00:09:05.595
from art exhibitions to music festivals,

00:09:05.619 --> 00:09:09.765
attracting joggers, bikers, tourists
all around that area.

00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:13.848
Now, not all initiatives
need to be stunning

00:09:13.872 --> 00:09:15.022
or even visible.

00:09:15.923 --> 00:09:19.816
My first home, Jordan, realized

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.363

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.886
to focus on growing
low water-intensive crops.
