people can easily turn a blind eye,

00:03:31.033 --> 00:03:33.873
pretending that since water
is coming out of the tap now,

00:03:33.897 --> 00:03:35.479
everything will be fine forever.

00:03:36.703 --> 00:03:39.771
But some smart, drought-affected countries

00:03:39.795 --> 00:03:42.180
have adopted simple, innovative measures

00:03:42.204 --> 00:03:46.061
to make sure their citizens,
their communities and their companies

00:03:46.085 --> 00:03:48.071
know just how dry their countries are.

When I was in Cape Town earlier this year,

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.500
I saw this electronic billboard
on the freeway,

00:03:55.524 --> 00:03:57.758
indicating how much water
the city had left.

00:03:59.004 --> 00:04:01.972
This is an idea they may well have
borrowed from Australia
