00:06:58.435 --> 00:07:01.352
where companies can voluntarily
take on a challenge

00:07:01.376 --> 00:07:04.938
to reduce their water-consumption
levels to preset targets

00:07:04.962 --> 00:07:06.599
within a period of one year.

00:07:07.716 --> 00:07:12.536
Companies which completed the challenge
saved on average 35 percent of water.

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:15.223
And one company, for example,

00:07:15.247 --> 00:07:19.563
implemented as many water-saving tips
as they could in their office space.

00:07:20.178 --> 00:07:25.005
They replaced their toilet-flushing
techniques, taps, showerheads --

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:26.218
you name it.

00:07:26.242 --> 00:07:28.709
If it saved water, they replaced it,

00:07:28.733 --> 00:07:32.365
eventually reducing their employees'
water consumption by half.
