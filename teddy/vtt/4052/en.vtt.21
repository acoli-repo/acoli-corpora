00:10:29.893 --> 00:10:32.091
they can ease their water shortages,

00:10:32.672 --> 00:10:34.185

00:10:34.209 --> 00:10:39.403
provide drinking water for more
than 300,000 citizens in its capital city.

00:10:40.714 --> 00:10:44.850
As more countries which used
to be more water rich

00:10:44.874 --> 00:10:46.714
are becoming water scarce,

00:10:47.703 --> 00:10:50.384
I say we don't need to reinvent the wheel.

00:10:51.586 --> 00:10:54.839
If we just look at what
