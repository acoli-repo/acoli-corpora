00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:31.420
when my friends and I were dared
to do the Ice Bucket Challenge,

00:02:32.197 --> 00:02:33.768
we did that with sand.

00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:34.942
(Laughter)

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:37.981
And you might think that,
you know, that's easy,

00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:39.246
sand is not ice cold.

00:02:39.697 --> 00:02:42.315
I promise you, sand goes everywhere,

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:44.224
and it took ages to get rid of it.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.731
But what perhaps I didn't realize

00:02:47.755 --> 00:02:50.308
as I played with flour
balloons as a child,

00:02:50.332 --> 00:02:52.724
and as I poured sand
on my head as an adult,

00:02:53.864 --> 00:02:57.164
is that some of the techniques
that seem second nature to me

00:02:57.188 --> 00:02:59.758
and to others who live in dry countries

00:02:59.782 --> 00:03:04.275
might help us all address
what is fast becoming a global crisis.
