00:09:56.585 --> 00:10:00.984
have been drinking
recycled water since 1968.

00:10:01.334 --> 00:10:04.003
Now, you may tell me
many countries recycle water.

00:10:04.767 --> 00:10:06.096
I would say yes.

00:10:06.569 --> 00:10:08.789
But very few use it for drinking purposes,

00:10:09.738 --> 00:10:12.189
mostly because people
don't like the thought

00:10:12.213 --> 00:10:15.709
of water that was in their toilets
going to their taps.

00:10:16.295 --> 00:10:18.834
But Namibia could not afford
to think that way.

00:10:19.528 --> 00:10:22.374
They looked below the surface
to save water.

00:10:23.428 --> 00:10:25.190
They are now a great example

00:10:25.214 --> 00:10:29.869
of how, when countries purify waste water
to drinking standards,

00:10:29.893 --> 00:10:32.091
they can ease their water shortages,
