00:01:03.378 --> 00:01:05.151
But as of September 3rd,

00:01:05.175 --> 00:01:08.549
the hundred-liter limit
dropped to 87 liters.

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:13.767
The mayor defined the city's new normal
as one of permanent drought.

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.324
Second:

00:01:16.348 --> 00:01:19.858

is pretty much coming to many other cities

00:01:19.882 --> 00:01:21.238
and countries in the world.

00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:25.537
According to the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations,

00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:27.912
excluding countries
that we don't have data for,

00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:31.688
less than five percent
of the world's population
