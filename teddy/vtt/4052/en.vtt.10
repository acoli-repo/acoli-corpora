Taking me to lesson two:

00:05:02.285 --> 00:05:04.702
empower people to save water.

00:05:06.658 --> 00:05:10.135
Melbourne wanted people
to spend less water in their homes.

00:05:10.636 --> 00:05:13.623
And one way to do that is to spend
less time in the shower.

00:05:14.644 --> 00:05:18.579
However, interviews revealed
that some people, women in particular,

00:05:18.603 --> 00:05:20.619
weren't keen on saving water that way.

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:23.250
Some of them honestly said,

00:05:23.274 --> 00:05:25.117
"The shower is not just to clean up.

00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:26.775
It's my sanctuary.

00:05:27.218 --> 00:05:30.250
It's a space I go to relax,
not just clean up."
