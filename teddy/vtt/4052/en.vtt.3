00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:31.688
less than five percent
of the world's population

00:01:31.712 --> 00:01:36.327
is living in a country that has more water
today than it did 20 years ago.

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:40.878
Everyone else is living in a country
that has less water today.

00:01:41.842 --> 00:01:44.555
And nearly one out of three
are living in a country

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.596
that is facing a water crisis.

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:48.902
I grew up in Jordan,

00:01:50.138 --> 00:01:55.439
a water-poor country that has experienced
absolute water scarcity since 1973.

00:01:56.496 --> 00:01:58.363
And still, in 2017,

00:01:58.387 --> 00:02:01.442
only 10 countries in the world
have less water than Jordan.
