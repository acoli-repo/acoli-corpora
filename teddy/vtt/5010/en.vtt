To start, I want to share with you guys
something about my hometown

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:05.309
of Norwalk, Ohio.

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.476
Now, as this video stated,
I am from Norwalk,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.643
which is an extremely small town,
about 15,000 people.

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:13.309
And really, in Norwalk,
if you want to do something fun,

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:16.636
you go to Walmart or drive half an hour
to something more interesting.

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.601
And for Norwalk, I've lived there
for my entire life,

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:22.434
I'm a senior at the local
public high school,

00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:25.851
and you know, it's something
to where I really enjoy my small town.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:27.851
And I'm just a normal kid, you know,

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:30.268
I lead debate clubs,
I volunteer at my church.
