00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:01.960
And this is where over-the-counter
painkillers come in.

00:02:01.984 --> 00:02:03.576
Aspirin and ibuprofen

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.267
block production of one class
of these tuning chemicals,

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:07.976
called prostaglandins.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.967
Let's take a look at how they do that.

00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:14.022
When cells are damaged, they release
a chemical called arachidonic acid.

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:16.837
And two enzymes called COX-1 and COX-2

00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:20.596
convert this arachidonic acid
into prostaglandin H2,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.344
which is then converted
into a bunch of other chemicals

00:02:23.368 --> 00:02:24.748
that do a bunch of things,

00:02:24.772 --> 00:02:27.440
including raise your body temperature,
cause inflammation

00:02:27.464 --> 00:02:29.584
and lower the pain threshold.
