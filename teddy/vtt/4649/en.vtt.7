00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:32.976
and they go to painful areas
just the same as normal ones.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.521
So that's how aspirin and ibuprofen work.

00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:38.501
But there are other dimensions to pain.

00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:39.976
Neuropathic pain, for example,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.642
is pain caused by damage
to our nervous system itself;

00:03:43.666 --> 00:03:46.190
there doesn't need to be
any sort of outside stimulus.

00:03:46.214 --> 00:03:48.976
And scientists are discovering
that the brain controls

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.976
how we respond to pain signals.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.335
For example, how much pain
you feel can depend on

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.096
whether you're paying attention
to the pain, or even your mood.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.977
Pain is an area of active research.

00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:02.549
If we can understand it better, maybe
we can help people manage it better.
