00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.126
for the arachidonic acid to fit.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.204
This permanently deactivates
COX-1 and COX-2.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.656
Ibuprofen, on the other hand,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.972
enters the active site,

00:03:07.996 --> 00:03:10.788
but doesn't break apart
or change the enzyme.

00:03:10.812 --> 00:03:13.587
COX-1 and COX-2 are free
to spit it out again,

00:03:13.611 --> 00:03:15.976
but for the time
that that ibuprofen is in there,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.465
the enzyme can't bind arachidonic acid,
and can't do its normal chemistry.

00:03:21.241 --> 00:03:24.610
But how do aspirin and ibuprofen
know where the pain is?

00:03:24.634 --> 00:03:25.976
Well, they don't.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.976
Once the drugs are in your bloodstream,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.850
they are carried throughout your body,

00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:32.976
and they go to painful areas
just the same as normal ones.
