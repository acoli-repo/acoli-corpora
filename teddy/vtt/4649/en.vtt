Say you're at the beach,
and you get sand in your eyes.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.484
How do you know the sand is there?

00:00:18.508 --> 00:00:22.125
You obviously can't see it,
but if you are a normal, healthy human,

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:23.152
you can feel it,

00:00:23.176 --> 00:00:26.976
that sensation of extreme discomfort,
also known as pain.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.976
Now, pain makes you do something,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.976
in this case, rinse your eyes
until the sand is gone.
