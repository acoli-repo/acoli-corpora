00:02:30.147 --> 00:02:32.568
Now, all enzymes have an active site.

00:02:32.592 --> 00:02:35.404
That's the place in the enzyme
where the reaction happens.

00:02:35.428 --> 00:02:37.976
The active sites of COX-1 and COX-2

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.869
fit arachidonic acid very cozily.

00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:42.976
As you can see, there is no room to spare.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.976
Now, it's in this active site
that aspirin and ibuprofen do their work.

00:02:47.924 --> 00:02:49.257
So, they work differently.

00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:51.905
Aspirin acts like a spine
from a porcupine.

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:54.072
It enters the active site
and then breaks off,

00:02:54.096 --> 00:02:55.976
leaving half of itself in there,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.576
totally blocking that channel
and making it impossible

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.126
for the arachidonic acid to fit.
