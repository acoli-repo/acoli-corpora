00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:30.852
Now, the harder you push
against the needle,

00:01:30.876 --> 00:01:33.776
the closer you get
to the nociceptor threshold.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.134
Push hard enough,
and you'll cross that threshold

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:37.520
and the nociceptors fire,

00:01:37.544 --> 00:01:40.402
telling your body to stop doing
whatever you're doing.

00:01:40.426 --> 00:01:43.221
But the pain threshold isn't set in stone.

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:47.976
Certain chemicals can tune nociceptors,
lowering their threshold for pain.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.976
When cells are damaged,
they and other nearby cells

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.976
start producing these tuning
chemicals like crazy,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.976
lowering the nociceptors'
threshold to the point

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.623
where just touch can cause pain.

00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:01.960
And this is where over-the-counter
painkillers come in.
