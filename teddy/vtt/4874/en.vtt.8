00:03:58.553 --> 00:04:00.274
as the play came in second.

00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:02.670
By exploring new ideas

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.915
and encouraging self-criticism 
in Athenian society,

00:04:05.915 --> 00:04:08.628
Aristophanes not only 
mocked his fellow citizens,

00:04:08.628 --> 00:04:11.793
but he shaped the nature of comedy itself.

00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:15.287
Hailed by some scholars 
as the father of comedy,

00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:18.938
his fingerprints are visible 
upon comic techniques everywhere,

00:04:18.938 --> 00:04:19.980
from slapstick

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:20.948
to double acts

00:04:20.948 --> 00:04:22.335
to impersonations

00:04:22.335 --> 00:04:23.963
to political satire.

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:27.887
Through the praise of free speech 
and the celebration of ordinary heroes,

00:04:27.887 --> 00:04:31.408
his plays made his audience think 
while they laughed.
