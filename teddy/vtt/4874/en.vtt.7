00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:30.756
No matter how outlandish these plays get,
the heroes always prevail in the end.

00:03:30.756 --> 00:03:35.149
Aristophanes also became
the master of the parabasis,

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:38.622
a comic technique where actors 
address the audience directly,

00:03:38.622 --> 00:03:43.641
often praising the playwright 
or making topical comments and jokes.

00:03:43.641 --> 00:03:45.737
For example, in "Birds,"

00:03:45.737 --> 00:03:48.100
the Chorus takes 
the role of different birds

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.104
and threatens the Athenian judges that
if their play doesn’t win first prize,

00:03:52.104 --> 00:03:55.866
they’ll defecate on them 
as they walk around the city.

00:03:55.866 --> 00:03:58.553
Perhaps the judges 
didn’t appreciate the joke,

00:03:58.553 --> 00:04:00.274
as the play came in second.
