One issue, in particular, 
inspired much of Aristophanes’ work:

00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:35.101
the Peloponnesian War 
between Athens and Sparta.

00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:38.692
In Peace, written in 421 BC,

00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:43.310
a middle-aged Athenian frees 
the embodiment of peace from a cave,

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.976
where she’d been exiled 
by profiteering politicians.

00:02:46.976 --> 00:02:53.083
Then, in the aftermath of a crushing 
naval defeat for Athens in 411 BC,

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:55.453
Aristophanes wrote "Lysistrata."

00:02:55.453 --> 00:02:59.111
In this play, the women 
of Athens grow sick of war

00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:03.411
and go on a sex strike 
until their husbands make peace.
