and go on a sex strike 
until their husbands make peace.

00:03:03.411 --> 00:03:08.658
Other plays use similarly fantastic 
scenarios to skewer topical situations,

00:03:08.658 --> 00:03:10.693
such as in "Clouds,"

00:03:10.693 --> 00:03:14.299
where Aristophanes mocked 
fashionable philosophical thinking.

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.513
The hero Strepsiades enrolls in
Socrates’s new philosophical school,

00:03:19.513 --> 00:03:22.193
where he learns 
how to prove that wrong is right

00:03:22.193 --> 00:03:24.738
and that a debt is not a debt.

00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:30.756
No matter how outlandish these plays get,
the heroes always prevail in the end.
