How, when paintings are sold
and traded multiple times?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.893
And that's that artist's lifetime work,

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:07.309
that other people are making 10, 15,

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:11.976
sometimes 100 times more
than the artist that created it.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.684
So I created something
called the Dean's Choice,

00:04:15.708 --> 00:04:18.934
where if you're a seller,

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.559
or a collector,

00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:23.768
and you bring in your work
into, let's say, Sotheby's,

00:04:23.792 --> 00:04:26.684
there's a paper that's there
that says, "Hey, guys, you know,

00:04:26.708 --> 00:04:28.684
this artist is still living.

00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:32.351
You've made 300 percent on your investment
