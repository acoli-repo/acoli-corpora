I'm no longer going to have fun with this
unless I'm able to give back."

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:34.934
You know, The Dean Collection started
for me to create a museum for my family

00:01:34.958 --> 00:01:36.268
and our name.

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:38.893
Something that my kids
would have to be responsible

00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:40.684
to pass through generations.

00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:41.976
I said, "Wait a minute,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.643
The Dean Collection is not just
for The Dean Collection,

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:46.476
The Dean Collection is for everyone."

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.976
There are some galleries now
and places you walk in,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.268
if you don't have 50,000,
there's nothing to talk about.

00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:56.184
And I felt that a lot of people
were using that as an excuse

00:01:56.208 --> 00:01:57.476
to exit art.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.059
They feel that art
is only for rich people.
