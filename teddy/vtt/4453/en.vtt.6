without having to be trapped
to sell your soul?

00:03:01.042 --> 00:03:04.893
I was a part of the sale with my brother
Sean "Diddy" Combs,

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:06.559
the 21-million-dollar purchase,

00:03:06.583 --> 00:03:08.559
which made Kerry James Marshall

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:13.351
the highest-selling African American
living artist to today.

00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:15.393
I'm like, "Man,
you just broke the record,"

00:03:15.417 --> 00:03:16.726
and the artist was like,

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.351
"Yeah, I don't know whether
to be happy or to be sad."

00:03:19.375 --> 00:03:23.101
He first sold that work,
it was under 100,000.

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:27.226
So imagine a work that you made
for under 100,000

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.351
is now being sold for 21 million,
