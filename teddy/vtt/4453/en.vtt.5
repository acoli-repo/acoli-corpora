WEBVTT

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:31.434
We went to Shanghai, we went to London,

00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:33.018
we went to Berlin,

00:02:33.042 --> 00:02:36.226
we did it right in my backyard
in the South Bronx.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.934
You can come in to "No Commissions"

00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:40.893
and get something for a couple of bucks,

00:02:40.917 --> 00:02:42.976
or a couple hundred thousand.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.684
There's a tier for every person
that has love for art.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:49.893
And what we're doing is something
totally different from a gallery.

00:02:49.917 --> 00:02:53.059
The artists keep 100 percent of the sales.

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:54.934
But what about after "No Commissions,"

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.726
how can you sustain,
how can you move forward

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.018
without having to be trapped
to sell your soul?
