00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.351
is now being sold for 21 million,

00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:33.809
and you had to sit home and watch this.

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:36.768
And you couldn't even
participate five percent.

00:03:36.792 --> 00:03:38.143
When you look at it,

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:41.059
I'm a producer, I'm a songwriter,

00:03:41.083 --> 00:03:43.226
every time it's played on the radio,

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.684
I get paid.

00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:47.726
Every time it's played in a movie,

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.018
I get paid.

00:03:49.042 --> 00:03:53.684
Every time it plays, period,

00:03:53.708 --> 00:03:54.976
I get paid.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.143
Visual artists, they only get paid once.

00:03:58.167 --> 00:04:02.476
How, when paintings are sold
and traded multiple times?
