00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:32.351
You've made 300 percent on your investment

00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:34.726
by working with this artist.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.101
You can choose to give the artist
whatever you want of the sale."

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:40.684
I think that even if five people did it,

00:04:40.708 --> 00:04:43.018

00:04:43.042 --> 00:04:44.976

00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:52.351
musicians are able to survive,

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.643
years after years,

00:04:53.667 --> 00:04:56.268
off of the residual income
of their publishing.

00:04:56.292 --> 00:05:02.059
So how can we take something
that brings creatives together,
