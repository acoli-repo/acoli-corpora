SB: A lot of people like to say "battle,"

00:05:31.927 --> 00:05:33.893
we pulled back off of that word "battle,"

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:36.226
because we're battling enough
in the world today.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.976
We call it educational celebration.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.393
I think we're on our ninth or tenth one.

00:05:40.417 --> 00:05:43.500
Me and Timbaland started out
with 20,000 people.

00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:51.226
As of yesterday,
750,000 people in one room.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.708
So, we have this thing
called the "Verzuz Effect."

00:05:55.792 --> 00:05:58.893
And the "Verzuz Effect"
is what happens to the artist

00:05:58.917 --> 00:06:02.601
after they contribute to Verzuz.
