building 700, apartment 2E.

00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:35.184
I would go outside
and all I would hear is music.

00:00:35.208 --> 00:00:38.143
You go around to the back park,
the DJs are playing,

00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:39.851
there's a basketball game going on,

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:42.143
but then you would look
at the handball court,

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:45.309
and that handball court
would have an amazing graffiti mural,

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:48.726
I don't know if it's from
Keith Haring or Fab 5 Freddy.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.601
I was instantly attracted to the creative.

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:54.976
Music has been my therapy since day one.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.226
Anytime I get stressed out,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.143
I go to the arts,
I go to creativity, I go to music.
