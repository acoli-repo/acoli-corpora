00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.059
They feel that art
is only for rich people.

00:02:00.083 --> 00:02:01.351
Whoa.

00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:03.559
We've got to stop this,
we've got to fix this.

00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:05.809
And that's what made me and my wife say,

00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:09.309
you know, we have to create an entry point
to the younger generation

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:11.184
that didn't understand the art world,

00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:12.934
didn't have their seat at the table,

00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:15.184
and then we started "No Commissions."

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:16.476
It's a big event,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.476
you got 30-something-thousand
RSVPs a night.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.434
The drinks are free, the food is free,

00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:22.917
the concert's free.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.143
The education is free,

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:28.059
and I feel that education should be free.

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:31.434
We went to Shanghai, we went to London,
