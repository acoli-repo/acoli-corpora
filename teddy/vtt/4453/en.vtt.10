So how can we take something
that brings creatives together,

00:05:02.083 --> 00:05:03.518
and celebrate each other?

00:05:03.542 --> 00:05:06.018
Myself and Timbaland
have been working on this idea

00:05:06.042 --> 00:05:10.059
called Verzuz for about three years now.

00:05:10.083 --> 00:05:11.434
Then this trying time came,

00:05:11.458 --> 00:05:13.934
and everybody started
going to social media

00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:15.268
to express themselves.

00:05:15.292 --> 00:05:20.768
So what we did was I played my top songs,

00:05:20.792 --> 00:05:23.268
he played his top songs,

00:05:23.292 --> 00:05:25.018
and we went on Instagram Live.

00:05:25.042 --> 00:05:26.684
(Video) (Laughter)

00:05:26.708 --> 00:05:27.976
Timbaland: You having fun?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.671
This is so good for the culture.

00:05:29.705 --> 00:05:31.923
