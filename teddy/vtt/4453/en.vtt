Swizz Beatz: I got it.

00:00:02.458 --> 00:00:04.434
So are you guys going to mute when I talk

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:06.059
so nothing interrupts it?

00:00:06.083 --> 00:00:07.351
Voice: Uhh, yes.

00:00:07.375 --> 00:00:10.434
SB: Because once I'm in the flow,
I like to stay in the flow.

00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:12.809
Having some type of support

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:15.184
is very necessary when you are creative.

00:00:15.208 --> 00:00:19.851
You know, there has to be something
that's fueling that creativity,

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:22.309
that's fueling that fire
that you have inside.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:26.434
My love for music and creativity
starts way back, way back.

00:00:26.458 --> 00:00:29.059
Back in the South Bronx where I grew up,

00:00:29.083 --> 00:00:31.768
building 700, apartment 2E.
