WEBVTT

00:06:56.458 --> 00:07:00.851
we're very "let somebody else handle that,
I want to stick to this."

00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:04.559
But not only creativity is key,
education is key,

00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:06.684
which is the reason
why I went back to school

00:07:06.708 --> 00:07:10.143
to sharpen my pencil in my mid-30s.

00:07:10.167 --> 00:07:12.059
We have to know our business.

00:07:12.083 --> 00:07:16.101
But it's going to take us
digging in a little deeper

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:19.143
and pulling out the knowledge
that we need to prepare ourselves

00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:22.309
for this world that's waiting
to take advantage of the creatives.

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:23.857
Then we can make better choices,

00:07:23.881 --> 00:07:27.768
then we can end that conversation
of artists dying poor.

00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:29.364
If we're not protecting the arts,

00:07:29.388 --> 00:07:31.184
we're not protecting our future,
