00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.143
I go to the arts,
I go to creativity, I go to music.

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:04.726
Music makes people feel hugged,
people feel loved.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.101
And then I remember
one of my uncles saying,

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:10.059
"You should get into producing,"
I'm like, "What's producing?"

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:12.351
You know, it started
as a family-owned business,

00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:14.518
because Ruff Ryders
was created by my family.

00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:16.309
It gave you DMX, it gave you Eve,

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.851
it gave you Drag-On, it gave you The LOX.

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:22.518
I've gotten every accolade
in music that one can get.

00:01:22.542 --> 00:01:25.726
It just came to the point
where it's like, "You know what?

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.309
I'm no longer going to have fun with this
unless I'm able to give back."
