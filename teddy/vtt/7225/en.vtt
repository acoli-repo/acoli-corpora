Hello and welcome.

00:00:02.516 --> 00:00:03.556
As visual beings,

00:00:03.556 --> 00:00:06.396
we rely on images
to perceive the world

00:00:06.396 --> 00:00:07.396
and make meaning.

00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:10.836

00:00:11.396 --> 00:00:13.036
How would you depict this body?

00:00:14.036 --> 00:00:16.636
Body ideals reflect social meanings

00:00:16.636 --> 00:00:20.556
about how we dwell in spaces
both physical and cultural.

00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:24.476
We often interpret bodies
with categories of gender,

00:00:24.476 --> 00:00:25.476
race,

00:00:25.476 --> 00:00:26.476
ethnicity,

00:00:26.476 --> 00:00:27.476
class

00:00:27.476 --> 00:00:28.556
and belonging --

00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:29.676
or not --

00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:31.556
through modifications such as hair,
