00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
One day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Under a tree she saw a woman

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
meditating furiously.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The one-eyed monkey recognized the woman, a Sekhri.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
To watch her better, the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Just then, with a loud bang,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the heavens opened. (Claps)
