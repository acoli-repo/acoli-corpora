Every year, tens of thousands of people
world-wide have brain surgery

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.200
without a single incision:

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.540
thereâ€™s no scalpel, no operating table, 
and the patient loses no blood.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.641
Instead, this procedure takes place 
in a shielded room

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:28.173
with a large machine that emits 
invisible beams of light

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:31.493
at a precise target inside the brain.
