00:04:29.781 --> 00:04:33.565
because there are hundreds of thousands
of people walking around

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:37.164
with artificial hearing
and artificial vision.

00:04:37.164 --> 00:04:41.553
So the way this works is, you take
a microphone and you digitize the signal,

00:04:41.553 --> 00:04:45.291
and you put an electrode strip
directly into the inner ear.

00:04:45.291 --> 00:04:47.590
Or, with the retinal implant,
you take a camera

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.864
and you digitize the signal,
and then you plug an electrode grid

00:04:50.864 --> 00:04:53.882
directly into the optic nerve.

00:04:53.882 --> 00:04:57.806
And as recently as 15 years ago,

00:04:57.806 --> 00:05:01.544
there were a lot of scientists who thought
these technologies wouldn't work.
