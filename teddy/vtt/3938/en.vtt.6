00:02:58.281 --> 00:03:00.802
that there's something beyond
what we can sense.

00:03:01.412 --> 00:03:04.126
Instead, what we all do
is we accept reality

00:03:04.126 --> 00:03:06.772
as it's presented to us.

00:03:07.222 --> 00:03:09.717
Let's do a consciousness-raiser on this.

00:03:09.717 --> 00:03:12.373
Imagine that you are a bloodhound dog.

00:03:12.973 --> 00:03:15.178
Your whole world is about smelling.

00:03:15.178 --> 00:03:19.590
You've got a long snout that has
200 million scent receptors in it,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.094
and you have wet nostrils
that attract and trap scent molecules,

00:03:24.094 --> 00:03:28.088
and your nostrils even have slits
so you can take big nosefuls of air.

00:03:28.088 --> 00:03:31.362
Everything is about smell for you.
