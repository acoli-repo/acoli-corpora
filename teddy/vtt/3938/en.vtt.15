00:07:27.373 --> 00:07:31.297
and many birds have magnetite
so they can orient

00:07:31.297 --> 00:07:33.792
to the magnetic field of the planet.

00:07:33.792 --> 00:07:37.664
So what this means is that
nature doesn't have to continually

00:07:37.664 --> 00:07:40.079
redesign the brain.

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:44.560
Instead, with the principles
of brain operation established,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:49.239
all nature has to worry about
is designing new peripherals.

00:07:49.239 --> 00:07:52.164
Okay. So what this means is this:

00:07:52.164 --> 00:07:54.184
The lesson that surfaces

00:07:54.184 --> 00:07:57.853
is that there's nothing
really special or fundamental

00:07:57.853 --> 00:08:00.848
about the biology that we
come to the table with.
