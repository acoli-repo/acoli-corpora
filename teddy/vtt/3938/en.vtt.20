They can come to see through their tongue.

00:10:07.525 --> 00:10:09.731
Now, that sounds completely insane, right?

00:10:09.731 --> 00:10:12.540
But remember, all vision ever is

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.557
is electrochemical signals
coursing around in your brain.

00:10:16.557 --> 00:10:19.251
Your brain doesn't know
where the signals come from.

00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:22.687
It just figures out what to do with them.

00:10:22.687 --> 00:10:28.493
So my interest in my lab

00:10:28.493 --> 00:10:31.232
and this is a project I've undertaken
