00:03:58.458 --> 00:04:00.757
So because we're humans,

00:04:00.757 --> 00:04:03.404
we've never experienced
that world of smell,

00:04:03.404 --> 00:04:06.083
so we don't miss it,

00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:10.114
because we are firmly settled
into our umwelt.

00:04:10.114 --> 00:04:13.777
But the question is,
do we have to be stuck there?

00:04:14.317 --> 00:04:18.845
So as a neuroscientist, I'm interested
in the way that technology

00:04:18.845 --> 00:04:21.468
might expand our umwelt,

00:04:21.468 --> 00:04:25.108
and how that's going to change
the experience of being human.

00:04:26.228 --> 00:04:29.781
So we already know that we can marry
our technology to our biology,

00:04:29.781 --> 00:04:33.565
because there are hundreds of thousands
of people walking around
