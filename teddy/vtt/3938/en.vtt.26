Jonathan is not doing this consciously,
because the patterns are too complicated,

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:05.510
but his brain is starting to unlock
the pattern that allows it to figure out

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.786
what the data mean,

00:13:07.786 --> 00:13:11.988
and our expectation is that,
after wearing this for about three months,

00:13:11.988 --> 00:13:16.586
he will have a direct
perceptual experience of hearing

00:13:16.586 --> 00:13:20.765
in the same way that when a blind person
passes a finger over braille,

00:13:20.765 --> 00:13:26.362
the meaning comes directly off the page
without any conscious intervention at all.

00:13:26.941 --> 00:13:30.494
Now, this technology has the potential
to be a game-changer,
