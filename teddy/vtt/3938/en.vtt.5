00:02:25.756 --> 00:02:30.655
its sensory world is lavishly colored
by electrical fields;

00:02:30.655 --> 00:02:33.116
and for the echolocating bat,

00:02:33.116 --> 00:02:37.156
its reality is constructed
out of air compression waves.

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:41.521
That's the slice of their ecosystem
that they can pick up on,

00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:43.379
and we have a word for this in science.

00:02:43.403 --> 00:02:44.911
It's called the umwelt,

00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:48.603
which is the German word
for the surrounding world.

00:02:48.603 --> 00:02:51.598
Now, presumably, every animal assumes

00:02:51.598 --> 00:02:55.987
that its umwelt is the entire
objective reality out there,

00:02:55.987 --> 00:02:58.281
because why would you ever stop to imagine

00:02:58.281 --> 00:03:00.802
that there's something beyond
what we can sense.
