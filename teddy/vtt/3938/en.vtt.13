00:06:29.023 --> 00:06:32.669
and that, I think, frees up Mother Nature

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:37.452
to tinker around with different
sorts of input channels.

00:06:37.452 --> 00:06:40.284
So I call this the P.H. 
model of evolution,

00:06:40.284 --> 00:06:42.328
and I don't want to get
too technical here,

00:06:42.328 --> 00:06:45.369
but P.H. stands for Potato Head,

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:49.200
and I use this name to emphasize
that all these sensors

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.451
that we know and love, like our eyes
and our ears and our fingertips,

00:06:52.451 --> 00:06:56.770
these are merely peripheral
plug-and-play devices:

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.044
You stick them in, and you're good to go.
