00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.655
and of course we build machines
in the dashboards of our cars

00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:34.883
to pick up on signals
in the radio frequency range,

00:01:34.883 --> 00:01:38.575
and we built machines in hospitals
to pick up on the X-ray range.

00:01:38.575 --> 00:01:41.965
But you can't sense
any of those by yourself,

00:01:41.965 --> 00:01:43.474
at least not yet,

00:01:43.474 --> 00:01:47.421
because you don't come equipped
with the proper sensors.

00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:51.902
Now, what this means is that
our experience of reality

00:01:51.902 --> 00:01:55.362
is constrained by our biology,

00:01:55.362 --> 00:01:57.916
and that goes against
the common sense notion

00:01:57.916 --> 00:02:00.179
that our eyes and our ears
and our fingertips
