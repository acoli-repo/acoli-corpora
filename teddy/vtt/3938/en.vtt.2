00:00:58.486 --> 00:01:01.783
and X-rays and gamma rays
passing through your body right now

00:01:01.783 --> 00:01:04.732
and you're completely unaware of it,

00:01:04.732 --> 00:01:07.913
because you don't come with
the proper biological receptors

00:01:07.913 --> 00:01:09.121
for picking it up.

00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:12.198
There are thousands
of cell phone conversations

00:01:12.198 --> 00:01:13.754
passing through you right now,

00:01:13.754 --> 00:01:16.055
and you're utterly blind to it.

00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:19.953
Now, it's not that these things
are inherently unseeable.

00:01:19.953 --> 00:01:24.852
Snakes include some infrared
in their reality,

00:01:24.852 --> 00:01:28.730
and honeybees include ultraviolet
in their view of the world,

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.655
and of course we build machines
in the dashboards of our cars
