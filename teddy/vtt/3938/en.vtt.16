00:07:57.853 --> 00:08:00.848
about the biology that we
come to the table with.

00:08:00.848 --> 00:08:02.915
It's just what we have inherited

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:06.142
from a complex road of evolution.

00:08:06.142 --> 00:08:09.671
But it's not what we have to stick with,

00:08:09.671 --> 00:08:11.715
and our best proof of principle of this

00:08:11.715 --> 00:08:14.315
comes from what's called
sensory substitution.

00:08:14.315 --> 00:08:17.543
And that refers to feeding
information into the brain

00:08:17.543 --> 00:08:20.329
via unusual sensory channels,

00:08:20.329 --> 00:08:23.208
and the brain just figures out
what to do with it.

00:08:23.208 --> 00:08:25.669
Now, that might sound speculative,

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:30.621
but the first paper demonstrating this was
published in the journal Nature in 1969.
