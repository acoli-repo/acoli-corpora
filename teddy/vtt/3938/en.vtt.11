00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:35.183
Your brain is locked in a vault of silence
and darkness inside your skull.

00:05:35.183 --> 00:05:38.991
All it ever sees are
electrochemical signals

00:05:38.991 --> 00:05:41.540
that come in along different data cables,

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.992
and this is all it has to work with,
and nothing more.

00:05:46.672 --> 00:05:48.924
Now, amazingly,

00:05:48.924 --> 00:05:51.687
the brain is really good
at taking in these signals

00:05:51.687 --> 00:05:55.238
and extracting patterns
and assigning meaning,

00:05:55.238 --> 00:05:59.292
so that it takes this inner cosmos
and puts together a story

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:04.179
of this, your subjective world.
