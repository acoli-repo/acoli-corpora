00:10:59.094 --> 00:11:02.136
something that you could wear
under your clothing.

00:11:02.136 --> 00:11:03.816
So here's the concept.

00:11:05.326 --> 00:11:10.402
So as I'm speaking, my sound
is getting captured by the tablet,

00:11:10.402 --> 00:11:16.160
and then it's getting mapped onto a vest
that's covered in vibratory motors,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.597
just like the motors in your cell phone.

00:11:19.597 --> 00:11:21.988
So as I'm speaking,

00:11:21.988 --> 00:11:28.327
the sound is getting translated
to a pattern of vibration on the vest.

00:11:28.327 --> 00:11:29.906
Now, this is not just conceptual:

00:11:29.906 --> 00:11:35.014
this tablet is transmitting Bluetooth,
and I'm wearing the vest right now.
