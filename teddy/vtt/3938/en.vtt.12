00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:04.179
of this, your subjective world.

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:06.129
But here's the key point:

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:09.519
Your brain doesn't know,
and it doesn't care,

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:12.561
where it gets the data from.

00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:17.414
Whatever information comes in,
it just figures out what to do with it.

00:06:17.414 --> 00:06:19.852
And this is a very efficient
kind of machine.

00:06:19.852 --> 00:06:24.008
It's essentially a general purpose
computing device,

00:06:24.008 --> 00:06:26.423
and it just takes in everything

00:06:26.423 --> 00:06:29.023
and figures out
what it's going to do with it,

00:06:29.023 --> 00:06:32.669
and that, I think, frees up Mother Nature
