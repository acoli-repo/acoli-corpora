WEBVTT

00:00:00.973 --> 00:00:05.516
We are built out of very small stuff,

00:00:05.516 --> 00:00:08.031
and we are embedded in
a very large cosmos,

00:00:08.031 --> 00:00:12.582
and the fact is that we are not
very good at understanding reality

00:00:12.582 --> 00:00:14.161
at either of those scales,

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:15.763
and that's because our brains

00:00:15.763 --> 00:00:20.157
haven't evolved to understand 
the world at that scale.

00:00:20.157 --> 00:00:24.377
Instead, we're trapped on this
very thin slice of perception

00:00:24.377 --> 00:00:26.143
right in the middle.

00:00:26.723 --> 00:00:31.191
But it gets strange, because even at 
that slice of reality that we call home,
