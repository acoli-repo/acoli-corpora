00:04:57.806 --> 00:05:01.544
there were a lot of scientists who thought
these technologies wouldn't work.

00:05:01.544 --> 00:05:06.723
Why? It's because these technologies
speak the language of Silicon Valley,

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:12.295
and it's not exactly the same dialect
as our natural biological sense organs.

00:05:12.295 --> 00:05:14.710
But the fact is that it works;

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.299
the brain figures out
how to use the signals just fine.

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.233
Now, how do we understand that?

00:05:21.763 --> 00:05:23.458
Well, here's the big secret:

00:05:23.458 --> 00:05:28.728
Your brain is not hearing
or seeing any of this.

00:05:28.728 --> 00:05:35.183
Your brain is locked in a vault of silence
and darkness inside your skull.
