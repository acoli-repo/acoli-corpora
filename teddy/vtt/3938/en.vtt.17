00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:30.621
but the first paper demonstrating this was
published in the journal Nature in 1969.

00:08:31.985 --> 00:08:34.353
So a scientist named Paul Bach-y-Rita

00:08:34.353 --> 00:08:37.581
put blind people
in a modified dental chair,

00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:39.926
and he set up a video feed,

00:08:39.926 --> 00:08:42.178
and he put something
in front of the camera,

00:08:42.178 --> 00:08:44.639
and then you would feel that

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:47.565
poked into your back
with a grid of solenoids.

00:08:47.565 --> 00:08:50.049
So if you wiggle a coffee cup
in front of the camera,

00:08:50.049 --> 00:08:52.394
you're feeling that in your back,

00:08:52.394 --> 00:08:55.482
and amazingly, blind people
got pretty good

00:08:55.482 --> 00:08:59.035
at being able to determine
what was in front of the camera

00:08:59.035 --> 00:09:02.820
just by feeling it
in the small of their back.
