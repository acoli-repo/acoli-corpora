00:00:26.723 --> 00:00:31.191
But it gets strange, because even at 
that slice of reality that we call home,

00:00:31.191 --> 00:00:34.176
we're not seeing most
of the action that's going on.

00:00:34.176 --> 00:00:37.566
So take the colors of our world.

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:42.279
This is light waves, electromagnetic
radiation that bounces off objects

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:45.716
and it hits specialized receptors
in the back of our eyes.

00:00:45.716 --> 00:00:49.361
But we're not seeing
all the waves out there.

00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:51.056
In fact, what we see

00:00:51.056 --> 00:00:55.119
is less than a 10 trillionth
of what's out there.

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:58.486
So you have radio waves and microwaves

00:00:58.486 --> 00:01:01.783
and X-rays and gamma rays
passing through your body right now
