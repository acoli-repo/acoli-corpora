00:00:06.646 --> 00:00:10.302
A few months ago we posed a challenge 
to our community.

00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:15.192
We asked everyone: given a range of 
integers from 0 to 100,

00:00:15.192 --> 00:00:22.056
guess the whole number closest to 2/3 
of the average of all numbers guessed.

00:00:22.056 --> 00:00:26.776
So if the average of all guesses is 60, 
the correct guess will be 40.

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:31.414
What number do you think was the 
correct guess at 2/3 of the average?
