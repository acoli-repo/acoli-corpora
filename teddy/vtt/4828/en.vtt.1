00:00:27.788 --> 00:00:31.121
We keep animals as pets,
they enrich our environment,

00:00:31.288 --> 00:00:33.329
we farm many species for food,

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.704
and we use them in experiments to advance
science and human health.

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:39.579
Animals are clearly important to us,

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.287
so it’s equally important that we
avoid causing them unnecessary pain.

00:00:44.287 --> 00:00:47.079
For animals that are similar to us,
like mammals,

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.537
it's often obvious when they're hurting.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.079
But there's a lot that isn't obvious,

00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:55.454
like whether pain relievers that
work on us also help them.

00:00:55.787 --> 00:00:57.996
And the more different
an animal is from us,

00:00:58.037 --> 00:01:00.454
the harder it is to understand
their experience.
