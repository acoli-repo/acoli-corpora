00:01:28.246 --> 00:01:32.121
And nearly all animals, even those
with very simple nervous systems,

00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:33.329
experience it.

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.579
Without this ability, animals would be 
unable to avoid harm

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.454
and their survival would be threatened.

00:01:39.413 --> 00:01:42.704
The second part is the conscious
recognition of harm.

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.413
In humans, this occurs when the sensory
neurons in our skin

00:01:46.413 --> 00:01:50.204
make a second round of connections 
via the spinal cord to the brain.

00:01:51.038 --> 00:01:55.913
There, millions of neurons in multiple
regions create the sensations of pain.

00:01:56.704 --> 00:02:00.371
For us, this is a very complex experience
associated with emotions
