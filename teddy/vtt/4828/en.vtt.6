00:02:58.413 --> 00:03:01.163
partly because their behaviors
are harder to read.

00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:06.621
We can make good guesses about some of
them, like oysters, worms and jellyfish.

00:03:07.038 --> 00:03:09.871
These are examples of animals 
that either lack a brain

00:03:09.871 --> 00:03:11.454
or have a very simple one.

00:03:11.871 --> 00:03:15.913
So an oyster may recoil when squirted
with lemon juice, for instance,

00:03:15.913 --> 00:03:17.621
because of nociception.

00:03:18.496 --> 00:03:20.496
But with such a simple nervous system,

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:23.538
it’s unlikely to experience 
the conscious part of pain.

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:27.038
Other invertebrate animals are 
more complicated, though.

00:03:27.204 --> 00:03:30.079
Like the octopus, 
which has a sophisticated brain
