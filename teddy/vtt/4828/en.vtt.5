00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:31.163
in the lab, scientists have discovered 
that animals like chickens and rats

00:02:31.163 --> 00:02:34.663
will self-administer pain-reducing 
drugs if they’re hurting.

00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:38.704
Animals also avoid situations 
where they’ve been hurt before,

00:02:38.704 --> 00:02:41.246
which suggests awareness of threats.

00:02:42.163 --> 00:02:45.163
We’ve reached the point that
research has made us so sure

00:02:45.163 --> 00:02:46.913
that vertebrates recognize pain

00:02:46.913 --> 00:02:50.538
that it’s illegal in many countries
to needlessly harm these animals.

00:02:51.954 --> 00:02:55.204
But what about other types 
of animals, like invertebrates?

00:02:55.663 --> 00:02:58.413
These animals aren't legally protected,

00:02:58.413 --> 00:03:01.163
partly because their behaviors
are harder to read.
