the harder it is to understand
their experience.

00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:03.162
How do you tell whether a shrimp 
is in pain?

00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:04.454
A snake?

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:05.871
A snail?

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:11.871
In vertebrates— including humans— pain 
can be split into two distinct processes.

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:15.996
In the first, nerves in the skin 
sense something harmful

00:01:15.996 --> 00:01:18.454
and communicate that information
to the spinal cord.

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:23.204
There, motor neurons activate movements
that make us rapidly jerk away

00:01:23.204 --> 00:01:24.371
from the threat.

00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:27.954
This is the physical recognition of harm 
called nociception.

00:01:28.246 --> 00:01:32.121
And nearly all animals, even those
with very simple nervous systems,
