Tests on hermit crabs show that they’ll
leave an undesirable shell

00:04:01.246 --> 00:04:02.954
if they’re zapped with electricity.

00:04:03.288 --> 00:04:05.163
But stay if it’s a good shell.

00:04:05.413 --> 00:04:09.163
And octopi that might originally 
curl up an injured arm to protect it,

00:04:09.163 --> 00:04:11.371
will risk using it to catch prey.

00:04:11.996 --> 00:04:16.538
That suggests that these animals make
value judgments around sensory input,

00:04:16.538 --> 00:04:19.204
instead of just reacting
reflexively to harm.

00:04:19.954 --> 00:04:23.704
Meanwhile, crabs have been known
to repeatedly rub a spot on their bodies

00:04:23.704 --> 00:04:25.829
where they’ve received an electric shock.

00:04:26.329 --> 00:04:29.621
And even sea slugs flinch when they
know they’re about to receive

00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:31.371
a noxious stimulus.
