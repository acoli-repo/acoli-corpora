why we can't measure racism
if we put our minds to it."

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.216
And so I put my mind to it

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.760
and developed three scales.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.416
The first one captured
major experiences of discrimination,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.696
like being unfairly fired
or being unfairly stopped by the police.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.016
But discrimination also occurs
in more minor and subtle experiences,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.120
and so my second scale,
called the Everyday Discrimination Scale,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.736
captures nine items

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.096
that captures experiences

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.416
like you're treated
with less courtesy than others,
