"Each time a man" --
or woman, I would add --

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.336
"stands up for an ideal

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.936
or acts to improve the lot of others

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.536
or strikes out against injustice,

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.096
he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope,

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.216
and those ripples can build a current

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.200
that can sweep down the mightiest walls
of oppression and resistance."
