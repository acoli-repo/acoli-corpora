00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.816
One explanation for this pattern

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.776
was a phenomenon
that's called "implicit bias"

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.096
or "unconscious discrimination."

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.936
Research for decades
by social psychologists

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.456
indicates that if you hold
a negative stereotype

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.536
about a group in your subconscious mind

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.256
and you meet someone from that group,

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.576
you will discriminate against that person.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.256
You will treat them differently.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.896
It's an unconscious process.
It's an automatic process.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.096
It is a subtle process, but it's normal
