determines your access to opportunities

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.216

in access to medical care.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:48.056
One study of the 171 largest
cities in the United States

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.376
concluded that there is not even one city

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.736
where whites live
under equal conditions to blacks,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.696
and that the worst urban contexts
in which whites reside

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.360
is considerably better than the average
context of black communities.
