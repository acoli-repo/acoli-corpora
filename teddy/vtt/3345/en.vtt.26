00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:02.200
as the equal treatment of unequal people.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.416
And that's why I am committed

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.960
to working to dismantle racism.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.416
I deeply appreciate the fact

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.696
that I am standing on the shoulders

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.056
of those who have sacrificed
even their lives to open the doors

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.366
that I have walked through.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.176
I want to ensure
that those doors remain open

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.840
and that everyone
can walk through those doors.
