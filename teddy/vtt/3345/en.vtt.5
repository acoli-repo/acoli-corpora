00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.040
So for example, if we look
at life expectancy at age 25,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.056
at age 25 there's a five-year gap
between blacks and whites.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.016
And the gap by education
for both whites and blacks

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.160
is even larger than the racial gap.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.576
At the same time,
at every level of education,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.840
whites live longer than blacks.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.856
So whites who are high school dropouts

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.576
live 3.4 years longer
than their black counterparts,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.496
and the gap is even larger
