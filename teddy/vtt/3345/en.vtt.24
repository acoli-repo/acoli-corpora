black America has been
less successful than I have.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:10.016
In 1978, black households
in the United States

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.160
earned 59 cents for every dollar
of income whites earned.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.296
In 2015,

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.176
black families still earn 59 cents

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.016
for every dollar of income
that white families receive,

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.640
and the racial gaps in wealth
are even more stunning.
