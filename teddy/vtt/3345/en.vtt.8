00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.720
For me, that was not good enough.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.616
A few months later,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.576
I was speaking at a conference
in Washington, DC,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.776
and I said that one
of the priorities for research

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.520
was to document the ways
in which racism affected health.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.416
A white gentleman stood in the audience

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.760
and said that while he agreed
with me that racism was important,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.720
we could never measure racism.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.880
"We measure self-esteem," I said.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.616
"There's no reason

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.640
why we can't measure racism
if we put our minds to it."
