00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.896
I have had a supportive family,

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.200
I have worked hard,

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.440
I have done well.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.800
But it took more for me to be successful.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.720
I received a minority fellowship
from the University of Michigan.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.680
Yes. I am an affirmative action baby.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.336
Without affirmative action,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.040
I would not be here.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.536
But in the last 40 years,

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.320
black America has been
less successful than I have.
