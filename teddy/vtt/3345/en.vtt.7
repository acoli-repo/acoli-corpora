00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.680
I was asked to review a new book

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.480
on the health of black America.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.296
I was struck that almost every single one

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.576
of its 25 chapters

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.376
said that racism

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.440
was a factor that was hurting
the health of blacks.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.080
All of these researchers

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.880
were stating that racism was a factor
adversely impacting blacks,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.640
but they provided no evidence.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.720
For me, that was not good enough.
