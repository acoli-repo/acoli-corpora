00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.360
is considerably better than the average
context of black communities.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.616
Another study found

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.656
that if you could eliminate statistically

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.336
residential segregation,

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.496
you would completely erase
black-white differences in income,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.016
education and unemployment,

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.336
and reduce black-white differences
in single motherhood

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.576
by two thirds,

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.960
all of that driven by segregation.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.016
I have also learned

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.816
how the negative stereotypes

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.816
and images of blacks in our culture
