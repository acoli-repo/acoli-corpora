00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:31.659
with the everyday absurdity 
of Soviet life.

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.869
So how did Bulgakov 
manage to publish such a subversive novel

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.234
under an oppressive regime?

00:02:38.234 --> 00:02:40.284
Well… he didn’t.

00:02:40.284 --> 00:02:43.484
He worked on "The Master and Margarita"
for over ten years.

00:02:43.484 --> 00:02:45.424
But while Stalin’s personal favor

00:02:45.424 --> 00:02:48.904
may have kept Bulgakov 
safe from severe persecution,

00:02:48.904 --> 00:02:51.904
many of his plays and writings 
were kept from production,

00:02:51.904 --> 00:02:55.424
leaving him safe but effectively silenced.

00:02:55.424 --> 00:02:57.844
Upon the author’s death in 1940,

00:02:57.844 --> 00:03:00.034
the manuscript remained unpublished.
