00:03:26.104 --> 00:03:30.454
"The Master" is a nameless author 
who’s worked for years on a novel

00:03:30.454 --> 00:03:34.164
but burned the manuscript 
after it was rejected by publishers–

00:03:34.164 --> 00:03:36.964
just as Bulgakov 
had done with his own work.

00:03:36.964 --> 00:03:41.214
Yet the true protagonist 
is the Master’s mistress Margarita.

00:03:41.214 --> 00:03:43.807
Her devotion 
to her lover’s abandoned dream

00:03:43.807 --> 00:03:48.207
bears a strange connection 
to the diabolical company’s escapades–

00:03:48.207 --> 00:03:51.627
and carries the story 
to its surreal climax.

00:03:51.627 --> 00:03:55.156
Despite its dark humor 
and complex structure,

00:03:55.156 --> 00:03:58.356
"The Master and Margarita" 
is, at its heart,

00:03:58.356 --> 00:04:02.406
a meditation on art, love, and redemption,
