Much of the novel’s dark humor 
comes not only from this demonic mischief,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.660
but also the backdrop 
against which it occurs.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.660
Bulgakov’s story takes place 
in the same setting where it was written–

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.310
the USSR 
at the height of the Stalinist period.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.889
There, artists and authors 
worked under strict censorship,

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:50.299
subject to imprisonment, 
exile, or execution

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.679
if they were seen 
as undermining state ideology.

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.879
Even when approved, their work–

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:58.379
along with housing, travel, 
and everything else–

00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:01.419
was governed by a convoluted bureaucracy.
