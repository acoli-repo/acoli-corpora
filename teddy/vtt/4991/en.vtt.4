WEBVTT

00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:01.419
was governed by a convoluted bureaucracy.

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:02.289
In the novel,

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.509
Woland manipulates this system 
along with the fabric of reality,

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.519
to hilarious results.

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.749
As heads are separated from bodies 
and money rains from the sky,

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:16.431
the citizens of Moscow 
react with petty-self interest,

00:02:16.431 --> 00:02:20.441
illustrating how Soviet society 
bred greed and cynicism

00:02:20.441 --> 00:02:22.111
despite its ideals.

00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:24.209
And the matter-of-fact narration

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.919
deliberately blends 
the strangeness of the supernatural events

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:31.659
with the everyday absurdity 
of Soviet life.
