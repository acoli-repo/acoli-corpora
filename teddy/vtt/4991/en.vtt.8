00:03:58.356 --> 00:04:02.406
a meditation on art, love, and redemption,

00:04:02.406 --> 00:04:05.233
that never loses itself in cynicism.

00:04:05.233 --> 00:04:09.593
And the book’s long overdue publication 
and survival against the odds

00:04:09.593 --> 00:04:14.060
is a testament 
to what Woland tells the Master:

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.297
“Manuscripts don’t burn.”
