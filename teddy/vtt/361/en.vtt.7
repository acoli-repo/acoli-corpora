00:03:29.138 --> 00:03:31.315
"Okay, you're going to learn to love the moon.

00:03:31.315 --> 00:03:33.648
I'm going to give you some building blocks

00:03:33.648 --> 00:03:36.798
and they're nonrectilinear cactus building blocks,

00:03:36.798 --> 00:03:38.612
so it's totally legit."

00:03:38.612 --> 00:03:40.886
But he doesn't really know what to do with these.

00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:42.458
I didn't show him.

00:03:42.458 --> 00:03:43.966
And so he's like, "Okay, I'll just mess around with this."

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:47.869
This is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest.

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:50.341
Just going to try to put them in shapes

00:03:50.341 --> 00:03:52.117
and push on them and stuff.

00:03:52.117 --> 00:03:54.781
And before long, he's kind of got this mechanism

00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:58.451
where you can almost launch and catapult objects around,

00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:00.716
and he enlists us in helping him.
