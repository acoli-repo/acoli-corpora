00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:31.102
A leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass.

00:02:31.102 --> 00:02:33.798
The materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom

00:02:33.798 --> 00:02:37.170
being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.735
And after about 45 minutes, you get really intricate projects

00:02:40.735 --> 00:02:43.962
like leaves sorted by hue, so you get a color fade

00:02:43.962 --> 00:02:45.806
and put in a circle like a wreath.

00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:48.422
And the creator of this, he said,

00:02:48.422 --> 00:02:50.092
"This is fire. I call this fire."

00:02:50.092 --> 00:02:52.319
And someone asked him, "How do you get those sticks

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.080
to stay on that tree?"

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.190
And he's like, "I don't know, but I can show you."

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.822
And I'm like, "Wow, that's really amazing.

00:02:58.822 --> 00:03:00.205
He doesn't know, but he can show you."
