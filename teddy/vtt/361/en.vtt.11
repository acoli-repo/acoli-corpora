00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:30.359
if you take that piano circuit, you can thumbtack

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:32.298
into the middle of a pencil,

00:05:32.298 --> 00:05:35.218
and you can lay out wire on the page, too,

00:05:35.218 --> 00:05:37.639
and get electrical current to run through it.

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.521
And so you can kind of hack a pencil,

00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:45.042
just by thumbtacking into it with a little piano electrical circuit.

00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:46.982
And the electricity runs through your body too.

00:05:46.982 --> 00:05:50.328
And then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil.

00:05:50.328 --> 00:05:53.782
You can make one of these brushes just on the fly.

00:05:53.782 --> 00:05:55.589
All you do is connect to the bristles,

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:57.581
and the bristles are wet, so they conduct,

00:05:57.581 --> 00:06:00.150
and the person's body conducts,
