(Music: Massive Attack — "Teardrop")

00:11:31.355 --> 00:11:34.101
Most people cannot play them that way. (Laughter)

00:11:34.101 --> 00:11:35.523
And when this started to get serious,

00:11:35.523 --> 00:11:38.950
I thought, I'd better put a really serious warning label on the box that this comes in,

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:40.652
because otherwise people are going to be getting this

00:11:40.652 --> 00:11:42.891
and they're going to be turning into agents of creative change,

00:11:42.891 --> 00:11:44.183
and governments will be crumbling,

00:11:44.183 --> 00:11:46.542
and I wouldn't have told people, so I thought I'd better warn them.

00:11:46.542 --> 00:11:48.871
And I also put this little surprise. When you open the lid

00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:51.731
of the box, it says, "The world is a construction kit."

00:11:51.731 --> 00:11:53.578
And as you start to mess around this way,

00:11:53.578 --> 00:11:56.677
I think that, in some small ways, you do start to see

00:11:56.677 --> 00:11:58.729
the landscape of your everyday life

00:11:58.729 --> 00:12:01.622
a little bit more like something you could express yourself with,
