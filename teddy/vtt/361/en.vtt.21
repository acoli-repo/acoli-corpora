00:10:28.281 --> 00:10:31.289
And this guy rounded up his dogs and he made a dog piano.

00:10:34.134 --> 00:10:36.579
And this is fun,

00:10:36.579 --> 00:10:39.466
and what could be more useful than feeling alive and fun?

00:10:39.466 --> 00:10:41.986
But it's also very serious because

00:10:41.986 --> 00:10:44.154
all this accessibility stuff started coming up,

00:10:44.154 --> 00:10:47.110
where people can't use computers, necessarily.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.802
Like this dad who wrote us, his son has cerebral palsy

00:10:49.802 --> 00:10:51.674
and he can't use a normal keyboard.

00:10:51.674 --> 00:10:55.245
And so his dad couldn't necessarily afford

00:10:55.245 --> 00:10:57.087
to buy all these custom controllers.

00:10:57.087 --> 00:10:58.713
And so, with the MaKey MaKey, he planned to make

00:10:58.713 --> 00:11:01.607
these gloves to allow him to navigate the web.
