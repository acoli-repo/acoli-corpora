00:08:58.432 --> 00:09:00.775
but we should be doing that stuff ourselves.

00:09:00.775 --> 00:09:03.858
It shouldn't be a set of experts engineering the way the world works.

00:09:03.858 --> 00:09:05.833
We should all be participating

00:09:05.833 --> 00:09:07.753
in changing the way the world works together.

00:09:07.753 --> 00:09:09.940
Aluminum foil. Everybody has a cat.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.124
Get a bowl of water. This is just Photo Booth on your Mac OS.

00:09:13.124 --> 00:09:15.184
Hover the mouse over the "take a photo" button,

00:09:15.184 --> 00:09:16.759
and you've got a little cat photo booth.

00:09:16.759 --> 00:09:19.448
And so we needed hundreds of people to buy this.

00:09:19.448 --> 00:09:22.536
If hundreds of people didn't buy this, we couldn't put it on the market.

00:09:22.536 --> 00:09:25.437
And so we put it up on Kickstarter,

00:09:25.437 --> 00:09:28.432
and hundreds of people bought it in the first day.

00:09:28.432 --> 00:09:29.458
And then 30 days later,

00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:32.725
11,000 people had backed the project.
