00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:32.725
11,000 people had backed the project.

00:09:32.725 --> 00:09:34.840
And then what the best part is, we started getting

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.912
a flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it.

00:09:38.912 --> 00:09:41.574
So this is "The Star-Spangled Banner" by eating lunch,

00:09:41.574 --> 00:09:43.648
including drinking Listerine.

00:09:43.648 --> 00:09:45.114
And we actually sent this guy materials.

00:09:45.114 --> 00:09:46.595
We're like, "We're sponsoring you, man.

00:09:46.595 --> 00:09:48.705
You're, like, a pro maker."

00:09:48.705 --> 00:09:52.320
Okay, just wait for this one. This is good.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.139
(Laughter)

00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:57.624
(Applause)

00:09:57.624 --> 00:09:59.501
And these guys at the exploratorium are

00:09:59.501 --> 00:10:02.466
playing house plants as if they were drums.
