00:11:01.607 --> 00:11:03.767
And a huge eruption of discussion

00:11:03.767 --> 00:11:06.722
around accessibility came, and we're really excited about that.

00:11:06.722 --> 00:11:08.623
We didn't plan for that at all.

00:11:08.623 --> 00:11:11.431
And then all these professional musicians started using it,

00:11:11.431 --> 00:11:13.559
like at Coachella, just this weekend

00:11:13.559 --> 00:11:16.711
Jurassic 5 was using this onstage,

00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:20.412
and this D.J. is just from Brooklyn, right around here,

00:11:20.412 --> 00:11:22.423
and he put this up last month.

00:11:22.423 --> 00:11:24.527
And I love the carrot on the turntable.
