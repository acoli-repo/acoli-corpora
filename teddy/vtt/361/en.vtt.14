00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:01.496
made a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from Taiwan

00:07:01.496 --> 00:07:03.280
and some electrical tape and hot glue.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.361
And professional designers were making artifacts

00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:07.140
with this thing strapped onto it.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.354
And big companies like Intel

00:07:09.354 --> 00:07:13.007
or smaller design firms like Ideo or startups like Bump,

00:07:13.007 --> 00:07:14.559
were inviting me to give workshops,

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:16.954
just to practice this idea of smashing electronics

00:07:16.954 --> 00:07:18.786
and everyday objects together.

00:07:18.786 --> 00:07:21.447
And then we came up with this idea

00:07:21.447 --> 00:07:23.235
to not just use electronics,

00:07:23.235 --> 00:07:26.207
but let's just smash computers with everyday objects

00:07:26.207 --> 00:07:28.767
and see how that goes over.

00:07:28.767 --> 00:07:32.366
And so I just want to do a quick demo.
