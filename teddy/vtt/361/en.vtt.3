00:01:26.847 --> 00:01:30.980
everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.324
or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to,

00:01:33.324 --> 00:01:37.235
maybe a more complicated one, but still, everything was made that way.

00:01:37.235 --> 00:01:39.427
And so I had to start studying,

00:01:39.427 --> 00:01:41.137
who is it that's making these decisions?

00:01:41.137 --> 00:01:42.946
Who's making these things? How did they make them?

00:01:42.946 --> 00:01:44.440
What stops us from making them?

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.345
Because this is how reality is created.

00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:49.932
So I started right away. I was at MIT Media Lab,

00:01:49.932 --> 00:01:52.481
and I was studying the maker movement

00:01:52.481 --> 00:01:54.031
and makers and creativity.

00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:56.158
And I started in nature, because I saw these Guaymís

00:01:56.158 --> 00:01:59.203
doing it in nature, and there just seems to be less barriers.

00:01:59.203 --> 00:02:02.548
So I went to Vermont to Not Back to School Camp,
