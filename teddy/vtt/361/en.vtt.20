00:09:59.501 --> 00:10:02.466
playing house plants as if they were drums.

00:10:04.723 --> 00:10:08.297
And dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways.

00:10:08.297 --> 00:10:10.649
And then this brother -- look at this diagram.

00:10:10.649 --> 00:10:11.937
See where it says "sister"?

00:10:11.937 --> 00:10:14.393
I love when people put humans on the diagram.

00:10:14.393 --> 00:10:16.861
I always add humans to any technical --

00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:18.993
if you're drawing a technical diagram, put a human in it.

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:23.463
And this kid is so sweet. He made this trampoline slideshow advancer for his sister

00:10:23.463 --> 00:10:25.536
so that on her birthday, she could be the star of the show,

00:10:25.536 --> 00:10:28.281
jumping on the trampoline to advance the slides.

00:10:28.281 --> 00:10:31.289
And this guy rounded up his dogs and he made a dog piano.
