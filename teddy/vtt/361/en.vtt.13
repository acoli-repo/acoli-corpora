I don't even have access to a facial piercing if I wanted to.

00:06:32.778 --> 00:06:36.799
And this young woman, she made what she called a hula-looper,

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:39.212
and as the hula hoop traveled around her body,

00:06:39.212 --> 00:06:41.983
she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there.

00:06:41.983 --> 00:06:44.024
You can see her pointing to it in the picture.

00:06:44.024 --> 00:06:46.440
And every time the hula hoop would smush against her body,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.623
it would connect two little pieces of copper tape,

00:06:48.623 --> 00:06:50.359
and it would make a sound, and the next sound,

00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:52.895
and it would loop the same sounds over and over again.

00:06:52.895 --> 00:06:54.824
I ran these workshops everywhere.

00:06:54.824 --> 00:06:57.834
In Taiwan, at an art museum, this 12-year-old girl

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:01.496
made a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from Taiwan
