00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:00.716
and he enlists us in helping him.

00:04:00.716 --> 00:04:02.651
And at this point, I'm starting to wonder,

00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:05.452
what kind of tools can we give people,

00:04:05.452 --> 00:04:08.406
especially adults, who know too much,

00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:10.697
so that they can see the world as malleable,

00:04:10.697 --> 00:04:12.174
so they see themselves as agents of change

00:04:12.174 --> 00:04:13.636
in their everyday lives.

00:04:13.636 --> 00:04:16.122
Because the most advanced scientists are really

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:18.854
just kind of pushing the way the world itself works,

00:04:18.854 --> 00:04:20.031
pushing what matter can do,

00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:22.812
the most advanced artists are just pushing the medium,

00:04:22.812 --> 00:04:24.758
and any sufficiently complicated task,

00:04:24.758 --> 00:04:27.683
whether you're a cook or a carpenter or you're raising a child --

00:04:27.683 --> 00:04:29.369
anything that's complicated --

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:31.896
comes up with problems that aren't solved in the middle of it,
