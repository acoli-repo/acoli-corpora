00:01:59.203 --> 00:02:02.548
So I went to Vermont to Not Back to School Camp,

00:02:02.548 --> 00:02:05.800
where there's unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.287
and willing to try anything.

00:02:07.287 --> 00:02:09.580
So I said, "Let's go into the woods near this stream

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.609
and just put stuff together, you know, make something,

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.196
I don't care, geometrical shapes, just grab some junk from around you.

00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:15.845
We won't bring anything with us.

00:02:15.845 --> 00:02:18.364
And, like, within minutes, this is very easy for adults

00:02:18.364 --> 00:02:19.452
and teens to do.

00:02:19.452 --> 00:02:22.587
Here's a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream,

00:02:22.587 --> 00:02:25.171
and the shape of an oak leaf being made

00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:28.365
by other small oak leaves being put together.

00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:31.102
A leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass.
