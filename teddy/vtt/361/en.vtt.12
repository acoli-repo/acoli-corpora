00:05:57.581 --> 00:06:00.150
and the person's body conducts,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.149
and leather is great to paint on,

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:04.854
and then you can start hooking to everything,

00:06:04.854 --> 00:06:05.849
even the kitchen sink.

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:07.768
The metal in the sink is conductive.

00:06:07.768 --> 00:06:11.321
Flowing water acts like a theremin or a violin.

00:06:11.321 --> 00:06:16.303
(Musical notes)

00:06:16.303 --> 00:06:17.557
And you can even hook to the trees.

00:06:17.557 --> 00:06:20.953
Anything in the world is either conductive or not conductive,

00:06:20.953 --> 00:06:22.727
and you can use those together.

00:06:22.727 --> 00:06:24.183
So — (Laughter) —

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:27.338
I took this to those same teens, because those teens are

00:06:27.338 --> 00:06:29.795
really awesome, and they'll try things that I won't try.

00:06:29.795 --> 00:06:32.778
I don't even have access to a facial piercing if I wanted to.
