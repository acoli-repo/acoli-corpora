Hey guys.

00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:03.811
It's funny, someone just mentioned MacGyver,

00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:05.751
because that was, like, I loved it,

00:00:05.751 --> 00:00:11.071
and when I was seven, I taped a fork to a drill

00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:13.792
and I was like, "Hey, Mom, I'm going to Olive Garden."

00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:17.943
And -- (Drilling noise) (Laughter)

00:00:17.943 --> 00:00:20.875
And it worked really well there.

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:24.696
And you know, it had a profound effect on me.

00:00:24.696 --> 00:00:26.924
It sounds silly, but I thought, okay,

00:00:26.924 --> 00:00:29.796
the way the world works can be changed,

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.947
and it can be changed by me in these small ways.
