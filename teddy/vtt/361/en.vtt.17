Just ordinary Play-Doh, nothing special.

00:08:32.233 --> 00:08:33.934
And you can literally draw joysticks

00:08:33.934 --> 00:08:41.057
and just find Pacman on your computer and then just hook it up. (Video game noises)

00:08:41.057 --> 00:08:44.560
And you know the little plastic drawers you can get at Target?

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.768
Well, if you take those out, they hold water great,

00:08:46.768 --> 00:08:48.904
but you can totally cut your toes,

00:08:48.904 --> 00:08:51.592
so yeah, just be careful.

00:08:51.592 --> 00:08:54.464
You know the Happiness Project, where the experts

00:08:54.464 --> 00:08:57.222
are setting up the piano stairs, and how cool that is?

00:08:57.222 --> 00:08:58.432
Well, I think it's cool,

00:08:58.432 --> 00:09:00.775
but we should be doing that stuff ourselves.
