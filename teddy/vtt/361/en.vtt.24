00:11:58.729 --> 00:12:01.622
a little bit more like something you could express yourself with,

00:12:01.622 --> 00:12:03.861
and a little bit more like you could participate

00:12:03.861 --> 00:12:06.325
in designing the future of the way the world works.

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:10.113
And so next time you're on an escalator

00:12:10.113 --> 00:12:11.789
and you drop an M&amp;M by accident,

00:12:11.789 --> 00:12:14.949
you know, maybe that's an M&amp;M surfboard, not an escalator,

00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:16.156
so don't pick it up right away.

00:12:16.156 --> 00:12:18.344
Maybe take some more stuff out of your pockets

00:12:18.344 --> 00:12:21.653
and throw it down, and maybe some chapstick, whatever.

00:12:21.653 --> 00:12:26.615
I used to want to design a utopian society

00:12:26.615 --> 00:12:28.987
or a perfect world or something like that.

00:12:28.987 --> 00:12:30.441
But as I'm kind of getting older
