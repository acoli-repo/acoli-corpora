00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:31.896
comes up with problems that aren't solved in the middle of it,

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:35.222
and you can't do a good job getting it done unless you can say,

00:04:35.222 --> 00:04:37.350
"Okay, well we're just going to have to refigure this.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.029
I don't care that pencils are supposed to be for writing.

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:42.214
I'm going to use them a different way."

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:47.013
So let me show you a little demo.

00:04:47.013 --> 00:04:51.575
This is a little piano circuit right in here,

00:04:51.575 --> 00:04:53.666
and this is an ordinary paintbrush

00:04:53.666 --> 00:04:56.661
that I smashed it together with. (Beeping)

00:04:56.661 --> 00:04:58.524
And so, with some ketchup,

00:04:58.524 --> 00:05:01.998
