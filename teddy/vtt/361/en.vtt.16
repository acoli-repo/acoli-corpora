00:07:57.235 --> 00:08:00.667
And now if I hook up this wire just by connecting it

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:03.939
to the left arrow, I'm kind of programming it by where I hook it up,

00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:06.960
now I have a left arrow and a right arrow,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.160
so I should be able to go forwards and backwards

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.264
and forwards and backwards. Awesome.

00:08:12.264 --> 00:08:14.808
And so we're like, "We gotta put a video out about this."

00:08:14.808 --> 00:08:17.376
Because no one really believed that this was important

00:08:17.376 --> 00:08:20.355
or meaningful except me and, like, one other guy.

00:08:20.355 --> 00:08:22.040
So we made a video to prove that

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.580
there's lots of stuff you can do.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.612
You can kind of sketch with Play-Doh

00:08:25.612 --> 00:08:29.546
and just Google for game controllers.

00:08:29.546 --> 00:08:32.233
Just ordinary Play-Doh, nothing special.
