I was there. She was peeling this palm frond apart,

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.427
these little threads off of it, and she'd roll the threads together

00:01:03.427 --> 00:01:06.145
and make little thicker threads, like strings,

00:01:06.145 --> 00:01:08.966
and she would weave the strings together,

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:12.446

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:21.115
of reality, kind of started to unravel in my mind,

00:01:21.115 --> 00:01:24.463

00:01:24.463 --> 00:01:26.847
and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener,

00:01:26.847 --> 00:01:30.980
everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock
