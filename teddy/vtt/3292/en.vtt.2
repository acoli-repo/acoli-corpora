00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:04.027
But Belle's story was a lie.

00:01:05.227 --> 00:01:06.761
Belle never had cancer.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:11.734
People shared her story
without ever checking if it was true.

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:16.035
This is a classic example
of confirmation bias.

00:01:16.403 --> 00:01:21.079
We accept a story uncritically
if it confirms what we'd like to be true.

00:01:21.484 --> 00:01:23.990
And we reject any story
that contradicts it.

00:01:24.937 --> 00:01:26.762
How often do we see this

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:29.831
in the stories
that we share and we ignore?

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:34.037
In politics, in business,
in health advice.
