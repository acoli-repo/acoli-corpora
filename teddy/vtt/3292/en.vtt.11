00:05:28.767 --> 00:05:30.282
How would you test it?

00:05:30.306 --> 00:05:33.568
Well, you'd propose other sets
of successive even numbers:

00:05:33.592 --> 00:05:36.910
4, 6, 8 or 12, 14, 16.

00:05:37.546 --> 00:05:40.346
And Peter would say these sets also work.

00:05:41.124 --> 00:05:43.688
But knowing that these sets also work,

00:05:43.712 --> 00:05:48.477
knowing that perhaps hundreds of sets
of successive even numbers also work,

00:05:48.501 --> 00:05:49.849
tells you nothing.

00:05:50.572 --> 00:05:53.930
Because this is still consistent
with rival theories.

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:58.094
Perhaps the rule
is any three even numbers.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.133
Or any three increasing numbers.
