00:03:58.141 --> 00:04:02.037
We share the outlier cases
because they are new,

00:04:02.061 --> 00:04:03.928
and therefore they are news.

00:04:04.657 --> 00:04:07.133
We never share the ordinary cases.

00:04:07.157 --> 00:04:10.370
They're too ordinary,
they're what normally happens.

00:04:11.125 --> 00:04:14.220
And that's the true
99 percent that we ignore.

00:04:14.244 --> 00:04:17.212
Just like in society, you can't just
listen to the one percent,

00:04:17.236 --> 00:04:18.394
the outliers,

00:04:18.418 --> 00:04:21.084
and ignore the 99 percent, the ordinary.

00:04:22.022 --> 00:04:25.276
Because that's the second example
of confirmation bias.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.069
We accept a fact as data.

00:04:29.038 --> 00:04:33.006
The biggest problem is not
that we live in a post-truth world;
