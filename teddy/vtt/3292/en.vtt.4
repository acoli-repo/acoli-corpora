Well, let's look at one of the most
fundamental techniques in statistics.

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.899
It's called Bayesian inference.

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.187
And the very simple version is this:

00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:12.479
We care about "does the data
support the theory?"

00:02:13.053 --> 00:02:16.509
Does the data increase our belief
that the theory is true?

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.903
But instead, we end up asking,
"Is the data consistent with the theory?"

00:02:22.838 --> 00:02:25.353
But being consistent with the theory

00:02:25.377 --> 00:02:28.306
does not mean that the data
supports the theory.

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:29.958
Why?

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:33.807
Because of a crucial
but forgotten third term --
