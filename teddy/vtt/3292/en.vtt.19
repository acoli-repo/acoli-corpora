00:09:29.029 --> 00:09:33.228
In a meeting, appoint someone
to be devil's advocate

00:09:33.252 --> 00:09:34.894
against your pet idea.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.291
And don't just hear another viewpoint --

00:09:38.315 --> 00:09:40.491
listen to it, as well.

00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:43.793
As psychologist Stephen Covey said,

00:09:43.817 --> 00:09:47.214
"Listen with the intent to understand,

00:09:47.238 --> 00:09:48.904
not the intent to reply."

00:09:49.642 --> 00:09:53.134
A dissenting viewpoint
is something to learn from

00:09:53.158 --> 00:09:54.706
not to argue against.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.556
Which takes us to the other
forgotten terms in Bayesian inference.
