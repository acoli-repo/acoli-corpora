00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:34.184
So test something, like 4, 12, 26.

00:06:34.938 --> 00:06:38.621
If you got a yes to that,
that would disprove your theory

00:06:38.645 --> 00:06:40.581
of successive even numbers.

00:06:41.232 --> 00:06:43.248
Yet this test is powerful,

00:06:43.272 --> 00:06:48.117
because if you got a no, it would rule out
"any three even numbers"

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:49.853
and "any three increasing numbers."

00:06:49.877 --> 00:06:53.218
It would rule out the rival theories,
but not rule out yours.

00:06:53.968 --> 00:06:58.762
But most people are too afraid
of testing the 4, 12, 26,

00:06:58.786 --> 00:07:02.949
because they don't want to get a yes
and prove their pet theory to be wrong.
