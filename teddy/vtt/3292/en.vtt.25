Evidence prevents the elites
from imposing their own view

00:12:34.219 --> 00:12:35.369
without proof.

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:39.077
A second reason
why experts are not trusted

00:12:39.101 --> 00:12:42.188
is that different experts
say different things.

00:12:42.212 --> 00:12:46.688
For every expert who claimed that leaving
the EU would be bad for Britain,

00:12:46.712 --> 00:12:49.141
another expert claimed it would be good.

00:12:49.165 --> 00:12:52.932
Half of these so-called experts
will be wrong.

00:12:53.774 --> 00:12:58.017
And I have to admit that most papers
written by experts are wrong.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.025
Or at best, make claims that
the evidence doesn't actually support.
