00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.908
Finding out that you're wrong

00:07:30.932 --> 00:07:33.665
is the only way to find out what's right.

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:37.600
Say you're a university
admissions director

00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:40.187
and your theory is that only
students with good grades

00:07:40.211 --> 00:07:41.974
from rich families do well.

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:44.529
So you only let in such students.

00:07:44.553 --> 00:07:45.703
And they do well.

00:07:46.482 --> 00:07:49.254
But that's also consistent
with the rival theory.

00:07:49.593 --> 00:07:52.340
Perhaps all students
with good grades do well,

00:07:52.364 --> 00:07:53.545
rich or poor.

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:58.037
But you never test that theory
because you never let in poor students

00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:00.861
because you don't want to be proven wrong.
