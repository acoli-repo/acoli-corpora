When you're at
the inflection points of life,

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.736
deciding on a strategy for your business,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.371
a parenting technique for your child

00:08:35.395 --> 00:08:37.823
or a regimen for your health,

00:08:37.847 --> 00:08:41.386
how do you ensure
that you don't have a story

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:42.878
but you have evidence?

00:08:44.268 --> 00:08:45.887
Let me give you three tips.

00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:50.625
The first is to actively seek
other viewpoints.

00:08:50.649 --> 00:08:54.243
Read and listen to people
you flagrantly disagree with.

00:08:54.267 --> 00:08:57.755
Ninety percent of what they say
may be wrong, in your view.

00:08:58.728 --> 00:09:00.861
But what if 10 percent is right?
