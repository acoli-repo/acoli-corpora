00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.133
Or any three increasing numbers.

00:06:02.365 --> 00:06:05.253
And that's the third example
of confirmation bias:

00:06:05.277 --> 00:06:08.966
accepting data as evidence,

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.990
even if it's consistent
with rival theories.

00:06:12.704 --> 00:06:15.656
Data is just a collection of facts.

00:06:16.402 --> 00:06:21.325
Evidence is data that supports
one theory and rules out others.

00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:25.148
So the best way to support your theory

00:06:25.172 --> 00:06:29.102
is actually to try to disprove it,
to play devil's advocate.

00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:34.184
So test something, like 4, 12, 26.
