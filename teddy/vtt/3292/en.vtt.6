"Is Belle's story consistent
with diet curing cancer?"

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.394
And the answer is yes.

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:07.942
If diet did cure cancer,
we'd see stories like Belle's.

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:11.688
But even if diet did not cure cancer,

00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:14.355
we'd still see stories like Belle's.

00:03:14.744 --> 00:03:19.934
A single story in which
a patient apparently self-cured

00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:23.132
just due to being misdiagnosed
in the first place.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.006
Just like, even if smoking
was bad for your health,

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.334
you'd still see one smoker
who lived until 100.
