00:11:26.847 --> 00:11:30.061
But gut feel can only get you so far.

00:11:30.736 --> 00:11:35.172
Gut feel would tell you never to give
water to a baby with diarrhea,

00:11:35.196 --> 00:11:37.514
because it would just
flow out the other end.

00:11:37.538 --> 00:11:40.116
Expertise tells you otherwise.

00:11:41.149 --> 00:11:44.577
You'd never trust your surgery
to the man on the street.

00:11:44.887 --> 00:11:48.474
You'd want an expert
who spent years doing surgery

00:11:48.498 --> 00:11:50.498
and knows the best techniques.

00:11:51.514 --> 00:11:54.647
But that should apply
to every major decision.

00:11:55.255 --> 00:11:59.811
Politics, business, health advice

00:11:59.835 --> 00:12:02.731
require expertise, just like surgery.
