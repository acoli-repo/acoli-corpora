Tip number three
is "pause before sharing anything."

00:16:04.907 --> 00:16:08.371
The Hippocratic oath says,
"First, do no harm."

00:16:09.046 --> 00:16:12.180
What we share is potentially contagious,

00:16:12.204 --> 00:16:15.887
so be very careful about what we spread.

00:16:16.632 --> 00:16:19.585
Our goal should not be
to get likes or retweets.

00:16:19.609 --> 00:16:23.594
Otherwise, we only share the consensus;
we don't challenge anyone's thinking.

00:16:24.085 --> 00:16:26.990
Otherwise, we only share what sounds good,

00:16:27.014 --> 00:16:29.414
regardless of whether it's evidence.
