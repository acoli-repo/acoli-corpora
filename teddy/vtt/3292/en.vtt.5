00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:33.807
Because of a crucial
but forgotten third term --

00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:37.389
the data could also be consistent
with rival theories.

00:02:37.918 --> 00:02:42.585
But due to confirmation bias,
we never consider the rival theories,

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.760
because we're so protective
of our own pet theory.

00:02:46.688 --> 00:02:49.101
Now, let's look at this for Belle's story.

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:53.339
Well, we care about:
Does Belle's story support the theory

00:02:53.363 --> 00:02:54.966
that diet cures cancer?

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.777
But instead, we end up asking,

00:02:56.801 --> 00:03:00.846
"Is Belle's story consistent
with diet curing cancer?"
