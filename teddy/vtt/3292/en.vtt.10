00:04:59.236 --> 00:05:01.593
But even if we had large-scale data,

00:05:01.617 --> 00:05:03.775
that might still not be enough.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.398
Because it could still be consistent
with rival theories.

00:05:08.136 --> 00:05:09.286
Let me explain.

00:05:10.072 --> 00:05:13.334
A classic study
by psychologist Peter Wason

00:05:13.358 --> 00:05:15.310
gives you a set of three numbers

00:05:15.334 --> 00:05:18.239
and asks you to think of the rule
that generated them.

00:05:18.585 --> 00:05:23.061
So if you're given two, four, six,

00:05:23.085 --> 00:05:24.235
what's the rule?

00:05:24.895 --> 00:05:28.114
Well, most people would think,
it's successive even numbers.

00:05:28.767 --> 00:05:30.282
How would you test it?
