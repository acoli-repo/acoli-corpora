and by ditching meat
for fruit and vegetables.

00:00:35.387 --> 00:00:37.587
And she made a complete recovery.

00:00:38.784 --> 00:00:40.363
Belle's story went viral.

00:00:40.387 --> 00:00:43.780
It was tweeted, blogged about,
shared and reached millions of people.

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:47.357
It showed the benefits of shunning
traditional medicine

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:48.848
for diet and exercise.

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:53.879
In August 2013, Belle launched
a healthy eating app,

00:00:53.903 --> 00:00:55.252
The Whole Pantry,

00:00:55.276 --> 00:00:59.299
downloaded 200,000 times
in the first month.
