00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Our mission is to build

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
a detailed, realistic

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
computer model of the human brain.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And we've done, in the past four years,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a proof of concept

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
on a small part of the rodent brain,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to reach the human brain.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Why are we doing this?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
There are three important reasons.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The first is, it's essential for us to understand the human brain

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
if we do want to get along in society,
