00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to talk to you today about my work on suspended animation.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now, usually when I mention suspended animation,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
people will flash me the Vulcan sign and laugh.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But now, I'm not talking about gorking people out

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to fly to Mars or even Pandora,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
as much fun as that may be.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm talking about

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the concept of using suspended animation

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to help people out in trauma.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So what do I mean

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
when I say "suspended animation"?
