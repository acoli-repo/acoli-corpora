00:00:28.773 --> 00:00:32.741
As the Roman Empire expanded,
it faced raids and invasions

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:36.862
from the semi-nomadic populations 
along its borders.

00:00:36.862 --> 00:00:41.649
Among the most powerful were
a Germanic people known as Goths

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.930
who were composed of two tribal groups,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.165
the Visigoths

00:00:45.165 --> 00:00:47.153
and Ostrogoths.

00:00:47.153 --> 00:00:50.303
While some of the Germanic tribes
remained Rome's enemies,

00:00:50.303 --> 00:00:55.563
the Empire incorporated others
into the imperial army.

00:00:55.563 --> 00:00:57.862
As the Roman Empire split in two,

00:00:57.862 --> 00:01:01.613
these tribal armies played
larger roles in its defense
