00:01:29.363 --> 00:01:31.264
and other Germanic tribes

00:01:31.264 --> 00:01:34.004
who assimilated into local cultures,

00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:38.177
though many of their names
still mark the map.

00:01:38.177 --> 00:01:40.638
This was the end of the Classical Period

00:01:40.638 --> 00:01:43.775
and the beginning of what many call
the Dark Ages.

00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:46.524
Although Roman culture was never
fully lost,

00:01:46.524 --> 00:01:50.554
its influence declined
and new art styles arose

00:01:50.554 --> 00:01:53.705
focused on religious symbolism
and allegory

00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:56.605
rather than proportion and realism.

00:01:56.605 --> 00:01:58.805
This shift extended to architecture

00:01:58.805 --> 00:02:04.487
with the construction of the Abbey
of Saint Denis in France in 1137.
