00:02:36.986 --> 00:02:40.116
Writing in his 1550 book, 
"Lives of the Artists,"

00:02:40.116 --> 00:02:45.127
Giorgio Vasari was the first
to describe it as Gothic,

00:02:45.127 --> 00:02:47.526
a derogatory reference to the Barbarians

00:02:47.526 --> 00:02:50.847
thought to have destroyed 
Classical civilization.

superstition, and simplicity.
