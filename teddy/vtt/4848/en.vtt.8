00:03:59.678 --> 00:04:03.400
Taking cues from artists like
The Doors and The Velvet Underground,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.679
British post-punk groups,

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:05.868
like Joy Division,

00:04:05.868 --> 00:04:06.739
Bauhaus,

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:07.750
and The Cure,

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.419
combined gloomy lyrics 
and punk dissonance

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:13.599
with imagery inspired 
by the Victorian era,

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:14.720
classic horror,

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.949
and androgynous glam fashion.

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.599
By the early 1980s, similar bands
were consistently described

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.471
as Gothic rock by the music press,

00:04:24.471 --> 00:04:28.089
and the stye's popularity brought it
out of dimly lit clubs

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:31.130
to major labels and MTV.
