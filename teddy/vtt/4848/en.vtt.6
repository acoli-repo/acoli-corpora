But time marched on,
as did what was considered fashionable.

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.248
In the 1700s, a period called
the Enlightenment came about,

00:03:09.248 --> 00:03:13.357
which valued scientific reason 
above all else.

00:03:13.357 --> 00:03:17.169
Reacting against that, Romantic authors
like Goethe and Byron

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:21.068
sought idealized visions of a past
of natural landscapes

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:24.227
and mysterious spiritual forces.

00:03:24.227 --> 00:03:27.588
Here, the word Gothic 
was repurposed again

00:03:27.588 --> 00:03:33.388
to describe a literary genre that
emerged as a darker strain of Romanticism.
