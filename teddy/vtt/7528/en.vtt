00:00:00.796 --> 00:00:03.436
So what do you think of
when you think of the ocean?

00:00:03.756 --> 00:00:05.676
Maybe you think of a visit to the beach

00:00:05.676 --> 00:00:08.956
or whales or sharks or coral reefs?

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:10.956
I think of this.

00:00:10.956 --> 00:00:13.636
This is the San Juan Islands
in Washington state.

00:00:13.676 --> 00:00:16.516
They jut out of an expanse
of deep dark water,

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:19.596
and they're filled with life
and mystery and opportunity.

00:00:20.116 --> 00:00:22.836
But whatever you think of,
the ocean is much more.

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:27.276
It is a complex physical, chemical
and biological system

00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:29.796
that takes up 70 percent of our planet.

00:00:29.836 --> 00:00:32.796
And yet we're still really
just beginning to understand it.
