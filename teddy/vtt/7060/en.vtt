Chris Anderson: This is such
a strange thing.

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.817
Your software, Linux,
is in millions of computers,

00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:10.388
it probably powers much of the Internet.

00:00:10.412 --> 00:00:12.175
And I think that there are, like,

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.544
a billion and a half active
Android devices out there.

00:00:15.568 --> 00:00:18.169
Your software is in every
single one of them.

00:00:18.808 --> 00:00:19.958
It's kind of amazing.

00:00:19.982 --> 00:00:25.017
You must have some amazing
software headquarters driving all this.

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:28.347
That's what I thought -- and I was shocked
when I saw a picture of it.

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:29.571
I mean, this is --

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:31.845
this is the Linux world headquarters.
