00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And now [these] new elements of human intolerance

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
for river creatures like the gharial

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
means that if they don't drown in the net,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
then they simply cut their beaks off.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Animals like the Ganges river dolphin

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
which is just down to a few left,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and it is also critically endangered.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So, who is next? Us?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Because we are all dependent on these water sources.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
So, we all know about the Narmada river,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
the tragedies of dams, the tragedies of huge projects

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
which displace people and wreck river systems

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
without providing livelihoods.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And development just basically going berserk,
