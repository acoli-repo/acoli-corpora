00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to withstand 5 to 10 [meters of rainfall],

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
in order that the eggs can incubate over the next 90 days,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and hatch into little baby king cobras.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So, she protects her eggs,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and after three months,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
the babies finally do hatch out.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
A majority of them will die, of course. There is very high mortality

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
in little baby reptiles who are just 10 to 12 inches long.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
My first experience with king cobras was in '72

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
at a magical place called Agumbe,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
in Karnataka, this state.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And it is a marvelous rain forest.
