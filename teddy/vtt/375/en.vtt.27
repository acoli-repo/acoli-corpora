00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And development just basically going berserk,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
for a double figure growth index, basically.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
So, we're not sure where this story is going to end,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
whether it's got a happy or sad ending.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And climate change is certainly going

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
to turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
We're still working hard at it.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
We've got a lot of a good team of people working up there.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And the thing is, you know, the decision makers,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
the folks in power,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
they're up in their bungalows and so on in Delhi,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
in the city capitals. They are all supplied with plenty of water. It's cool.
