00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
For example, in the winter of 2007 and 2008,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
there was this incredible die-off of gharial, in the Chambal River.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Suddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river, dead.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Why? How could it happen?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
This is a relatively clean river.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
The Chambal, if you look at it, has clear water.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
People scoop water out of the Chambal and drink it,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
something you wouldn't do in most north Indian rivers.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
So, in order to try to find out the answer to this,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
we got veterinarians from all over the world

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
working with Indian vets to try to figure out what was happening.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside.
