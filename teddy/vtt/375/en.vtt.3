00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
of course, arriving in India 60 years ago,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
brought by my mother, Doris Norden,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and my stepfather, Rama Chattopadhyaya.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It's been a roller coaster ride.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Two animals, two iconic reptiles

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
really captivated me very early on.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
One of them was the remarkable gharial.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
This crocodile, which grows to almost 20 feet long

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
in the northern rivers,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and this charismatic snake, the king cobra.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
What my purpose of the talk today really is,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
is to sort of indelibly scar your minds

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
with these charismatic and majestic creatures.
