00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
But in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
[it was necessary] for us to actually insert

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
a small radio transmitter inside [each] snake.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
where the babies go after they hatch,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and remarkable things like this you're about to see.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
This was just a few days ago in Agumbe.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I had the pleasure of being close to this large king cobra

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
who had caught a venomous pit viper.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And it does it in such a way that it doesn't get bitten itself.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And king cobras feed only on snakes.
