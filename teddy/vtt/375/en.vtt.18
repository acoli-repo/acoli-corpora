when conservation was at the fore,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
we were actually able to start projects which were

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
basically government supported

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
to collect eggs from the wild from the few remaining nests

and release 5,000 baby gharial

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this.

I mean, just incredible to see bunches of gharial

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
basking on the river again.

But complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And, sure enough, with all the other pressures on the river,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
like sand mining, for example,
