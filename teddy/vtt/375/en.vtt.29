00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
So, we can do it.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
But if you stroll down to the Yamuna

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
or to the Gomati in Lucknow,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
or to the Adyar river in Chennai,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
or the Mula-Mutha river in Pune,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
just see what we're capable of doing to a river. It's sad.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
But I think the final note really is

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
that we can do it.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
The corporates, the artists, the wildlife nuts,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
the good old everyday folks

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
can actually bring these rivers back.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And the final word is

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
that there is a king cobra looking over our shoulders.
