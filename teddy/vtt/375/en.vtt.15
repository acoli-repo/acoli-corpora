00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And what do we do? How do we respond to this?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Well, basically, we dam it, we pollute it,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
we pour in pesticides, weedicides, fungicides.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
You drink it in peril of your life.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And the thing is, it's not just big industry.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
It's not misguided river engineers

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
who are doing all this; it's us.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
It seems that our citizens find the best way to dispose of garbage

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
are in water sources.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Okay. Now we're going north, very far north.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
North central India, the Chambal River

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
is where we have our base.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
This is the home of the gharial, this incredible crocodile.
