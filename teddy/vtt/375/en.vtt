I want you to put off your preconceptions,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
your preconceived fears and thoughts about reptiles.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Because that is the only way I'm going to get my story across to you.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And by the way, if I come across as a sort of

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
rabid, hippie conservationist,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
it's purely a figment of your imagination.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
(Laughter)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Okay. We are actually the first species on Earth

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
to be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival.
