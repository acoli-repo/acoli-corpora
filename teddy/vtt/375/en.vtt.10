00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And it does it in such a way that it doesn't get bitten itself.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And king cobras feed only on snakes.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
This [little snake] was kind of a tid-bit for it,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
what we'd call a "vadai" or a donut or something like that.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
(Laughter)

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Usually they eat something a bit larger.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
In this case a rather strange and inexplicable

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
activity happened over the last breeding season,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
wherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
didn't mate with it, actually killed it and swallowed it.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
We're still trying to explain and come to terms with

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
what is the evolutionary advantage of this.
