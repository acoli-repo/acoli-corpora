00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and of course, having a good time too.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
You can almost hear the drums

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
throbbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we're there.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000

They are fascinated with snakes. They haven't got

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
that steely thing that you end up

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
either fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way.
