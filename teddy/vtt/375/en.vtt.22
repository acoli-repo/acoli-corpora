00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And we actually looked through

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
all their organs and tried to figure out what was going on.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And it came down to something called gout,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
which, as a result of kidney breakdown

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
is actually uric acid crystals throughout the body,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and worse in the joints,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
which made the gharial unable to swim.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And it's a horribly painful death.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Just downriver from the Chambal is the

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
filthy Yamuna river, the sacred Yamuna river.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And I hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it
