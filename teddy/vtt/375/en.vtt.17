00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
But we, actually, back in the early '70s,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
did surveys,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and found that gharial were extremely rare.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
In fact, if you see the map,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
the range of their original habitat

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
to the Irrawaddy in Burma.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And now it's just limited to a couple of spots

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
in Nepal and India.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So, in fact at this point

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
there are only 200 breeding gharial left in the wild.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So, starting in the mid-'70s

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
when conservation was at the fore,
