Now, what are we doing with all this information?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
What's the point of all this?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Well, the king cobra is literally

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
a keystone species in these rainforests.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And our job is to convince the authorities

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
that these forests have to be protected.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And this is one of the ways we do it,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
by learning as much as we can

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
about something so remarkable and so iconic in the rainforests there,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
in order to help protect trees, animals

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and of course the water sources.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
You've all heard, perhaps, of Project Tiger

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
which started back in the early '70s,
