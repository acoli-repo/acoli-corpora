00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So, the tiger is the icon.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And now the king cobra is a new one.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
All the major rivers in south India

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
are sourced in the Western Ghats,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
the chain of hills running along the west coast of India.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
It pours out millions of gallons every hour,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and washes many, many babies,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and of course feeds many, many animals,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
both domestic and wild,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
produces thousands of tons of rice.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And what do we do? How do we respond to this?
