00:13:28.589 --> 00:13:30.035
to hear the word of God."

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:31.976
And they said, "No."

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.976
(Laughter)

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.164
Well, then they didn't look so
fresh-faced and cute to me any more,

00:13:38.188 --> 00:13:39.393
but they had more to say.

00:13:39.417 --> 00:13:42.151
They said, "Well, we also believe
that if you're a Mormon,

00:13:42.175 --> 00:13:44.389
and if you're in good standing
with the church,

00:13:44.413 --> 00:13:46.549
when you die, you get to go to heaven

00:13:46.573 --> 00:13:49.354
and be with your family for all eternity."

00:13:49.378 --> 00:13:51.436
And I said, "Oh, dear.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:58.364
(Laughter)

00:13:58.388 --> 00:14:00.587
That wouldn't be
such a good incentive for me."
