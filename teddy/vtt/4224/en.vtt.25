00:12:29.099 --> 00:12:30.651
and this crazy gold plate story,

00:12:30.675 --> 00:12:33.509
but the truth was,
I hadn't really thought this through,

00:12:33.533 --> 00:12:35.731
so I backpedaled a little and I said,

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:38.642
"Well, what exactly
do you mean by 'righteous'?

00:12:38.666 --> 00:12:42.126
And what do you mean by prophets?
Like, could the prophets be women?"

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.696
And they said, "No." And I said, "Why?"

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.439
And they said, "Well, it's because
God gave women a gift

00:12:49.463 --> 00:12:51.434
that is so spectacular,

00:12:51.458 --> 00:12:56.235
it is so wonderful, that the only gift
he had left over to give men

00:12:56.259 --> 00:12:57.878
was the gift of prophecy."

00:12:58.656 --> 00:13:01.979
What is this wonderful gift
God gave women, I wondered?
