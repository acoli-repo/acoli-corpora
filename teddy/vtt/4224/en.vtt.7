00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.935
I left the kitchen not really
in shock about Santa,

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.660
but rather, I was just dumbfounded

00:03:34.684 --> 00:03:37.728
about how I could have missed
this whole age of reason thing.

00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:40.976
It was too late for me,
but maybe I could help someone else,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.976
someone who could use the information.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.173
They had to fit two criteria:

00:03:45.197 --> 00:03:47.538
they had to be old enough
to be able to understand

00:03:47.562 --> 00:03:50.733
the whole concept of the age
of reason, and not yet seven.

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:53.976
The answer was clear:
my brother Bill. He was six.

00:03:54.277 --> 00:03:55.539
Well, I finally found Bill

00:03:55.563 --> 00:03:58.772
about a block away from our house
at this public school playground.

00:03:58.796 --> 00:04:00.912
It was a Saturday,
and he was all by himself,
