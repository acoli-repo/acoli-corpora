00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:01.286
that it dawned on me:

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.833
I wasn't turning seven
when I thought I turned seven.

00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:05.103
I had a whole other month

00:07:05.127 --> 00:07:08.865
to do anything I wanted to
before God started keeping tabs on me.

00:07:09.238 --> 00:07:11.476
Oh, life can be so cruel.

00:07:13.317 --> 00:07:16.715
One day, two Mormon
missionaries came to my door.

00:07:17.192 --> 00:07:19.828
Now, I just live off a main
thoroughfare in Los Angeles,

00:07:19.852 --> 00:07:22.151
and my block is -- well,
it's a natural beginning

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:24.564
for people who are peddling
things door to door.

00:07:24.588 --> 00:07:27.976
Sometimes I get little old ladies
from the Seventh Day Adventist Church

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.162
showing me these cartoon
pictures of heaven.
