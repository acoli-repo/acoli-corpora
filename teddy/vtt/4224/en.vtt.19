00:09:28.862 --> 00:09:30.933
like that was the right answer.

00:09:30.957 --> 00:09:32.640
And then they said, "Do you believe

00:09:32.664 --> 00:09:35.111
that we're all brothers
and sisters on this planet?"

00:09:35.135 --> 00:09:36.286
And I said, "Yes, I do."

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.662
And I was so relieved that it was
a question I could answer so quickly.

00:09:39.686 --> 00:09:42.777
And they said, "Well, then
we have a story to tell you."

00:09:42.801 --> 00:09:45.976
And they told me this story
all about this guy named Lehi,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.503
who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC.

00:09:48.907 --> 00:09:53.456
Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC,
everyone was completely bad and evil.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.976
Every single one of them:
man, woman, child, infant, fetus.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.636
And God came to Lehi and said to him,

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.545
"Put your family on a boat
and I will lead you out of here."
