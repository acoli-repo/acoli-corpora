that instead of Santa
delivering our presents

00:02:31.544 --> 00:02:33.083
over the night of Christmas Eve,

00:02:33.107 --> 00:02:36.222
like he did for every other family
who got to open their surprises

00:02:36.246 --> 00:02:37.692
first thing Christmas morning,

00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:39.683
our family would give Santa more time.

00:02:39.707 --> 00:02:43.286
Santa would come to our house
while we were at nine o'clock high mass

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.976
on Christmas morning, but only
if all of us kids did not make a fuss.

00:02:47.302 --> 00:02:49.195
Which made me very suspicious.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.071
It was pretty obvious that it was really
our parents giving us the presents.

00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:56.976
I mean, my dad had a very
distinctive wrapping style,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.649
and my mother's handwriting
was so close to Santa's.

00:02:59.673 --> 00:03:00.831
(Laughter)
