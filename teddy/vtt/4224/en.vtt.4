I mean, Santa Claus knows
if you're naughty or nice, right?"

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.976
And my dad said, "Yeah, but, honey,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.265
I think that's technically just
between Thanksgiving and Christmas."

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.701

00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:17.061

not that upsetting to me.

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:26.865
My parents had this whole
elaborate story about Santa Claus:

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.395
how they had talked to Santa Claus
himself and agreed

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:31.520
that instead of Santa
delivering our presents
