00:05:28.024 --> 00:05:30.143
and my mother even had
another child to come,

00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:32.672
so what I think she --
understandably -- really meant

00:05:32.696 --> 00:05:35.071
was that she was so ready,
she was so ready.

00:05:35.095 --> 00:05:36.769
Then she said, "Don't worry, Julie.

00:05:36.793 --> 00:05:38.262
Every year on October 10th,

00:05:38.286 --> 00:05:41.136
when it was your birthday
but you didn't realize it,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.976
I made sure that you ate
a piece of cake that day."

00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:47.228
(Laughter)

00:05:47.252 --> 00:05:49.546
Which was comforting, but troubling.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.109
My mother had been celebrating
my birthday with me, without me.

00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:54.141
(Laughter)

00:05:54.165 --> 00:05:57.154
What was so upsetting
about this new piece of information

00:05:57.178 --> 00:05:59.853
was not that I had to change
the date of my slumber party

00:05:59.877 --> 00:06:01.179
with all of my girlfriends.
