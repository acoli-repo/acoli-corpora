00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.162
showing me these cartoon
pictures of heaven.

00:07:30.186 --> 00:07:32.426
And sometimes I get
teenagers who promise me

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.305
that they won't join a gang
and just start robbing people,

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:38.087
if I only buy some
magazine subscriptions from them.

00:07:38.556 --> 00:07:42.976
So normally, I just ignore the doorbell,
but on this day, I answered.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.285
And there stood two boys, each about 19,
in white, starched short-sleeved shirts,

00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:49.769
and they had little name tags

00:07:49.793 --> 00:07:52.086
that identified them
as official representatives

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.911
of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints,

00:07:54.935 --> 00:07:57.751
and they said they had
a message for me, from God.

00:07:58.629 --> 00:08:03.824
I said, "A message for me? From God?"
And they said, "Yes."
