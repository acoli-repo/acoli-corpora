00:00:29.742 --> 00:00:30.902
But more importantly,

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:33.871
being seven means that
you've reached the age of reason,

00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:38.422
and you're now capable of committing
any and all sins against God and man."

00:00:38.446 --> 00:00:41.298
(Laughter)

00:00:41.322 --> 00:00:44.548
Now, I had heard this phrase,
"age of reason," before.

00:00:44.572 --> 00:00:46.823
Sister Mary Kevin
had been bandying it about

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:48.544
my second-grade class at school.

00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:49.720
But when she said it,

00:00:49.744 --> 00:00:52.805
the phrase seemed all caught up
in the excitement of preparations

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.136
for our first communion
and our first confession,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.986
and everybody knew that was really
all about the white dress

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.161
and the white veil.

00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:01.825
And anyway, I hadn't really paid
all that much attention
