00:11:59.742 --> 00:12:02.583
(Laughter)

00:12:02.607 --> 00:12:03.767
I wanted to say --

00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:05.457
(Applause)

00:12:05.481 --> 00:12:07.747
"Ok, don't start with this story."

00:12:07.771 --> 00:12:08.976
(Laughter)

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.043

00:12:23.749 --> 00:12:25.289
through his righteous prophets?"

00:12:25.313 --> 00:12:26.566
And I said, "No, I don't,"

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.074
because I was sort of upset
about this Lamanite story

00:12:29.099 --> 00:12:30.651
and this crazy gold plate story,
