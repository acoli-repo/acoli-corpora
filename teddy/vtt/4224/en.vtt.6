(Laughter)

00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:03.588
Plus, why would Santa save time
by having to loop back

00:03:03.612 --> 00:03:06.365
to our house after he'd gone
to everybody else's?

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.510
There was only one obvious conclusion
to reach from this mountain of evidence:

00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:15.047
our family was too strange and weird
for even Santa Claus to come visit,

00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:18.326
and my poor parents were trying
to protect us from the embarrassment,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.111
this humiliation of rejection
by Santa, who was jolly --

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:24.786
but let's face it,
he was also very judgmental.

00:03:25.214 --> 00:03:27.777
So to find out that there was
no Santa Claus at all

00:03:27.801 --> 00:03:29.506
was actually sort of a relief.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.935
I left the kitchen not really
in shock about Santa,
