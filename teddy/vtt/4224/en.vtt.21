00:10:27.344 --> 00:10:30.794
and the Nephites were totally good --
each and every one of them --

00:10:30.818 --> 00:10:32.985
and the Lamanites
were totally bad and evil --

00:10:33.009 --> 00:10:35.160
every single one of them
just bad to the bone.

00:10:35.184 --> 00:10:38.692
Then, after Jesus died
on the cross for our sins,

00:10:38.716 --> 00:10:39.883
on his way up to heaven,

00:10:39.907 --> 00:10:42.480
he stopped by America
and visited the Nephites.

00:10:42.504 --> 00:10:43.530
(Laughter)

00:10:43.554 --> 00:10:47.042
And he told them that if they all remained
totally, totally good --

00:10:47.066 --> 00:10:48.448
each and every one of them --

00:10:48.472 --> 00:10:51.173
they would win the war
against the evil Lamanites.

00:10:51.197 --> 00:10:53.698
But apparently somebody blew it,

00:10:53.722 --> 00:10:56.459
because the Lamanites
were able to kill all the Nephites.

00:10:56.483 --> 00:10:58.749
All but one guy, this guy named Mormon,

00:10:58.773 --> 00:11:01.519
who managed to survive
by hiding in the woods.
