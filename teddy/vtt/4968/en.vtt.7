00:03:28.935 --> 00:03:31.655
her writhing sets the trap off repeatedly,

00:03:31.655 --> 00:03:34.295
each time bringing her deeper 
into the plant

00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:38.135
to be digested alive bit by bit.

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:42.375
Meanwhile, this beetle is bewitched by 
sweet-smelling nectar.

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:44.735
The scent draws him closer and closer

00:03:44.735 --> 00:03:50.145
until he lands on the leaves of the 
world’s most infamous carnivorous plant.

00:03:50.145 --> 00:03:54.335
His landing triggers tiny hairs on the 
surface of the leaves,

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:58.725
and the jaws of the venus fly trap 
snap shut around him.

00:03:58.725 --> 00:04:01.795
The spikes interlock to seal his fate.
