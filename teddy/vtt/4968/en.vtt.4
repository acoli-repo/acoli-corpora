00:01:57.726 --> 00:02:02.113
The second victim faces off with the 
sticky sundew plant.

00:02:02.113 --> 00:02:08.034
The sundew’s tiny leaves are equipped with
a viscous secretion called mucilage.

00:02:08.034 --> 00:02:11.094
The ant is swiftly trapped in this goo.

00:02:11.094 --> 00:02:15.134
As she struggles, enzymes begin 
to digest her body.

00:02:15.138 --> 00:02:19.428
Special tentacles sense her movement 
and curl around her,

00:02:19.428 --> 00:02:22.004
clenching her in their suffocating grip.

00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:23.484
Once she asphyxiates,

00:02:23.484 --> 00:02:25.784
which can happen in under an hour,

00:02:25.784 --> 00:02:30.384
the tentacles unfurl again 
to snare their next victim.
