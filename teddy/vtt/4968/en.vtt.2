00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:01.728
In these hostile conditions,

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:05.918
plants that are able to lure, trap, 
and digest prey

00:01:05.918 --> 00:01:10.667
have an advantage over those that rely 
on soil for their nutrients.

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:13.285
Take this inhospitable bog,

00:01:13.285 --> 00:01:15.795
where pitcher plants reign supreme.

00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:19.385
Drawn to the pitcher’s vivid colors 
and alluring scent,

00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:22.715
the fly closes in and slurps its nectar.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:27.655
But this pitcher species has an ingredient
called coniine in its nectar,

00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:30.705
a powerful narcotic to insects.
