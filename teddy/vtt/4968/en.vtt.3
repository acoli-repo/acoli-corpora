00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:30.705
a powerful narcotic to insects.

00:01:30.705 --> 00:01:32.735
As the coniine takes effect,

00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:37.235
the fly grows sluggish, stumbles, 
and falls down the funnel

00:01:37.235 --> 00:01:39.691
into a pool of liquid at the base,

00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:41.981
where he drowns.

00:01:41.981 --> 00:01:46.261
Enzymes and bacteria in the liquid slowly
break his body down

00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:51.899
into microscopic particles the pitcher 
plant can consume through its leaves.

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:52.646
Occasionally,

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:57.726
larger prey also tumbles into the 
fatal funnel of the pitcher plant.

00:01:57.726 --> 00:02:02.113
The second victim faces off with the 
sticky sundew plant.
