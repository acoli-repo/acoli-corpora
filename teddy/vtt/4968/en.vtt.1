00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:30.571
that supplement a regular 
diet of sunlight, water, and soil

00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:35.758
with insects, microbes, 
or even frogs and rats.

00:00:35.758 --> 00:00:40.338
Scientists believe that carnivory in 
plants evolved separately

00:00:40.338 --> 00:00:42.923
at least six times on our planet,

00:00:42.923 --> 00:00:45.943
suggesting that this flesh-munching 
adaptation

00:00:45.943 --> 00:00:48.873
holds a major benefit for plants.

00:00:48.873 --> 00:00:53.413
Carnivorous plants tend to grow in places 
with highly acidic soil,

00:00:53.413 --> 00:00:59.411
which is poor in crucial nutrients 
like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.

00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:01.728
In these hostile conditions,
