The spikes interlock to seal his fate.

00:04:01.795 --> 00:04:02.825
Once closed,

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:08.915
the leaves act like an external stomach
that digests the beetle’s soft tissues.

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.195
When they open again a few days later,

00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:15.385
only the dry husk of his 
exoskeleton remains.

00:04:15.385 --> 00:04:18.854
The mayfly is the last creature standing.

00:04:18.854 --> 00:04:21.504
As she approaches the butterwort plant,

00:04:21.504 --> 00:04:27.374
she heads for the flowers that wave high
above the plant’s globs of adhesive goo.

00:04:27.374 --> 00:04:32.600
She alights on the petals, drinks the 
nectar, and takes off unscathed.
