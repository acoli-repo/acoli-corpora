00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What I'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm not going to talk about "The Skeptical Environmentalist" --

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
probably that's also a good choice.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
(Laughter)

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But I am going talk about: what are the big problems in the world?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And I must say, before I go on, I should ask every one of you

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to try and get out pen and paper

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
because I'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So get out your pen and paper.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Bottom line is, there is a lot of problems out there in the world.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm just going to list some of them.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
There are 800 million people starving.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There's a billion people without clean drinking water.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Two billion people without sanitation.
