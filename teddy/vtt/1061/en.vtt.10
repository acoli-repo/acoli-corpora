00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and interact with adjacent nerves,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and they start releasing their neurotransmitters,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and those neurotransmitters spill out

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and activate adjacent glial cells, and so on and so forth,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
until what we have

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
is a positive feedback loop.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
It's almost as if somebody came into your home

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and rewired your walls

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
so that the next time you turned on the light switch,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
the toilet flushed three doors down,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
or your dishwasher went on,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
or your computer monitor turned off.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
That's crazy,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
but that's, in fact, what happens

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
with chronic pain.
