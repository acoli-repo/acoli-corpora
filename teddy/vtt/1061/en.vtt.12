00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
We take nerves that are noisy and active

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that should be quiet,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And most importantly, what we do

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
is we use a rigorous, and often uncomfortable, process

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
of physical therapy and occupational therapy

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
to retrain the nerves in the nervous system

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
to respond normally

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
to the activities and sensory experiences

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
that are part of everyday life.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And we support all of that

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
with an intensive psychotherapy program

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
to address the despondency, despair and depression
