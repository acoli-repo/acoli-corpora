00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
with chronic pain.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And that's why pain becomes its own disease.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
The nervous system has plasticity.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It changes, and it morphs

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
in response to stimuli.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Well, what do we do about that?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
What can we do in a case like Chandler's?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
at this point in time.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
We treat them with symptom-modifying drugs --

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
painkillers --

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
which are, frankly, not very effective

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
for this kind of pain.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
We take nerves that are noisy and active

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that should be quiet,
