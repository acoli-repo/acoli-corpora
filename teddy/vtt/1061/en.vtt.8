00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
But the situation, of course, in the human body

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
is far more complicated than that.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Instead of it being the case

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
that that junction box in the spinal cord

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
by releasing these little brown packets

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
of chemical information called neurotransmitters

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
in a linear one-on-one fashion,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
in fact, what happens

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions --

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
laterally, vertically, up and down in the spinal cord --

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and they start interacting

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
with other adjacent cells.
