00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the touch of a hand,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
the touch even of a sleeve, of a garment, as she put it on --

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
caused excruciating, burning pain.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
is hardwired like your house.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
In your house, wires run in the wall,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling
