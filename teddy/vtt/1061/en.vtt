00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
so I put children to sleep for a living.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
(Laughter)

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I'm an academic, so I put audiences to sleep for free.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
(Laughter)

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But what I actually mostly do

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is I manage the pain management service

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
at the Packard Children's Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And it's from the experience

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
from about 20 or 25 years of doing that

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that I want to bring to you the message this morning,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that pain is a disease.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now most of the time,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
you think of pain as a symptom of a disease,
