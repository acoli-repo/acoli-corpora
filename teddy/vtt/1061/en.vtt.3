00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
if I were to stroke it with this feather,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but your brain was telling you

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that this is what you are feeling --

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
In fact, imagine something even worse.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Imagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and their brain [was] telling them

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that they were feeling this hot torch.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
That was the experience of my patient, Chandler,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
whom you see in the photograph.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
As you can see, she's a beautiful, young woman.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
She was 16 years old last year when I met her,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and she aspired to be a professional dancer.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist.
