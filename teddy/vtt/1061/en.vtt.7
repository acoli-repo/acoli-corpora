from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and from the junction box to the light bulb.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And when you turn the switch on, the light goes on.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And when you turn the switch off, the light goes off.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
If you hit your thumb with a hammer,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
these wires in your arm -- that, of course, we call nerves --

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
where new wires, new nerves,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
take the information up to the brain

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
But the situation, of course, in the human body
