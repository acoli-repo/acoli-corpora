00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and what we can do about it,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I want to show you how it feels for my patients.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000

Now what does it have to do with chronic pain?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Imagine, if you will, these two ideas together.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Imagine what your life would be like

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
if I were to stroke it with this feather,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
