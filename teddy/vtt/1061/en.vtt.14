00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that new drugs will be developed

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
that are not symptom-modifying drugs

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
that simply mask the problem,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
as we have now,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
but that will be disease-modifying drugs

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
that will actually go right to the root of the problem

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and attack those glial cells,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
or those pernicious proteins

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that the glial cells elaborate,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
or plasticity,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
that so is capable

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
of distorting and amplifying

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the sensory experience that we call pain.
