00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now you would probably imagine, as she did,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that a wrist sprain is a trivial event

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
in a person's life.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Wrap it in an ACE bandage,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000

This is what her arm looked like

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
You can see that the arm is discolored,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
purplish in color.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It was cadaverically cold to the touch.
