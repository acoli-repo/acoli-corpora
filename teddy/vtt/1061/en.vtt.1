00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now most of the time,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
you think of pain as a symptom of a disease,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and that's true most of the time.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's the symptom of a tumor or an infection

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
or an inflammation or an operation.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But about 10 percent of the time,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
after the patient has recovered from one of those events,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
pain persists.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It persists for months

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and oftentimes for years,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and when that happens,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it is its own disease.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and what we can do about it,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I want to show you how it feels for my patients.
