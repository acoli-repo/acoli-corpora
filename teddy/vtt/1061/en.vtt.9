00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
with other adjacent cells.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
These cells, called glial cells,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
were once thought to be

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
that did nothing more than hold all the important things together,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
like the nerves.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
But it turns out

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
the glial cells have a vital role

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
in the modulation, amplification

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and, in the case of pain, the distortion

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
of sensory experiences.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
These glial cells become activated.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
which spill out

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and interact with adjacent nerves,
