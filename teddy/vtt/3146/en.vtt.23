00:11:28.244 --> 00:11:30.688
And as the conversation shifted
to our pediatrician,

00:11:30.712 --> 00:11:34.410
I saw Sarah and Becky's interaction
continue, and it went something like this.

00:11:34.434 --> 00:11:38.412
Becky, shaking her head "no"
and mouthing the word "mom."

00:11:38.902 --> 00:11:43.299
Sarah, shaking her head "no"
and mouthing the word "no, dad."

00:11:43.323 --> 00:11:44.863
(Laughter)

00:11:45.657 --> 00:11:46.807
Awkward, right?

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:49.712
So this went back and forth
in total silence a few more times

00:11:49.736 --> 00:11:51.136
until we walked away.

00:11:51.617 --> 00:11:53.641
Now, this interaction has stuck with me.

00:11:53.665 --> 00:11:55.815
Sarah could have chosen option one,

00:11:55.839 --> 00:11:58.906
ignored Becky, and let her
refer to me as mom.

00:11:59.228 --> 00:12:01.252
It would have been easier for Sarah.
