00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:37.512
Yeah, alright.

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:39.900
And over the past two years,

00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:41.931
this kid has forced me
to rethink the world

00:00:41.955 --> 00:00:43.431
and how I participate in it.

00:00:43.455 --> 00:00:47.644

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.911

00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:52.361
(Applause)

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.234
(Cheering)

00:00:54.258 --> 00:00:59.744
(Applause)

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:03.348
As you can see, I took
this year's theme super literal.
