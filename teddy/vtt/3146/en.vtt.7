00:03:28.315 --> 00:03:31.728
and I've drawn this map
to help illustrate my options.

00:03:31.752 --> 00:03:33.363
(Laughter)

00:03:33.387 --> 00:03:36.283
So, option one is to ignore the assumption

00:03:36.307 --> 00:03:39.247
and allow folks to continue
to refer to me as "mom,"

00:03:39.271 --> 00:03:41.224
which is not awkward for the other party,

00:03:41.248 --> 00:03:43.585
but is typically really awkward for us.

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.901
And it usually causes me to restrict
my interaction with those people.

00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:48.680
Option one.

00:03:48.704 --> 00:03:51.974
Option two is to stop and correct them

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:53.171
and say something like,

00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:56.315
"Actually, I'm Elliot's dad"
or "Elliot calls me 'daddy.'"

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:59.256
And when I do this, one or two
of the following things happen.

00:03:59.624 --> 00:04:02.917
Folks take it in stride
and say something like, "Oh, OK."
