the outside world doesn't think,
"Oh, that's a cute gender-neutral baby."

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:15.646
They think, "Oh, what a cute boy."

00:07:16.537 --> 00:07:20.252

and my parenting world collided hard.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.315

for my child to experience.

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:26.578

environment for her to explore

00:07:26.602 --> 00:07:28.180
and make sense of in her own way.

00:07:28.204 --> 00:07:31.244
We even picked a gender-neutral name
for our female-born child.
