WEBVTT

00:07:58.577 --> 00:08:01.117
We value femininity and masculinity

00:08:01.141 --> 00:08:03.124
while also being highly critical of it.

00:08:03.148 --> 00:08:06.486
And do our best to not make her feel
limited by gender roles.

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:08.304
And we do all this in hopes

00:08:08.328 --> 00:08:11.922
that we model a healthy and empowered
relationship with gender for our kid.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.847
Now this work to develop a healthy
relationship with gender for Elliot

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:19.736
made me rethink and evaluate
how I allowed sexism to manifest

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.263
in my own gender identity.

00:08:21.768 --> 00:08:24.403
I began to reevaluate
how I was rejecting femininity

00:08:24.427 --> 00:08:27.125
in order to live up to a masculinity
that was not healthy

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:28.950
or something I wanted to pass on.

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:32.791
Doing this self-work
meant I had to reject option one.
