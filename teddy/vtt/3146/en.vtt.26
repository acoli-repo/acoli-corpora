00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:02.458
To love her and myself hard

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:04.514
with forgiveness and compassion,

00:13:04.538 --> 00:13:06.938
with tough love and with generosity.

00:13:07.466 --> 00:13:10.553
To give room for growth,
to push beyond comfort

00:13:10.577 --> 00:13:13.323
in hopes of attaining and living
a more meaningful life.

00:13:14.306 --> 00:13:15.958
I know in my head and in my heart

00:13:15.982 --> 00:13:19.267
that there are hard and painful
and uncomfortable days ahead.

00:13:19.291 --> 00:13:20.731
My head and my heart also know

00:13:20.755 --> 00:13:23.666
that all of it will lead
to a more rich, authentic life

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.246
that I can look back on without regrets.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.420
Thank you.

00:13:27.444 --> 00:13:30.619
