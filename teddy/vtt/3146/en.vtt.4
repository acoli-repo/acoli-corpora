00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:01.506
collided with my new identity as a parent

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.846
that I understood
the depth of my vulnerabilities

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.959
and how they are preventing me
from being my most authentic self.

00:02:08.203 --> 00:02:10.680
Now, for most people,
what their child will call them

00:02:10.704 --> 00:02:12.903
is not something
that they give much thought to

00:02:12.927 --> 00:02:14.672
outside of culturally specific words

00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:18.242
or variations on a gendered theme
like "mama," "mommy," or "daddy," "papa."

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:20.670
But for me, the possibility
is what this child,

00:02:20.694 --> 00:02:23.608
who will grow to be a teenager
and then a real-life adult,

00:02:23.632 --> 00:02:25.490
will call me for the rest of our lives,

00:02:25.514 --> 00:02:28.251
was both extremely scary and exciting.

00:02:29.185 --> 00:02:32.718
And I spent nine months wrestling
with the reality that being called "mama"
