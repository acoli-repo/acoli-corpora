00:07:28.204 --> 00:07:31.244
We even picked a gender-neutral name
for our female-born child.

00:07:31.268 --> 00:07:34.688
But gender neutrality is much easier
as a theoretical endeavor

00:07:34.712 --> 00:07:36.210
than it is as a practice.

00:07:36.767 --> 00:07:39.343
And in my attempts
to create gender neutrality,

00:07:39.367 --> 00:07:42.863
I was inadvertently privileging
masculinity over femininity.

00:07:43.398 --> 00:07:46.827
So, rather than toning down
or eliminating femininity in our lives,

00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:49.056
we make a concerted effort
to celebrate it.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.755
We have pinks among the variety of colors,

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:53.637
we balance out the cutes with handsomes

00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:55.537
and the prettys with strongs and smarts

00:07:55.561 --> 00:07:58.553
and work really hard
not to associate any words with gender.

00:07:58.577 --> 00:08:01.117
We value femininity and masculinity
