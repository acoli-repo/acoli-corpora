00:02:29.185 --> 00:02:32.718
And I spent nine months wrestling
with the reality that being called "mama"

00:02:32.742 --> 00:02:35.029
or something like it
didn't feel like me at all.

00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:37.781
And no matter how many times
or versions of "mom" I tried,

00:02:37.805 --> 00:02:40.185
it always felt forced
and deeply uncomfortable.

00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:44.617
I knew being called "mom" or "mommy"
would be easier to digest for most people.

00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:46.982
The idea of having two moms
is not super novel,

00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:48.517
especially where we live.

00:02:49.743 --> 00:02:51.339
So I tried other words.

00:02:51.363 --> 00:02:54.267
And when I played around
with "daddy," it felt better.

00:02:54.568 --> 00:02:56.266
Better, but not perfect.

00:02:57.124 --> 00:02:59.458
It felt like a pair of shoes
that you really liked

00:02:59.482 --> 00:03:01.283
but you needed to wear and break in.
