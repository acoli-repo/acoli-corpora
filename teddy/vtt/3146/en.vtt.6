00:02:59.482 --> 00:03:01.283
but you needed to wear and break in.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.014
And I knew the idea of being
a female-born person being called "daddy"

00:03:05.038 --> 00:03:08.364
was going to be a harder road
with a lot more uncomfortable moments.

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:10.578
But, before I knew it, the time had come

00:03:10.602 --> 00:03:13.546
and Elliot came screaming
into the world, like most babies do,

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.172
and my new identity as a parent began.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:19.339
I decided on becoming a daddy,
and our new family faced the world.

00:03:20.538 --> 00:03:23.641
Now one of the most common things
that happens when people meet us

00:03:23.665 --> 00:03:24.974
is for people to "mom" me.

00:03:24.998 --> 00:03:28.291
And when I get "momed", there are
several ways the interaction can go,

00:03:28.315 --> 00:03:31.728
and I've drawn this map
to help illustrate my options.
