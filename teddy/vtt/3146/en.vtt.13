00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:31.308
and spent countless hours teaching
about it in workshops and classrooms,

00:06:31.332 --> 00:06:34.680
I thought I was pretty well versed
on the social construction of gender

00:06:34.704 --> 00:06:37.220
and how sexism is a devaluing
of the feminine

00:06:37.244 --> 00:06:40.255
and how it manifests
both explicitly and implicitly.

00:06:40.883 --> 00:06:45.304
But this situation, this aversion
to a bag full of pink stuff,

00:06:45.328 --> 00:06:48.621
forced me to explore my rejection
of highly feminized things

00:06:48.645 --> 00:06:49.979
in my child's world.

00:06:51.466 --> 00:06:53.664
I realized that I was reinforcing sexism

00:06:53.688 --> 00:06:56.259
and the cultural norms
I teach as problematic.

00:06:56.657 --> 00:06:59.875
No matter how much I believed
in gender neutrality in theory,

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:05.307
in practice, the absence of femininity
is not neutrality, it's masculinity.
