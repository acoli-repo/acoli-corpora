I need to model agency,
authenticity and vulnerability,

00:05:34.593 --> 00:05:38.501

uncomfortable moments of being "momed"

00:05:38.525 --> 00:05:41.382
and standing up and saying,
"No, I'm a dad.

00:05:41.406 --> 00:05:43.454

the dad jokes to prove it."

00:05:43.478 --> 00:05:45.342

But there's also been,
in just two short years,

00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:55.864
validating and at times transformative
moments on my journey as a dad

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:57.586
and my path towards authenticity.

00:05:58.466 --> 00:05:59.974
When we got our first sonogram,

00:05:59.998 --> 00:06:02.553
we decided we wanted to know
the sex of the baby.
