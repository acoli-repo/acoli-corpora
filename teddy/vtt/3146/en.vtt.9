00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.371
Option two is always
the more authentic one.

00:04:31.395 --> 00:04:34.077
And all of these scenarios
involve a level of discomfort,

00:04:34.101 --> 00:04:35.258
even in the best case.

00:04:35.282 --> 00:04:38.663
And I'll say that over time, my ability
to navigate this complicated map

00:04:38.687 --> 00:04:39.906
has gotten easier.

00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:41.574
But the discomfort is still there.

00:04:41.877 --> 00:04:43.553
Now, I won't stand here and pretend

00:04:43.577 --> 00:04:45.966
like I've mastered this,
it's pretty far from it.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.907
And there are days when I still allow
option one to take place

00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:51.304
because option two
is just too hard or too risky.

00:04:52.141 --> 00:04:55.427
There's no way to be sure
of anyone's reaction,

00:04:55.451 --> 00:04:58.172
and I want to be sure
that folks have good intentions,

00:04:58.196 --> 00:04:59.514
that people are good.

00:04:59.538 --> 00:05:02.672
But we live in a world
where someone's opinion of my existence
