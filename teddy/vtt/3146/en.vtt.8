00:03:59.624 --> 00:04:02.917
Folks take it in stride
and say something like, "Oh, OK."

00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:04.218
And move on.

00:04:04.242 --> 00:04:06.815
Or they respond by apologizing profusely

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:09.645
because they feel bad or awkward
or guilty or weird.

00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:13.585
But more often, what happens
is folks get really confused

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.108
and look up with an intense look
and say something like,

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.110
"Does this mean you want to transition?

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:20.649
Do you want to be a man?"

00:04:20.673 --> 00:04:22.395
Or say things like,

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:23.903
"How can she be a father?

00:04:23.927 --> 00:04:25.393
Only men can be dads."

00:04:26.283 --> 00:04:28.546
Well, option one is oftentimes
the easier route.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.371
Option two is always
the more authentic one.
