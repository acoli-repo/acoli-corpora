00:04:59.538 --> 00:05:02.672
But we live in a world
where someone's opinion of my existence

00:05:02.696 --> 00:05:04.561
can be met with serious threats to me

00:05:04.585 --> 00:05:07.053
or even my family's emotional
or physical safety.

00:05:07.498 --> 00:05:11.743
So I weigh the costs against the risks

00:05:11.767 --> 00:05:15.595
and sometimes the safety of my family
comes before my own authenticity.

00:05:16.934 --> 00:05:18.117
But despite this risk,

00:05:18.141 --> 00:05:22.347
I know as Elliot gets older and grows into
her consciousness and language skills,

00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:24.771
if I don't correct people, she will.

00:05:25.727 --> 00:05:28.513
I don't want my fears and insecurities
to be placed on her,

00:05:28.537 --> 00:05:31.424
to dampen her spirit
or make her question her own voice.
