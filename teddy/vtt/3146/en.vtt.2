As you can see, I took
this year's theme super literal.

00:01:03.372 --> 00:01:04.433
(Laughter)

00:01:04.457 --> 00:01:06.552
Like any good dad joke should.

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:09.926
More specifically, I identify
as genderqueer.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.729
And there are lots of ways
to experience being genderqueer,

00:01:12.753 --> 00:01:15.943
but for me that means I don't
really identify as a man or a woman.

00:01:15.967 --> 00:01:19.124
I feel in between and sometimes
outside of this gender binary.

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:21.395
And being outside of this gender binary

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:23.760
means that sometimes I get
"sired" and "ma'amed"

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:26.943
in the span of less than an hour
when I'm out doing everyday things

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:28.125
like getting Cheerios.

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.721
But this in between lane
is where I'm most comfortable.
