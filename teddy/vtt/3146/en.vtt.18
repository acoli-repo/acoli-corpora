00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.458
I've always struggled
with the parts of my body

00:09:01.482 --> 00:09:03.371
that can be defined as more feminine --

00:09:03.395 --> 00:09:05.647
my chest, my hips, my voice.

00:09:05.997 --> 00:09:08.664
And I've made the sometimes hard,
sometimes easy decision

00:09:08.688 --> 00:09:11.625
to not take hormones
or have any surgeries to change it

00:09:11.649 --> 00:09:14.370
to make myself more masculine
by society's standards.

00:09:15.276 --> 00:09:18.823
And while I certainly haven't overcome
all the feelings of dissatisfaction,

00:09:18.847 --> 00:09:21.299
I realized that by not engaging
with that discomfort

00:09:21.323 --> 00:09:24.046
and coming to a positive
and affirming place with my body,

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.887
I was reinforcing sexism, transphobia
and modeling body shaming.

00:09:28.823 --> 00:09:30.220
If I hate my body,
