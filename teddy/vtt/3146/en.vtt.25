00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.426
And my hope is that when confronted
with an opportunity

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.260
to stand up for someone else,

00:12:34.284 --> 00:12:37.410
we all take action like Sarah,
even when there's risk involved.

00:12:38.608 --> 00:12:42.811
So some days, the risk of being
a genderqueer dad feels too much.

00:12:43.244 --> 00:12:45.513
And deciding to be a dad
has been really hard.

00:12:45.878 --> 00:12:48.125
And I'm sure it will continue
to be the hardest,

00:12:48.149 --> 00:12:50.299
yet the most rewarding
experience of my life.

00:12:50.617 --> 00:12:54.304
But despite this challenge,
every day has felt 100 percent worth it.

00:12:54.815 --> 00:12:57.553
So each day I affirm my promise to Elliot

00:12:57.577 --> 00:12:59.711
and that same promise to myself.
