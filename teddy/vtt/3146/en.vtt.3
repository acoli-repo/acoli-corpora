00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.721
But this in between lane
is where I'm most comfortable.

00:01:30.745 --> 00:01:32.999
This space where I can be
both a sir and a ma'am

00:01:33.023 --> 00:01:35.315
feels the most right
and the most authentic.

00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:38.395
But it doesn't mean that these
interactions aren't uncomfortable.

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:40.998
Trust me, the discomfort can range
from minor annoyance

00:01:41.022 --> 00:01:42.434
to feeling physically unsafe.

00:01:42.458 --> 00:01:44.061
Like the time at a bar in college

00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:46.926
when a bouncer physically
removed me by the back of the neck

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.825
and threw me out of a woman's restroom.

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:51.602
But for me, authenticity
doesn't mean "comfortable."

00:01:51.626 --> 00:01:54.730
It means managing and negotiating
the discomfort of everyday life,

00:01:54.754 --> 00:01:56.236
even at times when it's unsafe.

00:01:57.093 --> 00:01:59.491
And it wasn't until
my experience as a trans person

00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:01.506
collided with my new identity as a parent
