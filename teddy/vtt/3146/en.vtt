00:00:00.872 --> 00:00:03.127
So the other morning
I went to the grocery store

00:00:03.151 --> 00:00:04.469
and an employee greeted me

00:00:04.493 --> 00:00:07.190
with a "Good morning, sir,
can I help you with anything?"

00:00:07.214 --> 00:00:09.150
I said, "No, thanks, I'm good."

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:11.815
The person smiled
and we went our separate ways.

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.151
I grabbed Cheerios
and I left the grocery store.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:16.910
And I went through the drive-through
of a local coffee shop.

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:19.609
After I placed my order,
the voice on the other end said,

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:21.498
"Thank you, ma'am. Drive right around."

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:23.332
Now, in the span of less than an hour,

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:26.318
I was understood
both as a "sir" and as a "ma'am."

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:28.969
But for me, neither
of these people are wrong,

00:00:28.993 --> 00:00:31.143
but they're also not completely right.
