00:10:58.347 --> 00:11:00.782
Sarah was one of those folks
that took it in stride,

00:11:00.796 --> 00:11:03.006
and our subsequent visits
went pretty smoothly.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.133
And about a year later,
Sarah switched shifts

00:11:05.157 --> 00:11:08.185
and we started working
with a new nurse -- we'll call her Becky.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:10.423
We didn't get in front
of the dad conversations

00:11:10.447 --> 00:11:13.440
and it didn't actually come up
until Sarah, our original nurse,

00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:14.688
walked in to say hi.

00:11:14.712 --> 00:11:17.713
Sarah's warm and bubbly and said hi
to Elliot and me and my wife

00:11:17.737 --> 00:11:19.943
and when talking to Elliot
said something like,

00:11:19.967 --> 00:11:21.720
"Is your daddy holding your toy?"

00:11:21.744 --> 00:11:23.379
Now out of the corner of my eye,

00:11:23.403 --> 00:11:25.459
I could see Becky
swing around in her chair

00:11:25.483 --> 00:11:27.216
and make daggers at Sarah.

00:11:28.244 --> 00:11:30.688
And as the conversation shifted
to our pediatrician,
