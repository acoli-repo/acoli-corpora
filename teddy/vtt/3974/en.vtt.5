00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.136
It's far less than half
the size of the Earth,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.176
and yet despite the fact
that it's smaller,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.896
the surface area of Mars
that you can stand on

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.856
is equivalent to the surface area
of the Earth that you can stand on,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.200
because the Earth
is mostly covered by water.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.296
The atmosphere on Mars is really thin --

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.896
100 times thinner than on Earth --

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.920
and it's not breathable,
it's 96 percent carbon dioxide.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.376
It's really cold there.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.376
The average temperature
is minus 81 degrees,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.560
although there is
quite a range of temperature.
