00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.080
And yes, I worry we could screw up Mars
the way we've screwed up Earth.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.936
But think for a moment,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.896

told us we would put a human on the moon.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.320
He excited an entire generation to dream.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.336
Think how inspired we will be

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.496
and see that that is
one people instead of many
