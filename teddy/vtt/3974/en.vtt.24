00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.656
which creates 15 pounds of pressure
on our bodies at all times,

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.823
and we're constantly
pushing out against that.

00:12:04.847 --> 00:12:07.767
On Mars there's hardly
any atmospheric pressure.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.616
So Dava Newman,

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.096
a scientist at MIT,

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.176
has created this sleek space suit.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.696
It will keep us together,

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.960
block radiation and keep us warm.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.056
So let's think about this for a minute.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.080
Food, shelter, clothing, water, oxygen ...

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.160
we can do this.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.800
We really can.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.840
But it's still a little complicated
and a little difficult.
