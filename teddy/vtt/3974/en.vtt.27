00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:31.776
Now, my favorite way of doing this
is to erect a very, very large solar sail

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.016
and focus it --

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.776
it essentially serves as a mirror --

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.176
and focus it on the south pole
of Mars at first.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.216
As the planet spins, it will heat up
all that dry ice, sublime it,

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.496
and it will go into the atmosphere.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.016
It actually won't take long

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.296
for the temperature
on Mars to start rising,

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.880
probably less than 20 years.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.776
Right now,

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.776
on a perfect day at the equator,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.896
in the middle of summer on Mars,

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.376
temperatures can
actually reach 70 degrees,

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.816
but then they go down
to minus 100 at night.
