00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.816
but then they go down
to minus 100 at night.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.416
(Laughter)

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.080
What we're shooting for
is a runaway greenhouse effect:

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.616
enough temperature rise
to see a lot of that ice on Mars --

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:13.080
especially the ice in the ground -- melt.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.400
Then we get some real magic.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.176
As the atmosphere gets thicker,
everything gets better.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.816
We get more protection from radiation,

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.936
more atmosphere makes us warmer,
makes the planet warmer,

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.656
so we get running water

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.280
and that makes crops possible.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.896
Then more water vapor goes into the air,
forming yet another potent greenhouse gas.
