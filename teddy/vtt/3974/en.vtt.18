00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.856
that white stuff is ice.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.136
In the second picture,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.416
which is four days later
than the first picture,

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.480
you can see that
some of it is evaporating.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.416
Orbiters also tell us

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.856
that there are huge amounts
of underground water on Mars

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.936
as well as glaciers.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:19.216
In fact, if only the water ice
at the poles on Mars melted,

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.000
most of the planet
would be under 30 feet of water.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.056
So there's plenty of water there,

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.616
but most of it's ice,
most of it's underground,

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.000
it takes a lot of energy to get it
and a lot of human labor.
