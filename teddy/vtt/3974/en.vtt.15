00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.416
Private companies are leaping into space

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.880
and they will be happy
to take you to Mars.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.760
And that raises a really big question.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.400
Can we actually live there?

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.856
Now, NASA may not be able
to get us there until 2040,

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.976
or we may get there
a long time before NASA,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.960
but NASA has taken a huge responsibility
in figuring out how we can live on Mars.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.896
Let's look at the problem this way.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.776
Here's what you need to live on Earth:

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.216
food, water, shelter and clothing.
