00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.000
it takes a lot of energy to get it
and a lot of human labor.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.776
This is a device cooked up
at the University of Washington

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.280
back in 1998.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.896
It's basically a low-tech dehumidifier.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.976
And it turns out the Mars atmosphere
is often 100 percent humid.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.376
So this device can extract
all the water that humans will need

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.800
simply from the atmosphere on Mars.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.136
Next we have to worry
about what we will breathe.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.056
Frankly, I was really shocked

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.640
to find out that NASA
has this problem worked out.
