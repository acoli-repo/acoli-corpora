WEBVTT

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.496
is going to have one
of these devices aboard,

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.216
and it will be able
to produce enough oxygen

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.936
to keep one person alive indefinitely.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.096
But the secret to this --

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.816
and that's just for testing --

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.136
the secret to this is that this thing
was designed from the get-go

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.800
to be scalable by a factor of 100.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.056
Next, what will we eat?

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.016
Well, we'll use hydroponics to grow food,

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.896
but we're not going to be able to grow

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.056
more than 15 to 20 percent
of our food there,

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.576
at least not until water is running
on the surface of Mars

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.920
and we actually have the probability
and the capability of planting crops.
