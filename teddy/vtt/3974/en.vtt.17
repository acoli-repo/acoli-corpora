00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.216
But it turns out that it's not.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.456
The soil alone on Mars
contains up to 60 percent water.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.416
And a number of orbiters that we still
have flying around Mars have shown us --

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.976
and by the way,
that's a real photograph --

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.136
that lots of craters on Mars
have a sheet of water ice in them.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.360
It's not a bad place to start a colony.

00:08:51.855 --> 00:08:56.016
Now, here's a view of a little dig
the Phoenix Lander did in 2008,

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.576
showing that just below
the surface of the soil is ice --

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.856
that white stuff is ice.
