00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.656
And that's only if we launch
on a very specific day,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.416
at a very specific time,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.416
once every two years,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.616
when Mars and the Earth
are aligned just so,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.560
so the distance that the rocket
would have to travel will be the shortest.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.720
240 days is a long time to spend
trapped with your colleagues in a tin can.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.856
And meanwhile, our track record
of getting to Mars is lousy.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.696
We and the Russians,
the Europeans, the Japanese,

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.056
the Chinese and the Indians,

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.656
have actually sent 44 rockets there,

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.216
and the vast majority of them
have either missed or crashed.
