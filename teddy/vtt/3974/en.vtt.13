00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.440
Well, let's put a decade with Elon Musk
into a little perspective.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.680
Where was this 10 years ago?

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.616
That's the Tesla electric automobile.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.296
In 2005, a lot of people
in the automobile industry were saying,

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.760
we would not have
a decent electric car for 50 years.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.560
And where was that?

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.296
That is SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.696
lifting six tons of supplies
to the International Space Station.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.936
10 years ago,

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.520
SpaceX had not launched anything,
or fired a rocket to anywhere.
