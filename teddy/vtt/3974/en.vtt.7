00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.560
but it's by far the most livable
other place in our entire solar system.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.856
Here's the problem.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.056
Mars is a long way away,

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.920
a thousand times farther away
from us than our own moon.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.336
The Moon is 250,000 miles away

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.000
and it took Apollo astronauts
three days to get there.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.856
Mars is 250 million miles away

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.136
and it will take us
eight months to get there --

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.440
240 days.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.656
And that's only if we launch
on a very specific day,
