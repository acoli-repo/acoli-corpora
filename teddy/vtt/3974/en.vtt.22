00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.920
and we actually have the probability
and the capability of planting crops.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.936
In the meantime,

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.056
most of our food will arrive from Earth,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.280
and it will be dried.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.560
And then we need some shelter.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.736
At first we can use inflatable,
pressurized buildings

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.016
as well as the landers themselves.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.016
But this really only works
during the daytime.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.136
There is too much solar radiation
and too much radiation from cosmic rays.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.336
So we really have to go underground.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.056
Now, it turns out that the soil on Mars,
