Now, it turns out that the soil on Mars,

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.056
by and large,
is perfect for making bricks.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.296
And NASA has figured this one out, too.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:40.176
They're going to throw
some polymer plastic into the bricks,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.976
shove them in a microwave oven,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.256
and then you will be able to build
buildings with really thick walls.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:51.256
Or we may choose to live underground
in caves or in lava tubes,

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.560
of which there are plenty.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.560
And finally there's clothing.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.336
On Earth we have miles
of atmosphere piled up on us,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.656
which creates 15 pounds of pressure
on our bodies at all times,
