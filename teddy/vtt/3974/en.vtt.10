00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.256
and we decided to do
something called the shuttle

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.920
instead of continuing on to Mars
after we landed on the Moon.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.136
The biggest rocket we have now

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.160
is only half big enough
to get us anything to Mars.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.216
So getting to Mars is not going to be easy

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.400
and that brings up
a really interesting question ...

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.760
how soon will the first humans
actually land here?

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.496
Now, some pundits think
if we got there by 2050,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.240
that'd be a pretty good achievement.
