00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.560
although there is
quite a range of temperature.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.896
A day on Mars is about as long
as a day on Earth,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.840
plus about 39 minutes.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.480
Seasons and years on Mars
are twice as long as they are on Earth.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.656
And for anybody who wants to strap
on some wings and go flying one day,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.496
Mars has a lot less gravity than on Earth,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.776
and it's the kind of place

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.600
where you can jump over your car
instead of walk around it.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.776
Now, as you can see,
Mars isn't exactly Earth-like,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.560
but it's by far the most livable
other place in our entire solar system.
