This is a scientist at MIT
named Michael Hecht.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.616
And he's developed this machine, Moxie.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.856
I love this thing.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.456
It's a reverse fuel cell, essentially,

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.640
that sucks in the Martian atmosphere
and pumps out oxygen.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.256
And you have to remember that CO2 --

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.136
carbon dioxide, which is
96 percent of Mars' atmosphere --

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.960
CO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.256
Now, the next big rover
that NASA sends to Mars in 2020

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.496
is going to have one
of these devices aboard,
