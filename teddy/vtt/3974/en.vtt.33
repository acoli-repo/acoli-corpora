00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.096
When that happened,
people looked at each other and said,

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.800
"If we can do this, we can do anything."

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.880
What are they going to think
when we actually form a colony on Mars?

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:40.296
Most importantly,

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.696
it will make us a spacefaring species.

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:49.176
And that means humans will survive
no matter what happens on Earth.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.296
We will never be the last of our kind.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.536
Thank you.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.140
