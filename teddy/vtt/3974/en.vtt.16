00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.216
food, water, shelter and clothing.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.736
And here's what you need to live on Mars:

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.960
all of the above, plus oxygen.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.256
So let's look at the most
important thing on this list first.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.296
Water is the basis
of all life as we know it,

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.896
and it's far too heavy for us to carry
water from the Earth to Mars to live,

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.560
so we have to find water
if our life is going to succeed on Mars.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.336
And if you look at Mars,
it looks really dry,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.176
it looks like the entire
planet is a desert.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.216
But it turns out that it's not.
