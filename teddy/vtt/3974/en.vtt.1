00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.976
But first I want to discuss
the obvious question:

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.479
Why the heck should we do this?

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.856
12 years ago,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.696
I gave a TED talk on 10 ways
the world could end suddenly.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.496
We are incredibly vulnerable
to the whims of our own galaxy.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.096
A single, large asteroid
could take us out forever.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.576
To survive we have to reach
beyond the home planet.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.816
Think what a tragedy it would be

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.840
if all that humans have accomplished
were suddenly obliterated.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.736
And there's another reason we should go:

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.696
exploration is in our DNA.
