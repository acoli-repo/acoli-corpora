00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.696
exploration is in our DNA.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.176
Two million years ago
humans evolved in Africa

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.016
and then slowly but surely
spread out across the entire planet

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.536
by reaching into the wilderness
that was beyond their horizons.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.160
This stuff is inside us.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.520
And they prospered doing that.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.136
Some of the greatest advances
in civilization and technology

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.080
came because we explored.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.536
Yes, we could do a lot of good

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.280
with the money it will take
to establish a thriving colony on Mars.
