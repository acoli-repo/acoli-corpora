00:00:06.835 --> 00:00:07.905
On our planet,

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:09.608
we have two polar regions:

00:00:09.608 --> 00:00:11.370
the Arctic, whose name comes from

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.488
the Greek Arktikos, of the North,

00:00:13.488 --> 00:00:14.804
and the Antarctic

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:16.160
from Antarktikos,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.726
opposite of the North.

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:19.978
But there's an easier way to remember them

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.082
if you just remember what surrounds them.

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:25.749
The Arctic, situated in the Northern hemisphere of our planet,

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.003
is an ocean entirely surrounded by land.

00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:30.547
On the other side of the world,
