00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:04.287
a pilgrimage to Canterbury 
to visit the shrine of St. Thomas Beckett,

00:02:04.287 --> 00:02:08.047
a martyred archbishop who was murdered 
in his own Cathedral.

00:02:08.047 --> 00:02:10.965
Eager and nosy
for some personal details,

00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:13.871
the host of the Inn 
proposes a competition:

00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:18.037
whoever tells the best tale 
will be treated to dinner.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:19.548
If not for their pilgrimage,

00:02:19.548 --> 00:02:23.520
many of these figures would never 
have had the chance to interact.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.420
This is because Medieval society followed 
a feudal system

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.245
that divided the clergy and nobility 
from the working classes,
