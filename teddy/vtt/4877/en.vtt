00:00:08.423 --> 00:00:12.018
A portly Miller, barely sober enough
to sit on his horse,

00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:15.967
rambles on about the flighty wife 
of a crotchety old carpenter

00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:18.808
and the scholar she takes as her lover.

00:00:18.808 --> 00:00:20.453
To get some time alone together,

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:22.899
the scholar and the wife 
play various tricks

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:24.755
that involve feigning madness,

00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:26.601
staging a biblical flood,

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:29.119
and exposing themselves in public.

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.718
But the parish clerk 
is also lusting after the wife,
