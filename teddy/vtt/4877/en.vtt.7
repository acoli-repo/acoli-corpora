00:03:28.618 --> 00:03:30.694
filled with scatological language,

00:03:30.694 --> 00:03:32.015
sexual deviance,

00:03:32.015 --> 00:03:33.548
and slapstick.

00:03:33.548 --> 00:03:36.666
This variation 
includes something for everyone,

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:40.019
and that’s one reason why readers
continue to delight in the work

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.668
in both Middle English and translation.

00:03:42.668 --> 00:03:46.106
While the narrative runs 
to over 17,000 lines,

00:03:46.106 --> 00:03:48.093
it's apparently unfinished,

00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:51.584
as the prologue ambitiously 
introduces 29 pilgrims

00:03:51.584 --> 00:03:54.059
and promises four stories apiece,

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:56.861
and the innkeeper never crowns a victor.

00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:00.717
It’s possible that Chaucer was
so caught up in his sumptuous creations
