It’s possible that Chaucer was
so caught up in his sumptuous creations

00:04:00.717 --> 00:04:02.733
that he delayed picking a winner -

00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:05.076
or perhaps he was so fond 
of each character

00:04:05.076 --> 00:04:07.144
that he just couldn’t choose.

00:04:07.144 --> 00:04:08.566
Whatever the reason,

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:10.997
this means that every reader
is free to judge;

00:04:10.997 --> 00:04:13.669
the question of who wins is up to you.
