00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:01.877
the ribald humor of the Cook,

00:03:01.877 --> 00:03:04.076
the solemn prose of the Parson,

00:03:04.076 --> 00:03:06.189

to satirize their worldviews.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:12.044
The varied dialects, genres,

also make the work a vivid record

00:03:23.338 --> 00:03:24.845
riffs on romance,

00:03:24.845 --> 00:03:28.618
while the tales of working-class narrators
are generally comedies

00:03:28.618 --> 00:03:30.694
filled with scatological language,
