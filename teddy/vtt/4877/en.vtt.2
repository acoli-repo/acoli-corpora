00:00:55.902 --> 00:01:00.605
but it’s part of one of the most esteemed 
works of English literature ever created:

00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:02.247
The Canterbury Tales,

00:01:02.247 --> 00:01:06.102
which seamlessly blends the lofty 
and the lowly.

00:01:06.102 --> 00:01:08.431
The work consists of 24 stories,

00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:12.377
each told by one 
of Chaucer’s spirited characters.

00:01:12.377 --> 00:01:14.940
Narrators include 
familiar Medieval figures

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.147
such as a Knight,

00:01:16.147 --> 00:01:17.201
a Clerk,

00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:18.475
and a Nun,

00:01:18.475 --> 00:01:20.385
and the less recognizable Reeve,

00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:21.802
and Mancible,

00:01:21.802 --> 00:01:23.162
and others.

00:01:23.162 --> 00:01:25.152
The Tales are written in Middle English,

00:01:25.152 --> 00:01:28.670
which often looks entirely different 
from the language spoken today.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.417
It was used between the 12th 
and 15th centuries,
