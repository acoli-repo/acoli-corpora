00:05:56.322 --> 00:06:00.523
one million people were slaughtered.

00:06:00.523 --> 00:06:05.750
Now if those 12,000 chairs freaked me out

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.822
with the sheer number,

00:06:07.822 --> 00:06:11.453
I want you just for a second to think of a million people.

00:06:11.453 --> 00:06:13.990
And to give you some example, I remember

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.071
standing and looking down a road as far as I could see,

00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:25.160
at least a mile, and there were bodies piled twice my height

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.884
of the dead.

00:06:26.884 --> 00:06:30.219
And that was just a small percentage of the dead.
