00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.166
There was no kind of compensation for, you're a Tutsi,

00:07:30.166 --> 00:07:33.081
you're a Hutu, you might have killed my mother,

00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:34.927
you might have killed my father.

00:07:34.927 --> 00:07:40.233
They were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation,

00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:43.817
and I find this remarkable.

00:07:43.817 --> 00:07:46.659
So when people ask me how I continue to cover war,

00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:48.871
and why I continue to do it,

00:07:48.871 --> 00:07:50.340
this is why.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.731
When I go back to Syria, next week in fact,

00:07:53.731 --> 00:07:57.692
what I see is incredibly heroic people,

00:07:57.692 --> 00:07:59.965
some of them fighting for democracy,

00:07:59.965 --> 00:08:03.982
for things we take for granted every single day.
