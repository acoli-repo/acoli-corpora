Martha Gellhorn, who's one of my heroes, once said,

00:03:30.512 --> 00:03:35.710
"You can only love one war. The rest is responsibility."

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.246
I went on to cover many, many, many wars after that,

00:03:39.246 --> 00:03:41.875
so many that I lost count,

00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:44.958
but there was nothing like Sarajevo.

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.913
Last April, I went back to a very strange --

00:03:48.913 --> 00:03:52.687
what I called a deranged high school reunion.

00:03:52.687 --> 00:03:57.030
What it was, was the 20th anniversary of the siege,

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.502
the beginning of the siege of Sarajevo,

00:03:59.502 --> 00:04:03.942
and I don't like the word "anniversary," because it sounds like a party,
