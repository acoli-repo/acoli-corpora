00:06:26.884 --> 00:06:30.219
And that was just a small percentage of the dead.

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:32.188
And there were mothers holding their children

00:06:32.188 --> 00:06:35.529
who had been caught in their last death throes.

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:38.859
So we learn a lot from war,

00:06:38.859 --> 00:06:41.211
and I mention Rwanda

00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:45.329
because it is one place, like South Africa,

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:49.311
where nearly 20 years on, there is healing.

00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:52.779
Fifty-six percent of the parliamentarians are women,

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:55.231
which is fantastic,

00:06:55.231 --> 00:06:59.257
and there's also within the national constitution now,

00:06:59.257 --> 00:07:02.430
you're actually not allowed to say Hutu or Tutsi.
