crowds and crowds of people, "Take my child! Take my child!"

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:12.682
and passing her son to someone through a window.

00:02:12.682 --> 00:02:15.550
And she didn't see him for years.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.269
The siege went on for three and a half years,

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.558
and it was a siege without water,

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:26.847
without power, without electricity, without heat, without food,

00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:32.202
in the middle of Europe, in the middle of the 20th century.
