00:08:57.732 --> 00:09:00.467
a quite famous Iraqi politician who was a friend of mine

00:09:00.467 --> 00:09:02.941
said to me, "What are you doing here?

00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:04.782
Why aren't you home with Luca?"

00:09:04.782 --> 00:09:08.567
And I said, "Well, I have to see." It was 2004

00:09:08.567 --> 00:09:12.954
which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in Iraq,

00:09:12.954 --> 00:09:16.194
"I have to see, I have to see what is happening here.

00:09:16.194 --> 00:09:17.059
I have to report it."

00:09:17.059 --> 00:09:20.623
And he said, "Go home,

00:09:20.623 --> 00:09:23.909
because if you miss his first tooth,

00:09:23.909 --> 00:09:26.907
if you miss his first step, you'll never forgive yourself.

00:09:26.907 --> 00:09:30.770
But there will always be another war."
