00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:32.202
in the middle of Europe, in the middle of the 20th century.

00:02:32.202 --> 00:02:36.004
I had the honor of being one of those reporters

00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:38.423
that lived through that siege,

00:02:38.423 --> 00:02:41.461
and I say I have the honor and the privilege of being there

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:43.651
because it's taught me everything,

00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:47.780
not just about being a reporter, but about being a human being.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.135
I learned about compassion.

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:53.946
I learned about ordinary people who could be heroes.

00:02:53.946 --> 00:02:58.317
I learned about sharing. I learned about camaraderie.

00:02:58.317 --> 00:03:01.228
Most of all, I learned about love.
