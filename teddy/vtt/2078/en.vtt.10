00:04:57.414 --> 00:05:00.541
I now cover Syria,

00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:03.731
and I started reporting it because I believed that

00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:05.987
it needs to be done.

00:05:05.987 --> 00:05:08.992
I believe a story there has to be told.

00:05:08.992 --> 00:05:12.962
I see, again, a template of the war in Bosnia.

00:05:12.962 --> 00:05:15.191
And when I first arrived in Damascus,

00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:17.593
I saw this strange moment where people

00:05:17.593 --> 00:05:21.153
didn't seem to believe that war was going to descend,

00:05:21.153 --> 00:05:23.088
and it was exactly the same in Bosnia

00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:25.902
and nearly every other country I've seen where war comes.

00:05:25.902 --> 00:05:28.445
People don't want to believe it's coming,

00:05:28.445 --> 00:05:31.912
so they don't leave, they don't leave before they can.
