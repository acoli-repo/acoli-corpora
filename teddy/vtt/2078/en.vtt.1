00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.955
It stops.

00:00:30.955 --> 00:00:33.513
I'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine,

00:00:33.513 --> 00:00:36.491
a Bosnian friend, about what happened to her,

00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:40.868
because I think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like.

00:00:40.868 --> 00:00:44.962
She was walking to work one day in April, 1992,

00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:48.110
in a miniskirt and high heels. She worked in a bank.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.634
She was a young mother. She was someone who liked to party.

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:53.468
Great person.

00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:56.775
And suddenly she sees a tank

00:00:56.775 --> 00:00:59.981
ambling down the main road of Sarajevo

00:00:59.981 --> 00:01:03.533
knocking everything out of its path.
