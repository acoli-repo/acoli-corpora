00:09:57.372 --> 00:10:00.198
and I can't tell you the times of how helpless I've felt

00:10:00.198 --> 00:10:03.469
to have people dying in front of me, and I couldn't save them.

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:07.304
All I am is a witness.

00:10:07.304 --> 00:10:12.358
My role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless.

00:10:12.358 --> 00:10:15.591
A colleague of mine described it as to shine a light

00:10:15.591 --> 00:10:18.353
in the darkest corners of the world.

00:10:18.353 --> 00:10:21.000
And that's what I try to do.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.036
I'm not always successful,

00:10:24.036 --> 00:10:26.577
and sometimes it's incredibly frustrating,

00:10:26.577 --> 00:10:28.783
because you feel like you're writing into a void,

00:10:28.783 --> 00:10:31.112
or you feel like no one cares.
