I've been a journalist
for more than 23 years,

00:00:03.668 --> 00:00:05.873
at the "Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,"

00:00:05.897 --> 00:00:07.555
the "Pittsburgh Tribune Review"

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:10.579
and most recently, "The Denver Post."

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:14.418

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:18.055
When I started
at "The Denver Post" in 2003,

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:22.340
it was among the country's
10 largest newspapers,

00:00:22.364 --> 00:00:24.467
with an impressive subscriber base

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:27.070
and nearly 300 journalists.

00:00:27.752 --> 00:00:29.910
At the time, I was in my 30s.
