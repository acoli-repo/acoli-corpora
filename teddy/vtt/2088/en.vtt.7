00:03:27.478 --> 00:03:30.557
And it's a massive thing of
tens of thousands of pages

00:03:30.557 --> 00:03:32.673
which just wasn't going to be possible

00:03:32.673 --> 00:03:34.426
in the few months that they had.

00:03:34.426 --> 00:03:36.883
So instead, they decided to build a parallel site

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.345
that better conformed to how citizens actually

00:03:39.345 --> 00:03:42.684
want to interact with information on a city website.

00:03:42.684 --> 00:03:44.621
They're looking for answers to questions,

00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.247
and they want to take action when they're done,

00:03:47.247 --> 00:03:49.533
which is really hard to do from a site

00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:51.182
that looks like this.

00:03:51.182 --> 00:03:53.427
So our team built Honolulu Answers,

00:03:53.427 --> 00:03:55.793
which is a super-simple search interface

00:03:55.793 --> 00:03:58.246
where you enter a search term or a question

00:03:58.246 --> 00:04:00.944
and get back plain language answers
