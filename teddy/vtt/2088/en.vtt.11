00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:32.553
based simply on this small act of participation.

00:05:32.553 --> 00:05:36.278
And by stitching together my small act

00:05:36.278 --> 00:05:39.084
with the thousands of other
small acts of participation

00:05:39.084 --> 00:05:41.665
that we're enabling through civic hacking,

00:05:41.665 --> 00:05:44.449
we think we can reenergize citizenship

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.499
and restore trust in government.

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:48.836
At this point, you may be wondering

00:05:48.836 --> 00:05:50.562
what city officials think of all this.

00:05:50.562 --> 00:05:52.115
They actually love it.

00:05:52.115 --> 00:05:54.309
As most of you guys know, cities are being asked

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:57.030
every day to do more with less,

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.228
and they're always looking for innovative solutions

00:05:59.228 --> 00:06:00.962
to entrenched problems.
