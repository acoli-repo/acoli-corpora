00:08:28.377 --> 00:08:30.447
with all the fires that were happening in the city,

00:08:30.447 --> 00:08:33.236
so in true civic hacker fashion,

00:08:33.236 --> 00:08:35.886
they built a solution.

00:08:35.886 --> 00:08:38.396
And we have our own brigades at Code for America

00:08:38.396 --> 00:08:41.542
working on the projects that I've just described,

00:08:41.542 --> 00:08:43.280
and we want to ask you

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.742
to follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps

00:08:45.742 --> 00:08:47.209
and come join us.

00:08:47.209 --> 00:08:49.499
We have 31 brigades in the U.S.

00:08:49.499 --> 00:08:50.767
We are pleased to announce today

00:08:50.767 --> 00:08:53.043
that we're opening up the 
brigade to international cities

00:08:53.043 --> 00:08:54.635
for the first time,

00:08:54.635 --> 00:08:58.616
starting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland.

00:08:58.616 --> 00:09:00.715
You can find out if there's a brigade where you live
