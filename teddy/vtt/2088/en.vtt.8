00:03:58.246 --> 00:04:00.944
and get back plain language answers

00:04:00.944 --> 00:04:03.384
that drive a user towards action.

00:04:03.384 --> 00:04:06.241
Now the site itself was easy enough to build,

00:04:06.241 --> 00:04:08.144
but the team was faced with the challenge

00:04:08.144 --> 00:04:10.854
of how they populate all of the content.

00:04:10.854 --> 00:04:12.530
It would have taken the three of them

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.907
a very long time,

00:04:13.907 --> 00:04:16.906
especially given that none of 
them are actually from Honolulu.

00:04:16.906 --> 00:04:18.981
And so they did something that's really radical,

00:04:18.981 --> 00:04:20.654
when you think about how government

00:04:20.654 --> 00:04:22.695
is used to working.

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:25.707
They asked citizens to write the content.

00:04:25.707 --> 00:04:27.201
So you've heard of a hack-a-thon.

00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:28.865
They held a write-a-thon,

00:04:28.865 --> 00:04:31.502
where on one Saturday afternoon --
