00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:32.524
And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea

00:00:32.524 --> 00:00:37.033
that hackers are people that we should be afraid of.

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:38.665
But like most things in technology

00:00:38.665 --> 00:00:40.114
and the technology world,

00:00:40.114 --> 00:00:43.289
hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil.

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:45.723
For every hacker that's trying to steal your identity

00:00:45.723 --> 00:00:47.961
there's one that's building a tool

00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:51.092
that will help you find your
loved ones after a disaster

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:54.571
or to monitor environmental quality

00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:57.308
after an oil spill.

00:00:57.308 --> 00:01:01.180
Hacking is really just any amateur innovation
