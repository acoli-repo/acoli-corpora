for citizens to be involved,

00:08:01.516 --> 00:08:05.461
besides voting or signing a petition or protesting.

00:08:05.461 --> 00:08:09.438
They can actually build government.

00:08:09.438 --> 00:08:12.574
So back to our friend Ben Franklin,

00:08:12.574 --> 00:08:15.320
who, one of his lesser-known accomplishments

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.195
was that in 1736 he founded

00:08:19.195 --> 00:08:22.753
the first volunteer firefighting
company in Philadelphia,

00:08:22.753 --> 00:08:24.452
called a brigade.

00:08:24.452 --> 00:08:26.678
And it's because he and his friends noticed

00:08:26.678 --> 00:08:28.377
that the city was having trouble keeping up

00:08:28.377 --> 00:08:30.447
with all the fires that were happening in the city,
