00:06:26.077 --> 00:06:30.389
entered into a contract with
a software development firm

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.569
to build an app that legislators would use

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:34.820
to track bills.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.496
So this was just for the handful of legislators

00:06:37.496 --> 00:06:40.070
in the House.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.739
And the contract was a two-year contract

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:46.665
for 9.3 million dollars.

00:06:46.665 --> 00:06:49.017
Now a lot of people were really angry about this,

00:06:49.017 --> 00:06:51.964
especially geeks who knew that 9.3 million dollars

00:06:51.964 --> 00:06:54.268
was an absolutely outrageous amount of money

00:06:54.268 --> 00:06:56.239
for what was a very simple app.

00:06:56.239 --> 00:06:58.668
But instead of taking to the streets,

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:00.876
they issued a challenge.
