00:04:57.963 --> 00:05:00.374
this past June in Oakland, where I live,

00:05:00.374 --> 00:05:02.403
the Code For America team in Oakland

00:05:02.403 --> 00:05:04.603
took the open source code base of Honolulu Answers

00:05:04.603 --> 00:05:06.614
and turned it into Oakland Answers,

00:05:06.614 --> 00:05:08.693
and again we held a write-a-thon

00:05:08.693 --> 00:05:12.041
where we took the most frequently asked questions

00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:13.703
and had citizens write the answers to them,

00:05:13.703 --> 00:05:15.172
and I got into the act.

00:05:15.172 --> 00:05:18.773
I authored this answer, and a few others.

00:05:18.773 --> 00:05:21.885
And I'm trying to this day to articulate

00:05:21.885 --> 00:05:24.931
the sense of empowerment and responsibility

00:05:24.931 --> 00:05:28.511
that I feel for the place that I live

00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:32.553
based simply on this small act of participation.
