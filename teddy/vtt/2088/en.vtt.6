00:02:59.914 --> 00:03:01.959
And we hear all the time from our community

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.247
of civic hackers at Code for America

00:03:04.247 --> 00:03:06.855
that they didn't understand
how much nontechnical work

00:03:06.855 --> 00:03:08.881
actually went into civic hacking projects.

00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:10.372
So keep that in mind.

00:03:10.372 --> 00:03:14.462
All of you are potential civic hackers.

00:03:14.462 --> 00:03:16.482
So what does civic hacking look like?

00:03:16.482 --> 00:03:18.746
Our team last year in Honolulu,

00:03:18.746 --> 00:03:21.361
which in this case was three full-time fellows

00:03:21.361 --> 00:03:23.513
who were doing a year of public service,

00:03:23.513 --> 00:03:27.478
were asked by the city to rebuild the website.

00:03:27.478 --> 00:03:30.557
And it's a massive thing of
tens of thousands of pages
