00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:31.973
that underly a healthy democracy,

00:02:31.973 --> 00:02:34.966
like collaboration and empowerment

00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:37.029
and participation and enterprise,

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.515
are the same values that underly the Internet.

00:02:40.515 --> 00:02:42.611
And so it's no surprise that many hackers

00:02:42.611 --> 00:02:45.968
are turning their attention to
the problem of government.

00:02:45.968 --> 00:02:48.021
But before I give you a few examples

00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:49.843
of what civic hacking looks like,

00:02:49.843 --> 00:02:51.359
I want to make clear that you don't have

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.453
to be a programmer to be a civic hacker.

00:02:53.453 --> 00:02:55.208
You just have to believe that you can bring

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.475
a 21st-century tool set to bear

00:02:57.475 --> 00:02:59.914
on the problems that government faces.

00:02:59.914 --> 00:03:01.959
And we hear all the time from our community
