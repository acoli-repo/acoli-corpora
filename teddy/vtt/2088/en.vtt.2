Hacking is really just any amateur innovation

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.576
on an existing system,

00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:05.406
and it is a deeply democratic activity.

00:01:05.406 --> 00:01:06.805
It's about critical thinking.

00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:09.839
It's about questioning existing ways of doing things.

00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:13.227
It's the idea that if you see a 
problem, you work to fix it,

00:01:13.227 --> 00:01:15.258
and not just complain about it.

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:19.168
And in many ways, hacking is what built America.

00:01:19.168 --> 00:01:21.313
Betsy Ross was a hacker.

00:01:21.313 --> 00:01:24.508
The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack.

00:01:24.508 --> 00:01:27.384
And from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs,

00:01:27.384 --> 00:01:29.923
hacking has always been at the foundation

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.975
of American democracy.
