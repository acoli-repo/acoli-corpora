00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
About 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And at the time I was very superstitious.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So, upon landing -- this was still at the old Hong Kong airport

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that's Kai Tak, when it was smack in the middle of the city --

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I thought, "If I see something good, I'm going to have a great time here in

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
my two weeks. And if I see something negative, I'm going to be miserable, indeed."
