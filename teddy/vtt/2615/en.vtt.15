00:07:28.508 --> 00:07:30.781
And they remain unused today.

00:07:31.642 --> 00:07:33.002
So here's an idea.

00:07:33.026 --> 00:07:34.398
As a first step,

00:07:35.046 --> 00:07:38.112
why don't we start
spending those unused,

00:07:38.136 --> 00:07:41.603
those extra SDRs
that were printed in 2009,

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:43.174
to combat climate change?

00:07:43.948 --> 00:07:45.461
They could, for example,

00:07:45.485 --> 00:07:50.185
be used to buy bonds issued
by the UN's Green Climate Fund.

00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:53.797
This was a fund created in 2009,

00:07:53.821 --> 00:07:57.095
following that climate
agreement in Copenhagen.

00:07:57.906 --> 00:08:02.262
And it was designed to channel funds
towards developing countries
