00:11:57.937 --> 00:12:00.804
We could take cars off the roads
for a generation.

00:12:01.384 --> 00:12:02.534
So,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.283
let's not quibble about whether we can
afford to fund climate change.

00:12:08.877 --> 00:12:11.125
The real question is:

00:12:11.149 --> 00:12:14.546
Do we care enough about future generations

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:19.611
to take the very same policy risks
we took to save the financial system?

00:12:20.223 --> 00:12:21.421
After all,

00:12:22.249 --> 00:12:23.468
we could do it,

00:12:24.284 --> 00:12:25.435
we did do it

00:12:25.459 --> 00:12:27.190
and we are doing it today.

00:12:27.808 --> 00:12:32.126
We must, must, must do
"whatever it takes."
