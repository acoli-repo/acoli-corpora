00:11:26.593 --> 00:11:32.892
That program has since delivered
a 70 percent reduction in deforestation

00:11:32.916 --> 00:11:34.327
in the past decade.

00:11:34.926 --> 00:11:39.264
That's saving 3.2 billion tons
of carbon dioxide emissions,

00:11:39.288 --> 00:11:43.819
which is the equivalent of taking
all American cars off the roads

00:11:43.843 --> 00:11:46.129
for three whole years.

00:11:47.704 --> 00:11:49.006
So what could we do

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:54.074
with 300 other pay-for-performance
climate projects like that,

00:11:54.098 --> 00:11:56.977
organized on a global scale?

00:11:57.937 --> 00:12:00.804
We could take cars off the roads
for a generation.
