And there are some truly terrible
historical examples of money printing --

00:05:05.846 --> 00:05:08.169
uncontrolled money printing --

00:05:08.193 --> 00:05:09.938
leading to hyperinflation.

00:05:10.764 --> 00:05:14.350
Think: Weimar Republic in 1930;

00:05:14.374 --> 00:05:17.447
Zimbabwe more recently, in 2008,

00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:21.535
when the prices of basic goods
like bread are doubling every day.

00:05:22.892 --> 00:05:27.896
But all of this is moving
the public debate forward,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:33.248
so much so, that money printing
for the people is now discussed openly
