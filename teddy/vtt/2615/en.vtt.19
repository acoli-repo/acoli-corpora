00:09:28.998 --> 00:09:34.025
What you end up with
is a collective, global action

00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:38.212
aimed -- and it's controlled
global action --

00:09:38.236 --> 00:09:40.825
aimed at a global good.

00:09:41.637 --> 00:09:42.845
And,

00:09:42.869 --> 00:09:45.436
as we've learned
with the money-printing schemes,

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.292
whatever concerns we have
can be allayed by rules.

00:09:48.757 --> 00:09:50.639
So, for example,

00:09:50.663 --> 00:09:55.636
the issuance of these extra SDRs
every five years could be capped,

00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:01.255
such that this international currency
is never more than five percent
