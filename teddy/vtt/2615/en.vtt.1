00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:31.529
will pass to my son, Charlie.

00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:34.829
And I wonder what his generation

00:00:34.853 --> 00:00:37.159
and perhaps the one that follows

00:00:37.183 --> 00:00:42.021
will make of the two lives
this ring has worked.

00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:45.518
My grandfather was a coal miner.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.677
In his time,

00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:53.585
burning fossil fuels for energy
and for allowing economies to develop

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:54.766
was accepted.

00:00:55.198 --> 00:00:58.577
We know now that that is not the case

00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:01.983
because of the greenhouse
gases that coal produces.
