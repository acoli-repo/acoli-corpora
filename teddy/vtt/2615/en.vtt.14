00:06:58.363 --> 00:07:00.029
here's the intriguing part.

00:07:01.083 --> 00:07:06.285
More than half of those extra SDRs
that were printed in 2009 --

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:08.295
150 billion dollars' worth --

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:12.634
went to developed market countries
who, for the most part,

00:07:12.658 --> 00:07:15.495
have a modest need
for these foreign exchange reserves,

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:17.950
because they have flexible exchange rates.

00:07:18.427 --> 00:07:22.808
So those extra reserves
that were printed in 2009,

00:07:22.832 --> 00:07:26.303
in the end, for developed
market countries at least,

00:07:26.327 --> 00:07:27.953
weren't really needed.

00:07:28.508 --> 00:07:30.781
And they remain unused today.
