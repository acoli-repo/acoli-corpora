00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.560
So, let's go back
to that original question:

00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:36.355
Can we print money for climate finance?

00:04:37.201 --> 00:04:38.931
Three years ago,

00:04:38.955 --> 00:04:42.690
the idea of using money in this way
was something of a taboo.

00:04:42.714 --> 00:04:45.890
Once you break down and dismantle the idea

00:04:45.914 --> 00:04:47.953
that money is a finite resource,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.063
governments can quickly get overwhelmed
by demands from their people

00:04:53.087 --> 00:04:56.313
to print more and more
money for other causes:

00:04:56.337 --> 00:04:58.337
education, health care, welfare --

00:04:58.361 --> 00:04:59.591
even defense.
