00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.928
Will we do whatever it takes
to tackle climate change?

00:00:07.393 --> 00:00:10.366
I come at this question
not as a green campaigner,

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.985
in fact, I confess to be rather
hopeless at recycling.

00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:18.669
I come at it as a professional observer
of financial policy making

00:00:18.693 --> 00:00:23.450
and someone that wonders
how history will judge us.

00:00:24.353 --> 00:00:25.609
One day,

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:29.498
this ring that belonged to my grandfather

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:31.529
will pass to my son, Charlie.
