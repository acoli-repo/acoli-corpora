Firstly,

00:02:00.364 --> 00:02:02.342
because greenhouse gases, once released,

00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:05.059
stay in the atmosphere for decades.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:06.271
And secondly,

00:02:06.295 --> 00:02:12.122
if a developing economy builds
its power grid around fossil fuels today,

00:02:12.146 --> 00:02:15.299
it's going to be way more costly
to change later on.

00:02:16.316 --> 00:02:18.462
So for the climate,

00:02:18.486 --> 00:02:22.312
history may judge
that the banking crisis happened

00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:24.315
at just the wrong time.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.608
The story need not be this gloomy, though.
