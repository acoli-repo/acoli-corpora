00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.101
that it's actually
a lot more energy-efficient

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:34.101
to cook little pieces quickly.

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:36.184
But also, then you don't have to cut them.

00:02:36.208 --> 00:02:37.893
So you have a circular influence,

00:02:37.917 --> 00:02:41.268
where the type of food that is cooked
allows people to use chopsticks,

00:02:41.292 --> 00:02:45.184
and then the fact that you have chopsticks
influences the food that you can cook.

00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:48.809
But at the same time, chopsticks reflect
the communal nature of eating food.

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:51.309
You'll have these dishes

00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:52.601
it's very family style.

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:54.143
You go in with your chopsticks,

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:57.268
and you put it on your rice,
and then you eat individually.

00:02:57.292 --> 00:02:59.476
There's actually a famous sort of legend

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.143
where everyone has these
really, really long chopsticks,
