Most of them are made out of wood.
They're also made out of plastic, bamboo,

00:00:30.458 --> 00:00:32.559
jade, gold, silver and even ivory,

00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:34.768
though I think that's not so cool anymore.

00:00:34.792 --> 00:00:38.143
Chopsticks are really well designed
for eating small bits of food.

00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:39.934
They're good for picking up noodles.

00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:41.768
If you're skilled, you can eat rice,

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:43.726
pick up dumplings, pieces of meat.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.851
There are some no-nos with chopsticks.

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:48.226
You should not use
the chopsticks like drumsticks,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.518
which I know is tempting.

00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:52.934
You don't want to stick chopsticks
into a bowl of rice face-up.

00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:56.184
And the reason for that is it actually
looks like a bowl of incense,

00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:57.559
so it sort of echoes death.

00:00:57.583 --> 00:01:00.018
Chopsticks are used
in a huge portion of the world,
