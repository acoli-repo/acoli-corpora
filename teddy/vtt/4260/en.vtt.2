00:00:57.583 --> 00:01:00.018
Chopsticks are used
in a huge portion of the world,

00:01:00.042 --> 00:01:02.643
across much of Asia,
about 1.5 billion people

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:04.643
are covered in the chopsticks sphere.

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:08.143
Different cultures have slightly different
variations of chopsticks.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:10.851
Chinese chopsticks
will tend to be long and round,

00:01:10.875 --> 00:01:13.851
Korean chopsticks
are flatter and often made of metal

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:16.018
and Japanese chopsticks tend to be round

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:17.518
and very, very pointy.

00:01:17.542 --> 00:01:19.851
While chopsticks
are actually really commonplace

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:21.768
in American society today,

00:01:21.792 --> 00:01:24.434
there was definitely a time
in the late 1800s

00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:26.684
where this idea that Asian men,

00:01:26.708 --> 00:01:28.726
because they ate rice with sticks,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.559
were of a different quality
than American men,
