00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.559
were of a different quality
than American men,

00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:33.643
who ate proper meat with a knife and fork.

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:35.809
But when China and the United States

00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:39.309
began their diplomatic
engagement in the 1970s,

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.893
Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger,

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:43.893
had to practice eating with chopsticks.

00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:45.851
What's been really interesting to see

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:50.976
is that as Asian cuisine has moved
from the East into the West,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.726
chopsticks have become
part of the experience.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.101
There's evidence of chopsticks
as long ago as the Shang dynasty,

00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:58.726
which is about 3000 years ago,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.559
and they loved tripods
during the Shang dynasty.
