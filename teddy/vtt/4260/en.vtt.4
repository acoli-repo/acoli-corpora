00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.559
and they loved tripods
during the Shang dynasty.

00:02:01.583 --> 00:02:03.809
So when you cook with these big tripods,

00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:05.851
chopsticks were actually really useful,

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:08.226
because it was a way
for you to stir and to reach

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.226
without getting burned
as the water was boiling

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.226
in these really big pots.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.351
Chinese culture has knives and has forks.

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:18.143
It uses them in many cases for cooking.

00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:22.184
But in terms of like what
moved into the dining room,

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:23.476
it was the chopsticks.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.309
One of the things about Asian cooking

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:27.601
is that it often comes
in very small pieces.

00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:29.934
And I think part of that
has to do with the fact

00:02:29.958 --> 00:02:32.101
that it's actually
a lot more energy-efficient
