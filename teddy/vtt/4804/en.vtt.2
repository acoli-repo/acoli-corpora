Some scholars have tried to identify
patterns common to all languages,

00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:02.496
but apart from some basic features,

00:01:02.496 --> 00:01:04.593
like having nouns or verbs,

00:01:04.593 --> 00:01:08.939
few of these so-called 
linguistic universals have been found.

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.026
And while any language needs consistent
patterns to function,

00:01:12.026 --> 00:01:17.306
the study of these patterns opens up
an ongoing debate between two positions

00:01:17.306 --> 00:01:20.913
known as prescriptivism
and descriptivism.

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:22.198
Grossly simplified,

00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:26.061
prescriptivists think a given language 
should follow consistent rules,

00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:30.692
while descriptivists see variation
and adaptation as a natural
