00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:03.461
Ultimately, grammar is best thought of
as a set of linguistic habits

00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:06.751
that are constantly being negotiated
and reinvented

00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:09.966
by the entire group of language users.

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:11.352
Like language itself,

00:04:11.352 --> 00:04:13.217
it's a wonderful and complex fabric

00:04:13.217 --> 00:04:17.080
woven through the contributions
of speakers and listeners,

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.565
writers and readers,

00:04:18.565 --> 00:04:20.781
prescriptivists and descriptivists,

00:04:20.781 --> 00:04:22.663
from both near and far.
