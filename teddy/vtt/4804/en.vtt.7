00:03:28.878 --> 00:03:31.175
prescriptivism 
and descriptivism continues,

00:03:31.175 --> 00:03:33.598
the two are not mutually exclusive.

00:03:33.598 --> 00:03:37.072
At its best, prescriptivism is useful
for informing people

00:03:37.072 --> 00:03:41.675
about the most common established
patterns at a given point in time.

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:44.471
This is important, 
not only for formal contexts,

00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:48.432
but it also makes communication easier
between non-native speakers

00:03:48.432 --> 00:03:50.620
from different backgrounds.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.194
Descriptivism, on the other hand,

00:03:52.194 --> 00:03:54.447
gives us insight into how our minds work

00:03:54.447 --> 00:03:58.855
and the instinctive ways in which we 
structure our view of the world.

00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:03.461
Ultimately, grammar is best thought of
as a set of linguistic habits
