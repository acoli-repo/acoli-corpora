00:01:56.741 --> 00:02:00.665
despite being derived from just one
of many spoken varieties,

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:03.078
usually that of the people in power.

00:02:03.078 --> 00:02:07.426
Language purists worked to establish
and propagate this standard

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:13.021
by detailing a set of rules that reflected
the established grammar of their times.

00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:17.245
And rules for written grammar were applied
to spoken language, as well.

00:02:17.245 --> 00:02:21.683
Speech patterns that deviated from the
written rules were considered corruptions,

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:24.090
or signs of low social status,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.675
and many people who had grown up
speaking in these ways

00:02:26.675 --> 00:02:30.570
were forced to adopt 
the standardized form.
