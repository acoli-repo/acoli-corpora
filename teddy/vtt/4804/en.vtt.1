And if he still understood it,

From the point of view of linguistics,

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:36.547
grammar is a set of patterns 
for how words are put together

00:00:36.547 --> 00:00:39.096
to form phrases or clauses,

00:00:39.096 --> 00:00:41.905
whether spoken or in writing.

00:00:41.905 --> 00:00:44.090
Different languages 
have different patterns.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.433
In English, the subject 
normally comes first,

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:48.689
followed by the verb,

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:50.007
and then the object,

00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:52.554
while in Japanese 
and many other languages,

00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:55.898
the order is subject, object, verb.

00:00:55.898 --> 00:01:00.151
Some scholars have tried to identify
patterns common to all languages,
