You're telling a friend an amazing story,

00:00:09.226 --> 00:00:13.637
and you just get to the best part
when suddenly he interrupts,

00:00:13.637 --> 00:00:17.819
"The alien and I," not "Me and the alien."

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:19.813
Most of us would probably be annoyed,

00:00:19.813 --> 00:00:21.907
but aside from the rude interruption,

00:00:21.907 --> 00:00:23.713
does your friend have a point?

00:00:23.713 --> 00:00:26.837
Was your sentence actually 
grammatically incorrect?

00:00:26.837 --> 00:00:30.867
And if he still understood it,
why does it even matter?
