00:02:58.727 --> 00:03:03.241
This could mean avoiding complex clauses
that are hard to parse in real time,

00:03:03.241 --> 00:03:06.037
making changes to avoid awkward
pronounciation,

00:03:06.037 --> 00:03:09.388
or removing sounds to make speech faster.

00:03:09.388 --> 00:03:13.571
The linguistic approach that tries
to understand and map such differences

00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:17.945
without dictating correct ones
is known as descriptivism.

00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:20.301
Rather than deciding how language
should be used,

00:03:20.301 --> 00:03:23.131
it describes how people actually use it,

00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:27.259
and tracks the innovations 
they come up with in the process.

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:28.878
But while the debate between

00:03:28.878 --> 00:03:31.175
prescriptivism 
and descriptivism continues,
