00:05:55.292 --> 00:06:00.768
When I saw my mother's first signature
on her bidi-rolling wage book,

00:06:00.792 --> 00:06:03.726
when I felt the hot
Delhi air against my face

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.643
after a 50-hour train journey,

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:10.184
when I finally felt free
and let myself be,

00:06:10.208 --> 00:06:13.518
I saw a glimpse
of that new world I longed for,

00:06:13.542 --> 00:06:17.726
a world where a girl like me
is no longer a liability or a burden

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.393
but a person of use, a person of value

00:06:20.417 --> 00:06:22.083
and a person of worthiness.

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:27.226
By the time my fellowship ended,
my life had changed.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.726
Not only had I traced my lost voice,

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.042
but also had a choice
to make myself useful.
