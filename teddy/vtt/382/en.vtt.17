00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:30.667
at any point in her life.

00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:33.808
Padma, Anitha and Kaviarasi

00:08:33.832 --> 00:08:36.558
grew up in the most tough
families and communities

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:38.250
one could only imagine.

00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:42.558
Yet the journey of finding
my usefulness in this world

00:08:42.582 --> 00:08:45.708
served them in finding
their usefulness to this world.

00:08:47.958 --> 00:08:49.559
Of course there are challenges.

00:08:49.583 --> 00:08:52.268
I'm aware change
does not happen overnight.

00:08:52.292 --> 00:08:56.684
A lot of my work involves working
with families and communities

00:08:56.708 --> 00:08:59.601
to help them understand
why getting an education

00:08:59.625 --> 00:09:01.083
is useful for everyone.
