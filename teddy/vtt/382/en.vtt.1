She asked me how much money
she has earned that week.

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:33.893
I went through that book,

00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:38.333
and what caught my eyes
were her thumbprints on each page.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.167
My mother has never been to school.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:46.393
She uses her thumbprints
instead of a signature

00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:48.333
to keep a record of her earnings.

00:00:49.292 --> 00:00:51.768
On that day, for some reason,

00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:56.226
I wanted to teach her
how to hold a pen and write her name.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.268
She was reluctant at first.

00:00:58.292 --> 00:01:00.958
She smiled innocently and said no.
