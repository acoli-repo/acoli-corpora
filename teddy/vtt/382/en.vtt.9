00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.184
My father was confused,
my mother was worried,

00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:32.934
but I felt butterflies in my stomach

00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.976
because I was going
to step out of my village

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.309
for the first time

00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:39.333
to study in the national capital.

00:04:41.292 --> 00:04:43.809
Of the 97 fellows selected that year,

00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:46.375
I was the only rural college graduate.

00:04:47.292 --> 00:04:50.125
There was no one there
who looked like me or spoke like me.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.208
I felt alienated, intimidated
and judged by many.

00:04:56.375 --> 00:04:58.708
One fellow called me "Coconut Girl."

00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:01.893
Can you guess why?
