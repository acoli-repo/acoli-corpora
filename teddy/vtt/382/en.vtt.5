All throughout my childhood,
as I rolled bidis alongside my mother,

00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:33.518
I would wonder:

00:02:33.542 --> 00:02:35.167
What did my future hold?

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:39.893
I often asked my mother,
with a lot of anxiety,

00:02:39.917 --> 00:02:42.750
"Amma, will my life
be different from yours?

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:45.833
Will I have a chance to choose my life?

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.542
Will I go to college?"

00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.792
And she would reply back,

00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:55.208
"Try to finish high school first."

00:02:56.458 --> 00:03:00.059
I am sure my mother
did not mean to discourage me.
