00:07:29.872 --> 00:07:35.048
and you're feeling intense energy,
intense focus, intense motivation

00:07:35.072 --> 00:07:39.579
and the willingness to risk it all,
to win life's greatest prize.

00:07:41.477 --> 00:07:44.371
So, what have I learned
from this experiment

00:07:44.395 --> 00:07:46.117
that I would like to tell the world?

00:07:46.141 --> 00:07:48.519
Foremost, I have come to think

00:07:48.543 --> 00:07:51.965
that romantic love is a drive,
a basic mating drive.

00:07:51.989 --> 00:07:53.165
Not the sex drive --

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:56.059
the sex drive gets you looking
for a whole range of partners.

00:07:56.083 --> 00:07:58.589
Romantic love enables you
to focus your mating energy

00:07:58.613 --> 00:08:01.411
on just one at a time,
conserve your mating energy,
