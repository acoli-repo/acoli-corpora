The question that I'm working on
right this minute --

00:12:02.309 --> 00:12:05.050
and I'm only going to say it
for a second, and then end --

00:12:05.074 --> 00:12:08.149
is, why do you fall in love
with one person, rather than another?

00:12:08.173 --> 00:12:10.976
I never would have
even thought to think of this,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.976
but Match.com, the Internet dating site,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.795
came to me three years ago
and asked me that question.

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:17.144
And I said, I don't know.

00:12:17.168 --> 00:12:20.545
I know what happens in the brain,
when you do become in love,

00:12:20.569 --> 00:12:24.086
but I don't know why you fall in love
with one person rather than another.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.872
And so, I've spent
the last three years on this.

00:12:26.896 --> 00:12:29.908
And there are many reasons
that you fall in love with one person

00:12:29.932 --> 00:12:32.423
rather than another,
that psychologists can tell you.
