00:14:29.777 --> 00:14:31.778
and this reminds me of it.

00:14:31.802 --> 00:14:33.226
These are two women.

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.382
Women tend to get intimacy
differently than men do.

00:14:36.406 --> 00:14:38.666
Women get intimacy
from face-to-face talking.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.587
We swivel towards each other,

00:14:40.611 --> 00:14:44.713
we do what we call
the "anchoring gaze" and we talk.

00:14:44.737 --> 00:14:46.300
This is intimacy to women.

00:14:46.324 --> 00:14:48.209
I think it comes from millions of years

00:14:48.233 --> 00:14:50.315
of holding that baby
in front of your face,

00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:53.749
cajoling it, reprimanding it,
educating it with words.

00:14:53.773 --> 00:14:57.366
Men tend to get intimacy
from side-by-side doing.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.760
As soon as one guy looks up,
the other guy will look away.
