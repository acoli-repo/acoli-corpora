by my colleague, Art Aron --

00:11:30.618 --> 00:11:33.779
putting people who are reporting
that they are still in love,

00:11:33.803 --> 00:11:36.941
in a long-term relationship,
into the functional MRI.

00:11:36.965 --> 00:11:39.318
We've put five people in so far,

00:11:39.342 --> 00:11:42.398
and indeed, we found exactly
the same thing.

00:11:42.422 --> 00:11:43.763
They're not lying.

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:49.770
The brain areas associated
with intense romantic love

00:11:49.794 --> 00:11:53.795
still become active, 25 years later.

00:11:54.556 --> 00:11:56.976
There are still many questions
to be answered

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.746
and asked about romantic love.

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.285
The question that I'm working on
right this minute --
