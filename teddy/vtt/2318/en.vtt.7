Emily Dickinson once wrote,
"Parting is all we need to know of hell."

00:03:32.856 --> 00:03:34.974
How many people have suffered

00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:37.976
in all the millions of years
of human evolution?

00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:40.752
How many people around the world

00:03:40.776 --> 00:03:43.641
are dancing with elation
at this very minute?

00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:47.909
Romantic love is one of the most powerful
sensations on Earth.

00:03:48.377 --> 00:03:51.811
So, several years ago,
I decided to look into the brain

00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:54.365
and study this madness.

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.276
Our first study of people
who were happily in love

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.641
has been widely publicized,

00:03:58.665 --> 00:04:01.159
so I'm only going to say
very little about it.
