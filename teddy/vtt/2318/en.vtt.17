I've also come to believe
that romantic love is an addiction:

00:08:32.392 --> 00:08:34.939
a perfectly wonderful addiction
when it's going well,

00:08:34.963 --> 00:08:38.035
and a perfectly horrible addiction
when it's going poorly.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.847
And indeed, it has all
of the characteristics of addiction.

00:08:40.871 --> 00:08:44.224
You focus on the person,
you obsessively think about them,

00:08:44.248 --> 00:08:46.976
you crave them, you distort reality,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.943
your willingness to take enormous
risks to win this person.

00:08:50.324 --> 00:08:53.011
And it's got the three main
characteristics of addiction:

00:08:53.035 --> 00:08:55.716
tolerance, you need to see them
more, and more, and more;

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.277
withdrawals;

00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:58.699
and last: relapse.

00:08:58.723 --> 00:09:02.349
I've got a girlfriend who's just
getting over a terrible love affair.
