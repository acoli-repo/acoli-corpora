00:12:58.072 --> 00:13:02.608
And I have concocted a questionnaire
to see to what degree

00:13:02.632 --> 00:13:06.976
you express dopamine, serotonin,
estrogen and testosterone.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.271
I think we've evolved four
very broad personality types

00:13:10.295 --> 00:13:13.976
associated with the ratios
of these four chemicals in the brain.

00:13:14.418 --> 00:13:18.619
And on this dating site
that I have created, called Chemistry.com,

00:13:18.643 --> 00:13:22.252
I ask you first a series of questions

00:13:22.276 --> 00:13:25.409
to see to what degree
you express these chemicals,

00:13:25.433 --> 00:13:28.469
and I'm watching who chooses who to love.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.408
And 3.7 million people have taken
the questionnaire in America.
