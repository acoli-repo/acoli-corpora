In one study of college students,
they asked a lot of questions about love,

00:02:00.763 --> 00:02:03.702
but the two that stood out
to me the most were:

00:02:03.726 --> 00:02:07.894
"Have you ever been rejected
by somebody who you really loved?"

00:02:08.356 --> 00:02:09.773
And the second question was:

00:02:09.797 --> 00:02:13.311
"Have you ever dumped somebody
who really loved you?"

00:02:13.613 --> 00:02:18.403
And almost 95 percent of both men
and women said yes to both.

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.575
Almost nobody gets out of love alive.

00:02:22.528 --> 00:02:25.783
So, before I start telling you
about the brain,

00:02:25.807 --> 00:02:27.267
I want to read for you

00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:29.976
what I think is the most powerful
love poem on Earth.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.817
There's other love poems that are,
of course, just as good,
