00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.528
I and my colleagues Art Aron
and Lucy Brown and others,

00:00:04.552 --> 00:00:09.109
have put 37 people who are madly in love
into a functional MRI brain scanner.

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:13.006
17 who were happily in love,
15 who had just been dumped,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.166
and we're just starting
our third experiment:

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.696
studying people who report
that they're still in love

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.976
after 10 to 25 years of marriage.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.976
So, this is the short story
of that research.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.322
In the jungles of Guatemala,
in Tikal, stands a temple.

00:00:29.124 --> 00:00:34.091
It was built by the grandest Sun King,
of the grandest city-state,
