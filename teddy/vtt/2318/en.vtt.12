00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.129
That brain system -- the reward system

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:05.976
for wanting, for motivation,
for craving, for focus --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.462
becomes more active
when you can't get what you want.

00:06:09.486 --> 00:06:13.739
In this case, life's greatest prize:
an appropriate mating partner.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.028
We found activity
in other brain regions also --

00:06:17.052 --> 00:06:21.944
in a brain region associated
with calculating gains and losses.

00:06:21.968 --> 00:06:24.315
You're lying there,
you're looking at the picture,

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:25.648
and you're in this machine,

00:06:25.672 --> 00:06:27.845
and you're calculating what went wrong.

00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:30.417
What have I lost?
