I've got a girlfriend who's just
getting over a terrible love affair.

00:09:02.373 --> 00:09:05.256
It's been about eight months,
she's beginning to feel better.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.746
And she was driving along
in her car the other day,

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.938
and suddenly she heard a song
on the car radio

00:09:09.962 --> 00:09:11.397
that reminded her of this man.

00:09:11.421 --> 00:09:14.284
Not only did the instant
craving come back,

00:09:14.308 --> 00:09:17.858
but she had to pull over
from the side of the road and cry.

00:09:18.374 --> 00:09:20.741
So, one thing I would like
the medical community,

00:09:20.765 --> 00:09:23.464
and the legal community,
and even the college community,

00:09:23.488 --> 00:09:27.301
to see if they can understand,
that indeed, romantic love

00:09:27.325 --> 00:09:30.391
is one of the most addictive
substances on Earth.
