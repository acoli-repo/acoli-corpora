As a matter of fact,
ethologists know this.

00:10:01.027 --> 00:10:04.976
There are over eight words
for what they call "animal favoritism:"

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.489
selective proceptivity, mate choice,
female choice, sexual choice.

00:10:10.513 --> 00:10:13.489
And indeed, there are now
three academic articles

00:10:13.513 --> 00:10:15.976
in which they've looked
at this attraction,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.976
which may only last for a second,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.711
but it's a definite attraction,

00:10:19.735 --> 00:10:23.017
and either this same brain region,
this reward system,

00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:26.594
or the chemicals of that reward
system are involved.

00:10:26.618 --> 00:10:29.232
In fact, I think animal attraction
can be instant --

00:10:29.256 --> 00:10:31.976
you can see an elephant
instantly go for another elephant.
