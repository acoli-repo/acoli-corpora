00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:02.087
And every spring and autumn,
exactly at the equinox,

00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:04.546
the sun rises behind his temple,

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.606
and perfectly bathes her temple
with his shadow.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.381
And as the sun sets
behind her temple in the afternoon,

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:17.044
it perfectly bathes
his temple with her shadow.

00:01:17.413 --> 00:01:23.524
After 1,300 years, these two lovers
still touch and kiss from their tomb.

00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:26.769
Around the world, people love.

00:01:26.793 --> 00:01:29.537
They sing for love, they dance for love,

00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:32.569
they compose poems and stories about love.
