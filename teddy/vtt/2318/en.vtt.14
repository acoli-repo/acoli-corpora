00:06:58.697 --> 00:07:03.594
when you're willing to take enormous risks
for huge gains and huge losses.

00:07:03.618 --> 00:07:06.880
Last but not least,
we found activity in a brain region

00:07:06.904 --> 00:07:10.613
associated with deep attachment
to another individual.

00:07:11.583 --> 00:07:17.706
No wonder people suffer around the world,
and we have so many crimes of passion.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.846
When you've been rejected in love,

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.799
not only are you engulfed
with feelings of romantic love,

00:07:23.823 --> 00:07:26.577
but you're feeling deep
attachment to this individual.

00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:29.848
Moreover, this brain circuit
for reward is working,

00:07:29.872 --> 00:07:35.048
and you're feeling intense energy,
intense focus, intense motivation
