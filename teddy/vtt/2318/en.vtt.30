00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.760
As soon as one guy looks up,
the other guy will look away.

00:15:00.784 --> 00:15:02.483
(Laughter)

00:15:02.507 --> 00:15:07.604
I think it comes from millions of years
sitting behind the bush,

00:15:07.628 --> 00:15:11.666
looking straight ahead, trying to hit
that buffalo on the head with a rock.

00:15:12.099 --> 00:15:14.866
I think, for millions of years,
men faced their enemies,

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:17.618
they sat side-by-side with friends.

00:15:17.642 --> 00:15:21.894
So my final statement is: love is in us.

00:15:21.918 --> 00:15:24.486
It's deeply embedded in the brain.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.315
Our challenge is to understand each other.

00:15:27.339 --> 00:15:28.540
Thank you.

00:15:28.564 --> 00:15:32.984
