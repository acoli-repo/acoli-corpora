00:03:58.665 --> 00:04:01.159
so I'm only going to say
very little about it.

00:04:01.183 --> 00:04:05.163
We found activity in a tiny,
little factory near the base of the brain

00:04:05.187 --> 00:04:07.333
called the ventral tegmental area.

00:04:07.357 --> 00:04:10.501
We found activity in some cells
called the A10 cells,

00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:13.454
cells that actually make
dopamine, a natural stimulant,

00:04:13.478 --> 00:04:15.754
and spray it to many brain regions.

00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:19.889
Indeed, this part, the VTA,
is part of the brain's reward system.

00:04:19.913 --> 00:04:22.486
It's way below your cognitive
thinking process.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.101
It's below your emotions.

00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:27.354
It's part of what we call
the reptilian core of the brain,

00:04:27.378 --> 00:04:32.624
associated with wanting, with motivation,
with focus and with craving.
