associated with wanting, with motivation,
with focus and with craving.

00:04:32.648 --> 00:04:35.754
In fact, the same brain region
where we found activity

00:04:35.778 --> 00:04:38.976
becomes active also
when you feel the rush of cocaine.

00:04:39.651 --> 00:04:42.594
But romantic love is much more
than a cocaine high --

00:04:42.618 --> 00:04:44.929
at least you come down from cocaine.

00:04:44.953 --> 00:04:48.234
Romantic love is an obsession,
it possesses you.

00:04:48.258 --> 00:04:49.917
You lose your sense of self.

00:04:49.941 --> 00:04:53.309
You can't stop thinking
about another human being.

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:55.726
Somebody is camping in your head.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.715
As an eighth-century Japanese poet said,
"My longing had no time when it ceases."
