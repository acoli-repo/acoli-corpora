00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.483
Pain like a boil about to burst
with my love for you,

00:03:00.507 --> 00:03:03.598
consumed by fire with my love for you.

00:03:03.622 --> 00:03:05.728
I remember what you said to me.

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:07.837
I am thinking of your love for me.

00:03:07.861 --> 00:03:10.186
I am torn by your love for me.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.148
Pain and more pain --

00:03:12.172 --> 00:03:14.209
where are you going with my love?

00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:16.009
I am told you will go from here.

00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:18.476
I am told you will leave me here.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.665
My body is numb with grief.

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:22.748
Remember what I said, my love.

00:03:22.772 --> 00:03:24.876
Goodbye, my love, goodbye."

00:03:26.645 --> 00:03:30.994
Emily Dickinson once wrote,
"Parting is all we need to know of hell."
