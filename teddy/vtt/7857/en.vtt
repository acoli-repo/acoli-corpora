It was Christmas Day, 1995.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.085
My brother Rich and I, we're up early,

00:00:06.085 --> 00:00:07.962
we're excited, it's Christmas.

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:09.464
He rushed into my room

00:00:09.505 --> 00:00:14.302
and in there my father had left
his IBM ThinkPad and a note.

00:00:15.303 --> 00:00:20.683
"This is so you don't wake up
your mother and me early.

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:22.727
Merry Christmas."

00:00:22.727 --> 00:00:24.854
Next to it was a present.

00:00:24.896 --> 00:00:28.649
It was a video game,
a football game, FIFA '96.

00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:29.942
We tore it open,

00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:32.111
put it into that laptop
and we huddled around
