00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.120
and relate to,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.000
we can avoid the crisis altogether.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.416
I was a commodities trader in my past life

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.616
and one of the things
that I learned trading

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.520
is that every market has a tipping point,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.936
the point at which
change occurs so rapidly

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.816
that it impacts the world

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.800
and things change forever.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.680
Think of the last financial crisis,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.480
or the dot-com crash.
