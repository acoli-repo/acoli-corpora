00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.416
And this, by the way, is actually assuming
we take all the extra calories

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.821
produced in North America,
South America and Europe

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.120
and export them solely
to India, China and Africa.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.680
What I just presented to you
is a vision of an impossible world.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.360
We can do something to change that.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.696
We can change consumption patterns,

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.976
we can reduce food waste,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.216
or we can make a bold commitment

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.560
to increasing yields exponentially.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.856
Now, I'm not going to go into discussing

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.376
changing consumption patterns
or reducing food waste,
