00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.240
So here's my concern.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.816
We could have a tipping point

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.976
in global food and agriculture

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.895
if surging demand

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:17.320
surpasses the agricultural system's
structural capacity to produce food.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.976
This means at this point supply
can no longer keep up with demand

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.256
despite exploding prices,

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.360
unless we can commit
to some type of structural change.
