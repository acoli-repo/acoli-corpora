00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.976
Blue countries are net calorie exporters,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.376
or self-sufficient.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.440
They have some in storage for a rainy day.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.896
Red countries are net calorie importers.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.856
The deeper, the brighter the red,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.120
the more you're importing.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.656
40 years ago, such few countries
were net exporters of calories,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.252
I could count them with one hand.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.456
Most of the African continent,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.096
Europe, most of Asia,

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.136
South America excluding Argentina,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.880
were all net importers of calories.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.180
And what's surprising is that China
used to actually be food self-sufficient.
