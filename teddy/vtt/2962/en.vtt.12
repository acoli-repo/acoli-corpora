00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.960
So let me break this down differently.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.216
An alternative way to think about this

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.096
is to think about it in Big Macs.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.736
214 trillion calories.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.976
A single Big Mac has 563 calories.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.216
That means the world will be short
379 billion Big Macs in 2027.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.240
That is more Big Macs
than McDonald's has ever produced.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.016
So how did we get
to these numbers in the first place?
