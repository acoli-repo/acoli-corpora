00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.016
So how did we get
to these numbers in the first place?

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.240
They're not made up.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.216
This map shows you
where the world was 40 years ago.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.256
It shows you net calorie gaps
in every country in the world.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.736
Now, simply put,

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.776
this is just calories
consumed in that country

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.856
minus calories produced
in that same country.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.656
This is not a statement
on malnutrition or anything else.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.696
It's simply saying how many calories
are consumed in a single year

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.576
minus how many are produced.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.976
Blue countries are net calorie exporters,
