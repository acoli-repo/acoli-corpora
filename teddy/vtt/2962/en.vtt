Since 2009, the world has been stuck

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.816
on a single narrative
around a coming global food crisis

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.280
and what we need to do to avoid it.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.400
How do we feed
nine billion people by 2050?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.056
Every conference, podcast
and dialogue around global food security

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.776
starts with this question

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.536
and goes on to answer it

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.000
by saying we need to produce
70 percent more food.
