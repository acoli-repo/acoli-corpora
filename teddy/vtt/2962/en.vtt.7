00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.456
not just world leaders,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.736
but businesses and citizens
like every single person in this room,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.840
lacked an actionable guide

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.376
on how we can avoid
a coming global food security crisis.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.416
And so we built a model,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.336
leveraging the petabytes
of data we sit on,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.760
and we solved for the tipping point.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.176
Now, no one knows
we've been working on this problem

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.800
and this is the first time
that I'm sharing what we discovered.
