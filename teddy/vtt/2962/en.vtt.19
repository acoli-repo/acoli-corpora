00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.240
where do we go from here?

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.336
Oddly enough,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.560
it's not a new story,

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.176
except this time
it's not just a story of China.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.576
It's a continuation of China,

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.696
an amplification of Africa

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.680
and a paradigm shift in India.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.120
By 2023,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.056
Africa's population is forecasted
to overtake that of India's and China's.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.736
By 2023, these three regions combined

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.920
will make up over half
the world's population.
