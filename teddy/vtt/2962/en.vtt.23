00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.256
have been able to meet these deficits

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.120
by importing from surplus regions.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.536
By surplus regions, I'm talking about

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.696
North America, South America and Europe.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.136
This line chart over here shows you

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.456
the growth and the projected growth
over the next decade of production

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.776
from North America,
South America and Europe.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.216
What it doesn't show you

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.680
is that most of this growth is actually
going to come from South America.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.056
And most of this growth

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.480
is going to come
at the huge cost of deforestation.
