00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.416
and that's intentional, because until now

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.656

quantified using mass:

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.496

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.600
whatever your unit of choice is in mass.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.880
Why do we talk about food

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.776

We can look at a photograph

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.576
by using a simple pocket calculator.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.360
We can weigh trucks,
airplanes and oxcarts.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.920

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.176
Not all foods are created equal,
