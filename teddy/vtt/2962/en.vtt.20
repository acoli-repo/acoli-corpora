00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.416
This crossover point starts to present
really interesting challenges

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.176
for global food security.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.600
And a few years later,
we're hit hard with that reality.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.480
What does the world look like in 10 years?

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.016
So far, as I mentioned,
India has been food self-sufficient.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.440
Most forecasters predict
that this will continue.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.400
We disagree.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.296
India will soon become
a net importer of calories.
