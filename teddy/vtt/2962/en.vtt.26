00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.376
changing consumption patterns
or reducing food waste,

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.456
because those conversations
have been going on for some time now.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.696
Nothing has happened.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:10.176
Nothing has happened
because those arguments

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.136
ask the surplus regions
to change their behavior

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.600
on behalf of deficit regions.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.456
Waiting for others
to change their behavior

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.976
on your behalf, for your survival,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.496
is a terrible idea.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.120
It's unproductive.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.280
So I'd like to suggest an alternative
that comes from the red regions.
