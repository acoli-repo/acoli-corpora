00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.416
A young and growing population

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.536
combined with significant economic growth

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.976
made its mark with a big bang

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.480
and no one in the markets saw it coming.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.256
This flip was everything
to global agricultural markets.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.096
Luckily now, South America

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:21.336
was starting to boom
at the same time as China's rise,

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.360
and so therefore, supply and demand
were still somewhat balanced.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.720
So the question becomes,

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.240
where do we go from here?
