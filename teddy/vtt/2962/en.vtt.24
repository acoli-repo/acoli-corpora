00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.360
coming from India, China
and the African continent,

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.016
and look at it versus
the combined increase in production

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.816
coming from India,
China, the African continent,

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.200
North America, South America and Europe,

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.696
you are left with
a 214-trillion-calorie deficit,

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.456
one we can't produce.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.416
And this, by the way, is actually assuming
we take all the extra calories
