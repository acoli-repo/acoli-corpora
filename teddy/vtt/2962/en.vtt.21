00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.296
India will soon become
a net importer of calories.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.576
This will be driven both by the fact

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.096
that demand is growing
from a population growth standpoint

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.376
plus economic growth.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.656
It will be driven by both.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.376
And even if you have
optimistic assumptions

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.296
around production growth,

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.440
it will make that slight flip.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.880
That slight flip
can have huge implications.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.336
Next, Africa will continue
to be a net importer of calories,

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.360
again driven by population growth
and economic growth.
