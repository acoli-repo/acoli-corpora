00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.016
This is again assuming optimistic
production growth assumptions.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.456
Then China,

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.056
where population is flattening out,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.056
calorie consumption will explode

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.096
because the types of calories consumed

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:16.640
are also starting to be
higher-calorie-content foods.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.336
And so therefore,

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.216
these three regions combined

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.536
start to present a really interesting
challenge for the world.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.656
Until now, countries with calorie deficits

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.256
have been able to meet these deficits
