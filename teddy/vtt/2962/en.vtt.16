00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.240
to the brightest red
that you see on this map.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.640
How did we get here? What happened?

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.800
So this chart shows you India and Africa.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.760
Blue line is India, red line is Africa.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.576
How is it that two regions
that started off so similarly

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.736
in such similar trajectories

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.896
take such different paths?

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.960
India had a green revolution.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.096
Not a single African country
had a green revolution.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.336
The net outcome?

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.056
India is food self-sufficient
