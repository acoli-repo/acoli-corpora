00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.280
So I'd like to suggest an alternative
that comes from the red regions.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.336
China, India, Africa.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.656
China is constrained in terms
of how much more land it actually has

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.216
available for agriculture,

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.016
and it has massive
water resource availability issues.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.680
So the answer really lies
in India and in Africa.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.776
India has some upside
in terms of potential yield increases.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.376
Now this is the gap
between its current yield

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.520
and the theoretical
maximum yield it can achieve.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.936
It has some unfarmed
arable land remaining, but not much,
