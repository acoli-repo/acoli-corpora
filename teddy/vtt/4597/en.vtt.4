00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.454
but even that quickly leads 
to morally murky decisions.

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:03.621
For example,

00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:05.621
let's say we have the same initial set up,

00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:08.496
but now there's a motorcyclist 
wearing a helmet to your left

00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:11.288
and another one without 
a helmet to your right.

00:02:11.288 --> 00:02:14.371
Which one should 
your robot car crash into?

00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:18.454
If you say the biker with the helmet
because she's more likely to survive,

00:02:18.454 --> 00:02:21.371
then aren't you penalizing 
the responsible motorist?

00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:24.121
If, instead, you save the biker 
without the helmet

00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:26.121
because he's acting irresponsibly,

00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:30.996
then you've gone way beyond the initial
design principle about minimizing harm,
