00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:30.788
And who should be making 
all of these decisions anyhow?

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.538
Programmers? Companies?
Governments?

00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:37.579
Reality may not play out exactly
like our thought experiments,

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.246
but that's not the point.

00:03:39.246 --> 00:03:43.579
They're designed to isolate 
and stress test our intuitions on ethics,

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.579
just like science experiments do
for the physical world.

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.954
Spotting these moral hairpin turns now

00:03:49.954 --> 00:03:53.538
will help us maneuver the unfamiliar road
of technology ethics,

00:03:53.538 --> 00:03:57.288
and allow us to cruise confidently
and conscientiously

00:03:57.288 --> 00:03:59.663
into our brave new future.
