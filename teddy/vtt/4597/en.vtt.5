00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:30.996
then you've gone way beyond the initial
design principle about minimizing harm,

00:02:30.996 --> 00:02:34.871
and the robot car is now 
meting out street justice.

00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:38.413
The ethical considerations 
get more complicated here.

00:02:38.413 --> 00:02:39.788
In both of our scenarios,

00:02:39.788 --> 00:02:44.288
the underlying design is functioning
as a targeting algorithm of sorts.

00:02:44.288 --> 00:02:45.288
In other words,

00:02:45.288 --> 00:02:47.788
it's systematically favoring 
or discriminating

00:02:47.788 --> 00:02:51.288
against a certain type 
of object to crash into.

00:02:51.288 --> 00:02:53.621
And the owners of the target vehicles

00:02:53.621 --> 00:02:56.663
will suffer the negative consequences
of this algorithm

00:02:56.663 --> 00:02:58.746
through no fault of their own.

00:02:58.746 --> 00:03:03.413
Our new technologies are opening up
many other novel ethical dilemmas.
