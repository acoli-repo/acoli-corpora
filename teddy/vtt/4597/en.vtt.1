00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:31.663
go straight and hit the object,

00:00:31.663 --> 00:00:33.954
swerve left into an SUV,

00:00:33.954 --> 00:00:36.954
or swerve right into a motorcycle.

00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:40.454
Should it prioritize your safety
by hitting the motorcycle,

00:00:40.454 --> 00:00:43.246
minimize danger to others by not swerving,

00:00:43.246 --> 00:00:47.329
even if it means hitting the large object
and sacrificing your life,

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.079
or take the middle ground
by hitting the SUV,

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.079
which has a high passenger safety rating?

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.287
So what should the self-driving car do?

00:00:56.287 --> 00:00:59.496
If we were driving that boxed in car
in manual mode,

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:03.037
whichever way we'd react
would be understood as just that,
