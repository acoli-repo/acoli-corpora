00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:03.037
whichever way we'd react
would be understood as just that,

00:01:03.037 --> 00:01:04.329
a reaction,

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:06.579
not a deliberate decision.

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:10.871
It would be an instinctual panicked move
with no forethought or malice.

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:14.496
But if a programmer were to instruct
the car to make the same move,

00:01:14.496 --> 00:01:17.329
given conditions it may 
sense in the future,

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.621
well, that looks more
like premeditated homicide.

00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:22.621
Now, to be fair,

00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:26.704
self-driving cars are predicted 
to dramatically reduce traffic accidents

00:01:26.704 --> 00:01:27.954
and fatalities

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:31.121
by removing human error 
from the driving equation.
