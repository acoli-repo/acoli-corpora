00:00:07.246 --> 00:00:09.288
This is a thought experiment.

00:00:09.288 --> 00:00:11.913
Let's say at some point
in the not so distant future,

00:00:11.913 --> 00:00:15.496
you're barreling down the highway
in your self-driving car,

00:00:15.496 --> 00:00:19.788
and you find yourself boxed in
on all sides by other cars.

00:00:19.788 --> 00:00:24.204
Suddenly, a large, heavy object
falls off the truck in front of you.

00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:27.371
Your car can't stop in time
to avoid the collision,

00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:29.413
so it needs to make a decision:

00:00:29.413 --> 00:00:31.663
go straight and hit the object,
