00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:31.121
by removing human error 
from the driving equation.

00:01:31.121 --> 00:01:33.496
Plus, there may be all sorts 
of other benefits:

00:01:33.496 --> 00:01:35.163
eased road congestion,

00:01:35.163 --> 00:01:36.704
decreased harmful emissions,

00:01:36.704 --> 00:01:41.329
and minimized unproductive
and stressful driving time.

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.496
But accidents can and will still happen,

00:01:43.496 --> 00:01:44.663
and when they do,

00:01:44.663 --> 00:01:49.163
their outcomes may be determined
months or years in advance

00:01:49.163 --> 00:01:51.746
by programmers or policy makers.

00:01:51.746 --> 00:01:54.246
And they'll have 
some difficult decisions to make.

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:57.204
It's tempting to offer up general 
decision-making principles,

00:01:57.204 --> 00:01:59.079
like minimize harm,

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.454
but even that quickly leads 
to morally murky decisions.
