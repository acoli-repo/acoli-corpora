00:02:58.746 --> 00:03:03.413
Our new technologies are opening up
many other novel ethical dilemmas.

00:03:03.413 --> 00:03:05.496
For instance, if you had to 
choose between

00:03:05.496 --> 00:03:09.538
a car that would always save
as many lives as possible in an accident,

00:03:09.538 --> 00:03:12.579
or one that would save you at any cost,

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.246
which would you buy?

00:03:14.246 --> 00:03:17.579
What happens if the cars start analyzing
and factoring in

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.038
the passengers of the cars
and the particulars of their lives?

00:03:21.038 --> 00:03:23.204
Could it be the case 
that a random decision

00:03:23.204 --> 00:03:28.121
is still better than a predetermined one
designed to minimize harm?

00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:30.788
And who should be making 
all of these decisions anyhow?
