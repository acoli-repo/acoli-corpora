00:00:27.803 --> 00:00:30.033
With a sneaky look,
she opened up the suitcase,

00:00:30.057 --> 00:00:35.172
and inside were six glorious,
multicolored turds.

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:37.283
The Cambridge team, she explained,

00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:40.220
had spent their summer
engineering the bacteria E. coli

00:00:40.244 --> 00:00:43.006
to be able to sense different things
in the environment

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.974
and produce a rainbow
of different colors in response.

00:00:45.998 --> 00:00:47.727
Arsenic in your drinking water?

00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:49.320
This strain would turn green.

00:00:49.344 --> 00:00:51.725
She and her collaborator,
the designer James King,

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.042
worked with the students and imagined
the different possible scenarios

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.828
of how you might use these bacteria.

00:00:56.852 --> 00:00:58.880
What if, they asked, you could use them

00:00:58.904 --> 00:01:03.190
as a living probiotic drink
and health monitor, all in one?
