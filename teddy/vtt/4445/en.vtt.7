00:03:27.688 --> 00:03:30.458
that GMOs are so polarizing
in our society?

00:03:30.482 --> 00:03:32.482
Can we make GMOs that people love?

00:03:33.315 --> 00:03:38.939
Can we use biology to make technology
that's more expansive and regenerative?

00:03:38.963 --> 00:03:42.733
I think it starts by recognizing
that we, as synthetic biologists,

00:03:42.757 --> 00:03:46.680
are also shaped by a culture
that values "real engineering"

00:03:46.704 --> 00:03:48.704
more than any of the squishy stuff.

00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:53.590
We get so caught up in circuits
and what happens inside of computers,

00:03:53.614 --> 00:03:57.256
that we sometimes lose sight of the magic
that's happening inside of us.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.918
There is plenty of shitty
technology out there,

00:03:59.942 --> 00:04:04.410
but this was the first time
that I imagined poop as technology.
