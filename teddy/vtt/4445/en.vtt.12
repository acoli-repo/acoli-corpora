Computers make sense and are rational,

00:06:01.165 --> 00:06:04.500
and biology is an unpredictable tangle.

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:06.721
It kind of follows from there

00:06:06.745 --> 00:06:09.950
that science and technology
are supposed to be rational,

00:06:09.974 --> 00:06:11.426
objective

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.403
and pure,

00:06:13.427 --> 00:06:16.048
and it's humans that are a total mess.

00:06:16.407 --> 00:06:18.645
But like synthetic biologists poke holes

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.701
in that line between nature
and technology,

00:06:21.725 --> 00:06:24.201
artists, designers and social scientists

00:06:24.225 --> 00:06:28.498
showed me that the lines that we draw
between nature, technology and society

00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:30.895
are a little bit softer
than we might think.
