00:08:57.376 --> 00:09:00.114
I wanted to take a piece
of science's past,

00:09:00.138 --> 00:09:02.296
tied up as it was with colonialism,

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.712
and all of the embedded ideas

00:09:03.736 --> 00:09:07.807
of the way that nature and science
and society should work together,

00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:10.664
and ask questions about science's future.

00:09:11.109 --> 00:09:13.014
Working with an awesome team at Ginkgo,

00:09:13.038 --> 00:09:14.982
and others at UC Santa Cruz,

00:09:15.006 --> 00:09:17.609
we were able to extract
a little bit of the DNA

00:09:17.633 --> 00:09:20.133
from a tiny sliver of this plant specimen

00:09:20.157 --> 00:09:22.268
and to sequence the DNA inside.

00:09:22.292 --> 00:09:25.439
And then resynthesize a possible version

00:09:25.463 --> 00:09:28.629
of the genes that made
the smell of the plant.

00:09:28.653 --> 00:09:31.026
By inserting those genes into yeast,
