00:06:28.522 --> 00:06:30.895
are a little bit softer
than we might think.

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:34.399
They challenge us to reconsider
our visions for the future

00:06:34.423 --> 00:06:37.360
and our fantasies
about controlling nature.

00:06:37.384 --> 00:06:40.971
They show us how our prejudices,
our hopes and our values

00:06:40.995 --> 00:06:43.222
are embedded in science and technology

00:06:43.246 --> 00:06:46.229
through the questions that we ask
and the choices that we make.

00:06:46.253 --> 00:06:50.601
They make visible the ways
that science and technology are human

00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:52.260
and therefore political.

00:06:52.284 --> 00:06:54.768
What does it mean for us
to be able to control life

00:06:54.792 --> 00:06:56.339
for our own purposes?

00:06:56.363 --> 00:06:58.212
The artists Oron Catts and Ionat Zurr

00:06:58.236 --> 00:07:00.371
made a project
called "Victimless Leather,"
