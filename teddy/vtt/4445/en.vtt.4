and tissue printers
and plastic-eating bacteria.

00:02:01.165 --> 00:02:02.561
Up until that moment, though,

00:02:02.585 --> 00:02:05.800
I was a little bit more concerned
with a different kind of oxymoron.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.236
Just plain old genetic engineering.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.348
The comedian Simon Munnery once wrote

00:02:10.372 --> 00:02:15.264
that genetic engineering is actually
insulting to proper engineering.

00:02:15.288 --> 00:02:19.153
Genetic engineering is more like throwing
a bunch of concrete and steel in a river

00:02:19.177 --> 00:02:21.967
and if somebody can walk across,
you call it a bridge.

00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:25.196
And so synthetic biologists
were pretty worried about this,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.910
and worried that genetic engineering
was a little bit more art that science.

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:33.472
They wanted to turn genetic engineering
into a real engineering discipline,
