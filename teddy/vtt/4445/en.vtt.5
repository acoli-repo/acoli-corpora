00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:33.472
They wanted to turn genetic engineering
into a real engineering discipline,

00:02:33.496 --> 00:02:37.401
where we could program cells and write DNA

00:02:37.425 --> 00:02:41.093
the way that engineers write
software for computers.

00:02:41.117 --> 00:02:45.641
That day 10 years ago started me on a path
that gets me to where I am now.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.283
Today, I'm the creative director

00:02:47.307 --> 00:02:50.131
at a synthetic biology company
called Ginkgo Bioworks.

00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:52.154
"Creative director" is a weird title

00:02:52.178 --> 00:02:54.734
for a biotech company
were people try to program life

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:56.758
the way that we program computers.

00:02:57.165 --> 00:02:59.220
But that day when I met Daisy,

00:02:59.244 --> 00:03:01.085
I learned something about engineering.
