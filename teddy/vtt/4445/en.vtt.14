00:06:58.236 --> 00:07:00.371
made a project
called "Victimless Leather,"

00:07:00.395 --> 00:07:03.283
where they engineered
a tiny leather jacket

00:07:03.307 --> 00:07:04.776
out of mouse cells.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.990
Is this jacket alive?

00:07:07.014 --> 00:07:10.291
What does it take to grow it
and keep it this way?

00:07:10.315 --> 00:07:11.910
Is it really victimless?

00:07:11.934 --> 00:07:14.545
And what does it mean
for something to be victimless?

00:07:15.022 --> 00:07:16.236
The choices that we make

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.760
in what we show and what we hide
in our stories of progress,

00:07:19.784 --> 00:07:23.487
are often political choices
that have real consequences.

00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:27.764
How will genetic technologies
shape the way that we understand ourselves

00:07:27.788 --> 00:07:29.217
and define our bodies?

00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:31.839
