The artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg
made these faces

00:07:31.863 --> 00:07:34.918
based on DNA sequences
she extracted from sidewalk litter,

00:07:34.942 --> 00:07:38.145
forcing us to ask questions
about genetic privacy,

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:41.867
but also how and whether
DNA can really define us.

00:07:42.249 --> 00:07:45.387
How will we fight against
and cope with climate change?

00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:47.633
Will we change the way
that we make everything,

00:07:47.657 --> 00:07:51.760
using biological materials
that can grow and decay alongside us?

00:07:51.784 --> 00:07:54.077
Will we change our own bodies?

00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:55.942
Or nature itself?

00:07:55.966 --> 00:08:00.076
Or can we change the system
that keeps reinforcing those boundaries
