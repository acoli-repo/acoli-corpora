Science and science fiction

00:04:31.141 --> 00:04:33.728
help us remember
that we're made of star stuff.

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:36.426
But can it also help us remember
the wonder and weirdness

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.125
of being made of flesh?

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:39.434
Biology is us,

00:04:39.458 --> 00:04:41.664
it's our bodies, it's what we eat.

00:04:41.688 --> 00:04:45.000
What happens when biology
becomes technology?

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:47.788
These images are questions,

00:04:47.812 --> 00:04:51.470
and they challenge what we think of
as normal and desirable.

00:04:51.796 --> 00:04:54.723
And they also show us
that the future is full of choices

00:04:54.747 --> 00:04:56.747
and that we could choose differently.

00:04:57.279 --> 00:05:00.556
What's the future of the body, of beauty?
