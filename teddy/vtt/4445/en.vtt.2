00:00:58.904 --> 00:01:03.190
as a living probiotic drink
and health monitor, all in one?

00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:06.553
You could drink the bacteria
and it would live in your gut,

00:01:06.577 --> 00:01:07.868

The Cambridge team went on to win

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.503
the International Genetically Engineered
Machine competition,

00:01:17.527 --> 00:01:18.887

00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:22.220
And as for me, those turds
were a turning point.

00:01:22.744 --> 00:01:24.315
I am a synthetic biologist,

00:01:24.339 --> 00:01:27.617
which is probably a weird term
that most people aren't familiar with.

00:01:27.641 --> 00:01:29.696
It definitely sounds like an oxymoron.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.010
How can biology, something natural,
