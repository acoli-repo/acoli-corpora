00:02:59.244 --> 00:03:01.085
I learned something about engineering.

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.949
I learned that engineering
isn't really just about equations

00:03:03.973 --> 00:03:05.750
and steel and circuits,

00:03:05.774 --> 00:03:07.790
it's actually about people.

00:03:07.814 --> 00:03:10.329
It's something that people do,
and it impacts us.

00:03:10.353 --> 00:03:11.561
So in my work,

00:03:11.585 --> 00:03:15.233
I try to open up new spaces
for different kinds of engineering.

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:17.966
How can we ask better questions,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.721
and can we have better conversations

00:03:19.745 --> 00:03:22.188
about what we want
from the future of technology?

00:03:22.212 --> 00:03:24.783
How can we understand the technological

00:03:24.807 --> 00:03:27.664
but also social and political
and economic reasons

00:03:27.688 --> 00:03:30.458
that GMOs are so polarizing
in our society?
