that I imagined poop as technology.

00:04:04.434 --> 00:04:07.966
I began to see that synthetic
biology was awesome,

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.752
not because we could turn
cells into computers,

00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:13.585
but because we could bring
technology to life.

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.498
This was technology that was visceral,

00:04:15.522 --> 00:04:18.672
an unforgettable vision
of what the future might hold.

00:04:18.696 --> 00:04:21.149
But importantly, it was also
framed as the question

00:04:21.173 --> 00:04:23.577
"Is this the kind of future
that we actually want?"

00:04:23.601 --> 00:04:26.077
We've been promised a future of chrome,

00:04:26.101 --> 00:04:28.982
but what if the future is fleshy?

00:04:29.006 --> 00:04:31.117
