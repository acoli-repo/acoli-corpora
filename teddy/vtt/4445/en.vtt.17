The cattle roamed the hillsides,

00:08:30.227 --> 00:08:33.137
trampling and changing
the ecosystems as they went.

00:08:33.161 --> 00:08:36.629
The scientists catalogued the species
that they found there,

00:08:36.653 --> 00:08:39.685
often taking the last specimen
before they went extinct.

00:08:40.117 --> 00:08:42.331
This is the Maui hau kuahiwi,

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.561
or the Hibiscadelphus wilderianus,

00:08:44.585 --> 00:08:46.967
so named by Gerrit Wilder in 1910.

00:08:47.276 --> 00:08:49.855
By 1912, it was extinct.

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:53.164
I found this specimen
in the Harvard University Herbarium,

00:08:53.188 --> 00:08:57.352
where it's housed with five million
other specimens from all over the world.

00:08:57.376 --> 00:09:00.114
I wanted to take a piece
of science's past,
