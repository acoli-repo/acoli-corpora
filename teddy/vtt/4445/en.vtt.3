00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.010
How can biology, something natural,

00:01:32.034 --> 00:01:33.201
be synthetic?

00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:36.280
How can something artificial be alive?

00:01:36.788 --> 00:01:38.703
Synthetic biologists sort of poke holes

00:01:38.727 --> 00:01:43.006
in that boundary that we draw between
what is natural and what's technological.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.680
And every year, iGEM students
from all over the world

00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:46.918
spend their summer

00:01:46.942 --> 00:01:50.010
trying to engineer biology
to be technology.

00:01:50.034 --> 00:01:52.749
They teach bacteria how to play sudoku,

00:01:52.773 --> 00:01:55.641
they make multicolored spider silk,

00:01:55.665 --> 00:01:57.815
they make self-healing concrete

00:01:57.839 --> 00:02:01.141
and tissue printers
and plastic-eating bacteria.
