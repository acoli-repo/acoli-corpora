00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So, here's one. There's another one which I studied.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Cars rarely appear on that third road.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And so, the question is, what does that cost us?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
That intersection I looked at had about 3,000

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
cars per day in each direction,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
That's five cents each, and times 3,000 cars per day,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that's $51,000 per year.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
That's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
wear on the car, and time.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
What's that time worth?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Well, at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that's 8.3 hours per day. The average wage in the U.S.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
is $20 an hour. That is 60,000 per year.
