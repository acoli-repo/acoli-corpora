00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I mean, why is there that stop sign in each direction?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Because it is saving lives. So, is there a better way to accomplish that goal?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The answer is to enable cars

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
to come in from that side road safely.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Because there are a lot of people who might live up there

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Can that be accomplished with existing signs?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So, there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Stop signs were invented in 1915,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
yield signs in 1950. But that's all we got.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So, why not use a yield sign?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Well the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way.
