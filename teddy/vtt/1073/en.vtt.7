00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So, you'd have a little instruction below it,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
you know, for those who didn't see the public service announcements.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And it merges the stop sign and yield signs.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It's kind of shaped like a T, as in taking turns.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And uncertainty results in caution.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
they slow down.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So, now that you are all "Road Scholars" ...

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
(Laughter)

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
don't wait for that sign to be adopted, these things don't change quickly.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But you all are members of communities,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and you can exercise your community influence

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
to create more sensible traffic flows.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And you can have more impact on the environment

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
just getting your neighborhood to change these things

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
than by changing your vehicle. Thank you very much.
