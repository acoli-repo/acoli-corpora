00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So, unsignalized intersections,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
meaning stop signs, they save many lives,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but there's an excessive proliferation of them.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Small roundabouts are starting to appear.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This is one in my neighborhood. And they are

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
much better -- better than traffic lights, better than four-way stop signs.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
They're expensive to install,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but they are more expensive not to. So, we should look at that.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
But they are not applicable in all situations.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So, take, for example, the three-way intersection.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So, it's logical that you'd have one there,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
on the minor road entering the major.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But the other two are somewhat questionable.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So, here's one. There's another one which I studied.
