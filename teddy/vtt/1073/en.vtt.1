00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Roundabouts are much better.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
A study of 24 intersections

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
has found crashes drop 40 percent

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Injury crashes have dropped 76 percent,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
fatal crashes down 90 percent.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But that's just safety.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
What about time and gas?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So, traffic keeps flowing, so that means less braking,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
which means less accelerating, less gas and less pollution,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
less time wasted,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
than we have in the United States.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So, unsignalized intersections,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
meaning stop signs, they save many lives,
