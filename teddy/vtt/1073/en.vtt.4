00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
is $20 an hour. That is 60,000 per year.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Add that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
just for that sign in each direction.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Discount that back to the present, at five percent:

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
over two million dollars

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
for a stop sign, in each direction.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now, if you look at what that adjacent property is worth,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
you could actually buy the property,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and then sell it off again.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And you'd still come out ahead.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So, it makes one wonder, "Why is it there?"

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I mean, why is there that stop sign in each direction?
