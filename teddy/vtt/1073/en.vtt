00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I only have three minutes

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
so I'm going to have to talk fast, and it will

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
use up your spare mental cycles, so multitasking may be hard.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So, 27 years ago I got a traffic ticket

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that got me thinking.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I've had some time to think it over.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And energy efficiency is more than just

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
about the vehicle --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
it's also about the road.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Road design makes a difference, particularly intersections,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
of which there are two types: signalized

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and unsignalized, which means stop signs.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Roundabouts are much better.
