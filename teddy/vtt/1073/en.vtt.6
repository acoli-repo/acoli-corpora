00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Well the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
That means that if there are five cars waiting, you have to wait

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
till they all go, then you go. It lacks the notion

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
of alternating, or taking turns,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and it's always on the minor road,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
allowing the major one to have primacy.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So, it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
You couldn't suddenly tell everyone, "OK, remember

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
what you used to do at yield signs? Now do something different."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
That would not work.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So, what the world needs now

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
is a new type of sign.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
(Applause)

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So, you'd have a little instruction below it,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
you know, for those who didn't see the public service announcements.
