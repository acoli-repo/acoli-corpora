The global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.416
in something that's actually one of the oldest questions in economics,

00:00:08.416 --> 00:00:11.100
dating back to at least before Adam Smith.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.584
And that is, why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions

00:00:16.584 --> 00:00:19.833
can display radically different savings behavior?

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:24.367
Now, many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question,

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:27.784
and as a field we've made a tremendous amount of headway

00:00:27.784 --> 00:00:30.217
and we understand a lot about this.
