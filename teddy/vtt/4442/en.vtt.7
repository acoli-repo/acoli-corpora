This day when I went to see him,
he was frustrated,

00:03:31.318 --> 00:03:33.635
"Russ, I'm done,
I don't want to do this anymore,

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:34.810
it's my time to go."

00:03:34.834 --> 00:03:37.023
I started telling him
this story about my dad,

00:03:37.047 --> 00:03:38.862
how he used to say, "Son, why not you?

00:03:38.886 --> 00:03:41.950
Why don't you graduate early,
play pro football and pro baseball?

00:03:41.974 --> 00:03:43.223
Why not you, why not you?"

00:03:43.247 --> 00:03:44.634
I said, "Milton, why not you?

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:46.871
If you tried T-cell therapy,

00:03:46.895 --> 00:03:49.474
and you try this and it doesn't work,

00:03:49.498 --> 00:03:50.672
you won't remember it."

00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:52.705
So Milton got a smile
on his face and said,

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:53.934
"You're exactly right.

00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.825
Yes, I do have cancer, Russ.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.340
But I can either let this kill me,

00:03:58.364 --> 00:03:59.808
not just physically,

00:03:59.832 --> 00:04:03.293
but I can also let it kill me
emotionally and mentally.
