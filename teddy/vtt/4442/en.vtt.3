00:01:29.712 --> 00:01:31.165
and realizing, you know what?

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.116
Life happens.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.156
Life happens, life happens to all of us.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.954
Loss of family members, divorce,

00:01:36.978 --> 00:01:39.823
fear, pain, depression, concerns, worries.

00:01:39.847 --> 00:01:41.871
When you think about
being superpositive --

00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:43.292
yes, I'm positive by nature,

00:01:43.316 --> 00:01:46.697
but positivity, you know,
it doesn't always work,

00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:50.128
because when you're down 16-nothing
in an NFC championship game,

00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:51.303
and people are like,

00:01:51.327 --> 00:01:53.985
"Russ, we're not going to be able
to win this game, man,

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.845
it's not a great situation right now,"

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.287
or when you're facing cancer,

00:01:57.311 --> 00:01:59.429
or when you have things
you have to deal with

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:00.895
or finances and this and that,
