00:02:57.317 --> 00:03:00.593
we train ourselves to be able to run fast,
throw farther, jump higher

00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:02.048
and do these different things,

00:03:02.072 --> 00:03:03.599
but why don't we train our mind?

00:03:03.623 --> 00:03:05.493
What do you want
your life to look like?

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:07.269

they don't worry about
the shot they just missed.

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:21.762
They think about this shot,

00:03:21.786 --> 00:03:23.650

00:03:24.814 --> 00:03:27.070
Then I met this kid

00:03:27.094 --> 00:03:28.847
he had cancer three different times.

00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:31.294
