00:00:30.303 --> 00:00:31.570
Just like that.

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:33.602
My dad laying in his deathbed,

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:35.665
just tears running down my face,

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:37.344
you know, what do I do next?

00:00:37.368 --> 00:00:40.728
My mind racing, memories,
flashbacks, moments,

00:00:40.752 --> 00:00:42.274
early mornings, getting up,

00:00:42.298 --> 00:00:43.793
taking grounders and throwing,

00:00:43.817 --> 00:00:48.164
speed outs and deep post routes
to my brother and my dad,

00:00:48.188 --> 00:00:50.548
to early morning car rides
to AAU baseball,

00:00:50.572 --> 00:00:53.129
to my dad being the third-base coach.

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:57.228
Fast-forward to the championship high
of winning a Super Bowl,

00:00:57.252 --> 00:00:58.752
holding up the Lombardi Trophy

00:00:58.776 --> 00:01:01.037
and the emotions
and the excitement of it all,
