00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:00.895
or finances and this and that,

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:02.318
like, how do we deal with it?

00:02:02.342 --> 00:02:04.622
It's hard to be positive
in the midst of it all.

00:02:04.646 --> 00:02:06.366
And what I definitely knew was this:

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.544
that negativity works
100 percent of the time.

00:02:08.568 --> 00:02:10.437
Negativity was going to get me nowhere.

00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:13.488
I started saying to myself,
"New are his mercies every morning,"

00:02:13.512 --> 00:02:14.823
new beginnings, new starts.

00:02:14.847 --> 00:02:18.418
And despite hardship and pain
and worries and wanting to get through it

00:02:18.442 --> 00:02:19.997
and "How do I do this?",

00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:21.768
I started thinking about a car.

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:24.532
You know how when you drive a car,
you've got stick shift

00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:26.147
and you want to shift to neutral?

00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:29.016
You go from first gear to second gear,
all the way to fifth?

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.042
You've got to know
how to shift to neutral.
