00:03:59.832 --> 00:04:03.293
but I can also let it kill me
emotionally and mentally.

00:04:03.317 --> 00:04:06.531
And I have a choice right now,
in the midst of the problem,

00:04:06.555 --> 00:04:07.842
in the midst of the storm,

00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:09.873
to decide to overcome."

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:14.652
One of the questions I always get asked
about neutral thinking is this:

00:04:14.676 --> 00:04:17.476
"Does that mean I don't have any emotion?"

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.668
And I always say, absolutely not.

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:20.883
Yeah, we have emotions,

00:04:20.907 --> 00:04:22.384
we have real-life situations,

00:04:22.408 --> 00:04:23.800
we have things to deal with.

00:04:23.824 --> 00:04:28.045
But what you have to be able to do is
to stay focused on the moment

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:31.069
and to not be superemotional.
