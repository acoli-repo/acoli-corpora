00:05:27.624 --> 00:05:30.085
I just have the ability
to throw the ball a long way

00:05:30.109 --> 00:05:32.466
and run around and make
some cool and fun throws

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.509
and make some people smile.

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:36.727
But the reality is
that I still have pressure,

00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:38.729
I still have worries, I still have fears,

00:05:38.753 --> 00:05:40.807
I still have things that happen.

00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:42.363
Still have loss.

00:05:42.387 --> 00:05:44.267
Positivity can be dangerous.

00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:46.557
But what always works is negativity.

00:05:46.581 --> 00:05:48.454
I never wanted to live in negativity,

00:05:48.478 --> 00:05:50.223
so I stayed in neutral.

00:05:50.247 --> 00:05:52.477
I kept my shift in neutral.

00:05:52.501 --> 00:05:54.540
And so that's where I lived,

00:05:54.564 --> 00:05:57.001
and that's where
I've been living ever since.
