You've got to know
how to shift to neutral.

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:34.160
And I needed to shift to neutral
immediately, before I crashed.

00:02:34.645 --> 00:02:36.503
Sitting there after the Super Bowl,

00:02:36.527 --> 00:02:38.244
I had a decision to make:

00:02:38.268 --> 00:02:41.244
Will I let this define my career?
Will I let it define my life?

00:02:41.268 --> 00:02:42.418
Hell, no.

00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:44.847
What I found out was this:
that mindset is a skill.

00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:46.450
It can be taught and learned.

00:02:46.474 --> 00:02:48.752
I started 10 years ago,
training my mind,

00:02:48.776 --> 00:02:51.791
with this guy named Trevor Moawad,
my mental conditioning coach.

00:02:51.815 --> 00:02:53.320
He's been with me for 10 years,

00:02:53.344 --> 00:02:55.788
and we've been best friends
and partners ever since.

00:02:55.812 --> 00:02:57.293
As athletes, we train the body,

00:02:57.317 --> 00:03:00.593
we train ourselves to be able to run fast,
throw farther, jump higher
