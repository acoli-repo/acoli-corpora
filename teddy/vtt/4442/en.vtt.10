00:04:59.087 --> 00:05:02.536
It was not just on the success of it all
or the failure of it,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.561
it was on the process, like:

00:05:04.585 --> 00:05:09.053
What is the next step,
how do I do this right here, right now?

00:05:09.077 --> 00:05:11.049
We have a choice to make in life.

00:05:11.073 --> 00:05:13.618
And for me, when I was young
and I didn't have much,

00:05:13.642 --> 00:05:14.792
I made a choice.

00:05:14.816 --> 00:05:16.866
I made a choice
that I was going to believe

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.760
that great things were going to happen,

00:05:18.784 --> 00:05:20.791
that I was going to have my mindset right,

00:05:20.815 --> 00:05:23.021
and I was going to have
the right language

00:05:23.045 --> 00:05:24.767
and the right things to think about,

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:26.426
which helped prepare me for today.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.600
Because I'm just human.

00:05:27.624 --> 00:05:30.085
I just have the ability
to throw the ball a long way
