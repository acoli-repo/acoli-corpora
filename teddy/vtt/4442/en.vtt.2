00:00:58.776 --> 00:01:01.037
and the emotions
and the excitement of it all,

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.092
blue and green confetti all over the place

00:01:03.116 --> 00:01:05.227
and knowing that you just
won the Super Bowl,

00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:07.660
to a year later, the pressure of the game,

00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:09.620
the ball on the one-yard line,

00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:13.070
and this is the chance to win the game,
and it doesn't work.

00:01:13.094 --> 00:01:15.607
And however many millions
and millions of people

00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:17.514
all over the world watching.

00:01:17.538 --> 00:01:19.108
And having to walk to the media,

00:01:19.132 --> 00:01:21.982
and what do I say next,
what do I do, what do I think?

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:24.549
Being married at a young age

00:01:24.573 --> 00:01:27.026
and just coming out of college
and everything else,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.688
to, you know, shortly after,
marriage not working out

00:01:29.712 --> 00:01:31.165
and realizing, you know what?
