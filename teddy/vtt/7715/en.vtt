00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.457
In 2019,

00:00:02.457 --> 00:00:05.960
I took a 9am flight
from Atlanta to New York City.

00:00:06.586 --> 00:00:08.921
I was the first person to board that day.

00:00:08.963 --> 00:00:11.841
So as I death-gripped my phone
to step over that little crack

00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:13.134
that leads to the runway,

00:00:13.134 --> 00:00:15.219
I caught a glimpse
of the flight attendant.

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.889
Head in her hand, like this, eyes closed.

00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:21.017
The moment she heard me, she looked up,

00:00:21.017 --> 00:00:23.895
she put a smile on her face
and she said, "Good morning."

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:27.815
"This is not your first flight
of the day, is it?" I asked.

00:00:27.857 --> 00:00:29.275
"No," she said,

00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:30.985
"it had been a really early one."
