00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So I just want to tell you my story.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I spend a lot of time

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
teaching adults how to use visual language

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and doodling in the workplace.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And naturally, I encounter a lot of resistance,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because it's considered to be anti-intellectual

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and counter to serious learning.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But I have a problem with that belief,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
because I know that doodling has a profound impact

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
on the way that we can process information

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and the way that we can solve problems.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So I was curious about why there was a disconnect

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
between the way our society perceives doodling
