00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
As a particle physicist, I study the elementary particles

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and how they interact on the most fundamental level.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
For most of my research career, I've been using accelerators,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
such as the electron accelerator at Stanford University, just up the road,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to study things on the smallest scale.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But more recently, I've been turning my attention

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to the universe on the largest scale.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Because, as I'll explain to you,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So I'm going to tell you about our twenty-first-century view of the universe,
