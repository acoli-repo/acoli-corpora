or crying until I laughed.

00:08:30.184 --> 00:08:34.153
Laughter and tears are both
involuntary human reactions,

00:08:34.177 --> 00:08:37.350
testaments to our capacity for expression.

00:08:37.374 --> 00:08:39.207
So allow me to express

00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:40.921
that if I make you laugh,

00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:43.024
it's usually on purpose.

00:08:43.048 --> 00:08:44.775
And if I make you cry,

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:46.778
I'll still think you are beautiful.

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:53.710
bedridden on a random afternoon.

00:08:54.131 --> 00:08:58.157
I hadn't seen her since the last time
we were in Sudan together,

00:08:58.181 --> 00:09:02.135
and there I was at her hospital bedside
