00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:31.152
I learned this in my high school
classroom one day,

00:01:31.176 --> 00:01:34.051
when my teacher asked me
to give a presentation about Darfur.

00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:37.970
I was setting up the projector
when a classmate of mine said,

00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:40.089
"Why do you have to talk about this?

00:01:40.113 --> 00:01:43.163
Can't you think about us
and how it will make us feel?"

00:01:43.187 --> 00:01:45.327
(Laughter)

00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:49.415
My 14-year-old self didn't know
what to say to her,

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.301
or how to explain the pain
that I felt in that moment,

00:01:53.325 --> 00:01:57.396
and in every moment that we were forced
not to talk about "this."

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.264
Her words took me back to the days
and nights on the ground in Darfur,
