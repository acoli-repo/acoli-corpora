00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:33.104
One day, I walked in on my mother crying,

00:00:33.128 --> 00:00:37.775
and I asked her why
we are burying so many people.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.103
I don't remember the words that she chose

00:00:41.127 --> 00:00:45.364
to describe genocide to her
10-year-old daughter,

00:00:45.388 --> 00:00:47.017
but I remember the feeling.

00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:50.796
We felt completely alone,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.738
as if no one could hear us,

00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:55.571
as if we were essentially invisible.

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.388
This is when I wrote
my first poem about Darfur.
