00:04:28.523 --> 00:04:30.377
and now they want me to write one.

00:04:31.254 --> 00:04:32.417

00:04:52.862 --> 00:04:55.112
and what is safe to say on a microphone.

00:04:55.136 --> 00:04:58.030
Do I talk about sorrow? Displacement?

00:04:58.054 --> 00:04:59.447
Do I mention the violence,

00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:02.151
how it's never as simple
as what you see on TV,
