00:09:26.789 --> 00:09:30.764
and it was the most important stage
that I've ever stood on,

00:09:30.788 --> 00:09:32.599
surrounded by family,

00:09:32.623 --> 00:09:37.399
by remnants of a people who were given
as a dowry to a relentless war

00:09:37.423 --> 00:09:40.879
but still managed
to make pearls of this life;

00:09:40.903 --> 00:09:44.619
by the ones who taught me
to not only laugh,

00:09:44.643 --> 00:09:47.513
but to live in the face of death;

00:09:47.537 --> 00:09:49.943
who placed their hands across the sky,

00:09:49.967 --> 00:09:53.334
measuring the distance to the sun
and saying, "Smile;

00:09:53.358 --> 00:09:55.013
I'm gonna meet you there."

00:09:55.798 --> 00:09:57.378
And for Zeinab --

00:09:58.122 --> 00:10:01.693
Zeinab, who taught me love
in a place like France,
