00:03:57.548 --> 00:04:00.170
as if each of those bodies
just found a grave

00:04:00.194 --> 00:04:02.127
right here in my esophagus.

00:04:02.593 --> 00:04:03.744
Our once country,

00:04:03.768 --> 00:04:05.998
all north and south and east and west,

00:04:06.022 --> 00:04:08.940
so restless the Nile couldn't
hold us together,

00:04:08.964 --> 00:04:10.823
and you ask me to summarize.

00:04:11.354 --> 00:04:14.389
They talk about the numbers
as if this isn't still happening,

00:04:14.413 --> 00:04:17.630
as if 500,000 didn't just die in Syria,

00:04:17.654 --> 00:04:20.548
as if 3,000 aren't still making
their final stand

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:23.736
at the bottom of the Mediterranean,

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.499
as if there aren't entire volumes
full of fact sheets about our genocides,

00:04:28.523 --> 00:04:30.377
and now they want me to write one.
