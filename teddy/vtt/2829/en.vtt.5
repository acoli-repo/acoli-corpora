00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:30.745
despite this renewed feeling
that I didn't deserve to be there,

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.209
that I didn't belong there

00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:34.611
or have a right to break the silence.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.794
As I talked,

00:02:36.818 --> 00:02:39.461
and my classmates listened,

00:02:39.485 --> 00:02:40.955
the fear ebbed away.

00:02:42.022 --> 00:02:43.599
My mind became calm,

00:02:43.623 --> 00:02:45.300
and I felt safe.

00:02:46.796 --> 00:02:49.693
It was the sound of our grieving,

00:02:49.717 --> 00:02:52.440
the feel of their arms around me,

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:54.745
the steady walls that held us together.

00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:57.857
It felt nothing like a vacuum.

00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:02.077
I choose poetry because it's so visceral.
