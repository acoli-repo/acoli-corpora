00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:02.077
I choose poetry because it's so visceral.

00:03:02.821 --> 00:03:06.131
When someone is standing in front of you,
mind, body and soul,

00:03:06.155 --> 00:03:07.356
saying "Witness me,"

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.194
it's impossible not to become
keenly aware of your own humanity.

00:03:11.593 --> 00:03:13.393
This changed everything for me.

00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:14.963
It gave me courage.

00:03:15.883 --> 00:03:18.474
Every day I experience
the power of witness,

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:20.599
and because of that, I am whole.

00:03:20.623 --> 00:03:22.105
And so now I ask:

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.495
Will you witness me?

00:03:25.401 --> 00:03:27.435
They hand me the microphone

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.760
as my shoulders sink
under the weight of this stress.
