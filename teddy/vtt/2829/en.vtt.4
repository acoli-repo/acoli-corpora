00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.264
Her words took me back to the days
and nights on the ground in Darfur,

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:04.742
where we were forced to remain silent;

00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:06.957
where we didn't speak over morning tea

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:11.434
because the warplanes overhead
would swallow any and all noise;

00:02:11.458 --> 00:02:13.581
back to the days when we were told

00:02:13.605 --> 00:02:16.394
not only that we don't
deserve to be heard

00:02:16.418 --> 00:02:19.234
but that we do not have a right to exist.

00:02:19.963 --> 00:02:22.442
And this is where the magic happened,

00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:25.689
in that classroom when all the students
started taking their seats

00:02:25.713 --> 00:02:26.982
and I began to speak,

00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:30.745
despite this renewed feeling
that I didn't deserve to be there,
