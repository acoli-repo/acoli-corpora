00:06:29.502 --> 00:06:31.090
bracing for impact.

00:06:31.737 --> 00:06:34.761
I never wear shoes I can't run in.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.487
Thank you.

00:06:37.988 --> 00:06:44.082
(Applause)

00:06:44.847 --> 00:06:49.084
So, I wanted to leave on a positive note,

00:06:49.108 --> 00:06:52.584
because that's the paradox
that this life has been:

00:06:52.608 --> 00:06:55.608
in the places where I learned
to cry the most,

00:06:55.632 --> 00:06:58.948
I also learned how to smile after.

00:06:59.615 --> 00:07:02.122
So, here goes.
