00:05:29.773 --> 00:05:31.640
Do I talk about the elderly,

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.299
our heroes,

00:05:33.323 --> 00:05:35.934
too weak to run, too expensive to shoot,

00:05:35.958 --> 00:05:37.341
how they would march them,

00:05:37.365 --> 00:05:39.612
hands raised, rifles at their backs,

00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:40.792
into the fire?

00:05:40.816 --> 00:05:43.086
How their walking sticks
kept the flames alive?

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.294
It feels too harsh for a bundle of wires
and an audience to swallow.

00:05:48.318 --> 00:05:49.754
Too relentless,

00:05:49.778 --> 00:05:53.637
like the valley that filled
with the putrid smoke of our deaths.

00:05:53.661 --> 00:05:55.494
Is it better in verse?

00:05:56.114 --> 00:05:58.815
Can a stanza become a burial shroud?

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:00.670
Will it sting less if I say it softly?
