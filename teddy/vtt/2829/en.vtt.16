00:07:58.198 --> 00:08:00.379
You want nothing more than to disappear,

00:08:00.403 --> 00:08:04.136
but your heart can't salvage
enough remnants to leave.

00:08:04.848 --> 00:08:06.192
But joy --

00:08:06.216 --> 00:08:10.543
joy is the armor we carried across
the borders of our broken homeland.

00:08:12.687 --> 00:08:16.239
A hasty mix of stories and faces

00:08:16.263 --> 00:08:19.087
that lasts long after the flavor is gone.

00:08:20.018 --> 00:08:23.928
A muscle memory that overcomes
even the most bitter of times,

00:08:23.952 --> 00:08:28.501
my memory is spotted with
days of laughing until I cried,

00:08:28.525 --> 00:08:30.160
or crying until I laughed.
