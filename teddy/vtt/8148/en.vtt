In 2000, a company called ViroPharma
ran clinical trials of pleconaril,

00:00:11.382 --> 00:00:13.885
a new pill designed to treat 
the common cold.

00:00:13.968 --> 00:00:15.762
In many patients, the pill helped.

00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:18.639
But in 7 of them, 
just a few days into the treatment,

00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:23.061
researchers found mutated virus variants
that were almost completely resistant

00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:24.103
to pleconaril.

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:28.274
Viruses are always mutating, but this one
mutated so quickly that it managed

00:00:28.274 --> 00:00:32.487
to outmaneuver years of research 
and development in just a few days.
