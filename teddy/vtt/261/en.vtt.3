Do I put a motor at the top of your wrist,
so you know to lift up?

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.634
Or do I put one
at the bottom of your wrist,

00:01:33.658 --> 00:01:35.586
so it feels like you're being pushed up?

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.522
There were no readily available answers

00:01:37.546 --> 00:01:40.221
because there was no commonly
agreed-upon haptic language

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:41.791
to communicate information with.

00:01:42.188 --> 00:01:44.981
So my cofounders and I
set out to create that language.

00:01:45.987 --> 00:01:49.154
And the first device we built
was not a kung fu suit.

00:01:49.178 --> 00:01:50.384
(Laughter)

00:01:50.408 --> 00:01:52.768
But in a way, it was even more impressive

00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:54.854
because of its simplicity and usefulness.

00:01:55.394 --> 00:01:57.799
We started with the use case
of navigation,

00:01:57.823 --> 00:01:59.879
which is a simplified form of movement.
