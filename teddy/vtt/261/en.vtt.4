00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:02.346
We then created Wayband,

00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:07.390
a wrist-wearable device that could
orient a user toward a destination,

00:02:07.414 --> 00:02:09.282
using vibrating cues.

00:02:10.235 --> 00:02:11.965
We would ask people to spin around

00:02:13.054 --> 00:02:16.481
and to stop in a way that they felt
was the right way to go.

00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:19.434
Informally, we tried this
with hundreds of people,

00:02:19.458 --> 00:02:22.417
and most could figure it out
within about 15 seconds.

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:23.908
It was that intuitive.

00:02:24.847 --> 00:02:27.929
Initially, we were just trying to get
people out of their phones

00:02:27.953 --> 00:02:29.752
and back into the real world.

00:02:29.776 --> 00:02:31.736
But the more we experimented,
