00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.244
We had proved the point:

00:03:30.268 --> 00:03:33.823
that it was possible to navigate
a complex route using only touch.

00:03:33.847 --> 00:03:35.282
So, why touch?

00:03:35.903 --> 00:03:37.594
The skin has an innate sensitivity

00:03:37.618 --> 00:03:41.085
akin to the eyes' ability
to recognize millions of colors

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.363
or the ears' ability to recognize
complex pitch and tone.

00:03:44.387 --> 00:03:46.014
Yet, as a communications channel,

00:03:46.038 --> 00:03:49.672
it's been largely relegated to
Morse code-like cell phone notifications.

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:52.768
If you were to suddenly receive
a kiss or a punch,

00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:55.775
your reaction would be
instinctive and immediate.

00:03:56.378 --> 00:03:59.373
Meanwhile, your brain would be playing
catch-up on the back end

00:03:59.397 --> 00:04:01.690
to understand the details
of what just occurred.
