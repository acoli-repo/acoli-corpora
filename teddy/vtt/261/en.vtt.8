00:03:59.397 --> 00:04:01.690
to understand the details
of what just occurred.

00:04:01.714 --> 00:04:04.889
And compared to instincts,
conscious thought is pretty slow.

00:04:05.706 --> 00:04:06.969
But it's a lightning bolt

00:04:06.993 --> 00:04:09.493
compared to the snail's pace
of language acquisition.

00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:12.371
I spent a considerable amount of time

00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:18.101
learning Spanish, Japanese,
German and currently Swedish,

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:19.832
with varying degrees of failure.

00:04:19.856 --> 00:04:22.092
(Laughter)

00:04:23.482 --> 00:04:27.635
But within those failures were kernels
of how different languages are organized.

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:29.366
That gave our team insight

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.128
into how to use the linguistic order
of well-established languages
