You see, I could give you
buzz-buzz-buzz, buzz-buzz,

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:02.543
and you would eventually learn

00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:04.697
that that particular
vibration means "stop."

00:05:05.123 --> 00:05:07.974
But as haptic designers,
we challenged ourselves.

00:05:09.045 --> 00:05:11.245
What would it be like to design "stop?"

00:05:12.299 --> 00:05:13.538
Well, based on context,

00:05:13.562 --> 00:05:16.006
most of us have the experience
of being in a vehicle

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.704
and having that vehicle stop suddenly,
along with our body's reaction to it.

00:05:20.545 --> 00:05:22.274
So if I wanted you to stop,

00:05:22.298 --> 00:05:24.315
I could send you
a vibration pattern, sure.

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:27.099
Or, I could design a haptic experience

00:05:27.123 --> 00:05:30.665
that just made stopping
feel like it was the right thing to do.
