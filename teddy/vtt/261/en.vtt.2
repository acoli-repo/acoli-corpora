00:01:00.187 --> 00:01:03.922
And in that moment,
it became crystal clear: touch.

00:01:04.657 --> 00:01:08.156
If I had vibrating motors
where she had placed each of her fingers,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.546
paired with motion-capture data
of my current and optimal posture,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.473
I could simulate the entire experience

00:01:14.497 --> 00:01:16.971
without an instructor
needing to be in the room.

00:01:16.995 --> 00:01:20.703
But there was still one important part
of the puzzle that was missing.

00:01:20.727 --> 00:01:23.600
If I want you to raise your wrist
two inches off of your lap,

00:01:23.624 --> 00:01:25.337
using vibration,

00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:26.885
how do I tell you to do that?

00:01:28.237 --> 00:01:31.515
Do I put a motor at the top of your wrist,
so you know to lift up?
