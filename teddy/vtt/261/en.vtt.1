She put her left thumb
into the left side of my lower back,

00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:36.291
while reaching her right index finger
around to the front of my right shoulder.

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:38.155
Instinctively, I sat up straight.

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:40.371
In one quick and gentle gesture,

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:42.694
she had communicated
how to improve my posture.

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:45.730
The paper I was working on
at that very moment

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:49.166
centered around developing new ways
to teach movement using technology.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.775
I wanted to create a suit
that could teach a person kung fu.

00:00:53.434 --> 00:00:55.236
(Laughter)

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.379
But I had no idea how
to communicate movement

00:00:57.403 --> 00:00:59.401
without an instructor being in the room.
