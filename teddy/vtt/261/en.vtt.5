00:02:29.776 --> 00:02:31.736
But the more we experimented,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.927
the more we realized that those
who stood to benefit most from our work

00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:38.551
were people who had little or no sight.

00:02:39.387 --> 00:02:42.252
When we first approached
a blind organization, they told us,

00:02:42.276 --> 00:02:44.142
"Don't build a blind device.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.680
Build a device that everyone can use

00:02:46.704 --> 00:02:49.042
but that's optimized
for the blind experience."

00:02:49.505 --> 00:02:53.048
We created our company WearWorks
with three guiding principles:

00:02:54.792 --> 00:02:55.942
make cool stuff,

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.418
create the greatest impact we can
in our lifetimes

00:02:59.442 --> 00:03:02.501
and reimagine an entire world
designed for touch.
