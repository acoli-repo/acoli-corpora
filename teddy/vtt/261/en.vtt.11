00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.720
It also takes the ability to distill
human experience into meaningful insights

00:05:42.744 --> 00:05:46.269
and then into haptic
gestures and products.

00:05:47.133 --> 00:05:49.894
Haptic design is going to expand
the human ability

00:05:49.918 --> 00:05:52.093
to sense and respond to our environments,

00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:53.850

00:05:54.292 --> 00:05:56.806
There's a new frontier: touch.

00:05:57.545 --> 00:06:00.928
And it has the power to change
how we all see the world around us.
