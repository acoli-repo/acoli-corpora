One of the things that really excites me about what we're doing now

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
is we have this thing called AdSense,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and this is a little bit foreshadowing --

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
this is from before Dean dropped out.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
But the idea is, like, on a newspaper, for example,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
we show you relevant ads.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
And this is hard to read, but this says "Battle for New Hampshire:

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Howard Dean for President" -- articles on Howard Dean.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And these ads are generated automatically --

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
like in this case, on the Washington Post --

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
from the content on the site.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And so we use our over 150,000 advertisers
