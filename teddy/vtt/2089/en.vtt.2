00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
or something like that.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And they're labeled by color right now, by language.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So you can see: here we are in the U.S.,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and they're all coming up red.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
There we are in Monterey -- hopefully I can get it right.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You can see that Japan is busy at night,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
right there.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
There's a lot of activity in China.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
There's a lot of activity in India.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
There's some in the Middle East, the little pockets.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And Europe, which is right now in the middle of the day,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages.
