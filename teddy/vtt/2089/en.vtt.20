00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And now it's a real, full-blown project with more people on it.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And this is how we keep our innovation running.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I think usually, as companies get bigger,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
they find it really hard to have small, innovative projects.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And we had this problem, too, for a while, and we said,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
"Oh, we really need a new concept."

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
You know, the Googlettes -- that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
but we hope it will, and if we do enough of them,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
some of them will really work and turn out, such as News.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
But then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And I don't know about all of you,
