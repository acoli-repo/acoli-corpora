00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And we didn't like that, so we actually,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
in maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosures

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
that enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the time

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and they're completely silent.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And as a result, we were able to build some software

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
that also lets us manage a meeting,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
so when you walk into a meeting room now,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
it lists all the meetings that are happening,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
you can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
to all the people that were present in the meeting.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And as we become more of a global company,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
we find these things really affect us --

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
you know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room?
