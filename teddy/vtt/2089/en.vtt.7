00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
going up over to Asia, Europe in the other direction, and so forth.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Now what I would like to do is just to show you

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
what one second of this activity would look like.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And if we can switch to slides --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
all right, here we go.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So this is slowed down.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
This is what one second looks like.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
is just making sure that we can keep up

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
with this kind of traffic load.
