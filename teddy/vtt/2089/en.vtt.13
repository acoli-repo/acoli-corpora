00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Now does anybody know who this is?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
A-ha!

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Audience: Orkut.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
SB: Yes! Somebody got it.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
This is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Do we have any?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Okay, not very many people know about it.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I'll explain it in a second.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
This is one of our engineers.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
We find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
That's how we churn those products out.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Orkut had a vision to create a social network.
