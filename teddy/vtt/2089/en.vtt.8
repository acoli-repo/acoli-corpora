00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
with this kind of traffic load.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Now, each one of those queries

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
has an interesting life and tale of its own.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I mean, it could be somebody's health,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
it could be somebody's career, something important to them.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And it could potentially be something

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
as important as tomato sauce,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
or in this case, ketchup.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So this is a query that we had --

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others.
