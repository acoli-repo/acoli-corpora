that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And this was kind of a surprise to me, but

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
which you did by writing them down,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
and where to put your resources.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And so that's basically what we've done

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
since we instituted that a few years ago, and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and still stay reasonably well-organized.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
The other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and so naturally,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities.
