Sergey Brin: I want to discuss a question

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I know that's been pressing on many of your minds.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We spoke to you last several years ago.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And before I get started today,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
since many of you are wondering,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I just wanted to get it out of the way.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The answer is boxers.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now I hope all of you feel better.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Do you know what this might be? Does anyone know what that is?
