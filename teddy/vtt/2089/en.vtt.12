00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
They run Google ads, and we just give them the ad credit

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
so they can let organizations know.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
One of the earlier results that we got --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
of 25 Vietnamese girls for their education,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and that was one of the earliest results. And as I said, now there have been

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
many, many stories that have come in,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
because we do have hundreds of charities in there,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
and the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Now does anybody know who this is?
