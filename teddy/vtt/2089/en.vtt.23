00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I just wanted to highlight a couple of things

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
that are new, or you might not know about.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And the top thing, actually, is the Deskbar.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
So this is a new -- how many of you use the Google Toolbar?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Raise your hands.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
How many of you use the Deskbar?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
All right, see? You guys should try it out.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
But if you go to our site and search

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
for "Deskbar," you'll get this.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And the idea is, instead of a toolbar, it's just present all the time

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
on your screen on the bottom,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and you can do searches really easily.
