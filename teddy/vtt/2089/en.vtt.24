and you can do searches really easily.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Thank you, Sergey.

This is another example of a project that somebody at Google

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
was really passionate about, and they just, they got going,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and it's really, really a great product, and really taking off.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Google Answers is something we started, which is really cool,

you can type a question in,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and then there's a pool of researchers

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
that go out and research it for you, and it's guaranteed and all that,
