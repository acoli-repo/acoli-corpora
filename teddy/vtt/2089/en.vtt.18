Mendel, who was supposed to be teaching high-school students,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
actually, you know, discovered the laws of genetics --

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
as a hobby, basically.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
So many, many useful things come out of this.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And News, which I just mentioned,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
was started by a researcher.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And he just -- he -- after 9/11, he got really interested in the news.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And he said, "Why don't I look at the news better?"

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And so he started clustering it by category,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and then he started using it, and then his friends started using it.
