I guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
You can see that it got started right here.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
In the U.S. and Spain, it was popular at the same time.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
as it did in Spain.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And then from Spain, it went to Italy,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and then Germany got excited, and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And so I guess the U.S. finally,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
finally started to like it, too.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And I just wanted to play it for you.
