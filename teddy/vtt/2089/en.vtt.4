00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And this is something that we should really work on,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
which is Africa, which is just a few trickles,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
But basically, what we've noticed is these queries,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
which come in at thousands per second,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
are available everywhere there is power.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And pretty much everywhere there is power, there is the Internet.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And even in Antarctica -- well, at least this time of year --

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
we from time to time will see a query rising up.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And if we had it plotted correctly,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I think the International Space Station would have it, too.
