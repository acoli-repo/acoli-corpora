But then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And I don't know about all of you,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
but I have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And we found that if we just wrote all of them down

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and ordered them -- and these are kind of made up.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Don't really pay attention to them.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
For example, the "Buy Iceland" was from a media article.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
We would never do such a crazy thing, but --

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And this was kind of a surprise to me, but
