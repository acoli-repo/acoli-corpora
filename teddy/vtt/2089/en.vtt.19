00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and then he started using it, and then his friends started using it.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And then, besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
we made it a Googlette,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
which is basically a small project at Google.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So it'd be like three people, or something like that,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and they would try to make a product.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And in News' case, you know, they had a couple of people

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
working on it for a while, and then more and more people

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
started using it, and then we put it out on the Internet,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and more and more people started using it.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And now it's a real, full-blown project with more people on it.
