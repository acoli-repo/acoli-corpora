00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This is how we have to move the bits around

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
to actually get the people the answers to their questions.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
You can see that there's a lot of data running around.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It has to go all over the world: through fibers,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
through satellites, through all kinds of connections.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
as low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
But you can see also, once again -- so some places are much more wired

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
than others, and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S.,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
going up over to Asia, Europe in the other direction, and so forth.
