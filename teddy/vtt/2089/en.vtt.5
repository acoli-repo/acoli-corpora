00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And if we had it plotted correctly,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I think the International Space Station would have it, too.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So this is

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
some of the challenge that we have here,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the --

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
there we go.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This is how we have to move the bits around

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
to actually get the people the answers to their questions.
