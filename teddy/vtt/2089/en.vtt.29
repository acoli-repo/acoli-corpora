A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other, and informally.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And I think we've done a good job encouraging that.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
It makes it a really fun place to work.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Along with our logos, too, which I think really embody

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
our culture when we change things.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
In the early days, we were actually advised

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
we should never change our logo because

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
we should establish our brand, you know,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
because, you know, you'd never want to change your logo.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
You want it to be consistent.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And we said, "Well, that doesn't sound so much fun.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Why don't we try changing it every day?"
