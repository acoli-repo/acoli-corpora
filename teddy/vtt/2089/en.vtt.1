00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Do you know what this might be? Does anyone know what that is?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Audience: Yes.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
SB: What is it?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Audience: It's people logging on to Google around the world.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
SB: Wow, OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But this is what helped me see it.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This is what we run at the office, that actually runs real time.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Here it's slightly logged.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But here you can see around the world

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
how people are using Google.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And every one of those rising dots

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
represents probably about 20, 30 searches,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
or something like that.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And they're labeled by color right now, by language.
