HIBM is very rare.

00:01:30.083 --> 00:01:35.476
In the United States there are
less than 200 people diagnosed.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.684
To date, there is
no proved treatment or cure,

00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:42.768
and within 10 to 15 years of its onset,

00:01:42.792 --> 00:01:45.684
HIBM typically leads to quadriplegia,

00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:48.643
which is why I now use a wheelchair.

00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:52.268
When I was first diagnosed,
everything changed.

00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:54.268
It was frightening news

00:01:54.292 --> 00:01:58.643
because I had no experience
with chronic illness or disabilities.

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:03.059
And I had no idea
how the disease might progress.
