00:07:29.208 --> 00:07:30.268
(Laughter)

00:07:30.292 --> 00:07:32.809
I took my breath
in the wrong part of the wave,

00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:34.268
choked on river water

00:07:34.292 --> 00:07:36.809
and was unable to steer myself.

00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:38.393
Yes, it was scary,

00:07:38.417 --> 00:07:40.809
but it was also fantastic.

00:07:40.833 --> 00:07:42.976
Waterfalls, slick canyons

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.934
and a couple billion years of bedrock

00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.434
that seemed to change color
throughout the day.

00:07:47.458 --> 00:07:50.351
The Grand Canyon is true wilderness

00:07:50.375 --> 00:07:53.059
and worthy of all of its accolades.

00:07:53.083 --> 00:07:56.792
(Applause)
