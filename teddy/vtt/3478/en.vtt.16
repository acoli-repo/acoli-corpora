00:08:00.833 --> 00:08:02.226
The expedition,

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.184
all that planning and the trip itself,

00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:10.226
showed me a level of fear
I had never experienced before.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.643
But more importantly,

00:08:11.667 --> 00:08:16.059
it showed me how boldly
courageous I can be.

00:08:16.083 --> 00:08:18.351
My Grand Canyon journey was not easy.

00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:21.018
This was not a vision
of an Amazonian woman

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:24.559
effortlessly making her way
through epic scenery.

00:08:24.583 --> 00:08:26.268
This was me crying,

00:08:26.292 --> 00:08:30.184
exhausted and beat up with two black eyes.
