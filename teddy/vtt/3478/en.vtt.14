00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:00.476
This was not an easy, peaceful journey,

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.559
and yet, that was exactly the point.

00:07:02.583 --> 00:07:05.184
Even though I was afraid
to get back into the saddle,

00:07:05.208 --> 00:07:06.559
I got back in.

00:07:06.583 --> 00:07:08.934
The descent alone to the canyon floor

00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:10.851
took a total of 10 hours

00:07:10.875 --> 00:07:13.768
and that was just day one of four riding.

00:07:13.792 --> 00:07:15.851
Next came the mighty rapids.

00:07:15.875 --> 00:07:17.851
The Colorado River in the Grand Canyon

00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:20.768
has some of the highest
white water in the country.

00:07:20.792 --> 00:07:23.643
And just to be prepared
in case we should capsize,

00:07:23.667 --> 00:07:26.476
we'd practice having me swim
through a smaller rapid.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.184
And it's safe to say it wasn't glamorous.

00:07:29.208 --> 00:07:30.268
(Laughter)
