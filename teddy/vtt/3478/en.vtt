00:00:01.458 --> 00:00:04.250
When we're young, we're innocently brave,

00:00:04.292 --> 00:00:07.809
and we fearlessly dream
about what our lives might be like.

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:11.351
Maybe you wanted to be an astronaut
or a rocket scientist.

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:15.143
Maybe you dreamed
of traveling to every continent.

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:16.851
Since I was very young,

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:19.059
I dreamed of working
for the United Nations

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:22.059
in some of the most difficult
countries in the world.

00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:24.393
And thanks to a lot of courage

00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:26.518
that dream came true.

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:28.559
But here's the thing about courage:

00:00:28.583 --> 00:00:31.184
it doesn't just appear
whenever we need it.
