00:06:29.083 --> 00:06:31.184
could we stop and remove my helmet

00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:35.143
and see the egg-sized bump
protruding from my forehead.

00:06:35.167 --> 00:06:37.226
For all of that planning and gear,

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.059
how is it that we didn't
even have an ice pack?

00:06:40.083 --> 00:06:41.101
(Laughter)

00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:44.018
Luckily for all of us,
the swelling came outwards,

00:06:44.042 --> 00:06:48.059
and would drain into my face
as two fantastic black eyes

00:06:48.083 --> 00:06:51.143
which is an amazing way to look
in a documentary film.

00:06:51.167 --> 00:06:53.226
(Laughter)

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:58.309
(Applause and cheers)

00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:00.476
This was not an easy, peaceful journey,
