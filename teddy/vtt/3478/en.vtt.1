it doesn't just appear
whenever we need it.

00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:34.518
It's the result of tough
reflection and real work,

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:39.018
involving the balance
between fear and bravery.

00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:41.851
Without fear, we'll do foolish things.

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.893
And without courage,
we'll never step into the unknown.

00:00:45.917 --> 00:00:48.768
The balance of the two
is where the magic lies,

00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:51.833
and it's a balance
we all deal with every day.

First, a word about my fancy wheels.

00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:57.476
I haven't always used a wheelchair.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.976
I grew up like many of you,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.184
running, jumping and dancing.
