00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:31.143
to internalize the severity of HIBM,

00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:35.809
even as basic tasks and functions
became increasingly difficult.

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:39.893
Yet, I continued to pursue my dream
of working all over the world,

00:03:39.917 --> 00:03:42.309
and was even appointed
as a disability focal point

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:44.226
for UNICEF in Haiti,

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.125
where I served for two years
after the devastating 2010 earthquake.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.893
And then my work brought me
to the United States.

00:03:51.917 --> 00:03:54.684
And even as the disease
progressed significantly

00:03:54.708 --> 00:03:57.726
and I needed leg braces
and a walker to get around,

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.726
I still longed for adventure.
