00:05:56.708 --> 00:06:00.351
was to breathe deeply,
stare up into the clouds

00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:03.893
and focus on my team's voices.

00:06:03.917 --> 00:06:08.476
But then, in the first hour,
disaster struck.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.851
Unable to hold myself
upright in the saddle,

00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:12.851
going down an oversized step,

00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:17.393
I flung forward and smacked my face
on the back of the horse's head.

00:06:17.417 --> 00:06:18.684
There was panic,

00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:20.268
my head hurt fiercely,

00:06:20.292 --> 00:06:23.976
but the path was too narrow
for us to dismount.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.809
Only at the halfway point at 2,300 feet,

00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:29.059
at least another two hours down,

00:06:29.083 --> 00:06:31.184
could we stop and remove my helmet
