00:02:29.875 --> 00:02:31.643
was preposterous.

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:33.292
And unacceptable.

00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:36.143
So I ignored them.

00:02:36.167 --> 00:02:42.684
(Cheers and applause)

00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:44.351
I did get married.

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:48.184
And I decided for myself
not to have children.

00:02:48.208 --> 00:02:51.518
And I continued my career
with the United Nations

00:02:51.542 --> 00:02:52.809
after my diagnosis,

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:55.268
going to work for two years in Angola,

00:02:55.292 --> 00:02:59.208
a country recovering
from 27 years of brutal civil war.
