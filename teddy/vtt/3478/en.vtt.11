00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.726
sitting eight feet above the ground,

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.976
riding a mustang horse named Sheriff,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.268
my first impression of Grand Canyon

00:05:35.292 --> 00:05:38.184
was one of shock and terror.

00:05:38.208 --> 00:05:41.018
Who knew I had a fear of heights.

00:05:41.042 --> 00:05:42.309
(Laughter)

00:05:42.333 --> 00:05:44.851
But there was no giving up now.

00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:48.601
I mustered up every ounce
of courage inside me

00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:52.101
to not let my fear get the best of me.

00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:53.934
Embarking on the South Rim,

00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.684
all I could do to keep myself composed

00:05:56.708 --> 00:06:00.351
was to breathe deeply,
stare up into the clouds
