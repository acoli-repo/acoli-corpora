00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.184
running, jumping and dancing.

00:01:01.208 --> 00:01:04.059
I love to dance.

00:01:04.083 --> 00:01:06.351
However, in my mid-twenties,

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:10.476
I began to experience
a series of inexplicable falls.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.809
And a few years later,

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:15.184
I was diagnosed with a recessive
genetic condition

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:18.851
called hereditary inclusion body myopathy,

00:01:18.875 --> 00:01:21.393
or HIBM.

00:01:21.417 --> 00:01:24.226
It's a progressive muscle wasting disease

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.893
that affects all of my muscles
from head to toe.

00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:30.059
HIBM is very rare.
