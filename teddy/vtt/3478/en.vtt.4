00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:03.059
And I had no idea
how the disease might progress.

00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:05.184
But what was most disheartening

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:08.351
was to listen to other people advise me

00:02:08.375 --> 00:02:10.518
to limit my ambitions and dreams,

00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:14.208
and to change my expectations
of what to expect from life.

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:18.018
"You should quit
your international career."

00:02:18.042 --> 00:02:20.684
"No one will marry you this way."

00:02:20.708 --> 00:02:23.417
"You would be selfish to have children."

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.976
The fact that someone who wasn't me

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.851
was putting limitations
on my dreams and ambitions

00:02:29.875 --> 00:02:31.643
was preposterous.
