My name is Jon Gray.

00:00:02.417 --> 00:00:04.125
They call me "The Dishwasher."

00:00:05.583 --> 00:00:08.101
I cofounded Ghetto Gastro,

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:10.268
a Bronx-based collective

00:00:10.292 --> 00:00:14.708
that works at the intersection
of food, design and art.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.393
We create experiences that challenge
people's perceptions of the Bronx,

00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:23.125
the place that I call home.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:27.601
It's a funny thing.

00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:31.601
I just touched down in Vancouver
from Paris a few days ago.
