00:07:57.704 --> 00:08:00.170
If someone wanted
to build a seven-star hotel

00:08:00.194 --> 00:08:02.009
at the bottom of the Grand Canyon,

00:08:02.033 --> 00:08:04.161
then we would laugh them out of Arizona.

00:08:04.494 --> 00:08:08.903
Yet every day we dredge, pollute
and overfish our oceans.

00:08:08.927 --> 00:08:11.333
And I think it's easier for us to do that,

00:08:11.357 --> 00:08:13.453
because when we see the ocean,

00:08:13.477 --> 00:08:15.405
we don't see the havoc we're wreaking.

00:08:15.429 --> 00:08:16.999
Because for most people,

00:08:17.023 --> 00:08:18.523
the ocean is like this.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.131
And it's really hard

00:08:20.155 --> 00:08:25.573
to think of something that's just
so plain and so enormous, as fragile.

00:08:25.597 --> 00:08:28.950
It's simply too massive,
too vast, too endless.

00:08:29.387 --> 00:08:30.610
And what do you see here?
