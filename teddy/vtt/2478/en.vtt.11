00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.430
So here's the thing:

00:05:30.454 --> 00:05:33.217
the most used, searched and shared image

00:05:33.241 --> 00:05:36.121
of all my work thus far is this.

00:05:37.256 --> 00:05:39.406
And I think this is for a reason,

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.949
or at least I hope it is.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.700
What I really hope is that people
are beginning to understand

00:05:44.724 --> 00:05:48.392

and the destruction of nature,

00:05:48.416 --> 00:05:51.282
that we need to start thinking
about our oceans, too.

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:54.215

we've seen some phenomenal

00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:55.814
and unexpected results.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.409
Besides creating over 800 square meters
of new habitats and living reef,
