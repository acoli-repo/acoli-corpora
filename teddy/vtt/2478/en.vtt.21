giving something back,

00:10:33.183 --> 00:10:36.541
and by encouraging
new environments to thrive,

00:10:36.565 --> 00:10:41.634
and in some way opening up a new --
or maybe it's a really old way

00:10:41.658 --> 00:10:43.725
of seeing the seas:

00:10:43.749 --> 00:10:47.279
as delicate, precious places,

00:10:47.303 --> 00:10:49.072
worthy of our protection.

00:10:49.896 --> 00:10:51.651
Our oceans are sacred.

00:10:51.675 --> 00:10:53.176
Thank you.
