00:03:39.288 --> 00:03:40.439
But over the years,

00:03:40.463 --> 00:03:43.822
I've realized that the greatest
thing about what we do,

00:03:43.846 --> 00:03:46.345
the really humbling thing about the work,

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:48.582
is that as soon as we
submerge the sculptures,

00:03:48.606 --> 00:03:50.132
they're not ours anymore,

00:03:50.156 --> 00:03:51.704
because as soon as we sink them,

00:03:51.728 --> 00:03:53.989
the sculptures, they belong to the sea.

00:03:54.013 --> 00:03:58.032
As new reefs form, a new world
literally starts to evolve,

00:03:58.056 --> 00:04:00.257
a world that continuously amazes me.
