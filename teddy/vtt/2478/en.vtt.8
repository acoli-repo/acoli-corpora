00:03:58.056 --> 00:04:00.257
a world that continuously amazes me.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.218
It's a bit of a cliché,
but nothing man-made

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:05.733
can ever match the imagination of nature.

00:04:06.591 --> 00:04:09.511
Sponges look like veins across the faces.

00:04:10.478 --> 00:04:13.303
Staghorn coral morphs the form.

00:04:14.567 --> 00:04:17.977
Fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed.

00:04:19.557 --> 00:04:22.731
Tunicates explode from the faces.

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:28.009
Sea urchins crawl across
the bodies feeding at night.
