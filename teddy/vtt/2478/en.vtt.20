00:09:57.705 --> 00:10:00.227
you get taken out to the ocean,

00:10:00.251 --> 00:10:03.012
to an underwater Noah's Ark,

00:10:03.036 --> 00:10:07.006
which you can access
through a dry-glass viewing tunnel,

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.432
where you can see
all the wildlife of the land

00:10:09.456 --> 00:10:11.805
be colonized by the wildlife of the ocean.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.216
Clearly, it would blow your mind.

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.251
So let's think big and let's think deep.

00:10:18.569 --> 00:10:22.005
Who knows where our imagination
and willpower can lead us?

00:10:22.029 --> 00:10:24.977
I hope that by bringing
our art into the ocean,

00:10:25.001 --> 00:10:28.530
that not only do we take advantage
of amazing creativity

00:10:28.554 --> 00:10:30.689
and visual impact of the setting,
