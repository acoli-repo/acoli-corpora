00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:03.603
But because of our work there,
there's now a little corner of Cancun

00:09:03.627 --> 00:09:06.309
that is simply precious for being itself.

00:09:07.071 --> 00:09:09.702
And we don't want to stop in Grenada,

00:09:09.726 --> 00:09:12.036
in Cancun or the Bahamas.

00:09:12.496 --> 00:09:16.387
Just last month, I installed
these Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse

00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:17.911
in the Thames River,

00:09:19.062 --> 00:09:22.564
in central London, right in front
of the Houses of Parliament,

00:09:22.588 --> 00:09:25.545
putting a stark message
about climate change

00:09:25.569 --> 00:09:29.393
in front of the people that have
the power to help change things.
