00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:35.084
Each project, we use materials
and designs that help encourage life;

00:01:35.108 --> 00:01:40.905
a long-lasting pH-neutral cement
provides a stable and permanent platform.

00:01:41.398 --> 00:01:44.262
It is textured to allow
coral polyps to attach.

00:01:45.262 --> 00:01:47.979
We position them down current
from natural reefs

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:51.445
so that after spawning,
there's areas for them to settle.

00:01:53.937 --> 00:01:56.835
The formations are all configured
so that they aggregate fish

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:58.516
on a really large scale.
