00:06:28.552 --> 00:06:32.819
in the government designating a spot --
a marine-protected area.

00:06:32.843 --> 00:06:36.202
Entrance fees to the park
now help fund park rangers

00:06:36.226 --> 00:06:38.812
to manage tourism and fishing quotas.

00:06:39.293 --> 00:06:41.901
The site was actually listed
as a "Wonder of the World"

00:06:41.925 --> 00:06:43.164
by National Geographic.

00:06:44.297 --> 00:06:46.877
So why are we all here today in this room?

00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:48.902
What do we all have in common?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.195
I think we all share a fear

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:53.353
that we don't protect our oceans enough.

00:06:53.837 --> 00:06:55.484
And one way of thinking about this

00:06:55.508 --> 00:06:58.853
is that we don't regard
our oceans as sacred,

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:00.115
and we should.
