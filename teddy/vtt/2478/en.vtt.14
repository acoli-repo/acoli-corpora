WEBVTT

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:00.115
and we should.

00:07:00.572 --> 00:07:02.135
When we see incredible places --

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:06.097
like the Himalayas
or the La Sagrada Família,

00:07:06.121 --> 00:07:07.782
or the Mona Lisa, even --

00:07:07.806 --> 00:07:10.695
when we see these incredible
places and things,

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:12.764
we understand their importance.

00:07:12.788 --> 00:07:14.178
We call them sacred,

00:07:14.202 --> 00:07:17.859
and we do our best
to cherish them, to protect them

00:07:17.883 --> 00:07:19.477
and to keep them safe.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.185
But in order to do that,

00:07:21.209 --> 00:07:24.539
we are the ones that have
to assign that value;

00:07:24.563 --> 00:07:26.096
otherwise, it will be desecrated

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.744
by someone who doesn't
understand that value.

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:33.384
So I want to finish up tonight
by talking about sacred things.
