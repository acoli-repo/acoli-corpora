00:08:29.387 --> 00:08:30.610
And what do you see here?

00:08:30.634 --> 00:08:33.323
I think most people actually
look past to the horizon.

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:35.402
So I think there's a real danger

00:08:35.426 --> 00:08:38.313
that we never really see the sea,

00:08:38.337 --> 00:08:39.846
and if we don't really see it,

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.269
if it doesn't have its own iconography,

00:08:42.293 --> 00:08:44.305
if we miss its majesty,

00:08:44.329 --> 00:08:47.327
then there's a big danger
that we take it for granted.

00:08:48.772 --> 00:08:52.089
Cancun is famous for spring break,

00:08:52.113 --> 00:08:54.372
tequila and foam parties.

00:08:54.396 --> 00:08:57.939
And its waters are where frat boys
can ride around on Jet Skis

00:08:57.963 --> 00:08:59.225
and banana boats.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:03.603
But because of our work there,
there's now a little corner of Cancun
