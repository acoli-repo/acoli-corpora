Even this VW Beetle
has an internal living habitat

00:02:04.503 --> 00:02:08.465
to encourage crustaceans
such as lobsters and sea urchins.

00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:13.473
So why exhibit my work in the ocean?

00:02:13.497 --> 00:02:16.035
Because honestly, it's really not easy.

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:19.264
When you're in the middle of the sea
under a hundred-foot crane,

00:02:19.288 --> 00:02:22.383
trying to lower eight tons
down to the sea floor,

00:02:22.407 --> 00:02:26.336
you start to wonder whether I shouldn't
have taken up watercolor painting instead.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.361
(Laughter)

00:02:27.385 --> 00:02:30.098
But in the end, the results
always blow my mind.
