Ten years ago,

00:00:02.318 --> 00:00:04.214
I had my first exhibition here.

00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:08.654
I had no idea if it would work
or was at all possible,

00:00:08.678 --> 00:00:12.091
but with a few small steps
and a very steep learning curve,

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:15.358
I made my first sculpture,
called "The Lost Correspondent."

00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:19.823
Teaming up with a marine biologist
and a local dive center,

00:00:19.847 --> 00:00:22.516
I submerged the work
off the coast of Grenada,

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.195
in an area decimated by Hurricane Ivan.

00:00:25.957 --> 00:00:28.083
And then this incredible thing happened.

00:00:28.554 --> 00:00:29.923
It transformed.
