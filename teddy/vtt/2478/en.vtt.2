00:00:59.228 --> 00:01:01.921
And then finally, to an underwater museum,

00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:03.998
with over 500 living sculptures.

00:01:06.076 --> 00:01:08.934
Gardening, it seems,
is not just for greenhouses.

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:14.017
We've since scaled up the designs:

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:18.151
"Ocean Atlas," in the Bahamas,
rising 16 feet up to the surface

00:01:18.175 --> 00:01:19.897
and weighing over 40 tons,

00:01:21.825 --> 00:01:23.613
to now currently in Lanzarote,

00:01:23.637 --> 00:01:26.772
where I'm making
an underwater botanical garden,

00:01:26.796 --> 00:01:29.102
the first of its kind
in the Atlantic Ocean.
