00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:33.384
So I want to finish up tonight
by talking about sacred things.

00:07:33.408 --> 00:07:35.562
When we were naming the site in Cancun,

00:07:35.586 --> 00:07:39.904
we named it a museum for a very
important and simple reason:

00:07:39.928 --> 00:07:42.355
museums are places of preservation,

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:45.173
of conservation and of education.

00:07:45.524 --> 00:07:48.960
They're places where we keep
objects of great value to us,

00:07:48.984 --> 00:07:52.093
where we simply treasure them
for them being themselves.

00:07:52.966 --> 00:07:55.753
If someone was to throw
an egg at the Sistine Chapel,

00:07:55.777 --> 00:07:57.307
we'd all go crazy.

00:07:57.704 --> 00:08:00.170
If someone wanted
to build a seven-star hotel
