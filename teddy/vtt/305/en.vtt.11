00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:31.671
to reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities

00:05:31.671 --> 00:05:33.360
they find in their code.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.910
Unfortunately, due to some miscommunications,

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.946
his report was not acknowledged.

00:05:39.946 --> 00:05:41.791
Frustrated with the exchange,

00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:45.068
he took to use his own discovery

00:05:45.068 --> 00:05:48.203
to post on Mark Zuckerberg's wall.

00:05:48.203 --> 00:05:50.970
This got their attention, all right,

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.265
and they fixed the bug,

00:05:54.265 --> 00:05:57.120
but because he hadn't reported it properly,

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.345
he was denied the bounty usually paid out

00:05:59.345 --> 00:06:01.349
for such discoveries.
