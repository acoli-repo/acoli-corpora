He's the NSA director and U.S. cyber commander,

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:07.878
but instead of his four star general uniform,

00:14:07.878 --> 00:14:10.174
he was wearing jeans and a t-shirt.

00:14:10.174 --> 00:14:11.918
This was at DEF CON,

00:14:11.918 --> 00:14:15.023
the world's largest hacker conference.

00:14:15.023 --> 00:14:16.950
Perhaps like me, General Alexander

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.770
didn't see 12,000 criminals that day in Vegas.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.881
I think he saw untapped potential.

00:14:23.881 --> 00:14:27.254
In fact, he was there to give a hiring pitch.

00:14:27.254 --> 00:14:29.894
"In this room right here," he said,

00:14:29.894 --> 00:14:32.284
"is the talent our nation needs."
