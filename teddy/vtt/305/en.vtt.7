00:03:28.132 --> 00:03:30.369
Indeed, many hackers do not resist

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:32.357
those temptations,

00:03:32.357 --> 00:03:35.482
and so they are responsible in one way or another

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:37.886
to billions of dollars lost each year

00:03:37.886 --> 00:03:41.147
to fraud, malware or plain old identity theft,

00:03:41.147 --> 00:03:43.025
which is a serious issue.

00:03:43.025 --> 00:03:45.010
But there are other hackers,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.772

00:03:47.772 --> 00:03:50.480
and it is precisely those hackers

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.773
that can find the weaker elements in our world

00:03:53.773 --> 00:03:55.450
and make us fix it.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.370
This is what happened last year

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.379
when another security researcher

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.944
called Kyle Lovett
