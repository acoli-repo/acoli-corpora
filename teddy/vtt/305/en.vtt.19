00:09:28.842 --> 00:09:33.382
They grab the spotlight for causes they support,

00:09:33.382 --> 00:09:36.013
forcing us to take note,

00:09:36.013 --> 00:09:38.478
acting as a global magnifying glass

00:09:38.478 --> 00:09:40.622
for issues that we are not as aware of

00:09:40.622 --> 00:09:42.731
but perhaps we should be.

00:09:42.731 --> 00:09:44.584
They have been called many names

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.355
from criminals to terrorists,

00:09:46.355 --> 00:09:49.801
and I cannot justify their illegal means,

00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:51.942
but the ideas they fight for

00:09:51.942 --> 00:09:55.968
are ones that matter to us all.

00:09:55.968 --> 00:09:57.951
The reality is,

00:09:57.951 --> 00:10:00.756
hackers can do a lot more than break things.
