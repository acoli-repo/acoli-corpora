Their moment of transformation was in early 2008

00:08:04.429 --> 00:08:06.079
when the Church of Scientology

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:09.146
attempted to remove certain leaked videos

00:08:09.146 --> 00:08:13.549
from appearing on certain websites.

00:08:13.549 --> 00:08:15.989
This is when Anonymous was forged

00:08:15.989 --> 00:08:18.620
out of the seemingly random collection

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.363
of Internet dwellers.

00:08:20.363 --> 00:08:22.817
It turns out,

00:08:22.817 --> 00:08:24.146
the Internet doesn't like it

00:08:24.146 --> 00:08:26.769
when you try to remove things from it,

00:08:26.769 --> 00:08:29.739
and it will react with cyberattacks

00:08:29.739 --> 00:08:31.840
and elaborate pranks
