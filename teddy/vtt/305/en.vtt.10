00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.445
is a practice called full disclosure

00:05:01.445 --> 00:05:03.047
in the hacker community,

00:05:03.047 --> 00:05:05.081
and it is controversial,

00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:07.613
but it does make me think of how hackers

00:05:07.613 --> 00:05:10.599
have an evolving effect on technologies we use

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.095
every day.

00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:14.373
This is what Khalil did.

00:05:14.373 --> 00:05:16.988
Khalil is a Palestinian hacker from the West Bank,

00:05:16.988 --> 00:05:20.997
and he found a serious privacy flaw on Facebook

00:05:20.997 --> 00:05:22.847
which he attempted to report

00:05:22.847 --> 00:05:25.837
through the company's bug bounty program.

00:05:25.837 --> 00:05:28.494
These are usually great arrangements for companies

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:31.671
to reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities
