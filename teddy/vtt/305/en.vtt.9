00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.105
until two months ago

00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:32.538
when a group of hackers used it

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:34.992
to get into people's files.

00:04:34.992 --> 00:04:37.393
But they didn't steal anything.

00:04:37.393 --> 00:04:39.410
They left a note:

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.288
Your router and your documents

00:04:41.288 --> 00:04:43.447
can be accessed by anyone in the world.

00:04:43.447 --> 00:04:45.715
Here's what you should do to fix it.

00:04:45.715 --> 00:04:48.093
We hope we helped.

00:04:48.093 --> 00:04:50.623
By getting into people's files like that,

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.083
yeah, they broke the law,

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.551
but they also forced that company

00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:56.532
to fix their product.

00:04:56.532 --> 00:04:58.700
Making vulnerabilities known to the public

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.445
is a practice called full disclosure
