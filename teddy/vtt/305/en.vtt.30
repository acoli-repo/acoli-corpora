00:14:56.806 --> 00:15:00.218
but hackers are perhaps the only ones

00:15:00.218 --> 00:15:04.101
still capable of challenging
overreaching governments

00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:06.316
and data-hoarding corporates

00:15:06.316 --> 00:15:08.794
on their own playing field.

00:15:08.794 --> 00:15:11.914
To me, that represents hope.

00:15:11.914 --> 00:15:13.238
For the past three decades,

00:15:13.238 --> 00:15:14.789
hackers have done a lot of things,

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:18.006
but they have also impacted civil liberties,

00:15:18.006 --> 00:15:20.376
innovation and Internet freedom,

00:15:20.376 --> 00:15:23.305
so I think it's time we take a good look

00:15:23.305 --> 00:15:25.435
at how we choose to portray them,

00:15:25.435 --> 00:15:29.019
because if we keep expecting
them to be the bad guys,

00:15:29.019 --> 00:15:32.489
how can they be the heroes too?
