00:08:29.739 --> 00:08:31.840
and elaborate pranks

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.489
and with a series of organized protests

00:08:34.489 --> 00:08:35.834
all around the world,

00:08:35.834 --> 00:08:37.822
from my hometown of Tel Aviv

00:08:37.822 --> 00:08:40.066
to Adelaide, Australia.

00:08:40.066 --> 00:08:43.196
This proved that Anonymous and this idea

00:08:43.196 --> 00:08:46.279
can rally the masses from the keyboards

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:47.855
to the streets,

00:08:47.855 --> 00:08:49.802
and it laid the foundations

00:08:49.802 --> 00:08:52.020
for dozens of future operations

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.960
against perceived injustices

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.316
to their online and offline world.

00:08:57.316 --> 00:08:59.341
Since then, they've gone after many targets.

00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:02.130
They've uncovered corruption, abuse.
