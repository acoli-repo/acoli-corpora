00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.944
called Kyle Lovett

00:04:00.944 --> 00:04:02.501
discovered a gaping hole

00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:05.461
in the design of certain wireless routers

00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:08.000
like you might have in your home or office.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.645
He learned that anyone could remotely connect

00:04:10.645 --> 00:04:12.967
to these devices over the Internet

00:04:12.967 --> 00:04:15.728
and download documents from hard drives

00:04:15.728 --> 00:04:17.903
attached to those routers,

00:04:17.903 --> 00:04:19.750
no password needed.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.087
He reported it to the company, of course,

00:04:22.087 --> 00:04:24.401
but they ignored his report.

00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:26.265
Perhaps they thought universal access

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:29.250
was a feature, not a bug,

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.105
until two months ago
