00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:04.730
Today, I'm going to talk about
a shameful topic.

00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:09.497
This has happened to many of us,
and it's embarrassing,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.897
but if we don't talk about it,
nothing will ever change.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.997
It's about being hacked.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.230
Some of us have clicked on a phishing link
and downloaded a computer virus.

00:00:20.263 --> 00:00:22.697
Some of us have had our identities stolen.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.730
And those of us
who are software developers

00:00:24.763 --> 00:00:28.130
might have written insecure code
with security bugs in it

00:00:28.163 --> 00:00:29.563
without realizing it.
