00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.510
The idea here is, rather than have students

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.696
walk into class and watch lectures,

00:08:33.696 --> 00:08:36.738
we replace this with what we call lessons.

00:08:36.738 --> 00:08:38.982
Lessons are interleaved sequences

00:08:38.982 --> 00:08:41.663
of videos and interactive exercises.

00:08:41.663 --> 00:08:44.842
So a student might watch a five-, seven-minute video

00:08:44.842 --> 00:08:47.882
and follow that with an interactive exercise.

00:08:47.882 --> 00:08:51.027
Think of this as the ultimate
Socratization of education.

00:08:51.027 --> 00:08:53.007
You teach by asking questions.

00:08:53.007 --> 00:08:54.511
And this is a form of learning

00:08:54.511 --> 00:08:55.788
called active learning,

00:08:55.788 --> 00:08:59.067
and really promoted by a very early paper, in 1972,

00:08:59.067 --> 00:09:00.585
by Craik and Lockhart,
