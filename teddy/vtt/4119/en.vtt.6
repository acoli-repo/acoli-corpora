00:02:59.288 --> 00:03:01.447
we are applying these technologies to education

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:04.633
through MOOCs to really
increase access to education.

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:06.350
And you heard of this example,

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.966
where, when we launched our very first course --

00:03:08.966 --> 00:03:10.732
and this was an MIT-hard

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.320
circuits and electronics course --

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.014
about a year and a half ago,

00:03:15.014 --> 00:03:20.317
155,000 students from 162 countries

00:03:20.317 --> 00:03:22.020
enrolled in this course.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.706
And we had no marketing budget.

00:03:24.706 --> 00:03:28.194
Now, 155,000 is a big number.

00:03:28.194 --> 00:03:29.933
This number is bigger

00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:32.564
than the total number of alumni of MIT
