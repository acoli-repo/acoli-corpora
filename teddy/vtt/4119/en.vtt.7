00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:32.564
than the total number of alumni of MIT

00:03:32.564 --> 00:03:36.389
in its 150-year history.

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.547
7,200 students passed the course,

00:03:38.547 --> 00:03:41.010
and this was a hard course.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.464
7,200 is also a big number.

00:03:44.464 --> 00:03:48.006
If I were to teach at MIT two semesters every year,

00:03:48.006 --> 00:03:50.883
I would have to teach for 40 years

00:03:50.883 --> 00:03:53.485
before I could teach this many students.

00:03:53.485 --> 00:03:55.023
Now these large numbers

00:03:55.023 --> 00:03:57.181
are just one part of the story.

00:03:57.181 --> 00:03:59.843
So today, I want to discuss a different aspect,

00:03:59.843 --> 00:04:01.068
the other side of MOOCs,
