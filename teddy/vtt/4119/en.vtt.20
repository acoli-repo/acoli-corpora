00:09:58.544 --> 00:10:00.168
you've forgotten all about it.

00:10:00.168 --> 00:10:02.245
I don't think I've still received
some of my homeworks

00:10:02.245 --> 00:10:03.730
from my undergraduate days.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.077
Some are never graded.

00:10:05.077 --> 00:10:06.571
So with instant feedback,

00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:08.061
students can try to apply answers.

00:10:08.061 --> 00:10:10.470
If they get it wrong, they can get instant feedback.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.118
They can try it again and try it again,

00:10:12.118 --> 00:10:14.051
and this really becomes much more engaging.

00:10:14.051 --> 00:10:15.634
They get the instant feedback,

00:10:15.634 --> 00:10:18.553
and this little green check mark that you see here

00:10:18.553 --> 00:10:22.143
is becoming somewhat of a cult symbol at edX.

00:10:22.143 --> 00:10:25.031
Learners are telling us that they go to bed at night

00:10:25.047 --> 00:10:28.491
dreaming of the green check mark.

00:10:28.491 --> 00:10:30.293
In fact, one of our learners
