00:12:29.605 --> 00:12:31.299
and before I can finish,

00:12:31.299 --> 00:12:33.973
another student from Egypt
popped in with an answer,

00:12:33.973 --> 00:12:35.891
not quite right, so I'm fixing the answer,

00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:37.859
and before I can finish, a student from the U.S.

00:12:37.859 --> 00:12:39.468
had popped in with a different answer.

00:12:39.468 --> 00:12:42.268
And then I sat back, fascinated.

00:12:42.268 --> 00:12:44.215
Boom, boom, boom, boom, the students were

00:12:44.215 --> 00:12:46.166
discussing and interacting with each other,

00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:48.684
and by 4 a.m. that night, I'm totally fascinated,

00:12:48.684 --> 00:12:50.152
having this epiphany,

00:12:50.152 --> 00:12:51.408
and by 4 a.m. in the morning,

00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:53.161
they had discovered the right answer.

00:12:53.161 --> 00:12:54.888
And all I had to do was go and bless it,

00:12:54.888 --> 00:12:56.854
"Good answer."

00:12:56.854 --> 00:12:59.206
So this is absolutely amazing,

00:12:59.206 --> 00:13:01.016
where students are learning from each other,
