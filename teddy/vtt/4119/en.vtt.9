It's a digital language.

00:04:31.856 --> 00:04:38.570
It's got two sounds: a grunt and a silence.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.886
"Honey, come over for dinner."

00:04:41.886 --> 00:04:43.481
"Hmm."

00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:45.615
"Did you hear me?"

00:04:45.615 --> 00:04:47.878
Silence. (Laughter)

00:04:47.878 --> 00:04:49.250
"Can you listen to me?"

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.622
&amp;quot;Hmm.&amp;quot;

00:04:50.622 --> 00:04:52.578
So we had a real issue with communicating,

00:04:52.578 --> 00:04:54.846
and we were just not communicating,

00:04:54.846 --> 00:04:57.860
until one day I had this epiphany.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.523
I texted her. (Laughter)
