00:08:59.067 --> 00:09:00.585
by Craik and Lockhart,

00:09:00.585 --> 00:09:02.106
where they said and discovered

00:09:02.106 --> 00:09:04.486
that learning and retention really relates strongly

00:09:04.486 --> 00:09:06.235
to the depth of mental processing.

00:09:06.235 --> 00:09:07.727
Students learn much better

00:09:07.727 --> 00:09:10.915
when they are interacting with the material.

00:09:10.915 --> 00:09:13.693
The second idea is self-pacing.

00:09:13.693 --> 00:09:15.329
Now, when I went to a lecture hall,

00:09:15.329 --> 00:09:16.619
and if you were like me,

00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:18.585
by the fifth minute I would lose the professor.

00:09:18.585 --> 00:09:22.165
I wasn't all that smart, and I would
be scrambling, taking notes,

00:09:22.165 --> 00:09:25.356
and then I would lose the lecture
for the rest of the hour.

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:27.826
Instead, wouldn't it be nice with online technologies,

00:09:27.826 --> 00:09:31.694
we offer videos and interactive
engagements to students?
