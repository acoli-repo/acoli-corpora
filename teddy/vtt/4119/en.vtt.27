00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:31.190
It can also solve a practical problem of MOOCs,

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:32.870
the business aspect.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.186
We can also license these MOOC courses

00:13:35.186 --> 00:13:36.925
to other universities,

00:13:36.925 --> 00:13:39.489
and therein lies a revenue model for MOOCs,

00:13:39.489 --> 00:13:41.878
where the university that
licenses it with the professor

00:13:41.878 --> 00:13:43.715
can use these online courses

00:13:43.715 --> 00:13:45.916
like the next-generation textbook.

00:13:45.916 --> 00:13:48.371
They can use as much or as little as they like,

00:13:48.371 --> 00:13:53.857
and it becomes a tool in the teacher's arsenal.

00:13:53.857 --> 00:13:55.907
Finally, I would like to have you

00:13:55.907 --> 00:13:58.748
dream with me for a little bit.

00:13:58.748 --> 00:14:02.917
I would like us to really reimagine education.
