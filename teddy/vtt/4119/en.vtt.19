WEBVTT

00:09:27.826 --> 00:09:31.694
we offer videos and interactive
engagements to students?

00:09:31.694 --> 00:09:33.425
They can hit the pause button.

00:09:33.425 --> 00:09:35.916
They can rewind the professor.

00:09:35.916 --> 00:09:39.015
Heck, they can even mute the professor.

00:09:39.015 --> 00:09:41.069
So this form of self-pacing

00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:43.694
can be very helpful to learning.

00:09:43.694 --> 00:09:47.048
The third idea that we have is instant feedback.

00:09:47.048 --> 00:09:48.525
With instant feedback,

00:09:48.525 --> 00:09:50.380
the computer grades exercises.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.675
I mean, how else do you teach 150,000 students?

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:54.969
Your computer is grading all the exercises.

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:56.503
And we've all submitted homeworks,

00:09:56.503 --> 00:09:58.544
and your grades come back two weeks later,

00:09:58.544 --> 00:10:00.168
you've forgotten all about it.
