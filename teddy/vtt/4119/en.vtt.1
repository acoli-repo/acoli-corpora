00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:32.128
and get a credential at the end of it.

00:00:32.128 --> 00:00:34.752
Now, in this discussion today,

00:00:34.752 --> 00:00:35.987
I'm going to focus

00:00:35.987 --> 00:00:39.255
on a different aspect of MOOCs.

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:41.606
We are taking what we are learning

00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:44.171
and the technologies we are developing in the large

00:00:44.171 --> 00:00:46.271
and applying them in the small

00:00:46.271 --> 00:00:49.250
to create a blended model of education

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.043
to really reinvent and reimagine

00:00:51.043 --> 00:00:53.470
what we do in the classroom.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.980
Now, our classrooms could use change.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.401
So, here's a classroom

00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:00.426
at this little three-letter institute
