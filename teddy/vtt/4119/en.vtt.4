00:01:58.495 --> 00:02:00.607
200 feet away from the instructor,

00:02:00.607 --> 00:02:05.502
I think they are undergoing long-distance education.

00:02:05.502 --> 00:02:07.177
Now, I really believe

00:02:07.177 --> 00:02:09.392
that we can transform education,

00:02:09.392 --> 00:02:12.238
both in quality and scale and access,

00:02:12.238 --> 00:02:14.546
through technology.

00:02:14.546 --> 00:02:18.241
For example, at edX,

00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:20.494
we are trying to transform education

00:02:20.494 --> 00:02:23.654
through online technologies.

00:02:23.654 --> 00:02:26.913
Given education has been calcified for 500 years,

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:29.104
we really cannot think about reengineering it,

00:02:29.104 --> 00:02:30.249
micromanaging it.
