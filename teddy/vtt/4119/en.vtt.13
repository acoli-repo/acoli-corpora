Then they come into the classroom

00:06:32.927 --> 00:06:36.351
for some in-person interaction.

00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:38.188

00:06:38.188 --> 00:06:39.764
They can solve problems together.

00:06:39.764 --> 00:06:40.910
They can work with the professor

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.904

this was happening unbeknownst to us.

00:06:52.572 --> 00:06:54.111
Two high school teachers

00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:57.793
at the Sant High School in Mongolia

00:06:57.793 --> 00:06:59.940
had flipped their classroom,

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.219
and they were using our video lectures
