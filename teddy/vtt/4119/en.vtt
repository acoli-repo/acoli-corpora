00:00:00.207 --> 00:00:03.558
I'd like to reimagine education.

00:00:03.558 --> 00:00:05.148
The last year

00:00:05.148 --> 00:00:08.054
has seen the invention of a new four-letter word.

00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:09.967
It starts with an M.

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:14.424
MOOC: massive open online courses.

00:00:14.424 --> 00:00:15.901
Many organizations

00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:18.659
are offering these online courses

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:22.689
to students all over the world, in the millions, for free.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.249
Anybody who has an Internet connection

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:26.777
and the will to learn can access these great courses

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:28.871
from excellent universities

00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:32.128
and get a credential at the end of it.
