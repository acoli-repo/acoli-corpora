00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.689
again, a hard course,

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:03.805
had a failure rate of about 40 to 41 percent

00:08:03.805 --> 00:08:05.305
every semester.

00:08:05.305 --> 00:08:08.003
With this blended class late last year,

00:08:08.003 --> 00:08:11.984
the failure rate fell to nine percent.

00:08:11.984 --> 00:08:15.747
So the results can be extremely, extremely good.

00:08:15.747 --> 00:08:18.974
Now before we go too far into this,

00:08:18.974 --> 00:08:21.626
I'd like to spend some time discussing

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:22.775
some key ideas.

00:08:22.775 --> 00:08:23.986
What are some key ideas

00:08:23.986 --> 00:08:26.843
that makes all of this work?

00:08:26.843 --> 00:08:29.070
One idea is active learning.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.510
The idea here is, rather than have students
