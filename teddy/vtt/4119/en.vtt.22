00:10:58.554 --> 00:11:01.398
has this to say about instant feedback:

00:11:01.398 --> 00:11:04.399
He indicated that instant feedback

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:10.174
turns teaching moments into learning outcomes.

00:11:10.174 --> 00:11:12.466
The next big idea is gamification.

00:11:12.466 --> 00:11:14.367
You know, all learners engage really well

00:11:14.367 --> 00:11:15.876
with interactive videos and so on.

00:11:15.876 --> 00:11:17.141
You know, they would sit down and shoot

00:11:17.141 --> 00:11:19.485
alien spaceships all day long until they get it.

00:11:19.485 --> 00:11:22.272
So we applied these gamification
techniques to learning,

00:11:22.272 --> 00:11:24.495
and we can build these online laboratories.

00:11:24.495 --> 00:11:26.742
How do you teach creativity?
How do you teach design?

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:28.421
We can do this through online labs

00:11:28.421 --> 00:11:29.698
and use computing power

00:11:29.698 --> 00:11:31.287
to build these online labs.
