00:07:27.184 --> 00:07:30.156
working with San Jose State University in California,

00:07:30.156 --> 00:07:32.003
again, with the circuits and electronics course.

00:07:32.003 --> 00:07:34.471
You'll hear that a lot. That course has become

00:07:34.471 --> 00:07:37.947
sort of like our petri dish of learning.

00:07:37.947 --> 00:07:40.215
So there, the students would, again,

00:07:40.215 --> 00:07:42.942
the instructors flipped the classroom,

00:07:42.942 --> 00:07:44.663
blended online and in person,

00:07:44.663 --> 00:07:46.971
and the results were staggering.

00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:49.613
Now don't take these results to the bank just yet.

00:07:49.613 --> 00:07:52.101
Just wait a little bit longer as we
experiment with this some more,

00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:54.262
but the early results are incredible.

00:07:54.262 --> 00:07:56.659
So traditionally, semester upon semester,

00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:59.000
for the past several years, this course,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.689
again, a hard course,
