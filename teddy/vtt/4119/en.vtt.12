00:05:58.725 --> 00:06:01.329
embraced the millennial generation's

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:02.594
natural predilections,

00:06:02.594 --> 00:06:05.639
and really think about creating
these online technologies,

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.073
blend them into their lives.

00:06:07.073 --> 00:06:08.896
So here's what we can do.

00:06:08.896 --> 00:06:11.388
So rather than driving our kids into a classroom,

00:06:11.388 --> 00:06:13.960
herding them out there at 8 o'clock in the morning --

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.718
I hated going to class at 8 o'clock in the morning,

00:06:16.718 --> 00:06:18.800
so why are we forcing our kids to do that?

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.974
So instead what you do

00:06:19.974 --> 00:06:21.994
is you have them watch videos

00:06:21.994 --> 00:06:23.805
and do interactive exercises

00:06:23.805 --> 00:06:26.494
in the comfort of their dorm rooms, in their bedroom,

00:06:26.494 --> 00:06:28.355
in the dining room, in the bathroom,

00:06:28.355 --> 00:06:30.932
wherever they're most creative.
