00:11:58.944 --> 00:12:02.170
When we did our circuits course

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.036
for the 155,000 students,

00:12:04.036 --> 00:12:05.701
I didn't sleep for three nights

00:12:05.701 --> 00:12:07.588
leading up to the launch of the course.

00:12:07.588 --> 00:12:10.147
I told my TAs, okay, 24/7,

00:12:10.147 --> 00:12:11.413
we're going to be up

00:12:11.413 --> 00:12:13.287
monitoring the forum, answering questions.

00:12:13.287 --> 00:12:15.260
They had answered questions for 100 students.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.121
How do you do that for 150,000?

00:12:18.121 --> 00:12:20.457
So one night I'm sitting up there, at 2 a.m. at night,

00:12:20.457 --> 00:12:21.678
and I think there's this question

00:12:21.678 --> 00:12:23.649
from a student from Pakistan,

00:12:23.649 --> 00:12:24.977
and he asked a question, and I said,

00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:26.433
okay, let me go and type up an answer,

00:12:26.433 --> 00:12:28.041
I don't type all that fast,

00:12:28.041 --> 00:12:29.605
and I begin typing up the answer,

00:12:29.605 --> 00:12:31.299
and before I can finish,
