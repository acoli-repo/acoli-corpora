00:13:58.748 --> 00:14:02.917
I would like us to really reimagine education.

00:14:02.917 --> 00:14:07.042
We will have to move from lecture halls to e-spaces.

00:14:07.042 --> 00:14:09.717
We have to move from books to tablets

00:14:09.717 --> 00:14:11.543
like the Aakash in India

00:14:11.543 --> 00:14:13.891
or the Raspberry Pi, 20 dollars.

00:14:13.891 --> 00:14:15.898
The Aakash is 40 dollars.

00:14:15.898 --> 00:14:18.812
We have to move from
bricks-and-mortar school buildings

00:14:18.812 --> 00:14:21.433
to digital dormitories.

00:14:21.433 --> 00:14:22.881
But I think at the end of the day,

00:14:22.881 --> 00:14:25.123
I think we will still need one lecture hall

00:14:25.123 --> 00:14:27.685
in our universities.

00:14:27.685 --> 00:14:30.509
Otherwise, how else do we tell our grandchildren
