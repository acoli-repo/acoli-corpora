Now, I'm older, and my
youthful looks might belie that,

00:05:30.882 --> 00:05:34.738
but I'm not in the millennial generation.

00:05:34.738 --> 00:05:36.370
But our kids are really different.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.229
The millennial generation is completely comfortable

with online technology.

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:41.498

00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:52.711
will develop really, really little, itty-bitty thumbs

00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:54.094

00:05:54.094 --> 00:05:56.954

00:05:56.954 --> 00:05:58.725
