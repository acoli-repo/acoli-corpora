00:02:29.104 --> 00:02:30.249
micromanaging it.

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.557
We really have to completely reimagine it.

00:02:32.557 --> 00:02:36.598
It's like going from ox carts to the airplane.

00:02:36.598 --> 00:02:38.121
Even the infrastructure has to change.

00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:39.734
Everything has to change.

00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:43.099
We need to go from lectures on the blackboard

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.707
to online exercises, online videos.

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:48.188
We have to go to interactive virtual laboratories

00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:49.837
and gamification.

00:02:49.837 --> 00:02:51.748
We have to go to completely online grading

00:02:51.748 --> 00:02:54.501
and peer interaction and discussion boards.

00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:56.782
Everything really has to change.

00:02:56.782 --> 00:02:59.288
So at edX and a number of other organizations,

00:02:59.288 --> 00:03:01.447
we are applying these technologies to education
