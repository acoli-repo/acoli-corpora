00:00:58.401 --> 00:01:00.426
at this little three-letter institute

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:03.210
in the Northeast of America, MIT.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.529
And this was a classroom about 50 or 60 years ago,

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:08.996
and this is a classroom today.

00:01:08.996 --> 00:01:12.116

The seats are in color.

00:01:14.663 --> 00:01:17.791
Whoop-de-do.

00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:20.502
Education really hasn't changed

00:01:20.502 --> 00:01:22.197
in the past 500 years.

00:01:22.197 --> 00:01:24.528

00:01:24.528 --> 00:01:28.010
was the printing press and the textbooks.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.420
Everything else has changed around us.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.243
