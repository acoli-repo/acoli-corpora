the other side of MOOCs,

00:04:01.068 --> 00:04:03.247
take a different perspective.

00:04:03.247 --> 00:04:06.182
We are taking what we develop
and learn in the large

00:04:06.182 --> 00:04:07.727
and applying it in the small

00:04:07.727 --> 00:04:11.723
to the classroom, to create
a blended model of learning.

00:04:11.723 --> 00:04:16.326
But before I go into that, let me tell you a story.

00:04:16.326 --> 00:04:20.410
When my daughter turned 13, became a teenager,

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.777
she stopped speaking English,

00:04:23.777 --> 00:04:26.838
and she began speaking this new language.

00:04:26.838 --> 00:04:29.644
I call it teen-lish.

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.856
It's a digital language.
