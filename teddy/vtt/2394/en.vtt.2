She said, "Oh, great you called.

00:01:01.126 --> 00:01:05.078
We have four or five apartments
available right now."

00:01:05.078 --> 00:01:08.072
She said, "Do you want 
a one-bedroom or two-bedroom?"

00:01:08.072 --> 00:01:10.125
Then she said, "Let's not talk about that.


00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:12.946
Just come on down, 
select the apartment that you want.

00:01:12.946 --> 00:01:14.834
We'll sign the contract

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:18.741
and you'll have keys in your hand
to get your family out here right away."

00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:20.270
So I was excited.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.666
I jumped in my car. I went downtown
and knocked on the door.

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:26.327
When I knocked on the door, 
the woman came to the door,

00:01:26.327 --> 00:01:29.261
and she looked at me, and she said,
"Can I help you?"

00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:33.102
I said, "Yes, I'm the person 
who called about the apartments.
