00:07:28.726 --> 00:07:30.899
And we did drive down the road,

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:34.421
but just before we took off 
and pulled out of the parking lot,

00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:35.914
guess what happened?

00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:37.733
The light came back on.

00:07:37.733 --> 00:07:40.593
And it said, "Vacancies, 
Vacancies, Vacancies."

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:42.979
We were able to find a nice place.

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:47.715
It wasn't our preference,
but it was secure and it was clean.

00:07:47.715 --> 00:07:50.537
And so we had a great sleep that night.

00:07:50.537 --> 00:07:52.356
The piece that's important about that

00:07:52.356 --> 00:07:55.468
is that we had similar
kinds of experiences

00:07:55.468 --> 00:07:58.650
from Idaho all the way through 
to Pennsylvania,

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.951
where we were rejected from hotels, 
motels and restaurants.
