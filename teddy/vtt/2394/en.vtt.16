where we were rejected from hotels, 
motels and restaurants.

00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:05.151
But we made it to Pennsylvania.

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:09.711
We got the family settled.
Everyone was glad to see the kids.

00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:14.286
I jumped on a plane and shot off
to Goose Bay, Labrador,

00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:15.947
which is another story, right?

00:08:15.947 --> 00:08:17.254
(Laughter)

00:08:18.234 --> 00:08:22.657
Here it is, 53 years later,

00:08:22.657 --> 00:08:27.086
I now have nine grandchildren, 
two great-grandchildren.

00:08:27.086 --> 00:08:29.863
Five of the grandchildren are boys.

00:08:29.863 --> 00:08:35.076
I have master's, Ph.D., undergrad,
one in medical school.
