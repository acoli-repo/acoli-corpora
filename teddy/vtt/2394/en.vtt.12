00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:01.951
She'll be with us as we drive,
she'll help us manage the children.

00:06:01.951 --> 00:06:05.881
So she came out, her and Alice 
put a lot of food together for the trip.

00:06:05.881 --> 00:06:08.964
That morning, we left at about 5 a.m.

00:06:08.964 --> 00:06:12.110
Great trip, having a great time, 
good conversation.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.944
Somewhere around 6:30, 7 o'clock,
we got a little bit tired,

00:06:15.944 --> 00:06:18.783
and we said, "Why don't we get
a motel so that we can rest

00:06:18.783 --> 00:06:21.164
and then have an early start
in the morning?"

00:06:21.164 --> 00:06:24.544
So we were looking at a number 
of the motels as we drove down the road,

00:06:24.544 --> 00:06:28.021
and we saw one, it was a great
big, bright flashing light that said,

00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:30.325
"Vacancies, Vacancies, Vacanies."
