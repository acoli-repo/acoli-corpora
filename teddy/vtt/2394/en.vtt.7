00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:30.279
And then I asked him, 
"Can I just leave the trailer here,

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:32.513
and that would take care 
of all my problems,

00:03:32.513 --> 00:03:34.682
I wouldn't have to find
another trailer park?"

00:03:34.682 --> 00:03:38.536
He said, "Before I say yes to that, 
I need to check with management."

00:03:38.536 --> 00:03:39.968
So I get back to the base,

00:03:39.968 --> 00:03:42.125
he called me back and management said,

00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:44.569
"No, you can't leave the trailer here

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.133
because we had promised that slot
to some other people."

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:49.944
And that was strange to me

00:03:49.944 --> 00:03:52.515
because there were several 
other slots that were open,

00:03:52.515 --> 00:03:56.202
but it just so happened that he 
had promised that slot to someone else.

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:57.504
So, what I did --

00:03:57.504 --> 00:04:01.571
and he said, "You shouldn't worry, Jim,
because there are a lot of trailer parks."
