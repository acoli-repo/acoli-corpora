00:02:57.215 --> 00:03:01.507
There's an airman who is leaving
and he has a trailer.

00:03:01.507 --> 00:03:03.343
If you noticed, in Mountain Home,

00:03:03.343 --> 00:03:05.991
there are trailer parks and trailers
all over the place.

00:03:05.991 --> 00:03:09.534
You can buy his trailer,
and you'd probably get a really good deal

00:03:09.534 --> 00:03:12.208
because he wants to get out of town
as soon as possible.

00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:14.190
And that would take care of your problem,

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.342
and that would provide 
the solution for you."

00:03:16.342 --> 00:03:19.578
So I immediately jumped in my car,
went downtown, saw the trailer --

00:03:19.578 --> 00:03:21.422
it was a small trailer,

00:03:21.422 --> 00:03:23.032
but under the circumstances,

00:03:23.032 --> 00:03:25.447
I figured that was the 
best thing that I could do.

00:03:25.447 --> 00:03:27.008
So I bought the trailer.

00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:30.279
And then I asked him, 
"Can I just leave the trailer here,
