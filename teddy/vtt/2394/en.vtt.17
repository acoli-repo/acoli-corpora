00:08:29.863 --> 00:08:35.076
I have master's, Ph.D., undergrad,
one in medical school.

00:08:35.076 --> 00:08:37.690
I have a couple that are trending.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.455
They're almost there but not quite.
(Laughter)

00:08:40.455 --> 00:08:43.555
I have one who has been 
in college now for eight years.

00:08:43.555 --> 00:08:44.975
(Laughter)

00:08:44.975 --> 00:08:48.346
He doesn't have a degree yet, 
but he wants to be a comedian.

00:08:48.346 --> 00:08:51.464

00:08:51.464 --> 00:08:52.994
Because you never know,

00:08:52.994 --> 00:08:56.894
just because you're funny at home,
does not make you a comedian, right?

00:08:56.894 --> 00:08:58.646
(Laughter)

00:08:58.646 --> 00:09:01.078
But the thing about it, 
they're all good kids --
