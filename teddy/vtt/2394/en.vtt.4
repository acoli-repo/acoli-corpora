00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:02.280
Nor did I get any responses 
from the other people

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.801
that they gave me on the list
where I could get apartments.

00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:08.092
So as a result of that,
and feeling rejected,

00:02:08.092 --> 00:02:11.978
I went back to the base, and I talked
to the squadron commander.

00:02:11.978 --> 00:02:14.244
His name was McDow, Major McDow.

00:02:14.244 --> 00:02:16.436
I said, "Major McDow, I need your help."

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:19.111
I told him what happened, 
and here's what he said to me:

00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:21.453
He said, "James, I would love to help you.

00:02:21.453 --> 00:02:23.182
But you know the problem:

00:02:23.182 --> 00:02:27.416
We can't make people rent to folks 
that they don't want to rent to.

00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:31.914
And besides, we have a great relationship
with people in the community
