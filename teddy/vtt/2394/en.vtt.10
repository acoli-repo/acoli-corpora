00:04:55.933 --> 00:05:00.233
and I looked at the far end 
of the town in Mountain Home,

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:02.327
and there was a small trailer park.

00:05:02.327 --> 00:05:04.414
I mean, a really small trailer park.

00:05:04.414 --> 00:05:06.462
It didn't have any paved roads in it,

00:05:06.462 --> 00:05:08.470
it didn't have the concrete slabs,

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.019
it didn't have fencing

00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:13.111
to portion off your trailer slot 
from other trailer slots.

00:05:13.111 --> 00:05:14.923
It didn't have a laundry facility.

00:05:14.923 --> 00:05:17.116
But the conclusion I reached 
at that moment

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:19.398
was that I didn't have 
a lot of other options.

00:05:19.398 --> 00:05:22.854
So I called my wife, and I said,
"We're going to make this one work."

00:05:22.854 --> 00:05:24.399
And we moved into it

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:28.117
and we became homeowners
in Mountain Home, Idaho.

00:05:28.117 --> 00:05:31.308
And of course, eventually
things settled down.
