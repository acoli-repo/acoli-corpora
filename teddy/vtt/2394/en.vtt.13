00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:30.325
"Vacancies, Vacancies, Vacanies."

00:06:30.325 --> 00:06:31.622
So we stopped in.

00:06:31.622 --> 00:06:33.807
They were in the parking lot, 
I went inside.

00:06:33.807 --> 00:06:35.134
When I walked inside,

00:06:35.134 --> 00:06:38.311
the lady was just finishing up 
one contract with some folks,

00:06:38.311 --> 00:06:40.400
some other people 
were coming in behind me.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.133
And so I walked to the counter,

00:06:42.133 --> 00:06:44.296
and she said, "How can I help you?"

00:06:44.296 --> 00:06:47.556
I said, "I would like to get a motel 
for the evening for my family."

00:06:47.556 --> 00:06:52.058
She said, "You know, I'm really sorry,
I just rented the last one.

00:06:52.058 --> 00:06:54.704
We will not have any more 
until the morning."

00:06:54.704 --> 00:06:58.685
She said, "But if you go down the road
about an hour, 45 minutes,

00:06:58.685 --> 00:07:01.030
there's another trailer park down there."
