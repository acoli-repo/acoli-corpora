00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:31.914
And besides, we have a great relationship
with people in the community

00:02:31.914 --> 00:02:33.956
and we really don't want to damage that."

00:02:33.956 --> 00:02:36.226
He said, "So maybe this is 
what you should do.

00:02:36.226 --> 00:02:38.864
Why don't you let your family stay home,

00:02:38.864 --> 00:02:41.818
because you do know 
that you get a 30-day leave.

00:02:41.818 --> 00:02:43.213
So once a year,

00:02:43.213 --> 00:02:47.818
you can go home to your family,
spend 30 days and then come on back."

00:02:47.818 --> 00:02:49.988
Needless to say, that didn't
resonate for me.

00:02:49.988 --> 00:02:52.914
So after leaving him, 
I went back to personnel,

00:02:52.914 --> 00:02:54.414
and talking to the clerk,

00:02:54.414 --> 00:02:57.215
he said, "Jim, I think I have a 
solution for you.

00:02:57.215 --> 00:03:01.507
There's an airman who is leaving
and he has a trailer.
