00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:05.420
So I put out another exhaustive list
of going to trailer parks.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.490
I went to one after another, 
after another.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.092
And I got the same kind of rejection there

00:04:10.092 --> 00:04:14.221
that I received when I was looking 
for the apartment.

00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:18.550
And as a result, the kind of comments
that they made to me,

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.753
in addition to saying that they
didn't have any slots open,

00:04:22.753 --> 00:04:27.008
one person said, "Jim, the reason
why we can't rent to you,

00:04:27.008 --> 00:04:31.188
we already have a Negro family
in the trailer park."
