I was wanted.

00:10:39.495 --> 00:10:42.760
It's time to reframe
our views on adoption.

00:10:42.784 --> 00:10:47.198
A healthy adoption ecosystem
is one in which children,

00:10:47.222 --> 00:10:50.554
adoptive families and birth families

00:10:50.578 --> 00:10:53.021
each own their unique stories.

00:10:53.494 --> 00:10:56.961
When these narratives
are placed side by side,

00:10:56.985 --> 00:11:01.831
it creates better empathy and policies
for the lives that adoption impacts.
