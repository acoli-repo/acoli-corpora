is adopted by parents
from a different race or ethnicity.

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:03.549
In my generation, children
who were adopted from Korea

00:01:03.573 --> 00:01:07.780
were assimilated into the culture
of their adoptive parents.

00:01:07.804 --> 00:01:10.187
So I was raised as if I were white.

00:01:11.117 --> 00:01:14.378
Growing up, occasionally my family
would eat at a Korean restaurant,

00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:16.176
or we'd go to the Asian festival.

00:01:17.184 --> 00:01:20.477
But I did not identify with being Asian.

00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:23.350
Looking back now,

00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:26.657
having my tattoo removed is symbolic
of losing a connection

00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:29.817
with my Korean ethnicity and culture.
