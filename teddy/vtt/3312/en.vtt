When I was three years old,

00:00:02.342 --> 00:00:05.493
I was transracially adopted
from South Korea

00:00:05.517 --> 00:00:08.662
by a white family in Salt Lake City, Utah.

00:00:09.507 --> 00:00:14.124
I arrived in America with a mysterious
tattoo on my left forearm.

00:00:14.148 --> 00:00:16.849
The tattoo was so large and noticeable

00:00:16.873 --> 00:00:20.218
that my adoptive parents
had it surgically removed right away.

00:00:20.826 --> 00:00:23.861
They were worried that other kids
would make fun of it.

00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:26.667
Today, there's only a light scar
where the tattoo once was,

00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:30.659
so I've redrawn it in permanent marker
so you can see what it looked like.
