00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:30.659

00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:36.842
Korean adoption records in 1976
were notoriously incomplete.

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:39.993
I didn't have any information
about my background

00:00:40.017 --> 00:00:41.401
or my birth family.

00:00:41.882 --> 00:00:46.095
I didn't even know if my name
or birth date were real

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:47.618
or if they were assigned.

00:00:48.422 --> 00:00:51.106
And no one knew what my tattoo meant.

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:56.153
Transracial adoption is where a child
from one race or ethnicity

00:00:56.177 --> 00:01:00.079
is adopted by parents
from a different race or ethnicity.
