00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:35.421
And he was right:

00:09:36.232 --> 00:09:41.157
the tattoo did eventually lead me
to find the family that I had lost.

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:47.468
Unfortunately, he passed away nine years
before he could see his children reunited.

00:09:48.229 --> 00:09:52.738
But last year, I traveled to Korea
to meet my two older brothers,

00:09:52.762 --> 00:09:54.847
my aunt and uncle,

00:09:54.871 --> 00:09:57.089
and I learned a lot
of new things about myself,

00:09:57.113 --> 00:09:59.088
including my real birth date,

00:09:59.112 --> 00:10:01.642
which actually makes me
seven months older.
