00:05:57.948 --> 00:06:00.450
we rarely acknowledge the complex emotions

00:06:00.474 --> 00:06:02.873
that children who are adopted
can experience.

00:06:03.444 --> 00:06:06.669
Some children experience feelings of loss,

00:06:06.693 --> 00:06:08.538
feelings of rejection,

00:06:08.562 --> 00:06:09.940
grief,

00:06:09.964 --> 00:06:11.536
shame,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.810
guilt,

00:06:12.834 --> 00:06:15.215
challenges with identity,

00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:16.694
difficulty with intimacy

00:06:16.718 --> 00:06:18.389
and control issues.

00:06:18.413 --> 00:06:20.586
Just ask my kids.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:21.968
(Laughter)

00:06:21.992 --> 00:06:27.630
Children who are adopted
can still love their adoptive parents

00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:31.306
at the same time as experiencing
these complex emotions.
