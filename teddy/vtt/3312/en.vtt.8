00:03:56.505 --> 00:04:00.569
The narrative that we usually hear
is that of a new parent,

00:04:00.593 --> 00:04:04.043
who is eagerly awaiting a child
that they've been wanting for so long.

00:04:05.552 --> 00:04:08.785
The parents' story is told with love,
joy and excitement,

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:12.102
and as they bring a newly adopted
child into their home,

00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:15.592
family and friends celebrate
and congratulate the parents

00:04:15.616 --> 00:04:18.443
on their wonderful decision to adopt.

00:04:19.622 --> 00:04:24.310
My parents' adoption story was like
a beautiful blanket that kept me warm.

00:04:25.556 --> 00:04:29.596
But after a while, it felt like
the focus was more on the blanket,

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.622
covering me and my point of view entirely.
