The hope is to help children
and their adoptive parents

00:07:03.846 --> 00:07:07.894
better adapt to their unique
racial and ethnic circumstances.

00:07:07.918 --> 00:07:10.146
There's more enculturation encouraged,

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.971
that exposes children to the people,

00:07:12.995 --> 00:07:16.735
places, languages and culture
of their birth families.

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:20.015
Some parents focus on racial inculcation

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:24.408
to specifically work with their children
on the racism and discrimination

00:07:24.432 --> 00:07:27.328
that they will experience

00:07:27.352 --> 00:07:30.669
And some parents allow children
to choose as they get older
