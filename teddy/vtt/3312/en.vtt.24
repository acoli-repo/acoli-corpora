00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.508
But my tattoo is a poignant reminder
that every adoption starts with loss,

00:12:05.532 --> 00:12:08.413
and every child is affected differently.

00:12:08.909 --> 00:12:12.807
Children who are adopted
can live full, rich lives,

00:12:12.831 --> 00:12:18.022
as we accept and build upon this unique
set of cards that we were dealt.

00:12:18.547 --> 00:12:21.058
And as you listen
to our narratives with empathy,

00:12:21.082 --> 00:12:23.484
you will hear other things as well:

00:12:24.526 --> 00:12:27.417
childlike curiosity,

00:12:27.441 --> 00:12:28.814
grace,

00:12:28.838 --> 00:12:30.539
resilience,
