00:01:31.042 --> 00:01:32.193
And I am not alone.

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:37.067
Since the 1950s, almost 200,000
Korean children have been adopted

00:01:37.091 --> 00:01:38.608
all over the world.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:43.531
A growing body of research shows
that children experience trauma

00:01:43.555 --> 00:01:46.147
when they're separated
from their families of origin.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.835
My story includes such childhood trauma.

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:53.081
I recently found out that my birth mother

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:55.710
left my family shortly after I was born.

00:01:56.587 --> 00:01:59.743
When I was two years old,
my birth father became injured

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:02.083
and could not provide
for my brothers and me.
