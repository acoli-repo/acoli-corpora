00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.849
that was invisible.

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.838
So they returned to their villages

00:04:02.838 --> 00:04:06.058

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.760
It turns out this holds true

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.851
for other species as well.

00:04:29.851 --> 00:04:32.798
Wild boar, lynx, moose, they've all returned
