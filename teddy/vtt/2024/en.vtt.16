00:07:58.138 --> 00:08:01.230
daring, flummoxed scientists.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.332
But the spirit and existence of the babushkas,

00:08:04.332 --> 00:08:06.039
whose numbers have been halved

00:08:06.039 --> 00:08:08.181
in the three years I've known them,

00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:10.379
will leave us with powerful new templates

00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:12.395
to think about and grapple with,

00:08:12.395 --> 00:08:16.058
about the relative nature of risk,

00:08:16.058 --> 00:08:19.905
about transformative connections to home,

00:08:19.905 --> 00:08:23.451
and about the magnificent tonic

00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:27.304
of personal agency and self-determination.

00:08:27.304 --> 00:08:29.239
Thank you.

00:08:29.239 --> 00:08:33.239
