00:01:59.617 --> 00:02:02.410
The women in the zone, now in their 70s and 80s,

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.405
are the last survivors of a group who defied authorities

00:02:05.405 --> 00:02:07.355
and, it would seem, common sense,

00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:11.045
and returned to their ancestral homes inside the zone.

00:02:11.045 --> 00:02:13.529
They did so illegally.

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.446
As one woman put it to a soldier

00:02:15.446 --> 00:02:18.260
who was trying to evacuate her for a second time,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.083
"Shoot me and dig the grave.

00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:22.661
Otherwise, I'm going home."

00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:25.196
Now why would they return to such deadly soil?

00:02:25.196 --> 00:02:27.104
I mean, were they unaware of the risks

00:02:27.104 --> 00:02:30.115
or crazy enough to ignore them, or both?
