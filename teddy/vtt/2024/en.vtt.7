"Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does."

00:03:31.351 --> 00:03:32.984
And you have to remember, these women have

00:03:32.984 --> 00:03:36.852
survived the worst atrocities of the 20th century.

00:03:36.852 --> 00:03:40.423
Stalin's enforced famines of the 1930s, the Holodomor,

00:03:40.423 --> 00:03:42.254
killed millions of Ukrainians,

00:03:42.254 --> 00:03:44.277
and they faced the Nazis in the '40s,

00:03:44.277 --> 00:03:47.253
who came through slashing, burning, raping,

00:03:47.253 --> 00:03:48.869
and in fact many of these women

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:51.954
were shipped to Germany as forced labor.

00:03:51.954 --> 00:03:54.414
So when a couple decades into Soviet rule,

00:03:54.414 --> 00:03:55.609
Chernobyl happened,

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.671
they were unwilling to flee in the face of an enemy

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.849
that was invisible.
