00:04:29.851 --> 00:04:32.798
Wild boar, lynx, moose, they've all returned

00:04:32.798 --> 00:04:34.548
to the region in force,

00:04:34.548 --> 00:04:37.803
the very real, very negative effects of radiation

00:04:37.803 --> 00:04:41.361
being trumped by the upside of a mass exodus

00:04:41.361 --> 00:04:43.112
of humans.

00:04:43.112 --> 00:04:47.805

00:04:47.805 --> 00:04:50.863
And there is a kind of heroic resilience,

00:04:50.863 --> 00:04:53.734
a kind of plain-spoken pragmatism to those

00:04:53.734 --> 00:04:56.226
who start their day at 5 a.m.

00:04:56.226 --> 00:04:58.469
pulling water from a well

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:00.173
and end it at midnight
