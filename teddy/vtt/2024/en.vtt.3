00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.042
The point being, no human being

00:01:32.042 --> 00:01:34.928
should be living anywhere near the dead zone.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.521
But they are.

00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:39.174
It turns out an unlikely community

00:01:39.174 --> 00:01:42.627
of some 200 people are living inside the zone.

00:01:42.627 --> 00:01:44.485
They're called self-settlers.

00:01:44.485 --> 00:01:47.125
And almost all of them are women,

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:48.993
the men having shorter lifespans

00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:51.310
in part due to overuse of alcohol, cigarettes,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.298
if not radiation.

00:01:53.298 --> 00:01:55.536
Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated

00:01:55.536 --> 00:01:57.156
at the time of the accident,

00:01:57.156 --> 00:01:59.617
but not everybody accepted that fate.

00:01:59.617 --> 00:02:02.410
The women in the zone, now in their 70s and 80s,
