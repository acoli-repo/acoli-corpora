00:02:27.104 --> 00:02:30.115
or crazy enough to ignore them, or both?

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:31.587
The thing is, they see their lives

00:02:31.587 --> 00:02:35.119
and the risks they run decidedly differently.

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.372
Now around Chernobyl, there are scattered ghost villages,

00:02:38.372 --> 00:02:42.703
eerily silent, strangely charming, bucolic,

00:02:42.703 --> 00:02:44.626
totally contaminated.

00:02:44.626 --> 00:02:47.765
Many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident,

00:02:47.765 --> 00:02:49.798
but a few are left like this,

00:02:49.798 --> 00:02:53.351
kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy.

00:02:53.351 --> 00:02:55.662
Others have a few residents in them,

00:02:55.662 --> 00:02:58.127
one or two "babushkas," or "babas,"

00:02:58.127 --> 00:03:01.316
which are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother.
