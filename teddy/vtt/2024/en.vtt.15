00:07:28.836 --> 00:07:30.595
The power of motherland

00:07:30.595 --> 00:07:33.053
so fundamental to that part of the world

00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:34.865
seems palliative.

00:07:34.865 --> 00:07:37.662
Home and community are forces

00:07:37.662 --> 00:07:41.722
that rival even radiation.

00:07:41.722 --> 00:07:44.200
Now radiation or not,

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.804
these women are at the end of their lives.

00:07:46.804 --> 00:07:50.797
In the next decade, the zone's human residents will be gone,

00:07:50.797 --> 00:07:55.024
and it will revert to a wild, radioactive place,

00:07:55.024 --> 00:07:58.138
full only of animals and occasionally

00:07:58.138 --> 00:08:01.230
daring, flummoxed scientists.
