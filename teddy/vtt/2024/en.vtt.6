00:02:58.127 --> 00:03:01.316
which are the Russian and Ukrainian words for grandmother.

00:03:01.316 --> 00:03:04.399
Another village might have six or seven residents.

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:07.129
So this is the strange demographic of the zone --

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.998
isolated alone together.

00:03:09.998 --> 00:03:12.201
And when I made my way to that piping chimney

00:03:12.201 --> 00:03:13.872
I'd seen in the distance,

00:03:13.872 --> 00:03:17.118
I saw Hanna Zavorotnya, and I met her.

00:03:17.118 --> 00:03:20.184
She's the self-declared mayor of Kapavati village,

00:03:20.184 --> 00:03:22.146
population eight.

00:03:22.146 --> 00:03:24.109
(Laughter)

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.342
And she said to me, when I asked her the obvious,

00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:31.351
"Radiation doesn't scare me. Starvation does."
