00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:32.296
because the nuclear fire that burned for 11 days

00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:36.712
back in 1986 released 400 times as much radiation

00:00:36.712 --> 00:00:38.928

and the sarcophagus, which is the covering

over reactor number four,

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:45.861
which was hastily built 27 years ago,

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:57.350
But then, I looked into the distance,

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.627
and I saw some smoke coming from a farmhouse,
