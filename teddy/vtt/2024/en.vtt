00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.489
Three years ago, I was standing about a hundred yards

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:07.115
from Chernobyl nuclear reactor number four.

00:00:07.115 --> 00:00:10.262
My Geiger counter dosimeter, which measures radiation,

00:00:10.262 --> 00:00:11.850
was going berserk,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.297
and the closer I got, the more frenetic it became,

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:18.093
and frantic. My God.

00:00:18.093 --> 00:00:20.843
I was there covering the 25th anniversary

00:00:20.843 --> 00:00:23.993
of the world's worst nuclear accident,

00:00:23.993 --> 00:00:25.942

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:28.833
reluctantly so, but with good reason,

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:32.296
because the nuclear fire that burned for 11 days
