Mary Robinson: Vanessa, thank you so much

00:00:02.915 --> 00:00:06.502
for inviting us to your home
here in Kampala, in Uganda,

00:00:06.544 --> 00:00:09.130
for this TEDWomen conversation,

00:00:09.172 --> 00:00:10.381
I really appreciate that.

00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:12.425
It's so much nicer to be
in somebody's home

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:14.093
having a conversation.

00:00:14.093 --> 00:00:18.056
So let's start with what prompted you

00:00:18.097 --> 00:00:22.602
or what brought you to become
a climate activist,

00:00:22.643 --> 00:00:25.271
to become aware of the climate issue
from the beginning?

00:00:25.313 --> 00:00:28.274
You must have been very young,
but you're still very young.

00:00:28.316 --> 00:00:31.027
