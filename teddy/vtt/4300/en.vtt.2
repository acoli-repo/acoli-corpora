I didn't see beauty 
just on a magazine cover.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.764
I did a shoot with, of 
course, Cindy, for Revlon,

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:06.602
and really fantastic, beautiful people.

00:01:06.602 --> 00:01:07.888
But I thought,

00:01:07.888 --> 00:01:10.590
someone's always telling me 
who's beautiful.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.086
And I was kind of frustrated.

00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:13.840
I left my studio one 
afternoon in New York,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.461
and I was walking down Park Avenue,

00:01:15.461 --> 00:01:18.552
and I saw, waiting for a bus 
at the corner of Park and 20th,

00:01:18.552 --> 00:01:20.593
this gorgeous kid.

00:01:20.593 --> 00:01:24.406
She had long, white, beautiful hair,
and pale, pale skin.

00:01:24.406 --> 00:01:27.109
She had a genetic condition 
called albinism.

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:28.939
I didn't know much about it, 
but she was stunning,

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.721
and I'd never met 
a model like this before.
