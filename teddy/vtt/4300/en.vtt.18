00:08:57.251 --> 00:09:00.559
to find out more about this idea, 
a message, about albinism,

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:04.795
or perceptions of people in communities 
about this syndrome, albinism.

00:09:04.795 --> 00:09:08.322
So I started hearing about stigmas, 
and discrimination,

00:09:08.322 --> 00:09:11.695
so what I looked at is really trying 
to explore cultural perceptions

00:09:11.695 --> 00:09:14.221
and attitudes towards this condition.

00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:16.928
This is my friend [unclear], 
who's a Kuna Indian

00:09:16.928 --> 00:09:19.268
in the San Blas region of the world,

00:09:19.268 --> 00:09:22.602
the San Blas region of Panama.

00:09:22.602 --> 00:09:24.064
She's extraordinary.

00:09:24.064 --> 00:09:27.618
So the incidence of albinism 
is about one in 20,000 worldwide.

00:09:27.618 --> 00:09:32.858
In the Kuna Indian, it's one in 125, 
the highest incidence in the world.
