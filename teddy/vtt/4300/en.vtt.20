00:09:58.072 --> 00:10:00.946
we found out that there are many kids
that we worked with in their communities,

00:10:00.946 --> 00:10:02.829
after we started this group in India,

00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:05.078
that have had really positive experiences.

00:10:05.078 --> 00:10:07.137
So one of the things 
we want to make very clear

00:10:07.137 --> 00:10:09.099
is that we're not making generalizations

00:10:09.099 --> 00:10:10.611
about a community or a culture,

00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:12.545
and their reaction 
to people that are different.

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:14.235
Keke's experiences were very different,

00:10:14.235 --> 00:10:15.827
but we've met many kids there

00:10:15.827 --> 00:10:19.209
that have been embraced 
by their communities throughout India.

00:10:19.209 --> 00:10:22.272
