00:07:27.225 --> 00:07:30.313
And I'd buy him an ice-cream cone,
or a toy truck,

00:07:30.313 --> 00:07:31.655
and he'd forget about it."

00:07:31.655 --> 00:07:34.574
She said, "Now he's in high school.
He comes home from school,

00:07:34.574 --> 00:07:38.018
I can see the pain, 
the anguish in his eyes.

00:07:38.018 --> 00:07:40.914
He walks in, he walks right past me,

00:07:40.914 --> 00:07:42.482
goes up to his room, slams the door,

00:07:42.482 --> 00:07:44.365
and I don't see him until the next day.

00:07:44.365 --> 00:07:45.976
He's not going to want to be photographed,

00:07:45.976 --> 00:07:47.317
he has zero self-esteem,

00:07:47.317 --> 00:07:52.383
this kid has such poor body image,
and he's just so shy.

00:07:52.383 --> 00:07:55.852
But if you could just show him 
photographs of kids his own age,

00:07:55.852 --> 00:07:58.068
so that he knows he's not alone."

00:07:58.068 --> 00:08:00.095
I'm like, "Of course. Where is he? Show me!"
