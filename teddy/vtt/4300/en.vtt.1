00:00:30.475 --> 00:00:32.904
I've worked for lots 
of different magazines,

00:00:32.904 --> 00:00:34.653
lots of great clients.

00:00:34.653 --> 00:00:37.294
But I was always told,
every single day, who was beautiful.

00:00:37.294 --> 00:00:38.826
I was forced to work

00:00:38.826 --> 00:00:41.268
within certain parameters 
of the beauty standard.

00:00:41.268 --> 00:00:43.841
I was told, "This is the most 
amazing model of the moment,

00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:45.227
you've got to photograph her.

00:00:45.227 --> 00:00:47.305
She's incredible, you've got to."

00:00:47.305 --> 00:00:49.421
And then the next season,
it would change again,

00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:51.768
and I'd have to shift my ideas of beauty,

00:00:51.768 --> 00:00:53.474
and so we'd go to the next model,

00:00:53.474 --> 00:00:56.205
and it was kind of really crazy,
because I'm an artist.

00:00:56.205 --> 00:00:57.849
I saw beauty everywhere.

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:00.769
I didn't see beauty 
just on a magazine cover.
