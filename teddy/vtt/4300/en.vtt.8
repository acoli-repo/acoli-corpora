or sensational — never 
positive, always negative.

00:04:02.316 --> 00:04:05.351
And I said, "Okay, well then, 
what do we do here?"

00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:08.067
So, let's form a nontraditional partnership —

00:04:08.067 --> 00:04:10.685
fashion photographer, 
genetic support group —

00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:12.092
and we'll work together.

00:04:12.092 --> 00:04:13.150
And you can keep an eye on me

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.228
to make sure that we create 
something positive and powerful,

00:04:16.228 --> 00:04:18.797
showing the world the beauty of albinism.

00:04:18.797 --> 00:04:19.988
And they said okay.

00:04:19.988 --> 00:04:21.694
And I was like, fantastic, let's do this!

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:23.834
So in walks the first person 
I'm about to photograph.

00:04:23.834 --> 00:04:27.421
Her name is Christine, 
and Christine is a knockout.

00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:30.196
Long white hair, really tall. 
She's stunning.
