00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.602
By the time she left the studio, 
she was kissing everybody on both cheeks,

00:05:30.602 --> 00:05:33.602
and saying, "Ciao!" 
and she was unbelievable.

00:05:33.602 --> 00:05:36.799
And I saw this transformation 
right in front of the lens,

00:05:36.799 --> 00:05:39.596
through photography, 
that she was now transformed,

00:05:39.596 --> 00:05:42.943
with a powerful and positive sense 
of who she is.

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:44.787
The next day, she goes to school,

00:05:44.787 --> 00:05:47.847
she's going to change the way 
her community sees her difference.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.185
Instead of walking into 
that classroom like this,

00:05:50.185 --> 00:05:51.608
she's walking in like this.

00:05:51.608 --> 00:05:54.046
So it's all about ambassadors for change.

00:05:54.046 --> 00:05:55.104
It was extraordinary.

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:57.894
And those first images, right after,
we did a series of them,

00:05:57.894 --> 00:06:01.327
using several individuals 
with this condition,
