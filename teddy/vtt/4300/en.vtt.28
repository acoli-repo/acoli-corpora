Taylor.

00:14:00.248 --> 00:14:01.795
Elizabeth.

00:14:01.795 --> 00:14:03.872
And my great friend Sean.

00:14:03.872 --> 00:14:07.733
So we decided at that point 
to involve other organizations

00:14:07.733 --> 00:14:10.975
to be part of this larger exhibition

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:16.187
that was going to be sent out from 
the People's Genome Celebration in 2001.

00:14:16.187 --> 00:14:19.435
The National Human Genome Research 
Institute and the Genetic Alliance

00:14:19.435 --> 00:14:22.476
invited me to create an exhibition 
at the Smithsonian,

00:14:22.476 --> 00:14:24.666
commemorating the mapping 
of the human genome.

00:14:24.666 --> 00:14:27.109
So we actually invited 
other genetic support groups

00:14:27.109 --> 00:14:30.428
to be part of this exhibition, 
not just on albinism, but all groups,
