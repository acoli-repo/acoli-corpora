She's like, well, if you have an anomaly 
on your 18th chromosome,

00:13:01.803 --> 00:13:05.071
then you have all kinds of problems 
and difficulties and challenges,

00:13:05.071 --> 00:13:08.387
and then we look after you, 
through this support group, like NOAH is.

00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:10.462
So I'm like, that's great.

00:13:10.462 --> 00:13:12.427
She said, 
I see there's a universal message here,

00:13:12.427 --> 00:13:15.094
about all kids with differences, 
so it's not just about albinism.

00:13:15.094 --> 00:13:17.793
Would you come and speak 
to our families in San Antonio

00:13:17.793 --> 00:13:19.472
with these chromosome 18 anomalies?

00:13:19.472 --> 00:13:22.102
I'm like, sure! 
I went back to them thinking,

00:13:22.102 --> 00:13:23.502
what the hell is 
a chromosome 18 anomaly?

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:24.952
I was an art major
at the school of visual arts,

00:13:24.952 --> 00:13:26.641
I had no idea.

00:13:26.641 --> 00:13:30.070
But I looked it up, 
these are the images that I saw.
