00:06:57.725 --> 00:07:00.253
We have a support group here, 
can you come meet our families?

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.370
People in Africa were calling in the same.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.342
New Zealand, can you help 
us start a support group?

00:07:04.342 --> 00:07:07.133
I'm like, fantastic! 
This is great! Let's do it!

00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:09.527
So I would travel in all these places,

00:07:09.527 --> 00:07:11.951
as I was shooting 
and doing my commercial work,

00:07:11.951 --> 00:07:14.436
I was at a local chapter conference 
in Philadelphia.

00:07:14.436 --> 00:07:16.503
Small family conference, 
about 40 families,

00:07:16.503 --> 00:07:18.934
did my presentation of kids with albinism,

00:07:18.934 --> 00:07:20.947
this mom came up to me, and she said,

00:07:20.947 --> 00:07:23.281
"My son Randy, when he was a little boy,

00:07:23.281 --> 00:07:25.848
he'd come home from school, 
and I could see the kids were teasing him,

00:07:25.848 --> 00:07:27.225
and he'd be in tears.

00:07:27.225 --> 00:07:30.313
And I'd buy him an ice-cream cone,
or a toy truck,
