schools for the blind,

00:11:31.168 --> 00:11:34.237
not because the tools were better there 
for kids with visual impairment,

00:11:34.237 --> 00:11:36.640
but more importantly, 
because the teasing was so great,

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.879
the discrimination is so great,

00:11:37.879 --> 00:11:41.218
these kids don't do well 
in mainstream schools.

00:11:41.218 --> 00:11:44.688
I started an albinism society in Kenya 
with my friend C.K.,

00:11:44.688 --> 00:11:46.188
who actually went to a mainstream school.

00:11:46.188 --> 00:11:49.092
I'm like, C.K., how is it possible 
you went to a mainstream school?

00:11:49.092 --> 00:11:50.943
Nobody in Africa goes 
to mainstream schools.

00:11:50.943 --> 00:11:53.383
She said, "It's because 
of my twin sister, Delphine."

00:11:53.383 --> 00:11:57.237
Fantastic. She said Delphine would get 
all the work off the board,

00:11:57.237 --> 00:11:59.627
the things I couldn't see, 
she'd help me with it.

00:11:59.627 --> 00:12:02.276
If the type was too small, 
she'd blow it up for me, she said.
