00:16:27.339 --> 00:16:30.375
I had a left hemispherectomy.

00:16:30.375 --> 00:16:34.277
I had the left half of my brain removed,

00:16:34.277 --> 00:16:39.063
because I have something 
called Sturge-Weber Syndrome.

00:16:39.063 --> 00:16:43.835
I wear a brace
on my right leg and right arm.

00:16:43.835 --> 00:16:47.394
I only see out of 
the right side of each eye,

00:16:47.394 --> 00:16:54.875
so sometimes it's harder 
for me to see things on the right side.

00:16:54.875 --> 00:17:01.301
So playing sports can be frustrating, 
because I might not see a ball coming.
