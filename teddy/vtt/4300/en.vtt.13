Friends Jen and Ruthie are sisters, 
and Kristen.

00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:33.913
That's Lauren. 
We did a campaign for sunglasses.

00:06:33.913 --> 00:06:36.606
A lot of kids with this condition 
are photophobic,

00:06:36.606 --> 00:06:39.018
so they have 
a real strong light sensitivity.

00:06:39.018 --> 00:06:41.988
So we thought, 
perfect for a sunglass campaign.

00:06:43.487 --> 00:06:45.518
People magazine did a great story.

00:06:45.518 --> 00:06:48.586
So it was circulating, 
people were saying all this great stuff.

00:06:48.586 --> 00:06:50.174
It was fantastic.

00:06:50.174 --> 00:06:51.724
So I was getting calls, though.

00:06:51.724 --> 00:06:54.428
Getting calls from the U.K.,
saying, well we just saw this spread,

00:06:54.428 --> 00:06:57.725
can you come photograph our 
kids with this condition?

00:06:57.725 --> 00:07:00.253
We have a support group here, 
can you come meet our families?
