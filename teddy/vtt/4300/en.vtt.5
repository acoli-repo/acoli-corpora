00:02:27.362 --> 00:02:30.996
of kids and adults in their underwear, 
against walls in doctor's offices,

00:02:30.996 --> 00:02:34.118
with the black bar across their eyes 
saying "disease."

00:02:34.118 --> 00:02:36.572
This is a disease, defined by a disease.

00:02:36.572 --> 00:02:39.186
And I was like, this is crazy.

00:02:39.186 --> 00:02:40.964
And then I started going into it further,

00:02:40.964 --> 00:02:42.308
looking on the Internet,

00:02:42.308 --> 00:02:44.068
and all these different medical textbooks,

00:02:44.068 --> 00:02:46.978
and everything was so sad, 
and so negative.

00:02:46.978 --> 00:02:51.125
I then started finding images 
of the albino freak family in the circus,

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:53.145
and then of course, 
all the movie references,

00:02:53.145 --> 00:02:57.835
from "Powder," who had albinism because
his mother was struck by lightning,

00:02:57.835 --> 00:03:01.467
to "The Princess Bride" and 
to "The Matrix Reloaded,"
