00:01:59.171 --> 00:02:02.742
looking downtrodden, 
just images of despair.

00:02:02.742 --> 00:02:06.105
I found images 
of a bright red eye, the albino eye.

00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:08.320
I'm thinking, 
this kid had beautiful blue eyes,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.785
she didn't have red eyes.

00:02:09.785 --> 00:02:11.812
And then I started seeing 
images from Africa,

00:02:11.812 --> 00:02:15.322
where kids were surrounded by tribes 
pointing spears at them

00:02:15.322 --> 00:02:17.261
or in cancer wards and clinics,

00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:20.114
or they're just in beds, 
and images of illness,

00:02:20.114 --> 00:02:22.107
of sadness, of sickness.

00:02:22.107 --> 00:02:23.661
And then, I started, of course,

00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:25.161
going through
those same medical textbooks,

00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:27.362
and started finding 
these typical images

00:02:27.362 --> 00:02:30.996
of kids and adults in their underwear, 
against walls in doctor's offices,
