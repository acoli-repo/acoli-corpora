Now, NOAH is the National Organization 
for Albinism and Hypopigmentation.

00:03:34.753 --> 00:03:37.229
It's a support group for people 
living with this condition,

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:38.575
and their families.

00:03:38.575 --> 00:03:40.611
And I'm like, "Hey, I'm a 
fashion photographer.

00:03:40.611 --> 00:03:42.847
Let's show the world 
the beauty of albinism!"

00:03:42.847 --> 00:03:44.661
And they said, "Get lost."

00:03:44.661 --> 00:03:47.003
And I'm pretty persistent. I'm 
like, "Won't you talk to me?"

00:03:47.003 --> 00:03:48.934
And they made it very clear to me

00:03:48.934 --> 00:03:51.135
about their fears of exploitation,

00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:52.884
that every time there 
was a magazine article

00:03:52.884 --> 00:03:54.753
that came out about a kid with albinism,

00:03:54.753 --> 00:03:56.460
it was a story about a victim.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.915
It was sad, or it was exploitative,

00:03:58.915 --> 00:04:02.316
or sensational — never 
positive, always negative.
