I'll tell you a little bit about my story
and who I am.

00:00:02.788 --> 00:00:05.436
I'm a fashion photographer
based in New York City.

00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:08.258
I've worked for lots 
of different magazines in New York,

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:13.056
I've worked for Elle and for Marie Claire,

00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:14.998
and for Interview and for GQ,

00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:17.505
and I got to work 
with some really beautiful people.

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:18.826
My studio is in New York,

00:00:18.826 --> 00:00:21.047
but I also lived in Milan
for about eight years,

00:00:21.047 --> 00:00:22.746
and in Paris as well,

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:25.644
and worked for the house 
of Yves St. Laurent.

00:00:25.644 --> 00:00:28.358
I also did portraiture as well.
