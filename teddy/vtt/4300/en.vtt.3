00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.721
and I'd never met 
a model like this before.

00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:32.281
And I went to grab her and say,

00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:34.431
"I have to take your photograph, 
you're amazing!"

00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:36.392
And the bus came, she got on, 
and then she took off,

00:01:36.392 --> 00:01:38.413
and I was really glad because she was 12,

00:01:38.413 --> 00:01:40.324
and I'd be in prison at the moment.
(Laughter)

00:01:40.324 --> 00:01:43.057
But really, it was 
extraordinary to see this kid.

00:01:43.057 --> 00:01:45.505
So I continued right down to Union Square,

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:46.916
to the huge Barnes and Noble,

00:01:46.916 --> 00:01:49.548
and started pulling any books,
or any information I could

00:01:49.548 --> 00:01:51.644
about this genetic condition, albinism.

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:53.975
And I found really kind of sad images.

00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:55.673
I didn't find images of this kid.

00:01:55.673 --> 00:01:59.171
I found images of people 
sitting in hospital beds, looking sad,

00:01:59.171 --> 00:02:02.742
looking downtrodden, 
just images of despair.
