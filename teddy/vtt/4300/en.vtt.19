In the Kuna Indian, it's one in 125, 
the highest incidence in the world.

00:09:32.858 --> 00:09:36.458
We went to Fiji, actually, where we 
found out at the turn of the 19th century,

00:09:36.458 --> 00:09:38.767
a tribe could not hold their territory

00:09:38.767 --> 00:09:43.225
unless they had somebody with albinism 
in a powerful political position.

00:09:43.225 --> 00:09:46.022
My great friend Keke, 
I photographed in New Zealand,

00:09:46.022 --> 00:09:48.769
she's from India, from Delhi,

00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:52.037
but her family left Delhi 
because she was getting death threats.

00:09:52.037 --> 00:09:54.295
Now I'm thinking, 
this is horrible that they had to move,

00:09:54.295 --> 00:09:55.733
because she's eight years old.

00:09:55.733 --> 00:09:58.072
And we actually started 
a support group in Delhi,

00:09:58.072 --> 00:10:00.946
we found out that there are many kids
that we worked with in their communities,
