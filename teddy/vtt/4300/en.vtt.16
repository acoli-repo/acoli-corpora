00:07:58.068 --> 00:08:00.095
I'm like, "Of course. Where is he? Show me!"

00:08:00.095 --> 00:08:01.385
She points over to Randy.

00:08:01.385 --> 00:08:03.306
Now Randy's sitting there — 
his pants are hanging down to here,

00:08:03.306 --> 00:08:06.158
his underwear's hanging out, 
he has this long, great big shirt,

00:08:06.158 --> 00:08:09.240
he has ten earrings, he has a tattoo.
He's amazing, this kid.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.874
I crawl over to Randy.

00:08:10.874 --> 00:08:14.244
I'm like, "Randy, 
I speak to moms and dads every single day,

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:17.484
terrified about the future 
of their kids with albinism.

00:08:17.484 --> 00:08:19.169
All they have to do 
is take one look at you,

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:20.403
and they're going to be fine.

00:08:20.403 --> 00:08:21.957
Please let me take a photo of you.

00:08:21.957 --> 00:08:23.122
Your mother said, she told me,

00:08:23.122 --> 00:08:24.848
that you didn't want to be photographed."

00:08:24.848 --> 00:08:26.685
He said, "Rick, 
what do you mean?

00:08:26.685 --> 00:08:29.402
You have to understand, I'm 16 years old.

00:08:29.402 --> 00:08:31.139
I don't talk to my mother."
