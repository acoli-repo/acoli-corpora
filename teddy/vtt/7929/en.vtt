00:00:01.122 --> 00:00:03.541
So here we are, together.

00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:07.045
But we're in a technological trance.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.381
Here we are together,
but we're divided by tribalism.

00:00:11.132 --> 00:00:14.594
Here we are together,
but we're distracted by mass myths.

00:00:15.011 --> 00:00:17.305
We've been separated by walls,

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:20.224
windows, computer screens, borders.

00:00:20.892 --> 00:00:23.519
But we're united in our hearts.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.898
Oh, we've argued
and quarreled in the past.

00:00:27.565 --> 00:00:30.318
But now we know we've got a common bond.
