If they're talking about mass surveillance
and intrusive government,

00:04:32.374 --> 00:04:38.141
they're describing something authoritarian
but not necessarily Orwellian.

00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:42.348
And if they use it as an all-purpose word
for any ideas they dislike,

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:46.047
it's possible their statements 
are more Orwellian

00:04:46.047 --> 00:04:50.319
than whatever it is they're criticizing.

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.158
Words have the power to shape thought.

00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:55.975
Language is the currency of politics,

00:04:55.975 --> 00:04:59.861
forming the basis of society from
the most common, everyday interactions

00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:02.817
to the highest ideals.
