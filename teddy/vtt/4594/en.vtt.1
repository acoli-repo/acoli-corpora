Because his most famous work,
the novel "1984,"

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.377
depicts an oppressive society 
under a totalitarian government,

00:00:34.377 --> 00:00:38.904
"Orwellian" is often used simply
to mean authoritarian.

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:40.808
But using the term in this way

00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:43.919
not only fails to fully 
convey Orwell's message,

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:50.155
it actually risks doing precisely what 
he tried to warn against.

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:53.604
Orwell was indeed opposed 
to all forms of tyranny,

00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:57.225
spending much of his life fighting against
anti-democratic forces

00:00:57.225 --> 00:01:00.530
of both the left-wing and the right.
