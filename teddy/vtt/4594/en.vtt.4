00:01:59.807 --> 00:02:03.645
This deliberate irony is an example
of doublespeak,

00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:08.012
when words are used not to convey meaning
but to undermine it,

00:02:08.012 --> 00:02:12.219
corrupting the very ideas they refer to.

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.036
The regime's control of language 
goes even further,

00:02:15.036 --> 00:02:17.130
eliminating words from 
the English language

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.502
to create the official 
dialect of Newspeak,

00:02:20.502 --> 00:02:24.843
a crudely limited collection of acronyms
and simple concrete nouns

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:30.913
lacking any words complex enough
to encourage nuanced or critical thought.
