00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.400
I got invited to an exclusive resort

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.896
to deliver a talk about the digital future

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.496
to what I assumed would be
a couple of hundred tech executives.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.216
And I was there in the green room,
waiting to go on,

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.416
and instead of bringing me to the stage,
they brought five men into the green room

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.496
who sat around this little table with me.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.616
They were tech billionaires.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.176
And they started peppering me
with these really binary questions,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.200
like: Bitcoin or Etherium?
