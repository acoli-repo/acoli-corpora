00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:31.033
The organizers decided
to take participants

00:02:31.057 --> 00:02:33.429
on a tour of local start-ups.

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:36.168
One of the start-ups had a social robot,

00:02:36.192 --> 00:02:38.104
and they decided to do a demo.

00:02:38.128 --> 00:02:41.108
The demo worked on everybody
until it got to me,

00:02:41.132 --> 00:02:43.055
and you can probably guess it.

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.044
It couldn't detect my face.

00:02:46.068 --> 00:02:48.579
I asked the developers what was going on,

00:02:48.603 --> 00:02:54.136
and it turned out we had used the same
generic facial recognition software.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.810
Halfway around the world,

00:02:55.834 --> 00:02:59.686
I learned that algorithmic bias
can travel as quickly

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.880
as it takes to download
some files off of the internet.
