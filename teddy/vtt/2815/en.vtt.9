Police departments can currently look
at these networks unregulated,

00:04:32.577 --> 00:04:36.863
using algorithms that have not
been audited for accuracy.

00:04:36.887 --> 00:04:40.751
Yet we know facial recognition
is not fail proof,

00:04:40.775 --> 00:04:44.954
and labeling faces consistently
remains a challenge.

00:04:44.978 --> 00:04:46.740
You might have seen this on Facebook.

00:04:46.764 --> 00:04:49.752
My friends and I laugh all the time
when we see other people

00:04:49.776 --> 00:04:52.234
mislabeled in our photos.

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:57.849
But misidentifying a suspected criminal
is no laughing matter,

00:04:57.873 --> 00:05:00.700
nor is breaching civil liberties.
