00:00:58.863 --> 00:01:02.004
Why am I sitting in front of a computer

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:03.452
in a white mask,

00:01:03.476 --> 00:01:07.126
trying to be detected by a cheap webcam?

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.441
Well, when I'm not fighting the coded gaze

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:10.985
as a poet of code,

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.281
I'm a graduate student
at the MIT Media Lab,

00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:19.222
and there I have the opportunity to work
on all sorts of whimsical projects,

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:21.273
including the Aspire Mirror,

00:01:21.297 --> 00:01:26.431
a project I did so I could project
digital masks onto my reflection.

00:01:26.455 --> 00:01:28.805
So in the morning, if I wanted
to feel powerful,

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.263
I could put on a lion.
