00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.542
a simple turn-taking game

00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:04.887
where partners cover their face
and then uncover it saying, "Peek-a-boo!"

00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:09.340
The problem is, peek-a-boo
doesn't really work if I can't see you,

00:02:09.364 --> 00:02:11.863
and my robot couldn't see me.

00:02:11.887 --> 00:02:15.837

to get the project done,

00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:17.241
submitted the assignment,

00:02:17.265 --> 00:02:21.018

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:23.672

for an entrepreneurship competition.

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:31.033
The organizers decided
to take participants
