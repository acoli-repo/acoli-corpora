00:03:26.868 --> 00:03:30.857
However, if the training sets
aren't really that diverse,

00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:34.230
any face that deviates too much
from the established norm

00:03:34.254 --> 00:03:35.903
will be harder to detect,

00:03:35.927 --> 00:03:37.890
which is what was happening to me.

00:03:37.914 --> 00:03:40.296
But don't worry -- there's some good news.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.091
Training sets don't just
materialize out of nowhere.

00:03:43.115 --> 00:03:44.903
We actually can create them.

00:03:44.927 --> 00:03:49.103
So there's an opportunity to create
full-spectrum training sets

00:03:49.127 --> 00:03:52.951
that reflect a richer
portrait of humanity.

00:03:52.975 --> 00:03:55.196
Now you've seen in my examples

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.988
how social robots

00:03:57.012 --> 00:04:01.623
was how I found out about exclusion
with algorithmic bias.
