00:07:29.302 --> 00:07:32.130
And we can also start thinking
more conscientiously

00:07:32.154 --> 00:07:37.545
about the social impact
of the technology that we're developing.

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:39.962
To get the incoding movement started,

00:07:39.986 --> 00:07:42.833
I've launched the Algorithmic
Justice League,

00:07:42.857 --> 00:07:48.729
where anyone who cares about fairness
can help fight the coded gaze.

00:07:48.753 --> 00:07:52.049
On codedgaze.com, you can report bias,

00:07:52.073 --> 00:07:54.518
request audits, become a tester

00:07:54.542 --> 00:07:57.313
and join the ongoing conversation,

00:07:57.337 --> 00:07:59.624
