Hello, I'm Joy, a poet of code,

00:00:04.199 --> 00:00:09.192
on a mission to stop
an unseen force that's rising,

00:00:09.216 --> 00:00:12.072
a force that I called "the coded gaze,"

00:00:12.096 --> 00:00:15.405
my term for algorithmic bias.

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.729
Algorithmic bias, like human bias,
results in unfairness.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:25.775
However, algorithms, like viruses,
can spread bias on a massive scale

00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:27.381
at a rapid pace.

00:00:27.943 --> 00:00:32.330
Algorithmic bias can also lead
to exclusionary experiences
