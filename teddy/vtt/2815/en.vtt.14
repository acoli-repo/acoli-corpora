00:06:58.554 --> 00:07:00.206
Who codes matters,

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.773
how we code matters

00:07:01.797 --> 00:07:03.820
and why we code matters.

00:07:03.844 --> 00:07:06.943
So to go towards incoding,
we can start thinking about

00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:10.131
building platforms that can identify bias

00:07:10.155 --> 00:07:13.233
by collecting people's experiences
like the ones I shared,

00:07:13.257 --> 00:07:16.327
but also auditing existing software.

00:07:16.351 --> 00:07:20.116
We can also start to create
more inclusive training sets.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.943
Imagine a "Selfies for Inclusion" campaign

00:07:22.967 --> 00:07:26.622
where you and I can help
developers test and create

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:28.739
more inclusive training sets.

00:07:29.302 --> 00:07:32.130
And we can also start thinking
more conscientiously
