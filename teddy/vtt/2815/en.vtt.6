as it takes to download
some files off of the internet.

00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:06.821
So what's going on?
Why isn't my face being detected?

00:03:06.845 --> 00:03:10.201
Well, we have to look
at how we give machines sight.

00:03:10.225 --> 00:03:13.634
Computer vision uses
machine learning techniques

00:03:13.658 --> 00:03:15.538
to do facial recognition.

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:19.459
So how this works is, you create
a training set with examples of faces.

00:03:19.483 --> 00:03:22.301
This is a face. This is a face.
This is not a face.

00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:26.844
And over time, you can teach a computer
how to recognize other faces.

00:03:26.868 --> 00:03:30.857
However, if the training sets
aren't really that diverse,
