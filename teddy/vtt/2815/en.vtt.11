00:05:30.577 --> 00:05:32.447
So who gets hired or fired?

00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:34.583
Do you get that loan?
Do you get insurance?

00:05:34.607 --> 00:05:38.110
Are you admitted into the college
you wanted to get into?

00:05:38.134 --> 00:05:41.643
Do you and I pay the same price
for the same product

00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:44.109
purchased on the same platform?

00:05:44.133 --> 00:05:47.892
Law enforcement is also starting
to use machine learning

00:05:47.916 --> 00:05:50.205
for predictive policing.

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.723
Some judges use machine-generated
risk scores to determine

00:05:53.747 --> 00:05:58.149
how long an individual
is going to spend in prison.

00:05:58.173 --> 00:06:00.627
So we really have to think
about these decisions.
