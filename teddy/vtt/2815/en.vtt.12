00:05:58.173 --> 00:06:00.627
So we really have to think
about these decisions.

00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:01.833
Are they fair?

00:06:01.857 --> 00:06:04.747
And we've seen that algorithmic bias

00:06:04.771 --> 00:06:08.145
doesn't necessarily always
lead to fair outcomes.

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.133
So what can we do about it?

00:06:10.157 --> 00:06:13.837
Well, we can start thinking about
how we create more inclusive code

00:06:13.861 --> 00:06:16.851
and employ inclusive coding practices.

00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:19.184
It really starts with people.

00:06:19.708 --> 00:06:21.669
So who codes matters.

00:06:21.693 --> 00:06:25.812
Are we creating full-spectrum teams
with diverse individuals

00:06:25.836 --> 00:06:28.247
who can check each other's blind spots?

00:06:28.271 --> 00:06:31.816
On the technical side,
how we code matters.
