00:00:00.381 --> 00:00:02.359
What do we know about the future?

00:00:02.383 --> 00:00:05.424
Difficult question,
simple answer: nothing.

00:00:05.448 --> 00:00:07.915
We cannot predict the future.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.554
We only can create a vision
of the future, how it might be,

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:15.887
a vision which reveals disruptive
ideas, which is inspiring,

00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:18.173
and this is the most important reason

00:00:18.197 --> 00:00:21.221
which breaks the chains
of common thinking.

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:22.549
There are a lot of people

00:00:22.573 --> 00:00:24.764
who created their own vision
about the future,

00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:27.955
for instance, this vision here
from the early 20th century.

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:32.015
It says here that this
is the ocean plane of the future.
