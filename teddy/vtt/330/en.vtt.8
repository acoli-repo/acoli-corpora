00:03:56.916 --> 00:04:00.045
the very first fireflies probably looked like this.

00:04:00.045 --> 00:04:01.402
They flew during the daytime

00:04:01.402 --> 00:04:03.665
and they didn't light up.

00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:06.838
Instead, males used their fantastic antennae

00:04:06.838 --> 00:04:10.949
to sniff out perfumes given off by their females.

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.555
In other fireflies, it's only the females who light up.

00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:18.897
They are attractively plump and wingless,

00:04:18.897 --> 00:04:20.821
so every night, they climb up onto perches

00:04:20.821 --> 00:04:22.789
and they glow brightly for hours

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:27.980
to attract their flying but unlit males.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.830
In still other fireflies, both sexes

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.217
use quick, bright flashes to find their mates.
