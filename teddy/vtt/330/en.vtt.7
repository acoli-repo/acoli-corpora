00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.788
from our collective adventures

00:03:31.788 --> 00:03:35.498
into this hidden world.

00:03:35.498 --> 00:03:38.660
Fireflies belong to a very beautiful

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.898
and diverse group of insects, the beetles.

00:03:42.898 --> 00:03:47.511
Worldwide, there are more than 2,000 firefly species,

00:03:47.511 --> 00:03:49.671
and these have evolved remarkably diverse

00:03:49.671 --> 00:03:51.026
courtship signals,

00:03:51.026 --> 00:03:54.660
that is, different ways to find and attract mates.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.916
Around 150 million years ago,

00:03:56.916 --> 00:04:00.045
the very first fireflies probably looked like this.
