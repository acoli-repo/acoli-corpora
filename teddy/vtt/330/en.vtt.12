00:05:56.878 --> 00:06:00.515
to being so conspicuous?

00:06:00.515 --> 00:06:02.133
Well, we know that these juveniles

00:06:02.133 --> 00:06:04.113
make nasty-tasting chemicals

00:06:04.113 --> 00:06:07.731
that help them survive their extended childhood,

00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:11.561
so we think these lights first evolved as a warning,

00:06:11.561 --> 00:06:16.120
a neon sign that says, "Toxic! Stay away!"

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.014
to any would-be predators.

00:06:19.014 --> 00:06:21.964
It took many millions of years

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:23.363
before these bright lights

00:06:23.363 --> 00:06:25.901
evolved into a smart communication tool

00:06:25.901 --> 00:06:28.916
that could be used not just to
ward off potential predators

00:06:28.916 --> 00:06:31.886
but to bring in potential mates.
