use quick, bright flashes to find their mates.

00:04:33.217 --> 00:04:34.688
Here in North America,

00:04:34.688 --> 00:04:37.829
we have more than 100 different kinds of firefly

00:04:37.829 --> 00:04:41.406
that have the remarkable ability to shine energy

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.644
out from their bodies

00:04:43.644 --> 00:04:45.970
in the form of light.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.420
How do they do that?

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.453
It seems totally magical,

00:04:50.453 --> 00:04:51.736
but these bioluminescent signals

00:04:51.736 --> 00:04:55.040
arise from carefully orchestrated chemical reactions

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.934
that happen inside the firefly lantern.

00:04:57.934 --> 00:05:01.241
The main star is an enzyme called luciferase,
