00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:01.055
not with flowers

00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:03.923
but with the lights of a thousand — 
(Bleep! Bleep!) — fireflies,

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:05.253
all blinking together

00:02:05.253 --> 00:02:08.411
in stunning synchrony.

00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:10.507
These luminous landscapes

00:02:10.507 --> 00:02:12.899
still fill me with wonder,

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.419
and they keep me connected to the magic

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.827
of the natural world.

00:02:17.827 --> 00:02:19.443
And I find it amazing that they're created

00:02:19.443 --> 00:02:22.731
by these tiny insects.

00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:25.622
In person, fireflies are charming.

00:02:25.622 --> 00:02:27.435
They're charismatic.

00:02:27.435 --> 00:02:29.119
They've been celebrated in art

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:31.594
and in poetry for centuries.
