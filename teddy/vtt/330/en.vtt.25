Here's another problem: we've conquered darkness,

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.964
but in the process, we spill so
much extra light out into the night

00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:40.090
that it disrupts the lives of other creatures,

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:43.534
and fireflies are especially sensitive to light pollution

00:12:43.534 --> 00:12:46.155
because it obscures the signals

00:12:46.155 --> 00:12:50.614
that they use to find their mates.

00:12:50.614 --> 00:12:52.592
Do we really need fireflies?

00:12:52.592 --> 00:12:54.631
After all, they're just one tiny bit

00:12:54.631 --> 00:12:56.900

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.208
Yet every time a species is lost,
