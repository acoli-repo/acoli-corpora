00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.781
that the female will use to provision her eggs.

00:09:31.781 --> 00:09:35.651
So females are keeping their eyes on this prize

00:09:35.651 --> 00:09:37.923
as they size up potential mates.

00:09:37.923 --> 00:09:40.792
We discovered that females use male flash signals

00:09:40.792 --> 00:09:42.839
to try to predict which males

00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:44.909
have the biggest gifts to offer,

00:09:44.909 --> 00:09:49.746
because this bling helps the female lay more eggs

00:09:49.746 --> 00:09:52.997
and ultimately launch more of her own offspring

00:09:52.997 --> 00:09:55.747
into the next generation.

00:09:57.687 --> 00:09:59.695
So it's not all sweetness and light.

00:09:59.695 --> 00:10:02.466
Firefly romance is risky.
