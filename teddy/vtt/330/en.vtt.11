00:05:29.953 --> 00:05:33.665
Fireflies completely reinvent
their bodies as they grow.

00:05:33.665 --> 00:05:35.966
They spend the vast majority of their lifetime,

00:05:35.966 --> 00:05:37.709
up to two years,

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:40.570
in this larval form.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.823
Their main goal here, like my teenagers,

00:05:42.823 --> 00:05:45.978
is to eat and grow.

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:48.430
And firefly light first originated

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.477
in these juveniles.

00:05:50.477 --> 00:05:52.907
Every single firefly larva can light up,

00:05:52.907 --> 00:05:55.786
even when their adults can't.

00:05:55.786 --> 00:05:56.878
But what's the point

00:05:56.878 --> 00:06:00.515
to being so conspicuous?
