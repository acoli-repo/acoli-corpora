00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.208
Yet every time a species is lost,

00:13:00.208 --> 00:13:02.897
it's like extinguishing a room full of candles

00:13:02.897 --> 00:13:05.825
one by one.

00:13:05.825 --> 00:13:06.771
You might not notice

00:13:06.771 --> 00:13:10.061
when the first few flames flicker out,

00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:14.435
but in the end, you're left sitting in darkness.

00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:24.411
As we work together to craft a planetary future,

00:13:24.411 --> 00:13:26.875
I hope we can find a way

00:13:26.875 --> 00:13:30.328
to keep these bright lights shining.
