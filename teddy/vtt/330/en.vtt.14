00:06:57.727 --> 00:07:00.503
into the next firefly generation.

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:03.767
So we can follow this male out into the field

00:07:03.767 --> 00:07:06.791
as he joins hundreds of other males

00:07:06.791 --> 00:07:11.169
who are all showing off their new courtship signals.

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:14.161
It's amazing to think that the luminous displays

00:07:14.161 --> 00:07:15.845
we admire

00:07:15.845 --> 00:07:18.280
here and in fact everywhere around the world

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.476
are actually the silent love songs

00:07:22.476 --> 00:07:25.453
of male fireflies.

00:07:25.453 --> 00:07:29.540
They're flying and flashing their hearts out.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.080
I still find it very romantic.
