and here's how it might go.

00:11:02.803 --> 00:11:06.673
First the prey male flashes, "Do you love me?"

00:11:06.673 --> 00:11:10.779
His own female responds, "Maybe."

00:11:10.779 --> 00:11:13.605
So then he flashes again.

00:11:13.605 --> 00:11:17.158
But this time, the predator sneaks in a reply

00:11:17.158 --> 00:11:22.834
that cleverly mimics exactly
what the other female just said.

00:11:22.834 --> 00:11:27.300
She's not looking for love: she's looking for toxins.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.181
If she's good, she can lure this male close enough
