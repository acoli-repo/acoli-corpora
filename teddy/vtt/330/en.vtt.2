00:00:56.426 --> 00:01:01.725
and suddenly, these silent sparks

00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:03.579
rose up all around me,

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:04.961

00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:07.651
How do these creatures make light,

00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:09.341

as I've explored this nocturnal world.

00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:23.460

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.561
or even heard about fireflies,

00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:28.207
then you'll know how magically they can transform

00:01:28.207 --> 00:01:30.598
our everyday landscape into something
