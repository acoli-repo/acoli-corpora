For the most part, these adult fireflies

00:10:04.943 --> 00:10:07.627
don't get eaten because like their juveniles

00:10:07.627 --> 00:10:10.563
they can manufacture toxins that are repellent

00:10:10.563 --> 00:10:13.620
to birds and other insectivores,

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.120
but somewhere along the line,

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.440
one particular group of fireflies

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.567
somehow lost the metabolic machinery

00:10:21.567 --> 00:10:25.370

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.650
This evolutionary flaw,

which was discovered by my colleague Tom Eisner,
