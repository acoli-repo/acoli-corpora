00:01:28.207 --> 00:01:30.598
our everyday landscape into something

00:01:30.598 --> 00:01:32.501
ethereal and otherworldly,

00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:34.442
and this happens around the globe,

00:01:34.442 --> 00:01:36.532
like this hillside in the Smoky Mountains

00:01:36.532 --> 00:01:40.618
that I saw transformed into a living cascade of light

00:01:40.618 --> 00:01:44.978
by the eerie glows of these blue ghost fireflies,

00:01:44.978 --> 00:01:47.998
or a roadside river that I visited in Japan

00:01:47.998 --> 00:01:52.104
as it was giving birth to the slow, floating flashes

00:01:52.104 --> 00:01:54.735
of these Genji fireflies,

00:01:54.735 --> 00:01:57.297
or in Malaysia, the mangrove trees

00:01:57.297 --> 00:01:59.625
that I watched blossom nightly

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:01.055
not with flowers
