00:08:59.275 --> 00:09:01.079
the male is busy giving the female

00:09:01.079 --> 00:09:03.050
not just his sperm

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:07.156
but also a nutrient-filled package

00:09:07.156 --> 00:09:11.777
called a nuptial gift.

00:09:11.777 --> 00:09:13.711
We can zoom in to look more closely

00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:15.274
inside this mating pair.

00:09:15.274 --> 00:09:16.967
We can actually see the gift —

00:09:16.967 --> 00:09:18.379
it's shown here in red —

00:09:18.379 --> 00:09:22.329
as it's being passed from the male to the female.

00:09:22.329 --> 00:09:25.464
What makes this gift so valuable

00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:27.320
is that it's packed with protein

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.781
that the female will use to provision her eggs.
