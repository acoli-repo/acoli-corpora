00:02:58.292 --> 00:03:01.952
natural selection, the struggle for survival,

00:03:01.952 --> 00:03:04.101
and sexual selection,

00:03:04.101 --> 00:03:08.162
the struggle for reproductive opportunity.

00:03:08.162 --> 00:03:10.513
As a firefly junkie, the past 20 years

00:03:10.513 --> 00:03:12.999
have been quite an exciting ride.

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:15.496
Together with my students at Tufts University

00:03:15.496 --> 00:03:16.512
and other colleagues,

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:20.119
we've made lots of new discoveries about fireflies:

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:22.128
their courtship and sex lives,

00:03:22.128 --> 00:03:25.022
their treachery and murder.

00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:26.839
So today I'd like to share with you

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:29.310
just a couple of tales that we've brought back

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.788
from our collective adventures
