00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
into very strange shapes,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and these shapes are speckled with wildlife

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
that has become so adapted

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to this harsh and strange land.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm a Himba.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You might wonder, why are you wearing these Western clothes?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm a Himba and Namibian.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
A Himba is one of the 29

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
ethnic groups in Namibia.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We live a very traditional lifestyle.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I grew up herding,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
looking after our livestock --

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
goats, sheep and cattle.
