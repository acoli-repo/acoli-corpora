00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
went into the house

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
of one of our neighbors

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and took a sleeping child out of the bed.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
It's a very sad story.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
But even today,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
that memory is still in people's minds.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
They can pinpoint the exact location

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
where this all happened.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And then, in the same year,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
we almost lost everything.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And my father said, "Why don't you just go to school?"

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And they sent me off to school, just to get busy somewhere there.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And the year I went to school,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
my father actually got a job with a non-governmental organization
