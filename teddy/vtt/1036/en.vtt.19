00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
The last element that actually helped develop these things

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
was the partnerships.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Our government has given legal status over our traditional lands.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
The other partners that we have got

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
is business communities.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Business communities helped bring Namibia onto the world map

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and they have also helped make wildlife

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
a very valuable land use like any other land uses

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
such as agriculture.
