00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
almost every Himba had a rifle.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Because it was wartime,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
the British .303 rifle

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
was just all over the whole country.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Then in the same time, around 1980,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
we had a very big drought.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
It killed almost everything that was left.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
protected as well.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
We were hungry.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I remember a night

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
when a hungry leopard

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
went into the house

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
of one of our neighbors
