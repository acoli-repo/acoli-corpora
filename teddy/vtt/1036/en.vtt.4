00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
goats, sheep and cattle.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And one day,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
my father actually took me into the bush.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
He said, "John,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I want you to become a good herder.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Boy, if you are looking after our livestock

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and you see a cheetah

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
eating our goat --

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
cheetah is very nervous --

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
just walk up to it.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Walk up to it and smack it on the backside."

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
(Laughter)

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
"And he will let go of the goat

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and run off."
