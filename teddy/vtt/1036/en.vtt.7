00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And it is very important if you are in the field

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
to know what to confront

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and what to run from.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I was born in 1971.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We lived under apartheid regime.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
The whites could farm, graze

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and hunt as they wished,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
but we black, we were not regarded as responsible

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
to use wildlife.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Whenever we tried to hunt,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
we were called poachers.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And as a result, we were fined and locked up in jail.
