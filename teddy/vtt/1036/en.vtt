In Africa we say,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
"God gave the white man a watch

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and gave the black man time."

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
(Laughter)

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I think, how is it possible

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
for a man with so much time

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to tell his story in 18 minutes?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I think it will be quite a challenge for me.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Most African stories these days,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
they talk about famine,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
HIV and AIDS,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
poverty or war.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But my story that I would like to share with you today
