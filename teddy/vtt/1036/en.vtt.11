00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And the year I went to school,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
my father actually got a job with a non-governmental organization

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
called IRDNC, Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
They actually spend a lot of time a year in the communities.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
They were trusted by the local communities

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
like our leader, Joshua Kangombe.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Joshua Kangombe saw what was happening:

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
wildlife disappearing,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
poaching was skyrocketing,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and the situation seemed very hopeless.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Death and despair surrounded Joshua

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and our entire communities.
