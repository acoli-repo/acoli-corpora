such as agriculture.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And most of my conservation colleagues today

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
that you find in Namibia

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
have been trained through the initiative,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
through the involvement of World Wildlife Fund

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
in the most up-to-date conservation practices.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
They have also given funding for two decades

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
to this whole program.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And so far, with the support of World Wildlife Fund,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
we've been able to scale up the very small programs

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
to national programs today.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
