00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
What started as very small,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
community rangers getting community involved,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
has now grown into something that we call conservancies.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Conservancies are legally instituted institutions

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
by the government,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and these are run by the communities themselves, for their benefit.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Today, we have got 60 conservancies

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
that manage and protect over 13 million hectares

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
of land in Namibia.
