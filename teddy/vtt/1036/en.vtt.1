00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
poverty or war.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But my story that I would like to share with you today

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is the one about success.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It is about a country

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
in the southwest of Africa

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
called Namibia.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Namibia has got 2.1 million people,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but it is only twice the size of California.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I come from a region

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
in the remote northwest part of the country.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's called Kunene region.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And in the center of Kunene region

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is the village of Sesfontein. This is where I was born.
