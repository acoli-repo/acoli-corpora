Other people. Everyone is interested in other people.

00:00:03.283 --> 00:00:05.406
Everyone has relationships with other people,

00:00:05.406 --> 00:00:06.998
and they're interested in these relationships

00:00:08.853 --> 00:00:10.865
Good relationships, bad relationships,

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:14.011
annoying relationships, agnostic relationships,

00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:17.435

00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:25.499
interested in interacting with other people,

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.331
I'm going to completely strip it of all its complicating features,

00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:33.225
and I'm going to turn that object, that simplified object,
