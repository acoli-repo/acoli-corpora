00:00:01.316 --> 00:00:04.596
When it comes to big problems
like climate change,

00:00:04.596 --> 00:00:07.996
we tend to like big solutions:

00:00:07.996 --> 00:00:11.476
new technologies, global policies.

00:00:11.516 --> 00:00:13.996
But many of the most important solutions

00:00:14.036 --> 00:00:15.996
are rooted on the ground

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:19.716
by actors that donâ€™t walk
the corridors of power,

00:00:20.316 --> 00:00:24.716
by actors that might not speak
the scientific language of climate change

00:00:24.756 --> 00:00:28.116
but who are dealing
with its impact every day.

00:00:28.956 --> 00:00:31.036
