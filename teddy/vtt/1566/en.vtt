00:00:00.487 --> 00:00:03.076
So in my free time outside of Twitter

00:00:03.076 --> 00:00:04.527
I experiment a little bit

00:00:04.527 --> 00:00:07.150
with telling stories online, experimenting

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.573
with what we can do with new digital tools.

00:00:09.573 --> 00:00:11.079
And in my job at Twitter,

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:12.695
I actually spent a little bit of time

00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:15.439
working with authors and storytellers as well,

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:17.644
helping to expand out the bounds

00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:19.954
of what people are experimenting with.

00:00:19.954 --> 00:00:22.324
And I want to talk through some examples today

00:00:22.324 --> 00:00:23.733
of things that people have done

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.902
that I think are really fascinating

00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:29.037
using flexible identity and anonymity on the web

00:00:29.037 --> 00:00:33.110
and blurring the lines between fact and fiction.
