00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.397
Everything in the real world
is being recreated

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.763
in the virtual world.

00:00:04.797 --> 00:00:05.930
The metaverse.

00:00:06.463 --> 00:00:09.730
The metaverse,
a persistent digital universe

00:00:09.763 --> 00:00:11.997
that mirrors our world,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.930
but is becoming as diverse
and awe-inspiring

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.330
as the natural world.

00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:19.597
And you'll be able to do everything
you do in the real world

00:00:19.597 --> 00:00:20.830
in the virtual world,

00:00:20.863 --> 00:00:22.097
and more.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.330
In the real world,
you can walk into a gallery,

00:00:24.363 --> 00:00:27.897
buy a one-of-a-kind artwork that is signed
and authenticated as original,

00:00:27.897 --> 00:00:30.863
take it home,
put it on the wall, enjoy it,
