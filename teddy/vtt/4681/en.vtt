00:00:01.083 --> 00:00:03.333
I'm a political and social psychologist.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.559
I study how people understand the world

00:00:06.583 --> 00:00:10.309
and what this means for society
and for democracy ...

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:13.143
which, as it turns out, is quite a lot.

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:15.476
Some people see the world
as safe and good,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.476
and this allows them
to be OK with uncertainty

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.643
and to take time to explore and play.

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:25.393
Others are acutely aware
of threats in their environment,

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:28.434
so they prioritize order
and predictability

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:30.958
over openness and experimentation.
