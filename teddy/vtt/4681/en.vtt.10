00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:00.851
Because they're on alert,

00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:03.851
they also make decisions
quickly and efficiently,

00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:06.518
guided by intuition and emotion.

00:05:06.542 --> 00:05:08.768
And we've found
that these traits help explain

00:05:08.792 --> 00:05:12.559
why conservatives enjoy
political opinion talk programming

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:16.542
that clearly and efficiently
identifies threats and enemies.

00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:19.684
What is essential though

00:05:19.708 --> 00:05:22.726
is that these propensities
are not absolute --

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.643
they're not fixed.

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:27.434
There are liberals
who are monitoring for threats

00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:31.059
just as there are conservatives
who are tolerant of ambiguity.
