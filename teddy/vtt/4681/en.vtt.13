Americans who are angry
and fearful of the other side.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.958
Charges of the other side
destroying America.

00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.143
But stop and think for a moment.

00:06:45.167 --> 00:06:50.042
What would happen if those differences
had never been weaponized?

00:06:50.833 --> 00:06:54.226
It is liberal inclinations
towards openness and flexibility

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.476
that allow us to cope with uncertainty

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.893
and that allow us to explore new paths
towards innovation, creativity --
