and to be comfortable not knowing
what was going to happen next.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.143
After we got married and had our baby boy,

00:01:36.167 --> 00:01:38.893
Mike was diagnosed with a brain tumor.

00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:43.101
And through months
of hospitalizations and surgeries,

00:01:43.125 --> 00:01:45.226
I followed Mike's lead,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.018
trying to practice being open,

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:52.059
trying to be OK not knowing
what was going to happen next.

00:01:52.083 --> 00:01:54.934
It was Mike's tolerance for ambiguity

00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:58.351
that allowed me to survive
those months of uncertainty,

00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:03.167
and that helped me explore new ways
to rebuild my life after he died.
