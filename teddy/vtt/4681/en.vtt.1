over openness and experimentation.

00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:33.184
In my academic research,

00:00:33.208 --> 00:00:37.643
I study how these two approaches
shape how we think and feel

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:40.250
about everything from art to politics.

00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:43.143
I also explore how political elites

00:00:43.167 --> 00:00:46.393
and partisan media
use these very differences

00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:48.768
to engender hatred and fear

00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:53.917
and how the economics of our media system
exploit these same divides.

00:00:54.792 --> 00:00:56.059
But after studying this,

00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:59.934
I have come away not with a sense
that we are doomed to be divided

00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:04.309
but that it's up to us
to see both sets of traits
