In fact, PJ's political beliefs

00:05:33.417 --> 00:05:36.292
are not that radically different

00:05:37.375 --> 00:05:43.018
The link between psychology
and politics is contingent on context:

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:45.726
who we're with
and what's going on around us.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.601
The problem is that right now,

00:05:47.625 --> 00:05:49.851
our dominant context,

00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:52.351
our political and media context,

00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:56.976
actually needs these
differences to be absolute,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.726
to be reinforced

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.542
and even to be weaponized.
