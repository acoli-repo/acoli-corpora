00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:03.167
and that helped me explore new ways
to rebuild my life after he died.

00:02:03.917 --> 00:02:06.851
About a year and a half
after Mike passed away,

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:09.518
I met my current husband, PJ.

00:02:09.542 --> 00:02:12.226
PJ is a criminal prosecutor

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.476
who sees the world as potentially good

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.726
provided that threats
are properly managed.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.934
He also is someone
who embraces order and predictability

00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.726
in his daily routine,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.351
in the foods that he eats,

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:27.684
in his selection of wardrobe.

00:02:27.708 --> 00:02:29.768
And PJ has a vicious wit,

00:02:29.792 --> 00:02:31.809
but he's also morally very serious
