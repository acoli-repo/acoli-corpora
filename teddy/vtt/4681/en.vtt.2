but that it's up to us
to see both sets of traits

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.958
as necessary and even valuable.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:12.958
Take for example two men who have been
so influential in my own life.

00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:16.434
First, my late husband, Mike.

00:01:16.458 --> 00:01:20.434
He was an artist who saw the world
as safe and good.

00:01:20.458 --> 00:01:23.059
He welcomed ambiguity
and play in his life.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.059
In fact, we met through improv comedy

00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:28.768
where he taught improvisers
to listen and be open

00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:32.083
and to be comfortable not knowing
what was going to happen next.
