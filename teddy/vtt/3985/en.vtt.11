looking at different objects

00:05:32.663 --> 00:05:34.616
and understanding where they come from.

It's a crazy Matrix experience.

00:05:36.872 --> 00:05:37.886
(Laughter)

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.196
Just moving on,

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.391

Vincent Van Gogh,

00:05:42.415 --> 00:05:46.130

00:05:46.154 --> 00:05:48.930
Thanks to the diversity
of the institutions we have,

00:05:48.954 --> 00:05:54.658
we have over 211 high-definition,
amazing artworks by this artist,

00:05:54.682 --> 00:05:58.429
now organized in one beautiful view.

00:05:58.453 --> 00:06:01.426
And as it resolves,
and as Cyril goes deeper,
