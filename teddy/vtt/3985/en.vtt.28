00:13:59.691 --> 00:14:04.066
which was this artwork
by Douglas Coupland,

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.185
our friend and artist
in residence as well,

00:14:06.209 --> 00:14:08.470
called, "I Miss My Pre-Internet Brain."

00:14:08.494 --> 00:14:12.109
I don't know why the machine feels like
it misses its pre-Internet brain

00:14:12.133 --> 00:14:13.403
and it's been tagged here,

00:14:13.427 --> 00:14:15.341
but it's a very interesting thought.

00:14:15.365 --> 00:14:17.548
I sometimes do miss my pre-Internet brain,

00:14:17.572 --> 00:14:20.572
but not when it comes to exploring
arts and culture online.

00:14:20.596 --> 00:14:22.909
So take out your phones,
take out your computers,

00:14:22.933 --> 00:14:24.090
go visit museums.

00:14:24.114 --> 00:14:26.793
And just a quick call-out
to all the amazing archivists,

00:14:26.817 --> 00:14:28.201
historians, curators,

00:14:28.225 --> 00:14:30.997
who are sitting in museums,
preserving all this culture.
