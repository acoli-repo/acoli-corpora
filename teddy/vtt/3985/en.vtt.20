00:09:56.854 --> 00:10:01.047
What we ended up with
is this very interesting map,

00:10:01.071 --> 00:10:05.381
these clusters that have
no reference point information,

00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:09.370
but has just used visuals
to cluster things together.

00:10:09.394 --> 00:10:12.976
Each cluster is an art to us
by itself of discovery.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.663
But one of the clusters we want
to show you very quickly

00:10:15.687 --> 00:10:18.339
is this amazing cluster of portraits

00:10:18.363 --> 00:10:20.765
that we found from museums
around the world.

00:10:20.789 --> 00:10:22.972
If you could zoom in
a little bit more, Cyril.

00:10:22.996 --> 00:10:26.828
Just to show you, you can
just travel through portraits.

00:10:26.852 --> 00:10:29.626
And essentially, you can do nature,
you can do horses

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.406
and clusters galore.
