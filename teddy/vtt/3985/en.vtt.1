Before we get started
in this presentation,

00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:35.200
I just want to take care
of a few housekeeping points.

00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:38.999
First, I am no expert in art or culture.

00:00:39.023 --> 00:00:41.749
I fell into this by mistake,
but I'm loving it.

00:00:42.356 --> 00:00:45.352
Secondly, all of what
I'm going to show you

00:00:45.376 --> 00:00:49.341
belongs to the amazing museums,
archives and foundations

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:50.791
that we partner with.

00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:52.671
None of this belongs to Google.

00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:56.424
And finally, what you see behind me

00:00:56.448 --> 00:00:59.799
is available right now
on your mobile phones,

00:00:59.823 --> 00:01:00.997
on your laptops.
