00:03:28.695 --> 00:03:30.771
It's one of the oldest
objects in the world,

00:03:30.795 --> 00:03:33.969
found in the Golan Heights
around 233,000 years ago,

00:03:33.993 --> 00:03:37.122
and currently residing
at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.

00:03:37.146 --> 00:03:39.767
It is also one of the oldest
objects on our platform.

00:03:40.322 --> 00:03:41.668
So let's zoom.

00:03:41.692 --> 00:03:43.457
We start from this one object.

00:03:43.986 --> 00:03:46.522
What if we zoomed out

00:03:46.546 --> 00:03:51.052
and actually tried to experience
our own cultural big bang?

00:03:51.076 --> 00:03:52.654
What might that look like?

00:03:53.474 --> 00:03:57.131
This is what we deal with on a daily basis
at the Cultural Institute --

00:03:57.155 --> 00:04:02.117
over six million cultural artifacts
curated and given to us by institutions,
