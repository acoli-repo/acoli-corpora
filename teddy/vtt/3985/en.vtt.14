I'm sorry, this is all live,

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:03.464
so you have to give Cyril
a little bit of --

00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:06.461
and this is available for every object:

00:07:06.485 --> 00:07:09.200
modern art, contemporary art,
Renaissance -- you name it,

00:07:09.224 --> 00:07:10.411
even sculpture.

00:07:11.802 --> 00:07:15.397
Sometimes, you don't know
what can attract you

00:07:15.421 --> 00:07:20.649
to an artwork or to a museum
or to a cultural discovery.

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:23.415
So for me, personally,
it was quite a challenge

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:26.661
because when I decided to make this
my full-time job at Google,

00:07:26.685 --> 00:07:29.288
my mother was not very supportive.

00:07:29.312 --> 00:07:30.559
I love my mother,
