00:05:58.453 --> 00:06:01.426
And as it resolves,
and as Cyril goes deeper,

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.659
you can see all the self-portraits,

00:06:03.683 --> 00:06:05.108
you can see still life.

00:06:05.132 --> 00:06:07.735
But I just wanted to highlight
one very quick example,

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:09.447
which is very timely:

00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:10.782
"The Bedroom."

00:06:10.806 --> 00:06:13.107
This is an artwork
where three copies exist --

00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:15.461
one at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam,

00:06:15.485 --> 00:06:17.472
one at the Orsay in Paris

00:06:17.496 --> 00:06:19.430
and one at the Art Institute of Chicago,

00:06:19.454 --> 00:06:21.957
which, actually, currently
is hosting a reunion

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:23.756
of all three artworks physically,

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.917
I think only for the second time ever.

00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:30.860
But, it is united digitally and virtually
for anybody to look at
