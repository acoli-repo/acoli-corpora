00:08:28.698 --> 00:08:30.333
to illustrate the point of access,

00:08:30.357 --> 00:08:32.779
and I'm going to go
quite quickly on this one.

00:08:32.803 --> 00:08:38.210
We all know that seeing the artwork
in person is amazing.

00:08:38.234 --> 00:08:40.817
But we also know
that most of us can't do it,

00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:43.599
and the ones that can afford
to do it, it's complicated.

00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:47.430

We don't have a good name for this.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.211
But essentially, we have
around 1,000 amazing institutions,

00:08:54.235 --> 00:08:55.402
68 countries.

00:08:55.426 --> 00:08:57.126
But let's start with Rembrandt.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.392
We might have time for only one example.

00:08:59.416 --> 00:09:01.645
But thanks to the diversity,
