00:00:59.823 --> 00:01:00.997
on your laptops.

00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:03.425
This is our current platform,
where you can explore

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.860
thousands of museums
and objects at your fingertips,

00:01:06.884 --> 00:01:09.395
in extremely high-definition detail.

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:12.312
The diversity of the content
is what's amazing.

00:01:12.336 --> 00:01:14.505
If we just had European paintings,

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:16.260
if we just had modern art,

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:18.086
I think it gets a bit boring.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.969
For example, this month,
we launched the "Black History" channel

00:01:21.993 --> 00:01:24.582
with 82 curated exhibitions,

00:01:24.606 --> 00:01:28.172
which talk about arts and culture
in that community.

00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:31.819
We also have some
amazing objects from Japan,
