00:12:28.263 --> 00:12:30.004
images of horses, right?

00:12:30.028 --> 00:12:33.470
And it has, but you also notice,
right over there,

00:12:33.494 --> 00:12:35.573
that it has a very abstract image

00:12:35.597 --> 00:12:38.792
that it has still managed to recognize
and cluster as horses.

00:12:38.816 --> 00:12:42.506
We also have an amazing head
in terms of a horse.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:46.532
And each one has the tags
as to why it got categorized in this.

00:12:46.556 --> 00:12:50.530
So let's move to another one
which I found very funny and interesting,

00:12:50.554 --> 00:12:53.045
because I don't understand
how this category came up.

00:12:53.069 --> 00:12:54.819
It's called "Lady in Waiting."

00:12:54.843 --> 00:12:57.455
If, Cyril, you do it very quickly,

00:12:57.479 --> 00:13:01.021
you will see that we have
these amazing images
