I'm being hard on Cyril,
because I'm moving too fast.

00:13:30.145 --> 00:13:32.772
Essentially, here you have
all the bling-bling

00:13:32.796 --> 00:13:35.957
of the world's museums organized for you.

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:39.497
And finally, to end this talk
and these experiments,

00:13:39.521 --> 00:13:42.838
what I hope you feel after this talk
is happiness and emotion.

00:13:42.862 --> 00:13:45.301
And what would we see
when we see happiness?

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:48.484
If we actually look at all the objects

00:13:48.508 --> 00:13:50.452
that have been tagged under "happiness,"

00:13:50.476 --> 00:13:53.540
you would expect happiness, I guess.

00:13:53.564 --> 00:13:59.667
But there was one that came up
that was very fascinating and interesting,

00:13:59.691 --> 00:14:04.066
which was this artwork
by Douglas Coupland,
