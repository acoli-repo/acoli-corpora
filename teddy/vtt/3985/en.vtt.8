00:03:57.155 --> 00:04:02.117
over six million cultural artifacts
curated and given to us by institutions,

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:04.087
to actually make these connections.

00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:05.510
You can travel through time,

00:04:05.534 --> 00:04:09.045
you can understand more
about our society through these.

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.469
You can look at it
from the perspective of our planet,

00:04:13.493 --> 00:04:16.128
and try to see how
it might look without borders,

00:04:16.152 --> 00:04:18.823
if we just organized art and culture.

00:04:18.847 --> 00:04:21.075
We can also then plot it by time,

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:25.179
which obviously, for the data geek
in me, is very fascinating.

00:04:25.203 --> 00:04:28.589
You can spend hours
looking at every decade

00:04:28.613 --> 00:04:31.929
and the contributions
in that decade and in those years
