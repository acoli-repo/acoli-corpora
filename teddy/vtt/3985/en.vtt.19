00:09:27.386 --> 00:09:30.051
so you can justify it,
perhaps, in some way.

00:09:30.837 --> 00:09:32.759
Moving on swiftly from here,

00:09:32.783 --> 00:09:35.718
is something a little bit
more technical and more interesting.

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:40.679
All that we've shown you so far
uses metadata to make the connections.

00:09:40.703 --> 00:09:42.813
But obviously we have
something cool nowadays

00:09:42.837 --> 00:09:45.749
that everyone likes to talk about,
which is machine learning.

00:09:45.773 --> 00:09:48.847
So what we thought is,
let's strip out all the metadata,

00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:52.483
let's look at what machine learning can do

00:09:52.507 --> 00:09:56.830
based purely on visual recognition
of this entire collection.

00:09:56.854 --> 00:10:01.047
What we ended up with
is this very interesting map,
