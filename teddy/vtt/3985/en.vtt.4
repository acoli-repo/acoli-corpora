One quick thing I wanted
to showcase in this platform,

00:02:02.794 --> 00:02:05.729
which you can share with your kids
and your friends right now,

00:02:05.753 --> 00:02:10.009
is you can travel to all these
amazing institutions virtually, as well.

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:13.619
One of our recent ideas was with
The Guggenheim Museum in New York,

00:02:13.643 --> 00:02:17.001
where you can get a taste
of what it might feel like

00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:18.176
to actually be there.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.967
You can go to the ground floor

00:02:19.991 --> 00:02:22.680
and obviously, most of you,
I assume, have been there.

00:02:22.704 --> 00:02:25.441
And you can see the architectural
masterpiece that it is.

00:02:25.465 --> 00:02:28.559
But imagine this accessibility
for a kid in Bombay

00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:30.303
