00:11:58.886 --> 00:12:03.787
but what if we could ask the machine
to also name these clusters?

00:12:03.811 --> 00:12:08.564
What if it could automatically tag
them, using no actual metadata?

00:12:08.588 --> 00:12:12.688
So what we have is this kind of explorer,

00:12:12.712 --> 00:12:16.323
where we have managed to match,
I think, around 4,000 labels.

00:12:16.347 --> 00:12:19.511
And we haven't really
done anything special here,

00:12:19.535 --> 00:12:21.193
just fed the collection.

00:12:21.217 --> 00:12:22.987
And we found interesting categories.

00:12:23.011 --> 00:12:25.916
We can start with horses,
a very straightforward category.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.239
You would expect to see
that the machine has put

00:12:28.263 --> 00:12:30.004
images of horses, right?
