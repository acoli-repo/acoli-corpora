Beyond the pretty picture,

00:05:00.557 --> 00:05:02.346
beyond the nice visualization,

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.697
what is the purpose, how is this useful?

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:09.450
This next idea comes
from discussions with curators

00:05:09.474 --> 00:05:11.109
that we've been having at museums,

00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:13.156
who, by the way, I've fallen in love with,

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.374
because they dedicate their whole life
to try to tell these stories.

00:05:16.398 --> 00:05:19.329
One of the curators told me,
"Amit, what would it be like

00:05:19.353 --> 00:05:21.832
if you could create
a virtual curator's table

00:05:21.856 --> 00:05:24.159
where all these six million objects

00:05:24.183 --> 00:05:28.586
are displayed in a way for us
to look at the connections between them?"

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.639
You can spend a lot of time, trust me,
looking at different objects
