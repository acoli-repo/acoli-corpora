00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:30.860
But, it is united digitally and virtually
for anybody to look at

00:06:30.884 --> 00:06:32.805
in a very different way,

00:06:32.829 --> 00:06:35.862
and you won't get pushed
in the line in the crowd.

00:06:35.886 --> 00:06:40.628
So let's take you and let's travel
through "The Bedroom" very quickly,

00:06:40.652 --> 00:06:44.239
so you can experience what we are doing
for every single object.

00:06:44.263 --> 00:06:47.714
We want the image to speak
as much as it can

00:06:47.738 --> 00:06:49.382
on a digital platform.

00:06:49.406 --> 00:06:52.553
And all you need is an internet
connection and a computer

00:06:52.577 --> 00:06:56.915
(Applause)

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:59.497
And, Cyril, if you can go deeper, quickly.

00:06:59.521 --> 00:07:01.005
I'm sorry, this is all live,
