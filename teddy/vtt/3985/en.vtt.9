00:04:28.613 --> 00:04:31.929
and the contributions
in that decade and in those years

00:04:31.953 --> 00:04:34.286
for art, history and cultures.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.689
We would love to spend hours
showing you each and every decade,

00:04:37.713 --> 00:04:39.574
but we don't have the time right now.

00:04:39.598 --> 00:04:42.857
So you can go on your phone
and actually do it yourself.

00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:46.343
(Applause)

00:04:46.367 --> 00:04:49.469
But if you don't mind
and can hold your applause till later,

00:04:49.493 --> 00:04:51.041
I don't want to run out of time,

00:04:51.065 --> 00:04:53.264
because I want to show you
a lot of cool stuff.

00:04:53.288 --> 00:04:54.788
So, just very quickly:

00:04:54.812 --> 00:04:58.798
you can move on from here
to another very interesting idea.

00:04:58.822 --> 00:05:00.533
Beyond the pretty picture,
