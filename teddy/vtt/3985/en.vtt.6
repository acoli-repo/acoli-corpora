00:02:55.657 --> 00:03:00.125
So I am joined today onstage
by my good friend and artist in residence

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:02.492
at our office in Paris, Cyril Diagne,

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.645
who is the professor of interactive design

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.306
at ECAL University
in Lausanne, Switzerland.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.944
What Cyril and our team
of engineers have been doing

00:03:09.968 --> 00:03:13.103
is trying to find these connections
and visualize a few of these.

00:03:13.127 --> 00:03:14.940
So I'm going to go quite quick now.

00:03:14.964 --> 00:03:18.566
This object you see
behind me -- oh, just clarification:

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.541
Always, seeing the real thing is better.

00:03:20.565 --> 00:03:23.428
In case people think
I'm trying to replicate the real thing.

00:03:23.452 --> 00:03:24.659
So, moving on.

00:03:25.155 --> 00:03:28.671
This object you see behind me
is the Venus of Berekhat Ram.

00:03:28.695 --> 00:03:30.771
It's one of the oldest
objects in the world,
