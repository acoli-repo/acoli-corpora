00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:30.303
who's studying architecture,

00:02:30.327 --> 00:02:33.382
who hasn't had a chance
to go to The Guggenheim as yet.

00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:36.491
You can obviously look at objects
in the Guggenheim Museum,

00:02:36.515 --> 00:02:39.233
you can obviously get into them
and so on and so forth.

00:02:39.257 --> 00:02:41.132
There's a lot of information here.

00:02:41.156 --> 00:02:45.005
But this is not the purpose
of my talk today.

00:02:45.543 --> 00:02:47.309
This exists right now.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:51.259
What we now have are the building blocks
to a very exciting future,

00:02:51.283 --> 00:02:52.998
when it comes to arts and culture

00:02:53.022 --> 00:02:55.633
and accessibility to arts and culture.

00:02:55.657 --> 00:03:00.125
So I am joined today onstage
by my good friend and artist in residence
