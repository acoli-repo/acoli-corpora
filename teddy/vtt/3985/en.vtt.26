00:12:57.479 --> 00:13:01.021
you will see that we have
these amazing images

00:13:01.045 --> 00:13:03.806
of ladies, I guess, in waiting or posing.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.276
I don't really understand it.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.540
But I've been trying to ask
my museum contacts,

00:13:07.564 --> 00:13:09.809
you know, "What is this?
What's going on here?"

00:13:09.833 --> 00:13:11.445
And it's fascinating.

00:13:11.469 --> 00:13:14.158
Coming back to gold very quickly,

00:13:14.182 --> 00:13:15.745
I wanted to search for gold

00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:17.871
and see how the machine
tagged all the gold.

00:13:17.895 --> 00:13:19.975
But, actually, it doesn't tag it as gold.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.835
We are living in popular times.

00:13:21.859 --> 00:13:23.962
It tags it as "bling-bling."

00:13:23.986 --> 00:13:25.800
(Laughter)

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.121
I'm being hard on Cyril,
because I'm moving too fast.
