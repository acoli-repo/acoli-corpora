I love my mother,

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:33.582
but she thought I was wasting my life
with this museum stuff.

00:07:33.606 --> 00:07:36.918
And for her, a museum is what
you do when you go on vacation

00:07:36.942 --> 00:07:38.909
and you tick-mark and it's over, right?

00:07:38.933 --> 00:07:41.464
And it took around four and a half years

00:07:41.488 --> 00:07:43.702
for me to convince my lovely Indian mother

00:07:43.726 --> 00:07:45.379
that actually, this is worthwhile.

00:07:45.403 --> 00:07:48.844
And the way I did it was,
I realized one day that she loves gold.

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:54.443
So I started showing her all objects
that have the material gold in them.

00:07:54.467 --> 00:07:57.118
And the first thing my mom asks me is,

00:07:57.142 --> 00:07:59.570
"How can we buy these?"

00:07:59.594 --> 00:08:01.412
(Laughter)
