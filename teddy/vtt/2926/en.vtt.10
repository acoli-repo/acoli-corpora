Waste for the one should be
food for the other.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.502
So, here, maybe show it around.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.433
Do not put this in your coffee.

00:05:06.457 --> 00:05:07.468
(Laughter)

00:05:07.492 --> 00:05:10.503
And we realized that 42 percent
is made out of carbon,

00:05:10.527 --> 00:05:12.695
and carbon, of course,
under high pressure,

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:13.990
you get ...

00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:16.275
diamonds.

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:20.430
So, inspired by that,
we compress it for 30 minutes --

00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:21.541
(Cracking sound)

00:05:21.565 --> 00:05:23.645
and make smog-free rings.

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:24.692
(Laughter)

00:05:24.716 --> 00:05:26.692
And so by sharing -- yeah, really!

00:05:26.716 --> 00:05:28.354
And so by sharing a ring,

00:05:28.378 --> 00:05:30.984
you donate 1,000 cubic meters of clean air
