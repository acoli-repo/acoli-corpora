Van Gogh, the famous
Van Gogh Foundation --

00:00:30.847 --> 00:00:34.823
who wanted to celebrate
his 125th anniversary in the Netherlands.

00:00:35.232 --> 00:00:37.097
And they came to me and asked,

00:00:37.121 --> 00:00:40.922
"Can you make a place
where he feels more alive again

00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:42.152
in the Netherlands?"

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:43.730
And I liked that question a lot,

00:00:43.754 --> 00:00:44.908
so in way,

00:00:44.932 --> 00:00:47.981
we sort of started to connect
these two different worlds.

00:00:49.027 --> 00:00:50.324
This is how my brain works,

00:00:50.348 --> 00:00:51.498
by the way.

00:00:51.522 --> 00:00:52.573
(Laughter)

00:00:52.597 --> 00:00:54.808
I would love to keep on
doing this for an hour,

00:00:54.832 --> 00:00:55.983
but OK --

00:00:56.007 --> 00:00:57.015
(Laughter)

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.817
And this is the result that we made:

00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:01.563
a bicycle path which charges
at daytime via the sun
