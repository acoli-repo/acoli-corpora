in the celebration of the bicycle.

00:07:01.453 --> 00:07:05.614
And so right now, we're working
on a sort of "package deal," so to speak,

00:07:05.638 --> 00:07:08.892
where we say, "Smog-free towers,
smog-free rings."

00:07:08.916 --> 00:07:11.412
We go to the mayors
or the governors of this world,

00:07:11.436 --> 00:07:15.539
and say, "We can guarantee
a short-term reduction of pollution

00:07:15.563 --> 00:07:17.646
between 20 and 40 percent.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.567
Please sign here right now."

00:07:19.591 --> 00:07:20.742
Yes?

00:07:20.766 --> 00:07:22.493
(Applause)

00:07:22.517 --> 00:07:23.667
Thank you.

00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:25.521
(Applause)

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:30.472
So it's all about connecting
new technology with creative thinking.
