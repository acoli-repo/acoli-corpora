00:10:29.839 --> 00:10:32.623
But we gave it a little "update,"

00:10:32.647 --> 00:10:34.978
a little "hack," so to speak.

00:10:35.002 --> 00:10:38.296
We placed a little voice-recognition
element right here.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.897
So the moment you sit on that chair,

00:10:41.921 --> 00:10:45.207
and you say those two horrible,

00:10:45.231 --> 00:10:49.681
creative-destructive,
annoying little words --

00:10:49.705 --> 00:10:50.796
(Laughter)

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.475
you get a short --

00:10:52.499 --> 00:10:54.122
(Laughter)

00:10:54.146 --> 00:10:55.719
but pretty intense

00:10:55.743 --> 00:10:58.558
little shock on the back side
of your bottom.

00:10:58.582 --> 00:10:59.739
(Laughter)

00:10:59.763 --> 00:11:01.152
(Applause)
