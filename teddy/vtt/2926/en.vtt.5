00:02:26.662 --> 00:02:30.315
And this makes me very optimistic,
very hopeful for the new world,

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:33.215
that as we will live
in this hyper-technological world,

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.681
our human skills --

00:02:34.705 --> 00:02:36.049
our desire for empathy,

00:02:36.073 --> 00:02:38.339
our desire for curiosity,

00:02:38.363 --> 00:02:40.078
our desire for beauty --

00:02:40.102 --> 00:02:41.836
will be more appreciated again,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.676
and we will live in a world
where creativity is our true capital.

00:02:46.784 --> 00:02:49.243
And a creative process like that --

00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:50.966
I don't know how it works for you,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.681
but in my brain, it always starts
with a question:

00:02:53.705 --> 00:02:54.859
Why?

00:02:55.884 --> 00:02:58.407
Why does a jellyfish emit light?

00:02:58.431 --> 00:02:59.786
Or a firefly?

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.056
Or why do be accept pollution?
