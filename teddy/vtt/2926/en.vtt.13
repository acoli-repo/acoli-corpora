00:06:28.231 --> 00:06:31.324
So the first goal is to create
local clean-air parks,

00:06:31.348 --> 00:06:33.348
and that works already quite well --

00:06:33.372 --> 00:06:35.632
55, 75 percent more clean.

00:06:35.656 --> 00:06:37.005
And at the same time,

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:38.426
we team up with the NGOs,

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.614
with the governors,

00:06:39.638 --> 00:06:40.838
with the students,

00:06:40.862 --> 00:06:42.013
with the tech people,

00:06:42.037 --> 00:06:45.392
to say, "Hey, what do we need to do
to make a whole city smog-free?"

00:06:45.416 --> 00:06:47.199
It's about the dream of clean air.

00:06:47.223 --> 00:06:49.469
We do workshops. New ideas pop up.

00:06:49.493 --> 00:06:52.287
These are smog-free bicycles
which -- I'm Dutch, yes? --

00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:54.750
I have this "bicycle DNA"
inside of me somewhere.

00:06:54.774 --> 00:06:56.424
And so it sucks up polluted air,

00:06:56.448 --> 00:06:58.007
it cleans it and releases it,

00:06:58.031 --> 00:06:59.524
in the fight against the car,

00:06:59.548 --> 00:07:01.429
in the celebration of the bicycle.
