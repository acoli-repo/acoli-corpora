00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.056
Or why do be accept pollution?

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.329
This is from my room
in Beijing three years ago.

00:03:04.353 --> 00:03:06.497
Left image is a good day -- Saturday.

00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:08.742
I can see the cars
and the people, the birds;

00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:11.358
life is OK in a dense urban city.

00:03:11.382 --> 00:03:13.214
And on the right image --

00:03:13.238 --> 00:03:15.038
holy moly.

00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:17.075
Pollution -- complete layers.

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.807
I couldn't even see
the other side of the city.

00:03:19.831 --> 00:03:21.667
And this image made me really sad.

00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:24.740
This is not the bright future
we envision here at TED --

00:03:24.764 --> 00:03:25.937
this is the horror.

00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:27.712
We live five to six years shorter;

00:03:27.736 --> 00:03:30.425
children have lung cancer
when they're six years old.
