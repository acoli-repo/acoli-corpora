00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:30.864
So this ...

00:04:30.888 --> 00:04:32.835
this is the stuff we are capturing.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.057
This is Beijing smog.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.378
This is in our lungs right now.

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:40.824
If you live next to a highway,
it's the same as 17 cigarettes per day.

00:04:40.848 --> 00:04:41.998
Are we insane?

00:04:42.022 --> 00:04:43.605
When did we say yes to that?

00:04:44.028 --> 00:04:47.271
And we had buckets
of this disgusting material

00:04:47.295 --> 00:04:48.839
in our studio,

00:04:48.863 --> 00:04:51.672
and on a Monday morning,
we were discussing, we were like,

00:04:51.696 --> 00:04:54.546
"Shit, what should we do with it?
Should we throw it away?"

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.725
Like, "Help!"

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:57.910
And then we realized:
no, no, no, no, no --

00:04:57.934 --> 00:04:59.126
waste should not exist.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.578
Waste for the one should be
food for the other.
