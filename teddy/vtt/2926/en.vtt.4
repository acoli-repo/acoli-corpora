asking, "What are the top 10 skills
you and I need to become successful?"

00:02:02.852 --> 00:02:05.172
And what is interesting,
what you see here:

00:02:05.196 --> 00:02:07.735
it's not about money

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.660
or being really good in C++,

00:02:10.684 --> 00:02:13.701
although these are great skills
to have, I have to admit.

00:02:13.725 --> 00:02:16.081
But look at number three, creativity;

00:02:16.105 --> 00:02:18.317
number two, critical thinking;

00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:21.441
number one, complex problem-solving --

00:02:21.465 --> 00:02:25.986
all the things a robot or a computer
is really bad at.

00:02:26.662 --> 00:02:30.315
And this makes me very optimistic,
very hopeful for the new world,
