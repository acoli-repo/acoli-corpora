Do you remember
these glow-in-the-dark little stars

00:00:03.177 --> 00:00:06.067
which you had on the ceiling
when you were a boy or a girl?

00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:07.301
Yes?

00:00:07.325 --> 00:00:08.521
It is light.

00:00:08.545 --> 00:00:09.729
It is pure light.

00:00:09.753 --> 00:00:11.655
I think I stared at them way too long

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.452
when I was a five-year-old, you know?

00:00:13.476 --> 00:00:14.700
It's so beautiful:

00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:17.481
no energy bill, no maintenance.

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:18.709
It is there.

00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:20.790
So two years ago, we went back to the lab,

00:00:20.814 --> 00:00:23.112
making it more durable,
more light-emitting,

00:00:23.136 --> 00:00:24.516
with the experts.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.221
And at the same time,
we got a request from this guy --

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:30.823
Van Gogh, the famous
Van Gogh Foundation --
