00:03:27.736 --> 00:03:30.425
children have lung cancer
when they're six years old.

00:03:30.828 --> 00:03:33.314
And so in a weird, beautiful way,

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:37.492
I, at that moment, became inspired
by Beijing smog.

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.332
And the governments all around the world
are fighting their war on smog,

00:03:41.356 --> 00:03:43.994
but I wanted to make something
within the now.

00:03:44.018 --> 00:03:47.816
So we decided to build
the largest smog vacuum cleaner

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.251
in the world.

00:03:49.275 --> 00:03:51.224
It sucks up polluted air, cleans it

00:03:51.248 --> 00:03:52.672
and then releases it.

00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:54.386
And we built the first one.

00:03:54.865 --> 00:03:57.502
So it sucks up 30,000
cubic meters per hour,

00:03:57.526 --> 00:04:01.313
cleans it on the nano level --
the PM2.5, PM10 particles --
