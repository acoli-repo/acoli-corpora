00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:31.554
"Oh, whatever, somebody else
will do it for us,"

00:08:31.578 --> 00:08:33.598
or we'll wait for government or whomever.

00:08:33.622 --> 00:08:35.488
You know, we're not going to do that.

00:08:35.512 --> 00:08:36.671
It goes wrong.

00:08:36.695 --> 00:08:39.411
And we placed this in public spaces
all around the world.

00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:41.026
Thousands of people showed up.

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:42.298
(Applause)

00:08:42.322 --> 00:08:43.472
Thank you.

00:08:44.117 --> 00:08:47.678
You're too nice, you're too nice.
That's not good for a designer.

00:08:47.702 --> 00:08:49.702
So thousands of people showed up,

00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:51.496
and some, actually, were scared.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.861
And they left; they experienced
the floods in 1953.

00:08:54.885 --> 00:08:56.277
And others were mesmerized.

00:08:56.301 --> 00:08:58.120
Can we make floating cities?

00:08:58.144 --> 00:09:01.631
Can we generate electricity
from the change in tides?
