00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:30.472
So it's all about connecting
new technology with creative thinking.

00:07:30.496 --> 00:07:32.438
And if you start thinking about that,

00:07:32.462 --> 00:07:34.623
there is so much you can imagine,

00:07:34.647 --> 00:07:36.170
so much more you can do.

00:07:36.194 --> 00:07:39.505
We worked on dance floors
which produce electricity

00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:40.788
when you dance on them.

00:07:40.812 --> 00:07:43.290
We did the design for that -- 2008.

00:07:43.314 --> 00:07:45.309
So it moves eight or nine millimeters,

00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:47.011
produces 25 watts.

00:07:47.035 --> 00:07:51.032
The electricity that we generate
is used for the lighting or the DJ booth.

00:07:51.056 --> 00:07:53.720
So some of the sustainability
is about doing more,

00:07:53.744 --> 00:07:55.407
not about doing less.

00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:56.917
But also on a larger scale,

00:07:56.941 --> 00:08:00.390
the Netherlands, where I'm
from, we live below sea level.
