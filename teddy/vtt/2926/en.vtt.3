00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:31.854
And it was somehow great
to make these projects happen

00:01:31.878 --> 00:01:34.724
with the industry,
with the infrastructure companies.

00:01:34.748 --> 00:01:37.037
So when these sheikhs of Qatar
started to call:

00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:38.562
"How much for 10 kilometers?"

00:01:38.586 --> 00:01:39.601
(Laughter)

00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:42.337
Yeah, really, that's a weird call
you're going to get.

00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:43.521
But it's fascinating

00:01:43.545 --> 00:01:46.953
that this is not just a sort
of one-off, nice-to-have special.

00:01:46.977 --> 00:01:50.400
I think this kind of creative thinking,
these kinds of connections --

00:01:50.424 --> 00:01:51.608
it's the new economy.

00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:54.379
The World Economic Forum,
the think tank in Geneva,

00:01:54.403 --> 00:01:56.802
did an interview
with a lot of smart people

00:01:56.826 --> 00:01:57.982
all around the world,

00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:02.828
asking, "What are the top 10 skills
you and I need to become successful?"
