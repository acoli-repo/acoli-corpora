00:05:28.378 --> 00:05:30.984
you donate 1,000 cubic meters of clean air

00:05:31.008 --> 00:05:32.673
to the city the tower is in.

00:05:32.697 --> 00:05:33.709
(Applause)

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:34.963
I have one here --

00:05:34.987 --> 00:05:36.167
(Applause)

00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:39.058
A little floating cube.

00:05:40.163 --> 00:05:41.313
I will give one to you.

00:05:41.337 --> 00:05:43.567
I'm not going to propose, don't worry.

00:05:43.591 --> 00:05:44.879
(Laughter)

00:05:44.903 --> 00:05:46.068
Are we good?

00:05:46.092 --> 00:05:47.334
You can show it around.

00:05:47.358 --> 00:05:50.768
And we put this online --
Kickstarter campaign, crowdfunding.

00:05:50.792 --> 00:05:52.581
And people started to preorder it,

00:05:52.605 --> 00:05:55.435
but more importantly,
they started to prepay it.

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:58.828
So the finance we made with the jewelry
helped us to realize,

00:05:58.852 --> 00:06:00.477
to build the first tower.
