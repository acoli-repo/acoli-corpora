00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:01.563
a bicycle path which charges
at daytime via the sun

00:01:01.587 --> 00:01:03.709
and glows at night, up to eight hours.

00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:04.961
(Applause)

00:01:04.985 --> 00:01:06.311
Thank you.

00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:10.702
... hinting towards a future
which should be energy friendly

00:01:10.726 --> 00:01:12.422
and linking up the local grounds

00:01:12.446 --> 00:01:15.873
as Van Gogh literally walked
and lived there in 1883.

00:01:15.897 --> 00:01:19.204
And you can go there every night
for free, no ticket needed.

00:01:19.228 --> 00:01:22.434
People experience the beauty
of cycling through the starry night,

00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:24.483
thinking about green energy and safety.

00:01:24.507 --> 00:01:28.222
I want to create places
where people feel connected again.

00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:31.854
And it was somehow great
to make these projects happen
