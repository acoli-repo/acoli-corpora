because it would affect the industries.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.576
And so here I was saying,

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.816
OK, I hear you,

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.496
I understand what you're saying,

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.776
but try also to understand what I'm saying

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.416
because if you do not cut your emissions,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.816
then our survival is on the line.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.176
And so it's a matter for you
to weigh this, these moral issues.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.216
It's about industry as opposed to
the survival of a people.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.896
CA: You know, I ask you yesterday
what made you angry,

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.416
and you said, "I don't get angry."
But then you paused.
