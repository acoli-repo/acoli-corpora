But then you paused.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.056
I think this made you angry.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.976
AT: I'd refer you to my earlier
statement at the United Nations.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.936
I was very angry, very frustrated
and then depressed.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.936
There was a sense of futility

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:49.416
that we are fighting a fight
that we have no hope of winning.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.616
I had to change my approach.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.736
I had to become more reasonable

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.903
because I thought people would listen
to somebody who was rational,

00:11:56.927 --> 00:11:59.496
but I remain radically rational,
whatever that is.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.136
