00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.136
just yesterday
or the day before yesterday,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.336
you visited these people.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.536
What happened here? What's the story here?

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.976
AT: Yes, and I'm sorry,
I think somebody was asking

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.976
why we were sneaking off
to visit that place.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.976
I had a very good reason, because we have
a community of Kiribati people

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.096
living in that part
of the Solomon Islands,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.976
but these were people who were relocated
from the Phoenix Islands, in fact,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.456
in the 1960s.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.016
There was serious drought, and the people
could not continue to live on the island,
