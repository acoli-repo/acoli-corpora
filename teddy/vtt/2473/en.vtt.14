00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.096
or we have to build up the islands
to continue to stay out of the water

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.856
as the sea level rises
and as the storms get more severe.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.309

to get the kind of resourcing
that we would need.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.056

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.576
we don't want to be caught
like what's happening in Europe.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.296
OK? We don't want to mass migrate
at some point in time.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.736
We want to be able
to give the people the choice today,
