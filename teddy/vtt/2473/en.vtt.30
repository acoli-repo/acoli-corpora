On the one hand,
it may prompt healthier fisheries.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.416
I mean, how much are you able
to move the price up

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.936
that you charge for the remaining areas?

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.576
AT: The negotiations
have been very difficult,

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.456
but we have managed
to raise the cost of a vessel day.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.096
For any vessel
to come in to fish for a day,

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.736
we have raised the fee from --
it was $6,000 and $8,000,

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:27.336
now to $10,000, $12,000 per vessel day.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.576
And so there's been
that significant increase.
