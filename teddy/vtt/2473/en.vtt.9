00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.216
AT: Well, we're on the equator,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.656
and I'm sure many of you understand
that when you're on the equator,

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.256
it's supposed to be in the doldrums.
We're not supposed to get the cyclones.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.090
We create them, and then we send them
either north or south.

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.496
(Laughter)

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.376
But they aren't supposed to come back.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.924
But for the first time,
at the beginning of this year,

00:04:46.948 --> 00:04:50.616
the Cyclone Pam,
which destroyed Vanuatu,

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.096
and in the process,
the very edges of it actually touched

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.496
our two southernmost islands,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.896
and all of Tuvalu was underwater
when Hurricane Pam struck.
