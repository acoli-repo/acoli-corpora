00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.456
But we decided to close this,
and it was a very difficult decision.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:38.016
I can assure you, politically,
locally, it was not easy,

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.976
but I was convinced that we had to do this

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.576
in order to ensure
that the fishery remains sustainable.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.376
There had been some indications
that some of the species,

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.536
in particular the bigeye,
was under serious threat.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.936
The yellowfin was also heavily fished.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.696
Skipjack remains healthy.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.496
And so we had to do something like that,
and so that was the reason I did that.
