what are your options
as a country, as a nation?

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.176
AT: Well, I've been telling
this story every year.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.629
I think I visit a number of --

00:06:04.653 --> 00:06:09.616
I've been traveling the world
to try and get people to understand.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.096
We have a plan, we think we have a plan.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.536
And on one occasion,
I think I spoke in Geneva

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.736
and there was a gentleman
who was interviewing me

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.496
on something like this,

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.856
and I said, "We are looking
at floating islands,"

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.096
and he thought it was funny,
but somebody said,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.056
"No, this is not funny.
These people are looking for solutions."
