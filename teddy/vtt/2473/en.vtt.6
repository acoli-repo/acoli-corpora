00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.376
sea levels are forecast to rise
perhaps three feet.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.020
There's scenarios where
it's higher than that, for sure,

00:03:05.044 --> 00:03:07.180
but what would you say
to a skeptic who said,

00:03:07.204 --> 00:03:08.376
"What's three feet?

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.576
You're on average
six feet above sea level.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.176
What's the problem?"

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.256
AT: Well, I think
it's got to be understood

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.336
that a marginal rise in sea level

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.936
would mean a loss of a lot of land,

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.216
because much of the land is low.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.336
And quite apart from that,
we are getting the swells at the moment.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.536
So it's not about getting two feet.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.576
I think what many people do not understand
