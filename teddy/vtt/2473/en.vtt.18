I spoke in our language, and of course
they spoke back, they replied,

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:05.416
but their accent, they are beginning
not to be able to speak Kiribati properly.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.936
I saw them, there was
this lady with red teeth.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.176
She was chewing betel nuts,

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.456
and it's not something we do in Kiribati.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.096
We don't chew betel nuts.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.976
I met also a family who have married
the local people here,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.096
and so this is what is happening.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.696
As you go into another community,
there are bound to be changes.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.176
There is bound to be
a certain loss of identity,
