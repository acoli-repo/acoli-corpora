00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.855
and on average about
two meters above sea level.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.336
And so this is what we have.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.176
Usually not more
than two kilometers in width.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.136
And so, on many occasions,
I've been asked by people,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.696
"You know, you're suffering,
why don't you move back?"

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.936
They don't understand.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.656
They have no concept
of what it is that's involved.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.256
With the rising sea, they say,
"Well, you can move back."

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.856
And so this is what I tell them.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.216
If we move back, we will fall off
on the other side of the ocean. OK?
