00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.016
But Kiribati is comprised
of three groups of islands:

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.856
the Gilbert Group on the west,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.216
we have the Phoenix Islands in the middle,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.656
and the Line Islands in the east.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.776
And quite frankly, Kiribati
is perhaps the only country

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.141
that is actually
in the four corners of the world,

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:50.465
because we are in the Northern Hemisphere,
in the Southern Hemisphere,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.545
and also in the east and the west
of the International Date Line.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.896
These islands are entirely
made up of coral atolls,

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.855
and on average about
two meters above sea level.
