00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.776
which made a categorical statement
that it is real, it's human-induced,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.736
and it's predicting
some very serious scenarios

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.296
for countries like mine.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.576
And so that's when I got very serious.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.576
In the past, I talked about it.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.816
We were worried.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.576
But when the scenarios,
the predictions came in 2007,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.936
it became a real issue for us.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.576
CA: Now, those predictions are,
I think, that by 2100,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.376
sea levels are forecast to rise
perhaps three feet.
