00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.896
and all of Tuvalu was underwater
when Hurricane Pam struck.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.616
But for our two southernmost islands,

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.976
we had waves come over half the island,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.456
and so this has never happened before.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.056
It's a new experience.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.416
And I've just come back
from my own constituency,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.776
and I've seen these beautiful trees
which had been there for decades,

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.776
they've been totally destroyed.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.496
So this is what's happening,

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.376
but when we talk
about the rising sea level,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.496
we think it's something
that happens gradually.
