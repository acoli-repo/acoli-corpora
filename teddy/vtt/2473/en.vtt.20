Nobody wants ever to leave their home,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.536
and so it's been
a very difficult decision for me.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.936
As a leader, you don't make plans
to leave your island, your home,

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.216
and so I've been asked
on a number of occasions,

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.456
"So how do you feel?"

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.616
And it doesn't feel good at all.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.216
It's an emotional thing,
and I've tried to live with it,

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:26.176
and I know that on occasions, I'm accused
of not trying to solve the problem

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.176
because I can't solve the problem.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.016
It's something that's got
to be done collectively.
