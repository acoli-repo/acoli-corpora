I began talking about climate change
at the United Nations General Assembly,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.216
but not with so much passion,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.856
because then there was still
this controversy among the scientists

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.136
whether it was human-induced,
whether it was real or it wasn't.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.296
But I think that that debate
was fairly much concluded in 2007

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.896
with the Fourth Assessment
Report of the IPCC,

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.776
which made a categorical statement
that it is real, it's human-induced,
