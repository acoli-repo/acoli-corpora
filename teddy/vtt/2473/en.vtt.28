00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.496
And so we had to do something like that,
and so that was the reason I did that.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.416
Another reason why I did that

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:12.136
was because I had been asking
the international community

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.696
that in order to deal with climate change,
in order to fight climate change,

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:20.616
there has got to be sacrifice,
there has got to be commitment.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.936
So in asking the international community
to make a sacrifice,

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.776
I thought we ourselves
need to make that sacrifice.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.616
And so we made the sacrifice.
