00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.736
We want to be able
to give the people the choice today,

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.416
those who choose
and want to do that, to migrate.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.496
We don't want something to happen
that they are forced to migrate

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.816
without having been prepared to do so.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.336
Of course, our culture is very different,
our society is very different,

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.696
and once we migrate
into a different environment,

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.936
a different culture,

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.896
there's a whole lot
of adjustments that are required.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.176
CA: Well, there's forced migration
in your country's past,

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.856
and I think just this week,

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.136
just yesterday
or the day before yesterday,
