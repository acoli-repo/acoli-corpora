It's something that's got
to be done collectively.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:36.816
Climate change is a global phenomenon,
and as I've often argued,

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.336
unfortunately, the countries,
when we come to the United Nations --

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.256
I was in a meeting with
the Pacific Island Forum countries

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.776
where Australia and New Zealand
are also members,

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.536
and we had an argument.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.256
There was a bit of a story in the news

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.576
because they were arguing
that to cut emissions,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.856
it would be something
that they're unable to do

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.096
because it would affect the industries.
