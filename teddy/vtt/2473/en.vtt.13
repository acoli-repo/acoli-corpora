"No, this is not funny.
These people are looking for solutions."

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.616
And so I have been looking
at floating islands.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.376
The Japanese are interested
in building floating islands.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.336
But, as a country,
we have made a commitment

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.056
that no matter what happens,
we will try as much as possible

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.256
to stay and continue to exist as a nation.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.816
What that will take,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.256
it's going to be
something quite significant,

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.296
very, very substantial.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.096
Either we live on floating islands,

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.096
or we have to build up the islands
to continue to stay out of the water
