00:02:58.827 --> 00:03:00.642
such as woodblock prints,

00:03:00.642 --> 00:03:02.376
as well as live performance.

00:03:02.376 --> 00:03:05.497
After 1868, others such as Vincent van Gogh

00:03:05.497 --> 00:03:07.571
and composer Claude Debussy

00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:10.509
began to incorporate Kabuki influences in their work,

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:12.051
while Kabuki itself underwent

00:03:12.051 --> 00:03:13.940
much change and experimentation

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.163
to adapt to the new modern era.

00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:17.892
Like other traditional art forms,

00:03:17.892 --> 00:03:19.618
Kabuki suffered in popularity

00:03:19.618 --> 00:03:21.411
in the wake of World War II.

00:03:21.411 --> 00:03:22.823
But innovation by artists

00:03:22.823 --> 00:03:25.075
such as director Tetsuji Takechi

00:03:25.075 --> 00:03:27.867
led to a resurgence shortly after.

00:03:27.867 --> 00:03:29.761
Indeed, Kabuki was even considered

00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:31.332
a popular form of entertainment
