00:01:58.577 --> 00:02:00.548
for those playing female roles,

00:02:00.548 --> 00:02:01.836
or onnagata.

00:02:01.836 --> 00:02:03.885
Attempts by the government to control Kabuki

00:02:03.885 --> 00:02:05.754
didn't end with bans on the gender

00:02:05.754 --> 00:02:07.599
or age of performers.

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:09.384
The Tokugawa military group,

00:02:09.384 --> 00:02:10.595
or Bakufu,

00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:12.553
was fueled by Confucian ideals

00:02:12.553 --> 00:02:14.100
and often enacted sanctions

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.440
on costume fabrics,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.517
stage weaponry,

00:02:16.517 --> 00:02:18.605
and the subject matter of the plot.

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:19.552
At the same time,

00:02:19.552 --> 00:02:21.517
Kabuki became closely associated with

00:02:21.517 --> 00:02:23.546
and influenced by Bunraku,

00:02:23.546 --> 00:02:26.170
an elaborate form of puppet theater.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.712
Due to these influences,

00:02:27.712 --> 00:02:29.964
the once spontaneous, one-act dance

00:02:29.964 --> 00:02:33.121
evolved into a structured, five-act play
