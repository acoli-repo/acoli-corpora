Once forensic scientists
come up with this genetic profile,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.576
they enter it into CODIS,
hopefully have a match.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.896
CODIS is filled with DNA profiles
of people who are arrested

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.440
and/or convicted
of certain prescribed offenses.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.856
If in fact a profile is made
and entered into CODIS,

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.120
it can help identify a perpetrator
in the matter of minutes.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.800
CODIS stands for
Combined DNA Index System.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.360
Now, how did we get here?
