00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.360
Now, how did we get here?

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.720
Detroit had no money.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.576
It cost, at that time
that these kits were found,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.576
up to 1,500 dollars per kit
to have it tested.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.336
So, you do the math
about how much that was going to cost.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.616
In addition to that,

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.416
within four years of these kits
being found in 2009,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.056
Detroit would be the largest municipality
in the history of the United States

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.480
to declare bankruptcy.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.936
We didn't know what we were going to do.
