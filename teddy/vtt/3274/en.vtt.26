00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.376
We still have a lot of work to do

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.616
in terms of investigation
and prosecution of those cases,

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.656
but our rape kit issue,
in terms of testing, is done.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.760
As of June 28, 2018,

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:20.200
our CODIS hits have showed us
and identified 2,600 suspects.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:28.120
We have identified 861 serial rapists.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.056
Just within this project.
