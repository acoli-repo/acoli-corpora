00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.496
We launched -- we, we --

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.536
UPS and the prosecutor's office --

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.776
(Laughter)

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.840
launched this pilot program in Detroit.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:16.576
And we started this process
on January 28, 2015,

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:21.056
through to May 25 of 2016.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.696
And during that period of time --

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.136
remember, we're not dealing
with the ones we found,

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.976
because they'd already been stored --

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.696
we're dealing with any new kit
that came in as of January 28, 2015.
