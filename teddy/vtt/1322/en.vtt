"Even in purely nonreligious terms,

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.446
homosexuality represents
a misuse of the sexual faculty.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.691
It is a pathetic little second-rate
substitute for reality --

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:17.661
a pitiable flight from life.

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:21.913
As such, it deserves no compassion,

00:00:21.937 --> 00:00:27.119
it deserves no treatment
as minority martyrdom,

00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:33.083
and it deserves not to be deemed
anything but a pernicious sickness."
