00:03:25.945 --> 00:03:31.647
The Normans were also central 
to the First Crusade of 1095-99,

00:03:31.647 --> 00:03:35.222
a bloody conflict that re-established
Christian control

00:03:35.222 --> 00:03:37.756
in certain parts of the Middle East.

00:03:37.756 --> 00:03:41.190
But the Normans did more than just fight.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.067
As a result of their victories,

00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:46.726
leaders like William Iron-Arm 
and Robert the Crafty

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.348
secured lands throughout Southern Italy,

00:03:49.348 --> 00:03:54.772
eventually merging them
to form the Kingdom of Sicily in 1130.

00:03:54.772 --> 00:03:56.260
Under Roger II,

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.509
the kingdom became a beacon of
multicultural tolerance

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:03.189
in a world torn apart 
by religious and civil wars.
