00:00:57.144 --> 00:01:00.043
Eventually, Charles, 
the king of the Franks,

00:01:00.043 --> 00:01:04.522
negotiated peace with 
the Viking leader Rollo in 911,

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:08.675
granting him a stretch of land 
along France’s northern coast

00:01:08.675 --> 00:01:11.654
that came to be known as Normandy.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:15.264
The Normans proved adaptable
to their newly settled life.

00:01:15.264 --> 00:01:17.053
They married Frankish women,

00:01:17.053 --> 00:01:18.680
adopted the French language,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.945
and soon started converting 
from Norse paganism to Christianity.

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:24.714
But though they adapted,

00:01:24.714 --> 00:01:26.936
they maintained the warrior tradition

00:01:26.936 --> 00:01:30.116
and conquering spirit 
of their Viking forebears.
