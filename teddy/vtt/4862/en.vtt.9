00:04:25.822 --> 00:04:30.326
And the churches built in Palermo
combined Latin-style architecture,

00:04:30.326 --> 00:04:31.713
Arab ceilings,

00:04:31.713 --> 00:04:33.669
and Byzantine domes,

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.522

00:04:41.292 --> 00:04:44.689
In fact, this was a key part of
their success:

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:47.541

And today, from the castles and
cathedrals that dot Europe’s landscape

00:04:59.805 --> 00:05:02.618
to wherever 
the English language is spoken,
