00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:08.455
In the year 1066,

00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:15.043
7000 Norman infantry and knights sailed 
in warships across the English Channel.

00:00:15.043 --> 00:00:19.076
Their target: England, 
home to more than a million people.

00:00:19.076 --> 00:00:23.077
Theirs was a short voyage
with massive consequences.

00:00:23.077 --> 00:00:25.206
And around the same period of time,

00:00:25.206 --> 00:00:29.368
other groups of Normans
were setting forth all across Europe,

00:00:29.368 --> 00:00:33.699
going on adventures that would reverberate
throughout that continentâ€™s history.
