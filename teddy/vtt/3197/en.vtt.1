How are we going to correct these wrongs?

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.560
How are we going
to choose the right course?

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.640
It's not going to be easy.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.880
For years, I've worked with talented teams

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.736
and they've chosen the right objectives
and the wrong objectives.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.376
Many have succeeded,
others of them have failed.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.616
And today I'm going to share with you

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.936
what really makes a difference --

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.376
that's what's crucial,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.936
how and why

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.496
they set meaningful and audacious goals,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.160
the right goals for the right reasons.
