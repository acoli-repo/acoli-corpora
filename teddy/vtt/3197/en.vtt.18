00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.200
Somewhat better.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.000
In the third year,

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.936
he upped the ante once more
to a hundred million.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.416
He launched an aggressive
marketing campaign,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.896
broader distribution,
improved the technology, and kaboom!

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.360
He got 111 million users.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.456
Here's why I like this story,

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.296
not so much for the happy ending,

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.336
but it shows someone
carefully choosing the right objective

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.480
and then sticking to it
year after year after year.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.320
It's a perfect story for a nerd like me.
