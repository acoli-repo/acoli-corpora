And these are not used
for bonuses or for promotions.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.696
They're set aside.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.456
They're used for a higher purpose,

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.576
and that's to get collective commitment

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.080
to truly stretch goals.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:14.456
In 2008, a Googler, Sundar Pichai,
took on an objective

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.776
which was to build
the next generation client platform

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.640

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.320
in other words, build the best browser.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.360
He was very thoughtful
about how he chose his key results.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.656
How do you measure the best browser?

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.776
It could be ad clicks or engagement.
