00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.800
We're at a critical moment.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.856
Our leaders,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.936
some of our great institutions

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.160
are failing us.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.440
Why?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.536
In some cases, it's because they're bad

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.760
or unethical,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.440
but often, they've taken us
to the wrong objectives.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.720
And this is unacceptable.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.680
This has to stop.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.200
How are we going to correct these wrongs?
