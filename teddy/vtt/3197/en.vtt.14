00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.056
So with Jini we've covered the whys,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.896
with Bono the whats of goal-setting.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.456
Let's turn our attention to the hows.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.696
Remember, the hows are the key results.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.056
That's how we meet our objectives.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.656
And good results
are specific and time-bound.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.656
They're aggressive but realistic.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.736
They're measurable,
and they're verifiable.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.320
Those are good key results.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:25.256
In 1999, I introduced OKRs
to Google's cofounders,

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.536
Larry and Sergey.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.896
Here they are,
24 years old in their garage.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.360
And Sergey enthusiastically
said he'd adopt them.
