00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.856
Because truly transformational teams

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.056
combine their ambitions
to their passion and to their purpose,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.880
and they develop a clear
and compelling sense of why.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.566
I want to tell you a story.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.496
I work with a remarkable entrepreneur.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.000
Her name is Jini Kim.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.400
She runs a company called Nuna.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.680
Nuna is a health care data company.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.616
And when Nuna was founded,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.320
they used data to serve the health needs
of lots of workers at large companies.
