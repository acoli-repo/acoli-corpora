00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.160
the right goals for the right reasons.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.896
Let's go back to 1975.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.536
Yep, this is me.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.896
I've got a lot to learn,
I'm a computer engineer,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.176
I've got long hair,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.120
but I'm working under Andy Grove,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.496
who's been called the greatest manager
of his or any other era.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.496
Andy was a superb leader
and also a teacher,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.840
and he said to me, "John,
it almost doesn't matter what you know.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.776
Execution is what matters the most."

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.536
And so Andy invented a system
called "Objectives and Key Results."
