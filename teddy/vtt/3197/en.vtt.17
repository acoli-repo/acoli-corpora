It could be ad clicks or engagement.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.456
No. He said: numbers of users,

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.535
because users are going to decide

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.976
if Chrome is a great browser or not.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.576
So he had this one
three-year-long objective:

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.856
build the best browser.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.856
And then every year
he stuck to the same key results,

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.816
numbers of users, but he upped the ante.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.096
In the first year,
his goal was 20 million users

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.656
and he missed it.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.936
He got less than 10.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.776
Second year, he raised
the bar to 50 million.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.936
He got to 37 million users.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.200
Somewhat better.
