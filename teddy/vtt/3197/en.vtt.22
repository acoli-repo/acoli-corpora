00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.136
but I want you
to join me in this movement.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.736
Let's fight for what it is
that really matters,

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.256
because we can take OKRs
beyond our businesses.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.216
We can take them to our families,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.496
to our schools,

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.920
even to our governments.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.896
We can hold those governments accountable.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.635
We can transform those informations.

00:11:16.659 --> 00:11:19.739
We can get back on the right track

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:29.400
if we can and do measure
what really matters.
