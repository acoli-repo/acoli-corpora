00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.976
ubiquitous computing,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.576
affordable health care,
high-quality for everyone,

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.256
ending global poverty,

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.200
access to all the world's information.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.336

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.216

the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.536
for spreading the good gospel
according to Andy Grove,

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.136
but I want you
to join me in this movement.
