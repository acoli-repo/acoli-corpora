00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.536
and they had a whole set of commitments
that they had to honor,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.920
and frankly, they weren't going to make
very much money on the project.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.976
This was a bet-your-company moment,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.416
and Jini seized it.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.360
She jumped at the opportunity.
She did not flinch.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.000
Why?

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.696
Well, it's a personal why.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.720
Jini's younger brother Kimong has autism.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.296
And when he was seven,

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.576
he had his first grand mal seizure

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.816
at Disneyland.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.296
He fell to the ground.
He stopped breathing.
