00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.440
they are inspiring,

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.960
and they're a kind of vaccine
against fuzzy thinking.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.056
You think a rockstar

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.616
would be an unlikely user
of Objectives and Key Results,

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.456
but for years, Bono has used OKRs

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.776
to wage a global war
against poverty and disease,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.016
and his ONE organization
has focused on two really gorgeous,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.856
audacious objectives.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.176
The first is debt relief

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.200
for the poorest countries in the world.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.896
The next is universal access
to anti-HIV drugs.
