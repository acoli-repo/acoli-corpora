(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid
saved my family from bankruptcy,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.200
and today it provides for Kimong's health
and for millions of others.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.376
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.216
Every row of data is a life

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.480
whose story deserves
to be told with dignity.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.696
JD: And Jini's story tells us

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.696
that a compelling sense of why

Remember, that's what
we want to have accomplished.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.536
And objectives are significant,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.456
they're action-oriented,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.440
they are inspiring,
