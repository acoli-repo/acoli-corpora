It's a perfect story for a nerd like me.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.816
Now, I think of OKRs
as transparent vessels

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.840
that are made from the whats
and hows of our ambitions.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:46.176
What really matters is the why
that we pour into those vessels.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.840
That's why we do our work.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.240
OKRs are not a silver bullet.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.016
They're not going to be
a substitute for a strong culture

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.936
or for stronger leadership,

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.680
but when those fundamentals are in place,
they can take you to the mountaintop.
