Jini's parents are Korean immigrants.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.416
They came to the country
with limited resources

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.296
speaking little English,

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.320
so it was up to Jini
to enroll her family in Medicaid.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.800
She was nine years old.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.376
That moment defined her mission,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.096
and that mission became her company,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.360
and that company bid on, won
and delivered on that contract.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.816
