00:00:00.476 --> 00:00:01.627
I do two things:

00:00:01.651 --> 00:00:03.769
I design mobile computers
and I study brains.

00:00:03.793 --> 00:00:06.723
Today's talk is about brains
and -- (Audience member cheers)

00:00:06.747 --> 00:00:08.564
Yay! I have a brain fan out there.

00:00:08.588 --> 00:00:11.735
(Laughter)

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.314
If I could have my first slide,

00:00:13.338 --> 00:00:16.187
you'll see the title of my talk
and my two affiliations.

00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:19.679
So what I'm going to talk about is why
we don't have a good brain theory,

00:00:19.703 --> 00:00:21.980
why it is important
that we should develop one

00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:23.487
and what we can do about it.

00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:25.335
I'll try to do all that in 20 minutes.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.510
I have two affiliations.

00:00:26.534 --> 00:00:29.066
Most of you know me
from my Palm and Handspring days,

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.773
but I also run a nonprofit
scientific research institute
