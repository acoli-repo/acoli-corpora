00:02:57.245 --> 00:03:00.077
but there's still less than a second of latency,

00:03:00.077 --> 00:03:02.156
but in musical terms, that's a lifetime.

00:03:02.156 --> 00:03:03.608
We deal in milliseconds.

00:03:03.608 --> 00:03:06.075
So what I've done is, I've adapted "Cloudburst"

00:03:06.075 --> 00:03:08.578
so that it embraces the latency

00:03:08.578 --> 00:03:11.483
and the performers sing into the latency

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.981
instead of trying to be exactly together.

00:03:13.981 --> 00:03:17.245
So with deep humility, and for your approval,

00:03:17.245 --> 00:03:19.357
we present "Cloudburst."

00:03:19.357 --> 00:03:24.076
