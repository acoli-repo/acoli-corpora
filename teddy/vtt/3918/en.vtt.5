00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.421
The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage.

00:02:31.421 --> 00:02:33.917
I'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach,

00:02:33.917 --> 00:02:37.245
Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College,

00:02:37.245 --> 00:02:40.565
some of the best amateur choirs in the country, and —

00:02:40.565 --> 00:02:47.603
(Applause) --

00:02:47.603 --> 00:02:49.789
and in the second half of the piece,

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:52.611
the virtual choir will join us, 30 different singers

00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:54.661
from 30 different countries.

00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:57.245
Now, we've pushed the technology as far as it can go,

00:02:57.245 --> 00:03:00.077
but there's still less than a second of latency,
