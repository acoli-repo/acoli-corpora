WEBVTT

00:01:55.253 --> 00:02:01.517
this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries.

00:02:01.517 --> 00:02:06.936
(Music)

00:02:06.936 --> 00:02:09.943
And when I was speaking to Chris about the future

00:02:09.943 --> 00:02:12.093
of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this,

00:02:12.093 --> 00:02:16.854
he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could.

00:02:16.854 --> 00:02:19.357
Could we do this all in real time?

00:02:19.357 --> 00:02:22.397
Could we have people singing together in real time?

00:02:22.397 --> 00:02:23.992
And with the help of Skype,

00:02:23.992 --> 00:02:26.096
that is what we are going to attempt today.

00:02:26.096 --> 00:02:28.269
Now, we'll perform "Cloudburst" for you.

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.421
The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage.
