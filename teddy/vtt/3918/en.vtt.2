00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.469
It was just extraordinary, and when I came back home

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.472
I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz,

00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:05.973
and decided to set it to music,

00:01:05.973 --> 00:01:08.154
a piece for choir called "Cloudburst,"

00:01:08.154 --> 00:01:11.317
which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment.

00:01:11.317 --> 00:01:15.692
Now fast forward to just three years ago.

00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:19.133
(Music) And we released to YouTube this,

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.389
the Virtual Choir Project,

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:24.596
185 singers from 12 different countries.

00:01:24.596 --> 00:01:28.033
You can see my little video there conducting these people,

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:29.188
alone in their dorm rooms

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:32.277
or in their living rooms at home.
