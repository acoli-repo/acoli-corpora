00:04:56.875 --> 00:05:00.541
So I decided to ask Jose
if Thursdays around 2pm,

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.258
Ivan could come and help him arrange
the water bottles on the shelves,

00:05:05.282 --> 00:05:07.597
because he loved to organize things.

00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:11.387
And as a reward, he could buy
some chocolate cookies,

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:13.157
which were his favorite.

00:05:15.843 --> 00:05:17.343
He said "yes" right away.

00:05:18.815 --> 00:05:22.057
So that's how it went for a year:

00:05:22.081 --> 00:05:24.371
Ivan would go to Jose's greengrocer,

00:05:25.312 --> 00:05:28.756
help him arrange the shelves
of water bottles

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.043
with the labels perfectly
lined up on the same side,
