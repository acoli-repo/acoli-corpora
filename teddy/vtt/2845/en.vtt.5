00:02:27.761 --> 00:02:31.061
on a rainy winter day,

00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:33.561
I was taking him to an indoor pool,

00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:36.235
because even on rainy days
we'd go swimming.

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:41.511
We were on the highway,
and I took the wrong exit.

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:46.237
He burst into tears and cried
inconsolably, nonstop,

00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:47.781
until I turned back.

00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:50.158
Only then did he calm down.

00:02:51.528 --> 00:02:55.224
How was it possible
that a two and a half year old

00:02:55.248 --> 00:02:57.055
didn't respond to his own name,

00:02:57.851 --> 00:03:01.975
yet in the middle of the rain and fog,
where I couldn't see anything,
