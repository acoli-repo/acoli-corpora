"Look at me!"

00:00:04.676 --> 00:00:09.301
That phrase turned me
into an eye-contact coach.

00:00:10.795 --> 00:00:13.739
I'm the mother of Ivan; he's 15 years old.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.463
Ivan has autism,

00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:18.032
he doesn't speak,

00:00:18.056 --> 00:00:20.046
and he communicates through an iPad,

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.942
where his whole universe of words
exists in images.

00:00:25.947 --> 00:00:30.489
He was diagnosed
when he was two and a half.
