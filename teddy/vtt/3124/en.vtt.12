00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.514
to try and figure out
what was happening there.

00:06:00.538 --> 00:06:02.673
There are stories of fishermen in Mexico,

00:06:02.697 --> 00:06:05.418
who used the robot to create
marine protected areas

00:06:05.442 --> 00:06:10.283
where Nassau grouper were spawning,
to protect the future of this species.

00:06:10.307 --> 00:06:11.831
It's really amazing stuff.

00:06:11.855 --> 00:06:14.799
We found that if you give
people the tools,

00:06:14.823 --> 00:06:16.513
they'll do the right thing.

00:06:19.291 --> 00:06:21.196
But we need to take it a step further.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.125
And, actually, I think we can dust off
Stephen Mather's playbook.

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:26.350
So what did he do?

00:06:26.374 --> 00:06:29.918
So, the first thing that he did
was he focused on infrastructure.

00:06:29.942 --> 00:06:32.704
So 1914 wasn't just
a time for the parks,
