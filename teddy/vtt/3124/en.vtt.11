00:05:28.904 --> 00:05:32.838
these little swimming cameras
with lights that you can see underwater.

00:05:32.862 --> 00:05:35.544
We started building these
in his garage five years ago,

00:05:35.568 --> 00:05:36.908
and we've watched that grow

00:05:36.932 --> 00:05:40.283
into this community of thousands
of people around the world,

00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:43.220
who believe that everybody
should have access to these places.

00:05:43.244 --> 00:05:45.720
We all deserve the tools
to go and explore.

00:05:46.076 --> 00:05:47.668
There's stories like Laura James,

00:05:47.692 --> 00:05:51.188
who used her robot to find out that
sea stars in her area were dying.

00:05:51.212 --> 00:05:54.299
And she started this whole
citizen science campaign,

00:05:54.323 --> 00:05:57.466
collected data and drove awareness
for sea-star wasting syndrome,

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.514
to try and figure out
what was happening there.
