00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.213
And he created dozens of national parks,

00:02:03.237 --> 00:02:07.164
hundreds of thousands of square acres
of national wildlife refuges.

00:02:07.188 --> 00:02:11.839
It was an important administration,
but it wasn't a done deal.

00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:17.561
Even less than 10 years
after he created all of those new places,

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:20.220
the future of those places
was very much in doubt.

00:02:20.847 --> 00:02:23.994

Stephen Mather,

00:02:24.018 --> 00:02:25.633
a businessman from Chicago,

00:02:25.657 --> 00:02:28.879
wrote an angry letter
to the Department of the Interior, saying,

00:02:28.903 --> 00:02:33.227
"You guys aren't doing a good enough job
protecting and preserving these places."
