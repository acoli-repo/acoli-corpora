And to really appreciate
just how prescient that idea was,

00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:06.458
you have to go back

00:01:06.482 --> 00:01:09.648
and you have to look at the history
of the National Parks Service.

00:01:09.672 --> 00:01:14.219
So, a lot of people know, the first
national park was Yellowstone, in 1872.

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.783
A lot of people think of John Muir,
the poet, naturalist,

00:01:17.807 --> 00:01:19.342
who was such a visionary

00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:22.783
in getting people inspired
by the idea of conservation --

00:01:22.807 --> 00:01:26.522
that we need to take
the best places and protect them.

00:01:26.546 --> 00:01:29.291
He had an audience in very high places --

00:01:29.315 --> 00:01:32.459
there's a great story
of Teddy Roosevelt and John Muir
