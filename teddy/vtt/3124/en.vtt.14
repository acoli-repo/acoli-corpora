00:06:59.356 --> 00:07:01.849
So that was a really insightful
idea that he had.

00:07:02.474 --> 00:07:03.934
The second thing they did,

00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:06.006
was they focused
on visionary philanthropy.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.617
So, Stephen Mather was a successful
businessman from Chicago,

00:07:09.641 --> 00:07:12.849
and anytime there was
a parks association that needed funding,

00:07:12.873 --> 00:07:15.730
anytime there was a highway
association that needed funding,

00:07:15.754 --> 00:07:18.071
they'd step in, write
the checks, make it happen.

00:07:18.095 --> 00:07:20.453
There's a great story
of his friend William Kent,

00:07:20.477 --> 00:07:25.409
who recognized there was a small patch
of redwoods left on the base of Mount Tam,

00:07:25.433 --> 00:07:27.093
and so he quickly bought the land

00:07:27.117 --> 00:07:29.346
and donated it
to this National Parks effort.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.695
That's Muir Woods today --
