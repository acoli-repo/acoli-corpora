That's Muir Woods today --

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:33.822
it's one of the most popular
national parks in the whole country.

00:07:33.846 --> 00:07:36.128
My parents are visiting here
from Minnesota,

00:07:36.152 --> 00:07:38.421
and they don't really even
care about this talk,

00:07:38.445 --> 00:07:40.806
all they're talking about
is going to Muir Woods.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.881
(Laughter)

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:45.299
But the last thing is critical --

00:07:45.323 --> 00:07:47.728
Stephen Mather focused on engagement.

00:07:47.752 --> 00:07:52.220
In one of the first meetings that they had
around this new system, he said,

00:07:52.244 --> 00:07:54.712
"If you're a writer,
I want you to write about this.

00:07:54.736 --> 00:07:58.601
If you're a business owner, I want you
to tell your clubs and your organizations.

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:01.611
If you work for the government,
I want you to pass regulation."
