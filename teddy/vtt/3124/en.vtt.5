"You guys aren't doing a good enough job
protecting and preserving these places."

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:35.363
Then, something was done about it.

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:37.553
The Department of the Interior
wrote him back.

00:02:37.577 --> 00:02:40.014
"Mr. Mather, if you care
so much about this,

00:02:40.038 --> 00:02:42.982

and do it yourself?"

00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:44.117

00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:45.918

00:02:45.942 --> 00:02:48.204
He took a job at the Department
of the Interior,

00:02:48.228 --> 00:02:51.784

00:02:52.304 --> 00:02:57.082
He actually had a meeting

00:02:57.106 --> 00:02:58.439
in California Hall,

00:02:58.463 --> 00:03:01.845
and he brought together the park
superintendents and a few other people
