00:11:29.974 --> 00:11:31.832
putting all of the progress we've made,

00:11:31.856 --> 00:11:35.138
all of these new marine protected
areas, under review,

00:11:35.162 --> 00:11:38.749
there were over 100,000 people
who commented online.

00:11:39.845 --> 00:11:42.448
Almost all of these letters were saying,

00:11:42.472 --> 00:11:46.805
"Don't do it; protecting these places
is the right thing to do."

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:51.728
My message to those 100,000 people,
those 100,000 letters is:

00:11:51.752 --> 00:11:53.442
don't wait for Washington.

00:11:53.466 --> 00:11:55.093
We can do this ourselves.

00:11:55.117 --> 00:11:56.291
Thank you.

00:11:56.315 --> 00:12:00.497
