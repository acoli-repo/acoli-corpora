But like Mather, we should focus
on the technology of our time,

00:08:33.331 --> 00:08:36.168
all of this new, amazing,
digital infrastructure

00:08:36.192 --> 00:08:39.404
can be built to engage people
with the oceans.

00:08:39.751 --> 00:08:44.133
So, the National Marine Sanctuary

00:08:44.157 --> 00:08:47.863
has created all these
wonderful VR 360 videos,

00:08:47.887 --> 00:08:51.021
where you can actually go
and see what these places look like.

00:08:51.395 --> 00:08:53.850
Our team is continuing to build new tools,

00:08:53.874 --> 00:08:56.729
this is our latest, this is
the trident underwater drone,

00:08:56.753 --> 00:09:00.348
it's a diving submarine, it's sleek,
you can fit it in a backpack,
