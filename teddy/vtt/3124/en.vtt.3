there's a great story
of Teddy Roosevelt and John Muir

00:01:32.483 --> 00:01:35.737
going hiking, in Yosemite,
during his presidency,

00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:39.014
four days, completely off the grid,
just the two of them.

00:01:39.038 --> 00:01:41.111
Can you imagine a president

00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:43.894
actually just going completely
off the grid for four days?

00:01:44.284 --> 00:01:45.609
(Laughter)

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:46.791
No tweeting.

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:50.609
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:51.881
Like that idea.

00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:52.905
(Applause)

00:01:54.625 --> 00:02:00.545
But he had a great impact
on Theodore Roosevelt.
