And now the administration is proposing
to roll back a lot of the progress

00:05:01.854 --> 00:05:03.780
we've made in the past 20 years.

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.568
So, so, don't mourn -- organize.

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:11.722
We need to do what
Stephen Mather did 100 years ago.

00:05:11.746 --> 00:05:16.049
We need to start a campaign
to get people engaged with this idea.

00:05:16.365 --> 00:05:20.745
And I think we need a league
of citizen scientists for the ocean.

00:05:21.486 --> 00:05:25.351
And I've seen glimpses of this future,
and I know that it's possible.

00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:28.880
My friend Erik and I started building
underwater robots,

00:05:28.904 --> 00:05:32.838
these little swimming cameras
with lights that you can see underwater.
