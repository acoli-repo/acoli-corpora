00:00:00.762 --> 00:00:04.301
So, of all my childhood memories,

00:00:04.325 --> 00:00:07.317
there is one that stands above the rest.

00:00:07.698 --> 00:00:10.958
And that is the time that my brave parents

00:00:10.982 --> 00:00:13.799
rented an RV, packed it
with me and my brothers,

00:00:13.823 --> 00:00:16.172
and drove west
from our house in Minneapolis,

00:00:16.196 --> 00:00:18.463
out to Yellowstone National Park.

00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:22.737
We saw all the sights, like the geysers,
we stopped at the Badlands,

00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:27.347
but more than any of the places,
I remember this as an adventure.

00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:31.157
This was my introduction to the Wild West.
