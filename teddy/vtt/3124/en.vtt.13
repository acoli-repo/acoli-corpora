00:06:29.942 --> 00:06:32.704
So 1914 wasn't just
a time for the parks,

00:06:32.728 --> 00:06:34.943
it was also a time for the automobile,

00:06:34.967 --> 00:06:36.983
the Model T was rolling off the line,

00:06:37.007 --> 00:06:39.188
and Stephen Mather understood

00:06:39.212 --> 00:06:42.220
that this was going to be
an important part of American culture.

00:06:42.244 --> 00:06:45.363
And so he partnered with highway
associations around the country

00:06:45.387 --> 00:06:48.871
to build big, beautiful highways
out to these parks.

00:06:48.895 --> 00:06:52.349
And it worked, he's basically
invented car camping.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.252
And he knew that if people
didn't go to these places,

00:06:56.276 --> 00:06:59.332
that they wouldn’t fall in love with them
and they wouldn't care.

00:06:59.356 --> 00:07:01.849
So that was a really insightful
idea that he had.
