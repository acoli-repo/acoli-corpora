and he brought together the park
superintendents and a few other people

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:04.669
who cared about this idea of conservation.

00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:09.537
And they put together a plan,
they hatched a campaign

00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:14.006
that eventually led to the
National Park Service in 1916.

00:03:14.744 --> 00:03:16.078
And that's really important.

00:03:16.102 --> 00:03:20.103
Because it went from an idea
that we should protect these places

00:03:20.127 --> 00:03:21.619
to an actual plan,

00:03:21.643 --> 00:03:25.683
a way for people to enlist
and carry that idea forward

00:03:25.707 --> 00:03:26.981
for future generations,

00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:31.045
so little kids like me can go
and have these amazing experiences.
