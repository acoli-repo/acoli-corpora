finding other people who think,

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:31.849
"Yeah, that's a good idea.

00:09:31.873 --> 00:09:33.378
I want to be a part of that."

00:09:33.712 --> 00:09:36.736
We need more ways for people
to get engaged

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.479
and become visionary
philanthropists themselves.

00:09:39.503 --> 00:09:41.516
We've also had
traditional philanthropists,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.885
who've stepped up to fund us

00:09:42.909 --> 00:09:46.131
in the SEE initiative --
the Science Education and Exploration,

00:09:46.155 --> 00:09:50.969
who are going to help us get donated
units out to people on the frontlines,

00:09:50.993 --> 00:09:54.255
people who are doing the science,
people who are telling the stories,

00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:55.715
inspiring communities.

00:09:55.739 --> 00:09:59.032
You can go on to OpenExplorer.com
and see what people are doing,

00:09:59.056 --> 00:10:01.104
it's hugely inspirational.
