WEBVTT

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.216
is being developed by companies

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.176
in the business of capturing
and selling our data and our attention

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.456
to advertisers and others:

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.896
Facebook, Google, Amazon,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.800
Alibaba, Tencent.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.536
Now, artificial intelligence has started
bolstering their business as well.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.656
And it may seem

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.536

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.776
It's not.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.256
It's a jump in category.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.856
It's a whole different world,
