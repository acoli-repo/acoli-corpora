00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.360
if you were shown
a cross section of my brain.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.936
It's like we're not programming anymore,

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.360
we're growing intelligence
that we don't truly understand.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.496
And these things only work
if there's an enormous amount of data,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.616
so they also encourage
deep surveillance on all of us

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.976
so that the machine learning
algorithms can work.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.176
That's why Facebook wants
to collect all the data it can about you.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.776
The algorithms work better.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.496
So let's push that Vegas example a bit.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.200
What if the system
that we do not understand
