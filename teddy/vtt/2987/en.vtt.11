When they learn this from existing data,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.136
they also learn
how to apply this to new people.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.216
So if they're presented with a new person,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.880
they can classify whether that person
is likely to buy a ticket to Vegas or not.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.176
Fine. You're thinking,
an offer to buy tickets to Vegas.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.656
I can ignore that.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.896
But the problem isn't that.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.496
The problem is,

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.656
we no longer really understand
how these complex algorithms work.
