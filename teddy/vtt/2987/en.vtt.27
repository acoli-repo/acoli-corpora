So in 2010, in the midterm elections,

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:39.936
Facebook did an experiment
on 61 million people in the US

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.856
that was disclosed after the fact.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.296
So some people were shown,
"Today is election day,"

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.696
the simpler one,

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.616
and some people were shown
the one with that tiny tweak

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.736
with those little thumbnails

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.600
of your friends who clicked on "I voted."

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.400
This simple tweak.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.816
OK? So the pictures were the only change,
