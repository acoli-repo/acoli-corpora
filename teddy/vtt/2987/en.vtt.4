We've all had the experience
of being followed on the web

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.056
by an ad based on something
we searched or read.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.936
You know, you look up a pair of boots

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.336
and for a week, those boots are following
you around everywhere you go.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.016
Even after you succumb and buy them,
they're still following you around.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.056
We're kind of inured to that kind
of basic, cheap manipulation.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.480
We roll our eyes and we think,
"You know what? These things don't work."

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.816
Except, online,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.440
the digital technologies are not just ads.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.360
Now, to understand that,
let's think of a physical world example.
