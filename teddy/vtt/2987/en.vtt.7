00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.696
and they can target, infer, understand

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.616
and be deployed at individuals

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.856
one by one

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.016
by figuring out your weaknesses,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.656
and they can be sent
to everyone's phone private screen,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.936
so it's not visible to us.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.216
And that's different.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.816
And that's just one of the basic things
that artificial intelligence can do.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.176
Now, let's take an example.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.896
Let's say you want to sell
plane tickets to Vegas. Right?

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.416
So in the old world, you could think
of some demographics to target
