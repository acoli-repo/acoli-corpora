00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.656
we no longer really understand
how these complex algorithms work.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.136
We don't understand
how they're doing this categorization.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.576
It's giant matrices,
thousands of rows and columns,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.560
maybe millions of rows and columns,

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.960
and not the programmers

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.440
and not anybody who looks at it,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.936
even if you have all the data,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.576
understands anymore
how exactly it's operating

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.376
any more than you'd know
what I was thinking right now

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.360
if you were shown
a cross section of my brain.
