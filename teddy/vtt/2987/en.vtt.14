and about to enter the manic phase.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.560
Such people tend to become
overspenders, compulsive gamblers.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.736
They could do this, and you'd have no clue
that's what they were picking up on.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.376
I gave this example
to a bunch of computer scientists once

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.456

"That's why I couldn't publish it."
