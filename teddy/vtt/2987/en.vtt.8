So in the old world, you could think
of some demographics to target

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.960
based on experience
and what you can guess.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.376
You might try to advertise to, oh,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.896

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.564
that's not how it works anymore.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.496

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.376
think of all the data
that Facebook has on you:

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.936
every status update you ever typed,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.976
every Messenger conversation,
