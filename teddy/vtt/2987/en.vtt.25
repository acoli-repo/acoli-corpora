to turn these people out."

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.000

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.136
We have no idea.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.360
Facebook won't tell us.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.856
So Facebook also algorithmically
arranges the posts

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.616
that your friends put on Facebook,
or the pages you follow.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.856
It doesn't show you
everything chronologically.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.696
It puts the order in the way
that the algorithm thinks will entice you

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.560
to stay on the site longer.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.416
Now, so this has a lot of consequences.
