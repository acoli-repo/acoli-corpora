00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.296
So when people voice fears
of artificial intelligence,

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.296
very often, they invoke images
of humanoid robots run amok.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.560
You know? Terminator?

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.736
You know, that might be
something to consider,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.616
but that's a distant threat.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.096
Or, we fret about digital surveillance

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.896
with metaphors from the past.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.576
"1984," George Orwell's "1984,"

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.880
it's hitting the bestseller lists again.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.376
It's a great book,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.280
but it's not the correct dystopia
for the 21st century.
