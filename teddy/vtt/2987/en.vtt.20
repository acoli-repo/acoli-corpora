It's like you're never
hardcore enough for YouTube.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.336
(Laughter)

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.920
So what's going on?

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:08.056
Now, YouTube's algorithm is proprietary,

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.440
but here's what I think is going on.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.456
The algorithm has figured out

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.176
that if you can entice people

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.936
into thinking that you can
show them something more hardcore,

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.376
they're more likely to stay on the site

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.816
watching video after video
going down that rabbit hole

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.520
while Google serves them ads.
