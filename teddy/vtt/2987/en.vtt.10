00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.776
Right? In the US,
such data is routinely collected,

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.760
collated and sold.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.760
In Europe, they have tougher rules.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.880
So what happens then is,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.936
by churning through all that data,
these machine-learning algorithms --

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.856
that's why they're called
learning algorithms --

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.976
they learn to understand
the characteristics of people

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.520
who purchased tickets to Vegas before.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.296
When they learn this from existing data,
