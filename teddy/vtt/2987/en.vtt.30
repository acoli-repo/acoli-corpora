What if a platform with that kind of power

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:08.920
decides to turn out supporters
of one candidate over the other?

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.120
How would we even know about it?

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.696
Now, we started from someplace
seemingly innocuous --

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.936
online adds following us around --

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.800
and we've landed someplace else.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.936
As a public and as citizens,

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.376
we no longer know
if we're seeing the same information

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.880
or what anybody else is seeing,
