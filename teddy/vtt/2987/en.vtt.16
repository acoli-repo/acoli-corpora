00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.176
because there are already companies

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.736
that are developing
this kind of technology,

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.560
and a lot of the stuff
is just off the shelf.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.816
This is not very difficult anymore.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.296
Do you ever go on YouTube
meaning to watch one video

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.680
and an hour later you've watched 27?

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.256
You know how YouTube
has this column on the right

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.496
that says, "Up next"

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.336
and it autoplays something?

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.576
It's an algorithm

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:28.216
picking what it thinks
that you might be interested in

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.776
and maybe not find on your own.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.056
It's not a human editor.
