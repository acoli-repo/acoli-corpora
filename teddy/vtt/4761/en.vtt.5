00:02:28.696 --> 00:02:32.753
These leukocytes can be so large
that they nearly fill a capillary

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:35.907
causing a plasma space
to open up in front of them.

00:02:37.132 --> 00:02:39.142
Because the space
and the white blood cells

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:41.696
are both more transparent to blue light

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.961
than the red blood cells
normally present in capillaries,

00:02:44.985 --> 00:02:48.041
we see a moving dot of light
wherever this happens,

00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:51.924
following the paths of your capillaries
and moving in time with your pulse.

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.786
Under ideal viewing conditions,

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.912
you might even see what looks
like a dark tail following the dot.

00:02:58.936 --> 00:03:02.578
This is the red blood cells
that have bunched up behind the leukocyte.
