Have you ever noticed something swimming
in your field of vision?

00:00:10.448 --> 00:00:14.061
It may look like a tiny worm
or a transparent blob,

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:18.052
and whenever you try to get
a closer look, it disappears,

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:20.763
only to reappear
as soon as you shift your glance.

00:00:21.727 --> 00:00:23.792
But don't go rinsing out your eyes!

00:00:23.816 --> 00:00:26.393
What you are seeing is a common phenomenon

00:00:26.417 --> 00:00:27.449
known as a floater.

00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:32.593
The scientific name for these objects
is Muscae volitantes,
