red blood cells,

00:01:00.746 --> 00:01:02.681
or clumps of protein.

00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:06.206
And because they're suspended
within the vitreous humor,

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.277
the gel-like liquid
that fills the inside of your eye,

00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:11.580
floaters drift along
with your eye movements,

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:14.331
and seem to bounce a little
when your eye stops.

00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:18.532
Floaters may be only
barely distinguishable most of the time.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.711
They become more visible
the closer they are to the retina,

00:01:22.735 --> 00:01:26.217
just as holding your hand closer
to a table with an overhead light

00:01:26.241 --> 00:01:28.727
will result in a more
sharply defined shadow.

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:31.580
And floaters are particularly noticeable
