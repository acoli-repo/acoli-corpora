00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:32.593
The scientific name for these objects
is Muscae volitantes,

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:34.755
Latin for "flying flies,"

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:37.909
and true to their name,
they can be somewhat annoying.

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:42.045
But they're not actually bugs
or any kind of external objects at all.

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:44.331
Rather, they exist inside your eyeball.

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:48.742
Floaters may seem to be alive,
since they move and change shape,

00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:50.013
but they are not alive.

00:00:50.832 --> 00:00:54.649
Floaters are tiny objects
that cast shadows on the retina,

00:00:54.673 --> 00:00:57.228
the light-sensitive tissue
at the back of your eye.

00:00:58.077 --> 00:00:59.590
They might be bits of tissue,

00:00:59.614 --> 00:01:00.722
red blood cells,
