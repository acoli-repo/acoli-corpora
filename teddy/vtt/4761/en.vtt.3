00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:31.580
And floaters are particularly noticeable

00:01:31.604 --> 00:01:34.582
when you are looking
at a uniform bright surface,

00:01:34.606 --> 00:01:36.219
like a blank computer screen,

00:01:36.243 --> 00:01:37.446
snow,

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.814
or a clear sky,

00:01:38.838 --> 00:01:43.083
where the consistency of the background
makes them easier to distinguish.

00:01:43.107 --> 00:01:46.761
The brighter the light is,
the more your pupil contracts.

00:01:46.785 --> 00:01:50.698
This has an effect similar
to replacing a large diffuse light fixture

00:01:50.722 --> 00:01:53.018
with a single overhead light bulb,

00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:55.323
which also makes
the shadow appear clearer.

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.744
There is another visual phenomenon
that looks similar to floaters

00:01:59.768 --> 00:02:01.319
but is in fact unrelated.
