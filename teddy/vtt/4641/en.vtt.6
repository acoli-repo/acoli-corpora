00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.656
managed to work herself to exhaustion.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.936
AH: The thing about machines
and the same thing about software

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.440
is that the goal is to minimize downtime.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.176
I mean, sales force has an ad out
about a new product

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.856
and they say 99.9 percent uptime.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.056
That's fantastic for software
and it's fantastic for machinery

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.216
but the human operating
system is different.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.856
Downtime for the human operating system
is not a bug, it's a feature.
