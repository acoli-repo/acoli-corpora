00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.416
And so for those folks

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.496
who have both those kind of
workaholic tendencies

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.456
but also love their jobs,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.296
they're buffered from
the negative risk of workaholics.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.856
AG: Yes! That's exactly
what I was hoping to hear.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.296
NR: Yes, Adam, you are
the classic engaged workaholic.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.976
AG: Yeah, I guess only a workaholic
would do a show about work.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.216
NR: That's right.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.256
(Laughter)

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.056
AG: I've never liked
this idea of recovery.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.296
In part because I think
it frames work as something stressful
