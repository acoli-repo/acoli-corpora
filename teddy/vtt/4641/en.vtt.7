Downtime for the human operating system
is not a bug, it's a feature.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.296
(Laughter)

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.136
AG: Well, I guess,
you know, it leaves me curious

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.496
about whether you actually
work less today.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.776
Because, Arianna, you're still
the fastest responder of anyone I know

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.016
to emails and calls.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.856
AH: It's not like my life
is less active or I've slowed down.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.216
AG: She's been working
this compulsively since she was a kid.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.576
AH: My mother says
that for my fifth birthday party

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.336
I sent away all the children

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.920
because they were interfering
with my reading.
