AG: That's my colleague
Nancy Rothbard again.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.736
Her family was in the furniture business.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.416
NR: So when I worked in the business,
I was working alongside my grandparents

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.656
and my uncle and my cousin
and my great aunt.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.496
And you know, I was
around my family a lot.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.136
And so I knew about

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.456
all sorts of issues of work motivation

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.016
and you know, problems with the warehouse

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.776
and issues with the drivers
and accounting issues.
