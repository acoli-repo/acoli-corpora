I'm Adam Grant

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.256
and this is WorkLife, my podcast with TED.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.296
I'm an organizational psychologist.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.056
I study how to make work not suck.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.016
In this show, I'm inviting myself in
to some truly unusual places,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.120
where they've mastered something
I wish everyone knew about work.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.936
Today: setting boundaries

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.760
so your work life
doesn't become your whole life.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.160
