00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.536
AG: More than 80 percent of people
on the autism spectrum are unemployed.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.616
But at JPMorgan Chase
things are a little different.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.656
For the last three years,
they've run an Autism at Work program

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.896
actively recruiting employees
on the autism spectrum like Henry.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.736
HD: I was diagnosed with autism
when I was very young

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.776
and that was kind of helpful
because it meant that I could

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.816
sort of build on my coping mechanisms
for a very long time.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.856
AG: Leaders at JPMorgan Chase realized
they were missing out on a lot of talent.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.216
So they started placing
less weight on interviews

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.096
and more emphasis on job skills.
