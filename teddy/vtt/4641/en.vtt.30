Is this an appropriate volume
for me to be talking?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.016
OK, cool. I'll try to maintain this level.

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.456
AG: That's Henry Dierds.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:08.056
He's a software developer
at JPMorgan Chase.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:12.936
HD: So it's like taking a big problem
that's complicated and poorly defined

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.536
and then breaking it down
into a series of steps.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.656
And then breaking those steps down
into a series of smaller steps

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.976
until each of the individual
components of your problem

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.696
can be replaced
with a line of computer code

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.416
or a function that you could write.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.656
That's the thing that I'm best at.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.536
AG: More than 80 percent of people
on the autism spectrum are unemployed.
