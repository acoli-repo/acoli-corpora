00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.776
and issues with the drivers
and accounting issues.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.896
That was all part
of our everyday conversation

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.840
and it was really
as natural to me as breathing.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.216
AG: When Nancy was in grad school,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.656
she started doing research
on the spillover between work and life.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.056
And she found that people
had different ideas

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.336
about whether work should bleed into life.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.576
NR: The way that people
navigate that boundary

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.456
between work and personal life

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.456
really varied quite a bit.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.296
AG: If you like to blend work and life,
you're an integrator.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.456
Like Arianna and Nancy's family.
