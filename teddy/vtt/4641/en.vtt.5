00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.760
And if so, should I be setting
more boundaries between work and life?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.016
For thousands of years,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.896
there were natural boundaries
between these two modes.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.456
People farmed by daylight, not at night.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.136
But then the industrial revolution
brought machines and electricity.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.336
Suddenly, there were fewer limits
on efficiency and productivity.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.440
We could work more and more hours.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.056
Today, it's gone even further.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.056
We're constantly connected by text.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.616
Always on email.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.056
Which is a big reason
why Arianna Huffington

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.656
managed to work herself to exhaustion.
