00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.616
Turning off my phone,

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.776
which for me is the ritual
that declares an end to the day.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.616
And in the morning,

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.976
never rush to my phone
as the first thing I do.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.536
Even if it's just taking
one or two minutes

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.176
to set my intention for the day --

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.976
what do I want from this day --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.656
before I go to my phone

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.960
which is everybody's agenda for me.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.616
AG: I have a could of colleagues
who have been studying workaholics.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.936
There's a group of people
that they call engaged workaholics.
