AG: Does that mean that the segmentors

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.856
feel like it's their place
to force other people to segment?

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.336
NR: I don't think
that they actively feel like that,

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.216
but I think that it just bothers them.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.936
And it's really hard for them
to get over that.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.736
Integrators were much more
accepting of segmentors.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.856
AG: So, when we think about technology,

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:24.736
do you think that the advent
of smartphones and email

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.136
and all these devices
that allow us to be connected 24/7

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.960
has made it harder to be a segmentor?
