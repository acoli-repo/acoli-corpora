I've played a personal role
in selecting the sponsors for this podcast

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.656
because they all have
interesting cultures of their own.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.680
Today, we're going inside
the workplace at JPMorgan Chase.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.936
When we think about work life,

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.056
we don't spend enough time
considering people

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.271
who sometimes don't get the chance
to go to work in the first place.

00:14:58.295 --> 00:14:59.536

Is this an appropriate volume
for me to be talking?
