00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.680
where you couldn't really cross
and if you did, it was inappropriate.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.776
Or distracting.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.136
AG: If you're a segmentor,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.136
you prefer very clear boundaries
between work and life.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.776
NR: I've met some segmentors who --

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.336
what they do is they keep
their key chains separate,

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.840
so they have a work key chain
and a home key chain.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.936
AG: No!

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.016
NR: Separate key chains for home and work.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.936
AG: That's crazy. I love it.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.176
NR: Yeah.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.216
People who are extreme segmentors

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.240
will also not have pictures
of their family in their office.
