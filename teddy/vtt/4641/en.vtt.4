00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.896
I like work.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.776
All right, I love work.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.496
In college, my roommates complained

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.776
that I wasn't fully present
for their parties

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.760
because I was too busy writing my thesis.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.656
Before I met my wife,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.280
my idea of a fun Saturday
was working from 7am to 9pm.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.600
And the thought of leaving an email
unanswered causes me physical pain.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.456
I've been called a workaholic.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.256
Is that so bad?

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.760
And if so, should I be setting
more boundaries between work and life?
