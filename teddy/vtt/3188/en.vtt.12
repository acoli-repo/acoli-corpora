00:05:59.248 --> 00:06:01.530
This muscle dynamic interaction

00:06:01.554 --> 00:06:04.586
causes biological sensors
within the muscle tendon

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.079
to send information through the nerve
to the central nervous system,

00:06:08.103 --> 00:06:12.707
relating information on the muscle
tendon's length, speed and force.

00:06:12.731 --> 00:06:15.049
This is how muscle tendon
proprioception works,

00:06:15.073 --> 00:06:17.716
and it's the primary way we, as humans,

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.866
can feel and sense the positions,
movements and forces on our limbs.

00:06:22.386 --> 00:06:23.688
When a limb is amputated,

00:06:23.712 --> 00:06:27.832
the surgeon connects these opposing
muscles within the residuum

00:06:27.856 --> 00:06:29.073
to create an AMI.

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:32.190
Now, multiple AMI
constructs can be created
