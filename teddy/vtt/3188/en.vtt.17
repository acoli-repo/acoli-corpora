00:08:29.303 --> 00:08:32.423
We electrically linked Jim's AMI muscles,
via the electrodes,

00:08:32.447 --> 00:08:33.605
to a bionic limb,

00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:36.390
and Jim quickly learned
how to move the bionic limb

00:08:36.414 --> 00:08:39.318
in four distinct ankle-foot
movement directions.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.063
We were excited by these results,
but then Jim stood up,

00:08:43.087 --> 00:08:45.953
and what occurred was truly remarkable.

00:08:45.977 --> 00:08:49.993
All the natural biomechanics
mediated by the central nervous system

00:08:50.017 --> 00:08:53.366
emerged via the synthetic limb

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.905
as an involuntary, reflexive action.

00:08:56.929 --> 00:09:00.826
All the intricacies of foot placement
during stair ascent --
