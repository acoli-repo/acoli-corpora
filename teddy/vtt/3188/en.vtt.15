After his accident, he dreamed
of returning to his chosen sport

00:07:31.814 --> 00:07:33.118
of mountain climbing,

00:07:33.142 --> 00:07:35.019
but how might this be possible?

00:07:37.322 --> 00:07:39.544
The answer was Team Cyborg,

00:07:40.369 --> 00:07:43.608
a team of surgeons,
scientists and engineers

00:07:43.632 --> 00:07:48.474
assembled at MIT to rebuild Jim
back to his former climbing prowess.

00:07:48.498 --> 00:07:52.554
Team member Dr. Matthew Carty
amputated Jim's badly damaged leg

00:07:52.578 --> 00:07:54.690
at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston,

00:07:54.714 --> 00:07:56.786
using the AMI surgical procedure.

00:07:57.262 --> 00:08:00.667
Tendon pulleys were created
and attached to Jim's tibia bone
