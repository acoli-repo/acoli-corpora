00:11:28.797 --> 00:11:30.896
I suddenly became an MIT professor.

00:11:31.353 --> 00:11:33.520
(Laughter)

00:11:33.544 --> 00:11:37.266
(Applause)

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:41.767
Now I'm worried that once I'm neurally
connected to my limbs once again,

00:11:41.791 --> 00:11:45.481
my brain will remap
back to its not-so-bright self.

00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:46.807
(Laughter)

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:50.902
But you know what, that's OK,
because at MIT, I already have tenure.

00:11:50.926 --> 00:11:52.554
(Laughter)

00:11:52.578 --> 00:11:55.443
(Applause)

00:11:55.467 --> 00:11:57.825
I believe the reach
of NeuroEmbodied Design

00:11:57.849 --> 00:12:00.706
will extend far beyond limb replacement
