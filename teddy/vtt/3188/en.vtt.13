00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:32.190
Now, multiple AMI
constructs can be created

00:06:32.214 --> 00:06:36.175
for the control and sensation
of multiple prosthetic joints.

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.597
Artificial electrodes are then placed
on each AMI muscle,

00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:43.272
and small computers within the bionic limb
decode those signals

00:06:43.296 --> 00:06:46.208
to control powerful motors
on the bionic limb.

00:06:46.933 --> 00:06:49.093
When the bionic limb moves,

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:50.974
the AMI muscles move back and forth,

00:06:50.998 --> 00:06:53.190
sending signals through
the nerve to the brain,

00:06:53.214 --> 00:06:57.356
enabling a person wearing the prosthesis
to experience natural sensations

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.864
of positions and movements
of the prosthesis.
