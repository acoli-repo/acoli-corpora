00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.399
I'm basically a bunch of nuts and bolts
from the knee down.

00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:34.202
But with this advanced bionic technology,

00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:36.468
I can skip, dance and run.

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:39.182
(Applause)

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.357
Thank you.

00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:42.991
(Applause)

00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:46.944
I'm a bionic man,
but I'm not yet a cyborg.

00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:53.086
When I think about moving my legs,

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.229
neural signals from
my central nervous system

00:00:56.253 --> 00:00:57.872
pass through my nerves

00:00:57.896 --> 00:01:01.007
and activate muscles
within my residual limbs.
