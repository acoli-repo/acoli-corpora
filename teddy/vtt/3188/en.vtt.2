00:00:57.896 --> 00:01:01.007
and activate muscles
within my residual limbs.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.039
Artificial electrodes sense these signals,

00:01:06.063 --> 00:01:08.528
and small computers in the bionic limb

00:01:08.552 --> 00:01:12.575
decode my nerve pulses
into my intended movement patterns.

00:01:14.493 --> 00:01:16.394
Stated simply,

00:01:16.418 --> 00:01:17.749
when I think about moving,

00:01:17.773 --> 00:01:21.970
that command is communicated
to the synthetic part of my body.

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:26.244
However, those computers can't input
information into my nervous system.

00:01:26.838 --> 00:01:29.727
When I touch and move my synthetic limbs,

00:01:29.751 --> 00:01:33.004
I do not experience normal
touch and movement sensations.
