00:02:27.406 --> 00:02:31.795
NeuroEmbodied Design is a methodology
to create cyborg function.

00:02:33.843 --> 00:02:38.194
In this design process,
designers contemplate a future

00:02:38.218 --> 00:02:41.369
in which technology
no longer compromises separate,

00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:44.321
lifeless tools from
our minds and our bodies,

00:02:44.345 --> 00:02:48.171
a future in which technology
has been carefully integrated

00:02:48.195 --> 00:02:49.766
within our nature,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.965
a world in which
what is biological and what is not,

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.075
what is human and what is not,

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.156
what is nature and what is not

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.367
will be forever blurred.

00:02:59.391 --> 00:03:02.867
That future will provide
humanity new bodies.
