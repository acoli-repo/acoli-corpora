00:03:59.991 --> 00:04:04.058
hasn't changed fundamentally
since the US Civil War

00:04:04.082 --> 00:04:07.836
and has grown obsolete
in light of dramatic advancements

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.796
in actuators, control systems
and neural interfacing technologies.

00:04:13.058 --> 00:04:17.336
A major deficiency is the lack
of dynamic muscle interactions

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.502
for control and proprioception.

00:04:20.682 --> 00:04:22.532
What is proprioception?

00:04:22.556 --> 00:04:25.794
When you flex your ankle,
muscles in the front of your leg contract,

00:04:25.818 --> 00:04:28.794
simultaneously stretching muscles
in the back of your leg.

00:04:28.818 --> 00:04:31.303
The opposite happens
when you extend your ankle.
