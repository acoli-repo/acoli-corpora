At MIT, Team Cyborg built Jim
a specialized limb for the vertical world,

00:13:34.419 --> 00:13:38.649
a brain-controlled leg with full position
and movement sensations.

00:13:40.065 --> 00:13:43.288
Using this technology,
Jim returned to the Cayman Islands,

00:13:43.312 --> 00:13:45.219
the site of his accident,

00:13:45.243 --> 00:13:49.251
rebuilt as a cyborg
to climb skyward once again.
