00:09:27.635 --> 00:09:33.222
Now, Jim moves and behaves
as if the synthetic limb is part of him.

00:09:33.746 --> 00:09:35.706
For example, one day in the lab,

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.826
he accidentally stepped
on a roll of electrical tape.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.477
Now, what do you do
when something's stuck to your shoe?

00:09:41.501 --> 00:09:44.112
You don't reach down like this;
it's way too awkward.

00:09:44.136 --> 00:09:45.430
Instead, you shake it off,

00:09:45.454 --> 00:09:47.279
and that's exactly what Jim did

00:09:47.303 --> 00:09:50.469
after being neurally connected to the limb
for just a few hours.

00:09:51.436 --> 00:09:53.413
What was most interesting to me

00:09:53.437 --> 00:09:56.305
is what Jim was telling us
he was experiencing.

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:59.654
He said, "The robot became part of me."
