00:07:57.262 --> 00:08:00.667
Tendon pulleys were created
and attached to Jim's tibia bone

00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:02.730
to reconnect the opposing muscles.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.365
The AMI procedure
reestablished the neural link

00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:09.264
between Jim's ankle-foot
muscles and his brain.

00:08:09.854 --> 00:08:12.418
When Jim moves his phantom limb,

00:08:12.442 --> 00:08:15.450
the reconnected muscles
move in dynamic pairs,

00:08:15.474 --> 00:08:19.911
causing signals of proprioception
to pass through nerves to the brain,

00:08:19.935 --> 00:08:23.555
so Jim experiences normal sensations
with ankle-foot positions and movements,

00:08:23.579 --> 00:08:24.895
even when blindfolded.

00:08:25.842 --> 00:08:29.279
Here's Jim at the MIT laboratory
after his surgeries.

00:08:29.303 --> 00:08:32.423
We electrically linked Jim's AMI muscles,
via the electrodes,
