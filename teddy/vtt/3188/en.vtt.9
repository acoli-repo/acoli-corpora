00:04:28.818 --> 00:04:31.303
The opposite happens
when you extend your ankle.

00:04:31.327 --> 00:04:33.559
Here, muscles in the back
of your leg contract,

00:04:33.583 --> 00:04:35.304
stretching muscles in the front.

00:04:35.328 --> 00:04:37.304
When these muscles flex and extend,

00:04:37.328 --> 00:04:39.662
biological sensors
within the muscle tendons

00:04:39.686 --> 00:04:42.162
send information
through nerves to the brain.

00:04:42.186 --> 00:04:44.790
This is how we're able to feel
where our feet are

00:04:44.814 --> 00:04:47.360
without seeing them with our eyes.

00:04:48.186 --> 00:04:52.409
The current amputation paradigm
breaks these dynamic muscle relationships,

00:04:52.433 --> 00:04:56.529
and in so doing eliminates
normal proprioceptive sensations.

00:04:56.553 --> 00:04:59.292
Consequently, a standard artificial limb

00:04:59.316 --> 00:05:01.991
cannot feed back information
into the nervous system
