00:02:59.391 --> 00:03:02.867
That future will provide
humanity new bodies.

00:03:04.156 --> 00:03:06.895
NeuroEmbodied Design
will extend our nervous systems

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.593
into the synthetic world,

00:03:08.617 --> 00:03:11.093
and the synthetic world into us,

00:03:11.117 --> 00:03:13.767
fundamentally changing who we are.

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:18.048
By designing the biological body
to better communicate

00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:19.859
with the built design world,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.065
humanity will end disability
in this 21st century

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:27.639
and establish the scientific
and technological basis

00:03:27.663 --> 00:03:28.964
for human augmentation,

00:03:29.937 --> 00:03:34.394
extending human capability
beyond innate, physiological levels,
