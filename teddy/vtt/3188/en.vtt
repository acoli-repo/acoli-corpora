00:00:01.388 --> 00:00:03.574
I'm an MIT professor,

00:00:03.598 --> 00:00:06.574
but I do not design buildings
or computer systems.

00:00:06.938 --> 00:00:09.415
Rather, I build body parts,

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.157
bionic legs that augment
human walking and running.

00:00:13.812 --> 00:00:16.745
In 1982, I was in
a mountain-climbing accident,

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.403
and both of my legs had to be amputated
due to tissue damage from frostbite.

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:23.182
Here, you can see my legs:

00:00:23.206 --> 00:00:28.506
24 sensors, six microprocessors
and muscle-tendon-like actuators.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.399
I'm basically a bunch of nuts and bolts
from the knee down.
