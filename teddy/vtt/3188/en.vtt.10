00:04:59.316 --> 00:05:01.991
cannot feed back information
into the nervous system

00:05:02.015 --> 00:05:04.759
about where the prosthesis is in space.

00:05:04.783 --> 00:05:07.940
The patient therefore
cannot sense and feel

00:05:07.964 --> 00:05:10.931
the positions and movements
of the prosthetic joint

00:05:10.955 --> 00:05:13.050
without seeing it with their eyes.

00:05:14.153 --> 00:05:18.097
My legs were amputated
using this Civil War-era methodology.

00:05:18.626 --> 00:05:21.182
I can feel my feet,
I can feel them right now

00:05:21.206 --> 00:05:23.065
as a phantom awareness.

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.978
But when I try to move them, I cannot.

00:05:25.002 --> 00:05:27.748
It feels like they're stuck
inside rigid ski boots.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:29.886
To solve these problems,

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.948
at MIT, we invented the agonist-antagonist
myoneural interface,
