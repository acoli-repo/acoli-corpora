Jim Ewing: The morning after the first
time I was attached to the robot,

00:10:04.027 --> 00:10:09.393
my daughter came downstairs
and asked me how it felt to be a cyborg,

00:10:09.417 --> 00:10:13.386
and my answer was
that I didn't feel like a cyborg.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.236
I felt like I had my leg,

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.981
and it wasn't that I was
attached to the robot

00:10:22.005 --> 00:10:24.626
so much as the robot was attached to me,

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.182
and the robot became part of me.

00:10:26.206 --> 00:10:28.697
It became my leg pretty quickly.

00:10:29.617 --> 00:10:30.768
Hugh Herr: Thank you.
