00:11:57.849 --> 00:12:00.706
will extend far beyond limb replacement

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.434
and will carry humanity into realms

00:12:03.458 --> 00:12:06.148
that fundamentally
redefine human potential.

00:12:06.866 --> 00:12:08.585
In this 21st century,

00:12:08.609 --> 00:12:13.046
designers will extend the nervous system
into powerfully strong exoskeletons

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:17.277
that humans can control
and feel with their minds.

00:12:18.139 --> 00:12:21.282
Muscles within the body
can be reconfigured

00:12:21.306 --> 00:12:24.219
for the control of powerful motors,

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:28.347
and to feel and sense
exoskeletal movements,

00:12:28.371 --> 00:12:32.132
augmenting humans' strength,
jumping height and running speed.
