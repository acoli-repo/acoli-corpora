I believe that if I were a cyborg
and could feel my legs,

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.218
they would become
part of me, part of self.

00:02:05.923 --> 00:02:10.068
At MIT, we're thinking about
NeuroEmbodied Design.

00:02:10.092 --> 00:02:11.869
In this design process,

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.573
the designer designs human flesh and bone,
the biological body itself,

00:02:18.597 --> 00:02:23.534
along with synthetics to enhance
the bidirectional communication

00:02:23.558 --> 00:02:26.040
between the nervous system
and the built world.

00:02:27.406 --> 00:02:31.795
NeuroEmbodied Design is a methodology
to create cyborg function.
