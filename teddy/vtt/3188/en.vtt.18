00:08:56.929 --> 00:09:00.826
All the intricacies of foot placement
during stair ascent --

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.348
(Applause)

00:09:04.372 --> 00:09:06.276
emerged before our eyes.

00:09:07.644 --> 00:09:09.469
Here's Jim descending steps,

00:09:09.493 --> 00:09:12.485
reaching with his bionic toe
to the next stair tread,

00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:15.025
automatically exhibiting natural motions

00:09:15.049 --> 00:09:17.841
without him even trying to move his limb.

00:09:17.865 --> 00:09:22.478
Because Jim's central nervous system
is receiving the proprioceptive signals,

00:09:22.502 --> 00:09:26.549
it knows exactly how to control
the synthetic limb in a natural way.

00:09:27.635 --> 00:09:33.222
Now, Jim moves and behaves
as if the synthetic limb is part of him.
