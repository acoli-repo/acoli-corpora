A few years ago, my good friend
Jim Ewing -- of 34 years --

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:11.341
reached out to me for help.

00:07:12.272 --> 00:07:14.328
Jim was in an a terrible
climbing accident.

00:07:14.352 --> 00:07:17.050
He fell 50 feet in the Cayman Islands

00:07:17.074 --> 00:07:20.272
when his rope failed to catch him
hitting the ground's surface.

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:23.809
He suffered many, many injuries:

00:07:23.833 --> 00:07:27.047
punctured lungs and many broken bones.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.790
