00:11:00.108 --> 00:11:04.106
Because of this neurological embodiment,
Jim doesn't feel like a cyborg.

00:11:05.215 --> 00:11:07.432
He feels like he just has his leg back,

00:11:07.456 --> 00:11:09.003
that he has his body back.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.731
Now I'm often asked

00:11:10.755 --> 00:11:14.311
when I'm going to be neurally linked
to my synthetic limbs bidirectionally,

00:11:14.335 --> 00:11:16.119
when I'm going to become a cyborg.

00:11:16.143 --> 00:11:18.906
The truth is, I'm hesitant
to become a cyborg.

00:11:19.966 --> 00:11:23.173
Before my legs were amputated,
I was a terrible student.

00:11:23.197 --> 00:11:26.020
I got D's and often F's in school.

00:11:26.044 --> 00:11:28.773
Then, after my limbs were amputated,

00:11:28.797 --> 00:11:30.896
I suddenly became an MIT professor.
