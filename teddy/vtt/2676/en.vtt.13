I checked back on it the other day,

00:06:30.616 --> 00:06:36.899
and it appears there have been
a number of emails going back and forth.

00:06:37.661 --> 00:06:40.646
We're on 21,439.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.852
(Applause)

00:06:47.252 --> 00:06:50.304
It gives me an immense
sense of satisfaction to know

00:06:50.328 --> 00:06:54.249
that these computer programs
are just going to be pinging one another

00:06:54.273 --> 00:06:55.742
for eternity.

00:06:56.926 --> 00:06:59.271
And as legacies go,
I don't think that's bad.
