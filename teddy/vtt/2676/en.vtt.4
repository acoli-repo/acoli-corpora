00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:02.193
but it also gave everything access to us.

00:02:03.177 --> 00:02:04.750
It's hard enough to discriminate

00:02:04.774 --> 00:02:07.329
between the things that genuinely
matter in this world

00:02:07.353 --> 00:02:08.877
and the minutiae of life,

00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:11.576
without having emails
about supermarket chains

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.043
and Candy Crush Saga.

00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:16.403
And I was really annoyed with them,

00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:19.605
and I thought, OK, I was about to write
a strongly worded email,

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:20.890
which I can do quite well.

00:02:20.914 --> 00:02:22.707
(Laughter)

00:02:23.144 --> 00:02:24.366
And I thought, no --

00:02:25.252 --> 00:02:26.948
I'm going to find the game.

00:02:26.972 --> 00:02:29.081
So I replied to it, and I said,

00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:30.905
"I literally cannot wait!!!!"
