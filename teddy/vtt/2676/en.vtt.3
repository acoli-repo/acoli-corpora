00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.244
So what I did was I scrolled down
to the bottom of the email,

00:01:32.268 --> 00:01:33.825
and I pressed, "Unsubscribe."

00:01:34.238 --> 00:01:36.071
And I thought that'd be the end of it.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.251
But a week later,
I got another one that said,

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:39.713
"Just two weeks

00:01:40.664 --> 00:01:42.579
until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!"

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:45.230
And I thought, obviously,
I haven't clicked hard enough.

00:01:45.254 --> 00:01:47.143
So I tried it again. Right?

00:01:48.254 --> 00:01:50.739
Lo and behold, a week passes,
you guessed it,

00:01:50.763 --> 00:01:54.820
"Just one week until SafeMart
at King's Cross opens!!!"

00:01:54.844 --> 00:01:56.686
And here's the problem:

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.032
The internet gave us access to everything;

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:02.193
but it also gave everything access to us.
