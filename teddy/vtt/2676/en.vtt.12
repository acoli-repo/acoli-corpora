00:06:00.358 --> 00:06:03.493
And I set it up so every time
it receives an email from SafeMart,

00:06:03.517 --> 00:06:04.667
it just pings one back.

00:06:04.691 --> 00:06:06.042
So I set it up, and it says,

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:08.427
"Thanks for your email -
your Case Number is ..."

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:12.305
Then it has a little formula that I wrote
to up the case number every time.

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:13.614
And I put it on the server

00:06:14.455 --> 00:06:15.820
and set it running.

00:06:17.681 --> 00:06:21.446
(Laughter)

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:24.075
I'll be honest, guys --

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:25.495
then I forgot about it.

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:27.519
(Laughter)

00:06:28.453 --> 00:06:30.592
I checked back on it the other day,
