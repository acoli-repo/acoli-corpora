00:00:58.616 --> 00:01:01.065
I got a marketing email
from a supermarket firm,

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:02.898
which will remain nameless

00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:04.868
for predominantly legal reasons,

00:01:04.892 --> 00:01:07.373
but which I'm going to call "SafeMart."

00:01:07.397 --> 00:01:09.455
(Laughter)

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.677
I got an email from them,
and it went like this, it said:

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:16.942
"Just three weeks until SafeMart
at King's Cross opens!!!"

00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.378
And I resented this,

00:01:18.402 --> 00:01:22.573
because not only do I not remember
signing up to that,

00:01:22.597 --> 00:01:25.309
but I resent the fact
that they appear to think

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.475
that I should be excited
about a shop opening.

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.244
So what I did was I scrolled down
to the bottom of the email,
