"I literally cannot wait!!!!"

00:02:31.535 --> 00:02:33.455
(Laughter)

00:02:35.173 --> 00:02:36.693
"What do you need from me?"

00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:41.211
They got back to me;
a guy called Dan said,

00:02:41.235 --> 00:02:44.149
"Hi James. I've asked a colleague
to help me with your query."

00:02:44.173 --> 00:02:45.193
(Laughter)

00:02:45.217 --> 00:02:46.849
Like it needs help.

00:02:48.364 --> 00:02:50.119

00:02:50.143 --> 00:02:52.436
I'm thinking fireworks, bouncy castle ..."

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.655
(Laughter)

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:57.751
"I'm not sure what you mean."

00:02:57.775 --> 00:02:58.982
(Laughter)

00:02:59.512 --> 00:03:02.309
I said, "I'm just tremendously
excited about the opening!"
