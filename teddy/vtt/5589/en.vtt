00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:07.125
“All the World’s a Stage”

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:08.706
from "As You Like It"

00:00:08.706 --> 00:00:10.716
by William Shakespeare

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:15.829
All the world’s a stage,

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:19.089
And all the men and women merely players;

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:21.909
They have their exits and their entrances;

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:26.079
And one man in his time plays many parts,

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:31.759
His acts being seven ages.
