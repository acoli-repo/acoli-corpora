00:00:06.371 --> 00:00:08.996
How much would you pay
for a bouquet of tulips?

00:00:09.038 --> 00:00:11.371
A few dollars? A hundred dollars?

00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:13.663
How about a million dollars?

00:00:13.704 --> 00:00:15.704
Probably not.

00:00:15.746 --> 00:00:17.871
Well, how much would 
you pay for this house,

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:21.663
or partial ownership of a website
that sells pet supplies?

00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:23.163
At different points in time,

00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:28.163
tulips, real estate, and stock in pets.com

00:00:28.163 --> 00:00:31.829
have all sold for much more
than they were worth.
