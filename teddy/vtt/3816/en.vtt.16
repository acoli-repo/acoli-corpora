00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:01.545
also makes clear

00:08:01.545 --> 00:08:03.990
that what we think of as economic growth

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.937
is best understood as

00:08:05.937 --> 00:08:08.431
the rate at which we solve problems.

00:08:08.431 --> 00:08:11.849
But that rate is totally dependent upon

00:08:11.849 --> 00:08:15.426
how many problem solvers —

00:08:15.426 --> 00:08:17.912
diverse, able problem solvers — we have,

00:08:17.912 --> 00:08:20.645
and thus how many of our fellow citizens

00:08:20.645 --> 00:08:22.870
actively participate,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.520
both as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.162
and as customers who consume them.
