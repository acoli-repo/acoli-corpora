00:09:29.627 --> 00:09:32.656
How many haircuts can I get?

00:09:32.656 --> 00:09:36.361
How often can I go out to dinner?

00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:40.434
No matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get,

00:09:40.434 --> 00:09:43.978
we can never drive a great national economy.

00:09:43.978 --> 00:09:49.671
Only a thriving middle class can do that.

00:09:49.671 --> 00:09:51.368
There's nothing to be done,

00:09:51.368 --> 00:09:55.509
my plutocrat friends might say.

00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:58.713
Henry Ford was in a different time.

00:09:58.713 --> 00:10:00.987
Maybe we can't do some things.
