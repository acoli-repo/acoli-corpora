00:11:57.823 --> 00:12:02.582
Since 1980, the wages of CEOs in our country

00:12:02.582 --> 00:12:04.850
have gone from about 30 times the median wage

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.122
to 500 times.

00:12:07.122 --> 00:12:10.290
That's raising the price of employment.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:13.262
And yet, to my knowledge,

00:12:13.262 --> 00:12:15.434
I have never seen a company

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:19.180
outsource its CEO's job, automate their job,

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.267
export the job to China.

00:12:21.267 --> 00:12:23.293
In fact, we appear to be employing

00:12:23.293 --> 00:12:26.515
more CEOs and senior managers than ever before.

00:12:26.515 --> 00:12:30.705
So too for technology workers
