00:14:28.564 --> 00:14:31.365
that if low-wage workers earn a little bit more,

00:14:31.365 --> 00:14:32.873
unemployment will skyrocket

00:14:32.873 --> 00:14:34.201
and the economy will collapse?

00:14:34.201 --> 00:14:36.810
There is no evidence for it.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:38.041
The most insidious thing

00:14:38.041 --> 00:14:39.888
about trickle-down economics

00:14:39.888 --> 00:14:42.190
is not the claim that if the rich get richer,

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.727
everyone is better off.

00:14:43.727 --> 00:14:46.788
It is the claim made by those who oppose

00:14:46.788 --> 00:14:48.690
any increase in the minimum wage

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.545
that if the poor get richer,

00:14:50.545 --> 00:14:52.762
that will be bad for the economy.

00:14:52.762 --> 00:14:54.742
This is nonsense.

00:14:54.742 --> 00:14:58.607
So can we please dispense with this rhetoric

00:14:58.607 --> 00:15:00.950
that says that rich guys like me
