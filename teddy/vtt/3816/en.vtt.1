00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:31.763
I have founded, cofounded or funded

00:00:31.763 --> 00:00:35.293
over 30 companies across a range of industries.

00:00:35.293 --> 00:00:38.888
I was the first non-family investor in Amazon.com.

00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:41.609
I cofounded a company called aQuantive

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.479
that we sold to Microsoft for 6.4 billion dollars.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:48.027
My friends and I, we own a bank.

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:50.923
I tell you this — (Laughter) —

00:00:50.923 --> 00:00:52.170
unbelievable, right?

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.380
I tell you this to show

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.143
that my life is like most plutocrats.

00:00:58.143 --> 00:01:01.450
I have a broad perspective on capitalism
