00:04:27.117 --> 00:04:30.750
And it will be terrible when they come

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.201
for everyone,

00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:37.185
but particularly for people like us plutocrats.

00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:40.605
I know I must sound like some liberal do-gooder.

00:04:40.605 --> 00:04:42.855
I'm not. I'm not making a moral argument

00:04:42.855 --> 00:04:46.117
that economic inequality is wrong.

00:04:46.117 --> 00:04:50.403
What I am arguing is that rising economic inequality

00:04:50.403 --> 00:04:53.924
is stupid and ultimately self-defeating.

00:04:53.924 --> 00:04:57.152
Rising inequality doesn't just increase our risks

00:04:57.152 --> 00:04:59.020
from pitchforks,

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.587
but it's also terrible for business too.
