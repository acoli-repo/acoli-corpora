WEBVTT

00:02:58.868 --> 00:03:00.607
will share just six.

00:03:00.607 --> 00:03:02.603
You see, the problem isn't that we have

00:03:02.603 --> 00:03:04.684
some inequality.

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.136
Some inequality is necessary

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:10.430
for a high-functioning capitalist democracy.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.140
The problem is that inequality

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.502
is at historic highs today

00:03:15.502 --> 00:03:18.921
and it's getting worse every day.

00:03:18.921 --> 00:03:21.545
And if wealth, power, and income

00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:23.380
continue to concentrate

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.681
at the very tippy top,

00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:27.529
our society will change

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:29.262
from a capitalist democracy

00:03:29.262 --> 00:03:33.034
to a neo-feudalist rentier society
