00:00:58.143 --> 00:01:01.450
I have a broad perspective on capitalism

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.250
and business,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.040
and I have been rewarded obscenely for that

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.197
with a life that most of you all

00:01:09.197 --> 00:01:11.456
can't even imagine:

00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:14.157
multiple homes, a yacht, my own plane,

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:18.284
etc., etc., etc.

00:01:18.284 --> 00:01:21.546
But let's be honest: I am not the
smartest person you've ever met.

00:01:21.546 --> 00:01:23.950
I am certainly not the hardest working.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.923
I was a mediocre student.

00:01:25.923 --> 00:01:27.141
I'm not technical at all.

00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:29.639
I can't write a word of code.

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:32.772
Truly, my success is the consequence
