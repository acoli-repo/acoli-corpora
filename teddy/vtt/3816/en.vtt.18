00:08:57.239 --> 00:09:00.378
trickle-down economics thing behind us,

00:09:00.378 --> 00:09:02.284
this idea that the better we do,

00:09:02.284 --> 00:09:04.951
the better everyone else will do.

00:09:04.951 --> 00:09:08.871
It's not true. How could it be?

00:09:08.871 --> 00:09:12.999
I earn 1,000 times the median wage,

00:09:12.999 --> 00:09:15.924
but I do not buy 1,000 times as much stuff,

00:09:15.924 --> 00:09:16.988
do I?

00:09:16.988 --> 00:09:20.176
I actually bought two pairs of these pants,

00:09:20.176 --> 00:09:22.110
what my partner Mike calls

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.625
my manager pants.

00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:26.561
I could have bought 2,000 pairs,

00:09:26.561 --> 00:09:29.627
but what would I do with them? (Laughter)

00:09:29.627 --> 00:09:32.656
How many haircuts can I get?
