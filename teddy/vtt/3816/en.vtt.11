00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.861
that an economy is best understood as an ecosystem

00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:37.780
and characterized by the same kinds

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.340
of feedback loops you find

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.080
in a natural ecosystem,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.018

00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:53.286
which in turn increases wages

00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:55.916
and demand and profits,

00:05:55.916 --> 00:06:00.760
and that virtuous cycle of increasing prosperity
