00:12:26.515 --> 00:12:30.705
So too for technology workers

00:12:30.705 --> 00:12:32.531
and financial services workers,

00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:35.149
who earn multiples of the median wage

00:12:35.149 --> 00:12:37.154
and yet we employ more and more of them,

00:12:37.154 --> 00:12:42.050
so clearly you can raise the price of employment

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:44.091
and get more of it.

00:12:44.091 --> 00:12:46.675
I know that most people

00:12:46.675 --> 00:12:48.397
think that the $15 minimum wage

00:12:48.397 --> 00:12:52.312
is this insane, risky economic experiment.

00:12:52.312 --> 00:12:54.210
We disagree.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.684
We believe that the $15 minimum wage

00:12:56.684 --> 00:12:57.950
in Seattle

00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.803
is actually the continuation

00:12:59.803 --> 00:13:02.511
of a logical economic policy.
