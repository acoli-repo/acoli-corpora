00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:02.209
I'd like to talk today

00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:05.136
about a powerful and fundamental aspect

00:00:05.136 --> 00:00:08.734
of who we are: our voice.

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:11.480
Each one of us has a unique voiceprint

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.769
that reflects our age, our size,

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.006
even our lifestyle and personality.

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:19.148
In the words of the poet Longfellow,

00:00:19.148 --> 00:00:23.018
"the human voice is the organ of the soul."

00:00:23.018 --> 00:00:25.765
As a speech scientist, I'm fascinated

00:00:25.765 --> 00:00:27.594
by how the voice is produced,

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:31.252
and I have an idea for how it can be engineered.
