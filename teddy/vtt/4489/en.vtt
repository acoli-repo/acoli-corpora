How often do we hear
that people just don't care?

00:00:04.958 --> 00:00:06.549
How many times have you been told

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.814
that real, substantial change
isn't possible

00:00:09.838 --> 00:00:11.913
because most people are too selfish,

00:00:11.937 --> 00:00:13.869
too stupid or too lazy

00:00:13.893 --> 00:00:16.525
to try to make a difference
in their community?

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:19.643
I propose to you today
that apathy as we think we know it

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:21.378
doesn't actually exist;

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:23.576
but rather, that people do care,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.309
but that we live in a world
that actively discourages engagement

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:30.694
by constantly putting obstacles
and barriers in our way.
