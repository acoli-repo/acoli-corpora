00:02:27.468 --> 00:02:30.693
Well, they're the numbers that go into 30.

00:02:30.717 --> 00:02:33.118
Maybe you can remember them.
We'll work them out.

00:02:33.142 --> 00:02:36.956
It's one, two, three,

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.072
five, six,

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:41.956
10, 15 and 30.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.457
It's not very interesting.

00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:46.356
It's a bunch of numbers
in a straight line.

00:02:46.826 --> 00:02:48.349
We can make it more interesting

00:02:48.373 --> 00:02:52.063
by thinking about which of these numbers
are also factors of each other

00:02:52.087 --> 00:02:54.615
and drawing a picture,
a bit like a family tree,

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.345
to show those relationships.

00:02:56.369 --> 00:03:00.439
So 30 is going to be at the top
like a kind of great-grandparent.
