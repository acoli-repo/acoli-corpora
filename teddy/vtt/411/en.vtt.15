00:07:28.527 --> 00:07:33.540
They're definitely better off
than poor, white, unemployed homeless men.

00:07:34.164 --> 00:07:36.944
So actually, the diagram
is more skewed like this.

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:40.222
And that tension exists

00:07:40.246 --> 00:07:43.485
between the layers
of privilege in the diagram

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:47.174
and the absolute privilege
that people experience in society.

00:07:47.198 --> 00:07:50.872
And this has helped me to understand
why some poor white men

00:07:50.896 --> 00:07:54.305
are so angry in society at the moment.

00:07:54.329 --> 00:07:58.756
Because they are considered to be high up
in this cuboid of privilege,

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:03.563
but in terms of absolute privilege,
they don't actually feel the effect of it.
