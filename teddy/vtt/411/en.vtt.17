we would see that they are here,

00:08:30.804 --> 00:08:33.535
and now the rich, white
non-men are at the top.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.404
So we could move to
a whole context of women,

00:08:36.428 --> 00:08:41.572
and our three types of privilege
could now be rich, white and cisgendered.

00:08:41.596 --> 00:08:45.301
Remember that "cisgendered" means
that your gender identity does match

00:08:45.325 --> 00:08:47.290
the gender you were assigned at birth.

00:08:48.021 --> 00:08:54.033
So now we see that rich, white cis women
occupy the analogous situation

00:08:54.057 --> 00:08:57.231
that rich white men did
in broader society.

00:08:57.255 --> 00:09:00.683
And this has helped me understand
why there is so much anger
