00:03:29.756 --> 00:03:32.666
We can see something more here.
There's a hierarchy going on.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.561
At the bottom level is the number one,

00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:36.829
then there's the numbers
two, three and five,

00:03:36.853 --> 00:03:39.663
and nothing goes into those
except one and themselves.

00:03:39.687 --> 00:03:42.117
You might remember
this means they're prime.

00:03:42.141 --> 00:03:45.174
At the next level up,
we have six, 10 and 15,

00:03:45.198 --> 00:03:48.706
and each of those is a product
of two prime factors.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.672
So six is two times three,

00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:52.367
10 is two times five,

00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:54.352
15 is three times five.

00:03:54.376 --> 00:03:56.341
And then at the top, we have 30,

00:03:56.365 --> 00:03:58.860
which is a product
of three prime numbers --

00:03:58.884 --> 00:04:00.937
two times three times five.
