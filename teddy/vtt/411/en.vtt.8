00:03:58.884 --> 00:04:00.937
two times three times five.

00:04:00.961 --> 00:04:05.580
So I could redraw this diagram
using those numbers instead.

00:04:06.335 --> 00:04:09.403
We see that we've got
two, three and five at the top,

00:04:09.427 --> 00:04:12.499
we have pairs of numbers
at the next level,

00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:14.910
and we have single elements
at the next level

00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:16.852
and then the empty set at the bottom.

00:04:17.271 --> 00:04:22.650
And each of those arrows shows
losing one of your numbers in the set.

00:04:22.674 --> 00:04:25.291
Now maybe it can be clear

00:04:25.315 --> 00:04:28.173
that it doesn't really matter
what those numbers are.

00:04:28.197 --> 00:04:30.156
In fact, it doesn't matter what they are.
