00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:00.704
than poor white men,

00:07:00.728 --> 00:07:03.734
and rich black men are probably
somewhere in between.

00:07:03.758 --> 00:07:06.535
So it's really more skewed like this,

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:08.492
and the same on the bottom level.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.081
But we can actually take it further

00:07:11.105 --> 00:07:14.676
and look at the interactions
between those two middle levels.

00:07:15.076 --> 00:07:21.012
Because rich, nonwhite non-men
might well be better off in society

00:07:21.036 --> 00:07:23.129
than poor white men.

00:07:23.153 --> 00:07:27.061
Think about some extreme
examples, like Michelle Obama,

00:07:27.085 --> 00:07:28.503
Oprah Winfrey.

00:07:28.527 --> 00:07:33.540
They're definitely better off
than poor, white, unemployed homeless men.
