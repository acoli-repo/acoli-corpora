00:04:28.197 --> 00:04:30.156
In fact, it doesn't matter what they are.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.576
So we could replace them with
something like A, B and C instead,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.335
and we get the same picture.

00:04:37.025 --> 00:04:39.142
So now this has become very abstract.

00:04:39.626 --> 00:04:41.610
The numbers have turned into letters.

00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:45.569
But there is a point to this abstraction,

00:04:45.593 --> 00:04:50.178
which is that it now suddenly
becomes very widely applicable,

00:04:50.202 --> 00:04:53.876
because A, B and C could be anything.

00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:58.609
For example, they could be
three types of privilege:

00:04:58.633 --> 00:05:01.326
rich, white and male.
