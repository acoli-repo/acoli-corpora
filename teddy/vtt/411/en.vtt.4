00:01:58.653 --> 00:02:01.339
as irrelevant schools maths:

00:02:01.974 --> 00:02:04.053
factors of numbers.

00:02:04.077 --> 00:02:07.633
We're going to start
by thinking about the factors of 30.

00:02:07.657 --> 00:02:12.373
Now, if this makes you shudder
with bad memories of school maths lessons,

00:02:12.397 --> 00:02:16.995
I sympathize, because I found
school maths lessons boring, too.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.363
But I'm pretty sure we are going
to take this in a direction

00:02:21.387 --> 00:02:24.828
that is very different
from what happened at school.

00:02:25.718 --> 00:02:27.444
So what are the factors of 30?

00:02:27.468 --> 00:02:30.693
Well, they're the numbers that go into 30.
