00:02:56.369 --> 00:03:00.439
So 30 is going to be at the top
like a kind of great-grandparent.

00:03:00.463 --> 00:03:03.060
Six, 10 and 15 go into 30.

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.489
Five goes into 10 and 15.

00:03:06.945 --> 00:03:09.632
Two goes into six and 10.

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:12.943
Three goes into six and 15.

00:03:12.967 --> 00:03:17.151
And one goes into two, three and five.

00:03:17.175 --> 00:03:20.910
So now we see that 10
is not divisible by three,

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:24.114
but that this is the corners of a cube,

00:03:24.138 --> 00:03:26.219
which is, I think, a bit more interesting

00:03:26.243 --> 00:03:28.367
than a bunch of numbers
in a straight line.

00:03:29.756 --> 00:03:32.666
We can see something more here.
There's a hierarchy going on.
