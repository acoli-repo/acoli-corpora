00:04:58.633 --> 00:05:01.326
rich, white and male.

00:05:02.386 --> 00:05:05.576
So then at the next level,
we have rich white people.

00:05:06.368 --> 00:05:08.849
Here we have rich male people.

00:05:08.873 --> 00:05:10.922
Here we have white male people.

00:05:10.946 --> 00:05:14.561
Then we have rich, white and male.

00:05:15.209 --> 00:05:18.341
And finally, people with none
of those types of privilege.

00:05:18.365 --> 00:05:21.634
And I'm going to put back in
the rest of the adjectives for emphasis.

00:05:21.658 --> 00:05:24.688
So here we have rich, white
non-male people,

00:05:24.712 --> 00:05:27.761
to remind us that there are
nonbinary people we need to include.

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:30.438
Here we have rich, nonwhite male people.
