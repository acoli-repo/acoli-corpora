00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:30.438
Here we have rich, nonwhite male people.

00:05:30.462 --> 00:05:33.758
Here we have non-rich, white male people,

00:05:33.782 --> 00:05:36.484
rich, nonwhite, non-male,

00:05:36.508 --> 00:05:39.059
non-rich, white, non-male

00:05:39.083 --> 00:05:41.418
and non-rich, nonwhite, male.

00:05:41.442 --> 00:05:43.639
And at the bottom,
with the least privilege,

00:05:43.663 --> 00:05:47.706
non-rich, nonwhite, non-male people.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.542
We have gone from a diagram
of factors of 30

00:05:51.566 --> 00:05:55.496
to a diagram of interaction
of different types of privilege.

00:05:56.068 --> 00:05:59.690
And there are many things
we can learn from this diagram, I think.

00:05:59.714 --> 00:06:06.525
The first is that each arrow represents
a direct loss of one type of privilege.
