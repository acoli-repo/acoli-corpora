that abstract mathematics
is highly relevant to our daily lives

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:36.820
and can even help us to understand
and empathize with other people.

00:10:38.584 --> 00:10:44.223
My wish is that everybody would try
to understand other people more

00:10:44.247 --> 00:10:46.163
and work with them together,

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:48.208
rather than competing with them

00:10:48.232 --> 00:10:50.843
and trying to show that they're wrong.

00:10:52.031 --> 00:10:56.598
And I believe that abstract
mathematical thinking

00:10:56.622 --> 00:10:58.702
can help us achieve that.
