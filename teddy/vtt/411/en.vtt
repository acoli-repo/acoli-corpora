00:00:01.247 --> 00:00:06.860
The world is awash
with divisive arguments,

00:00:06.884 --> 00:00:08.757
conflict,

00:00:08.781 --> 00:00:10.594
fake news,

00:00:10.618 --> 00:00:12.204
victimhood,

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:18.847
exploitation, prejudice,
bigotry, blame, shouting

00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:21.794
and minuscule attention spans.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.048
It can sometimes seem
that we are doomed to take sides,

00:00:28.072 --> 00:00:30.334
be stuck in echo chambers
