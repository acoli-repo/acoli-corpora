I have a tool for understanding
this confusing world of ours,

00:01:00.385 --> 00:01:03.293
a tool that you might not expect:

00:01:04.194 --> 00:01:05.848
abstract mathematics.

00:01:07.268 --> 00:01:09.651
I am a pure mathematician.

00:01:10.063 --> 00:01:14.076
Traditionally, pure maths
is like the theory of maths,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.269
where applied maths is applied
to real problems like building bridges

00:01:19.293 --> 00:01:20.808
and flying planes

00:01:20.832 --> 00:01:23.175
and controlling traffic flow.

00:01:23.894 --> 00:01:28.820
But I'm going to talk about a way
that pure maths applies directly

00:01:28.844 --> 00:01:30.353
to our daily lives
