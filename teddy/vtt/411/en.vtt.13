we would expect them
to be better off in society.

00:06:39.302 --> 00:06:42.087
There is something else

If we look along the second-to-top row,
where people have two types of privilege,

00:06:48.426 --> 00:06:52.382

are probably much better off in society

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:00.704
than poor white men,
