to our daily lives

00:01:30.377 --> 00:01:32.222
as a way of thinking.

00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:37.119
I don't solve quadratic equations
to help me with my daily life,

00:01:37.143 --> 00:01:42.285
but I do use mathematical thinking
to help me understand arguments

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:44.818
and to empathize with other people.

00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:51.109
And so pure maths helps me
with the entire human world.

00:01:52.434 --> 00:01:55.545
But before I talk about
the entire human world,

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.629
I need to talk about something
that you might think of

00:01:58.653 --> 00:02:01.339
as irrelevant schools maths:
