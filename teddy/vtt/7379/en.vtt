00:00:02.036 --> 00:00:06.316
I wonder if the sun debates dawn

00:00:06.316 --> 00:00:07.876
some mornings

00:00:07.876 --> 00:00:09.436
not wanting to rise

00:00:09.436 --> 00:00:10.996
out of bed

00:00:10.996 --> 00:00:14.316
from under that down-feather horizon

00:00:14.636 --> 00:00:17.236
if the sky grows tired

00:00:17.236 --> 00:00:19.836
of being everywhere at once

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:21.396
adapting to the mood

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:23.356
swings of the weather

00:00:23.796 --> 00:00:26.036
if clouds drift off

00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:29.476
trying to hold themselves together

00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:31.836
make deals with gravity
