00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:00.579
and then they rush in to dine

00:03:00.603 --> 00:03:03.414
on this pulsating and movable feast.

00:03:03.438 --> 00:03:05.234
Close behind are sharks.

00:03:05.258 --> 00:03:06.413
Now, most people believe

00:03:06.437 --> 00:03:08.814
that sharks and dolphins
are these mortal enemies,

00:03:08.838 --> 00:03:11.610
but during the Sardine Run,
they actually coexist.

00:03:11.634 --> 00:03:15.805
In fact, dolphins actually
help sharks feed more effectively.

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.411
Without dolphins, the bait balls
are more dispersed

00:03:19.435 --> 00:03:23.173
and sharks often end up
with what I call a sardine donut,

00:03:23.197 --> 00:03:24.657
or a mouth full of water.

00:03:24.681 --> 00:03:28.722
Now, while I've had a few spicy moments
with sharks on the sardine run,

00:03:28.746 --> 00:03:30.812
I know they don't see me as prey.
