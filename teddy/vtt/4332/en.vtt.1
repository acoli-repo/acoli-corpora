00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:31.320
But the first time
I truly went underwater,

00:00:31.344 --> 00:00:32.745
I was about 10 years old.

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:35.416
And I can still vividly remember
furiously finning

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.915
to reach this old, encrusted
cannon on a shallow coral reef.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:41.107
And when I finally managed
to grab hold of it,

00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.216
I looked up, and I was instantly
surrounded by fish

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.189
in all colors of the rainbow.

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.816
That was the day
I fell in love with the ocean.

In my 40 years on this planet,

00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:56.523
I've had the great privilege to explore

00:00:56.547 --> 00:00:58.635
some of its most incredible seascapes
