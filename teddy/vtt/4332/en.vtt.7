00:03:28.746 --> 00:03:30.812
I know they don't see me as prey.

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:34.039
However, I get bumped and tail-slapped
just like any other guest

00:03:34.063 --> 00:03:35.832
at this rowdy, rowdy banquet.

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:40.714
From the shores of Africa we travel east,

00:03:40.738 --> 00:03:42.839
across the vastness
that is the Indian Ocean

00:03:42.863 --> 00:03:46.755
to the Maldives, an archipelago
of coral islands.

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:49.317
And during the stormy southwest monsoon,

00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:51.651
manta rays from all across the archipelago

00:03:51.675 --> 00:03:54.928
travel to a tiny speck
in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.

00:03:54.952 --> 00:03:56.135
Armies of crustaceans,

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:58.373
most no bigger than the size
of your pupils,

00:03:58.397 --> 00:04:01.582
are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet.
