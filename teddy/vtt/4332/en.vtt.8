00:03:58.397 --> 00:04:01.582
are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet.

00:04:02.185 --> 00:04:04.968
When plankton concentrations
become patchy,

00:04:04.992 --> 00:04:06.178
manta rays feed alone

00:04:06.202 --> 00:04:08.914
and they somersault themselves
backwards again and again,

00:04:08.938 --> 00:04:11.289
very much like a puppy
chasing its own tail.

00:04:11.757 --> 00:04:13.757

00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:17.504
However, when plankton densities increase,

00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:21.727
the mantas line up head-to-tail
to form these long feeding chains,

00:04:21.751 --> 00:04:25.075
and any tasty morsel that escapes
the first or second manta in line

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.555
is surely to be gobbled up
by the next or the one after.

00:04:29.912 --> 00:04:31.808
As plankton levels peak in the bay,
