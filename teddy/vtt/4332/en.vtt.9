00:04:29.912 --> 00:04:31.808
As plankton levels peak in the bay,

00:04:31.832 --> 00:04:34.037
the mantas swim closer and closer together

00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:36.422
in a unique behavior
we call cyclone feeding.

00:04:36.852 --> 00:04:39.122
And as they swirl in tight formation,

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:40.817
this multi-step column of mantas

00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:44.718
creates its own vortex, sucking in
and delivering the plankton

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:47.550
right into the mantas' cavernous mouths.

00:04:47.574 --> 00:04:51.916
The experience of diving
amongst such masses of hundreds of rays

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.968
is truly unforgettable.

00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:56.881
