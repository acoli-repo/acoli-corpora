00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.647
for National Geographic Magazine

00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:02.298
and the Save Our Seas Foundation.

00:01:02.322 --> 00:01:05.438
I've photographed everything
from really, really big sharks

00:01:05.462 --> 00:01:08.655
to dainty ones that fit
in the palm of your hand.

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:11.631
I've smelled the fishy, fishy breath
of humpback whales

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:13.266
feeding just feet away from me

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.114
in the cold seas off Canada's
Great Bear Rainforest.

00:01:16.138 --> 00:01:19.075
And I've been privy to the mating rituals
of green sea turtles

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:20.437
in the Mozambique Channel.

00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:24.185
Everyone on this planet affects
and is affected by the ocean.

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.962
And the pristine seas
I used to dream of as a child

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:29.678
are becoming harder and harder to find.

00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:31.797
They are becoming more compressed
