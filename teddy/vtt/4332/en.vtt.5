00:02:28.928 --> 00:02:31.646
The first time I experienced
that kind of high

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.063
was about 10 years ago,

00:02:33.087 --> 00:02:35.922
off South Africa's rugged, wild coast.

00:02:35.946 --> 00:02:37.292
And every June and July,

00:02:37.316 --> 00:02:39.725
enormous shoals of sardines
travel northwards

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:42.074
in a mass migration
we call the Sardine Run.

00:02:42.098 --> 00:02:44.707
And boy, do those fish
have good reason to run.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:49.020
In hot pursuit are hoards
of hungry and agile predators.

00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:50.902
Common dolphins hunt together

00:02:50.926 --> 00:02:53.847
and they can separate some
of the sardines from the main shoal

00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:55.275
and they create bait balls.

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.987
They drive and trap the fish upward
against the ocean surface

00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:00.579
and then they rush in to dine
