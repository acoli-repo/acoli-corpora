00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:12.105
Flanked by two powerful European nations,
the English Channel

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:16.345
has long been one of the world’s 
most important maritime passages.

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:17.949
Yet for most of its history,

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.860
the channel’s rocky shores 
and stormy weather

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.930
made crossing a dangerous prospect.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.800
Engineers of the early 1800's 
proposed numerous plans

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.130
for spanning the 33 kilometer gap.
