Hi, my name is Andri Snær Magnason,

00:00:03.056 --> 00:00:04.529
talking from Iceland.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.930
(Water rushing)

00:00:10.554 --> 00:00:15.091
In 2019, we had lost our first glacier
to climate change:

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.828
the Okjökull, the Ok glacier,

00:00:17.852 --> 00:00:19.437
that is not OK anymore.

00:00:20.038 --> 00:00:21.615
And in the next 200 years,

00:00:21.639 --> 00:00:25.273
we expect all our glaciers
to follow the same path.

00:00:27.821 --> 00:00:29.846
This glacier here is one of them:

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.332
Sólheimajökull,
in the south coast of Iceland.
