00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What I'm going to try and do in the next 15 minutes or so

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is tell you about an idea

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of how we're going to make matter come alive.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now this may seem a bit ambitious,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but when you look at yourself, you look at your hands,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
you realize that you're alive.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So this is a start.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now this quest started four billion years ago on planet Earth.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There's been four billion years

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
of organic, biological life.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And as an inorganic chemist,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
my friends and colleagues make this distinction

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
between the organic, living world

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and the inorganic, dead world.
