00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I, for one -- and I'm not kidding --

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Who needed it though? Meat was everywhere.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
What could be easier, more filling or healthier for your family

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
than broiling a steak?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Rather than spending their lives eating grass,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
for which their stomachs were designed,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
they were forced to eat soy and corn.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
They have trouble digesting those grains, of course,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
but that wasn't a problem for producers.
