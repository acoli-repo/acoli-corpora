Now global warming was unforeseen.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Maybe a few lung diseases here and there,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
is the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Now, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here,
