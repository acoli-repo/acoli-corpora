00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Thus arrived convenience.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
It was sold to proto-feminist housewives

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
as a way to cut down on housework.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Now, I know everybody over the age of, like 45 --

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
their mouths are watering at this point.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
(Laughter)

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
(Applause)

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
If we had a slide of Salisbury steak, even more so, right?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
(Laughter)

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
But this may have cut down on housework,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad.
