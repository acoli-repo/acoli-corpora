00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
is someone who eats only locally grown food --

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
which is fine if you live in California,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Between the official story -- the food pyramid --

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and the hip locavore vision,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
you have two versions of how to improve our eating.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
(Laughter).

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
They both get it wrong, though.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
The first at least is populist, and the second is elitist.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And I'm going to go through that,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
at least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now.
