00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Now, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
but the evidence is that plants -- and I want to make this clear --

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
it's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
The evidence is very clear that plants promote health.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
This evidence is overwhelming at this point.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
You eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Not bad.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
But back to animals and junk food.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
What do they have in common?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
One: we don't need either of them for health.
