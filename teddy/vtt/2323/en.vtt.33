30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
to raising the animals we'll eat.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And if the numbers coming in from China

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
are anything like what they look like now,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
it's not going to be 40 years.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
The most common argument is that we need nutrients --

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
even though we eat, on average, twice as much protein
