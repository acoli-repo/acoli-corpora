than anywhere in the rest of the world.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And that's the direct result of eating a Western diet.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Our demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates --

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day --

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
our demand for these things, not our need, our want,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Now global warming was unforeseen.
