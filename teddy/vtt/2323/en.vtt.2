00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Start with the notion that global warming

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
is not only real, but dangerous.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Since every scientist in the world now believes this,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and even President Bush has seen the light, or pretends to,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
we can take this is a given.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Then hear this, please.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
After energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
to atmosphere-altering gases.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
is generated by livestock production --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
more than transportation.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts,
