00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So, when the USDA finally acknowledged

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
that it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
they encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and that plants and whole grains

should be supplanting eating junk food.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
But industry lobbyists would never let that happen.

And guess what?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
have ties to agribusiness.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So, instead of substituting plants for animals,
