can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000

Back in those days, before even Julia,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
back in those days, there was no philosophy of food.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
You just ate.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
You didn't claim to be anything.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
There was no marketing. There were no national brands.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Vitamins had not been invented.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
There were no health claims, at least not federally sanctioned ones.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Fats, carbs, proteins -- they weren't bad or good, they were food.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
You ate food.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
because it was an ingredient.
