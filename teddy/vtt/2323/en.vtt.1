00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, that is only a little bit hyperbolic.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And why do I say it?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Because only once before has the fate of individual people

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and the fate of all of humanity

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
been so intertwined.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
There was the bomb, and there's now.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And where we go from here is going to determine

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
not only the quality and the length of our individual lives,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
we'd recognize it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It's a holocaust of a different kind,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and hiding under our desks isn't going to help.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Start with the notion that global warming
