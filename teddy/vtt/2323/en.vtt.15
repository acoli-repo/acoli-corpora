00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
at least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
A hundred years ago, guess what?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Everyone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Every family had a cook, usually a mom.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And those moms bought and prepared food.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It was like your romantic vision of Europe.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Margarine didn't exist.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
In fact, when margarine was invented,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
so we'd all know that it was a fake.
