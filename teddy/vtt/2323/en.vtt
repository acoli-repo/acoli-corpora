00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I write about food. I write about cooking.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I take it quite seriously,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but I'm here to talk about something

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that's become very important to me in the last year or two.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm not a vegetarian -- this is the old Nixon line, right?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But I still think that this --

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
(Laughter)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
-- may be this year's version of this.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, that is only a little bit hyperbolic.
