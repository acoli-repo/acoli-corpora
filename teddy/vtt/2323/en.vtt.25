00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
By the '70s, forward-thinking people

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
began to recognize the value of local ingredients.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
We tended gardens, we became interested in organic food,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
we knew or we were vegetarians.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
We weren't all hippies, either.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Meanwhile, food production had become industrial. Industrial.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Perhaps because it was being produced rationally,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
as if it were plastic,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
food gained magical or poisonous powers, or both.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Many people became fat-phobic.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Others worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like.
