00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
because it was an ingredient.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
The cornflake hadn't been invented.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
(Laughter)

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
The Pop-Tart, the Pringle, Cheez Whiz, none of that stuff.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Goldfish swam.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
(Laughter)

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
It's hard to imagine. People grew food, and they ate food.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And again, everyone ate local.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
In New York, an orange was a common Christmas present,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
because it came all the way from Florida.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
From the '30s on, road systems expanded,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
trucks took the place of railroads,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
fresh food began to travel more.
