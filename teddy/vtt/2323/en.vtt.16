00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
so we'd all know that it was a fake.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
There was no snack food, and until the '20s,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
until Clarence Birdseye came along, there was no frozen food.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
There were no restaurant chains.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
but none of them would think to open another one.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And fancy food was entirely French.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
As an aside, those of you who remember

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Dan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide.
