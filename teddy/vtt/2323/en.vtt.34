00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
as even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
But listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
What do you think we eat per day? Half a pound.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
But don't we need meat to be big and strong?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Isn't meat eating essential to health?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Won't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
turn us into godless, sissy, liberals?
