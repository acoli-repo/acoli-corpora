00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So, instead of substituting plants for animals,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
our swollen appetites simply became larger,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
So-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets --

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
these are not solutions.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
But with lots of intelligent people

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
focusing on whether food is organic or local,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
or whether we're being nice to animals,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
the most important issues just aren't being addressed.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Now, don't get me wrong.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I like animals,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production
