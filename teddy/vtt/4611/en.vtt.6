Phytoplankton are the base
for the largest food web in the world.

00:03:06.983 --> 00:03:08.621
During the night,

00:03:08.645 --> 00:03:11.237
many animals like me
would rise up from the depths

00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:14.136
to feed on this sun-powered feast.

00:03:15.056 --> 00:03:16.681
(Maraca sound)

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.732
I was part of the largest daily
migration of life on Earth.

00:03:25.197 --> 00:03:26.760
During the day,

00:03:26.784 --> 00:03:30.927
I'd return to the darkness,
where I'd join my bizarre companions.
