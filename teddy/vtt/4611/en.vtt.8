while others just take
a bite out of their cousins.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.729
And siphonophores

00:04:06.753 --> 00:04:09.341
that catch prey with toxic fishing lures.

00:04:15.246 --> 00:04:19.024
But my favorite would have
to be the crustacean Phronima.

00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:23.568
Its monstrous looks inspired
the movie "Aliens."

00:04:25.215 --> 00:04:28.052
It can catch tiny bits in its bristles,

00:04:28.076 --> 00:04:30.765
but prefers larger prey like salps.
