00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:30.814
How did I get here?

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:35.557
Well, it's a stranger story
than you might think.

00:00:37.028 --> 00:00:40.283
I came from a world of drifters,

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:42.886
a place few humans have ever seen.

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:45.585
The world of plankton.

00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:52.158
I came from a batch of a million eggs,
and only a few of us survived.

00:00:55.092 --> 00:00:58.732
When I became a larva,
I moved among other drifters.

00:00:59.472 --> 00:01:04.125
["Plankton" comes from the Greek
"planktos" for wandering]
