00:03:26.784 --> 00:03:30.927
I'd return to the darkness,
where I'd join my bizarre companions.

00:03:32.682 --> 00:03:34.205
(High pitch buzz)

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:35.422
(Flapping noises)

00:03:35.446 --> 00:03:38.560
Cannibals, like this
sea butterfly mollusk,

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:40.261
that eats its next of kin.

00:03:44.983 --> 00:03:46.621
And comb jellies,

00:03:46.645 --> 00:03:49.864
that beat cilia like rainbowed eyelashes.

00:03:55.907 --> 00:03:58.752
Some of these snare
their prey with sticky tentacles,

00:03:59.834 --> 00:04:03.192
while others just take
a bite out of their cousins.
