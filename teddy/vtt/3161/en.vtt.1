00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:33.387
I want to give you a vision
of what that would look like.

00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:37.768
This is the first time
we've shared this publicly.

00:00:38.498 --> 00:00:40.720
You're the first audience to hear it.

00:00:42.204 --> 00:00:44.585
We are going to launch a rocket.

00:00:45.347 --> 00:00:47.260
And on that rocket will be a satellite.

00:00:47.284 --> 00:00:50.766
And that satellite will collect
data about pollution

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.590
that is warming the planet.

00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:56.442
We will put that data
in the hands of people

00:00:56.466 --> 00:01:00.125
who can make simple fixes
