00:07:30.252 --> 00:07:33.482
Can you see we're entering
a whole new era of innovation

00:07:33.506 --> 00:07:35.572
that is supercharging progress?

00:07:35.998 --> 00:07:38.331
Can you see that it's in our hands?

00:07:39.752 --> 00:07:43.291
We've set an aggressive goal
of three years till liftoff,

00:07:43.315 --> 00:07:47.198
and when that satellite is ready,
we'll have a launch party.

00:07:48.284 --> 00:07:49.817
A literal launch party.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:56.375
So imagine a blue-sky day,
crowds of people,

00:07:56.399 --> 00:07:58.299
television cameras,

00:07:58.323 --> 00:08:00.856
kids staring up toward the sky
