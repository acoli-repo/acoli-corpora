So, as it's produced and processed

00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:35.538
and transported to homes
and businesses across America,

00:03:35.562 --> 00:03:41.067
it escapes from wells and pipes
and other equipment.

00:03:41.435 --> 00:03:44.213
It gets up into the sky and contributes

00:03:44.237 --> 00:03:47.304
to the disasters
that we're now experiencing.

00:03:48.467 --> 00:03:50.467
That does not have to happen.

00:03:51.712 --> 00:03:53.728
But nobody had paid much attention to it

00:03:53.752 --> 00:03:57.489
until we launched a nationwide study
to understand the problem.

00:03:58.061 --> 00:04:04.513
We used drones, planes, helicopters,
even Google Street View cars.
