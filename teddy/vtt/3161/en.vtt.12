00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:01.434
Citizens will be empowered to take action;

00:06:01.458 --> 00:06:04.258
governments will tighten the regulations.

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:09.149
And because all of our data
will be free and public,

00:06:09.173 --> 00:06:10.554
there will be transparency --

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:15.023
we'll all be able to see how much progress
is being made and where.

00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:17.450
Which brings me to our goal:

00:06:17.474 --> 00:06:22.720
to cut this methane pollution
by 45 percent by 2025.

00:06:23.526 --> 00:06:30.363
