00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.770
We've got a big problem on our hands
with global warming.

00:00:04.794 --> 00:00:09.815
A lot of you, a lot of people
have been watching the floods,

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.239
the droughts, the storms, the fires.

00:00:14.712 --> 00:00:18.434
When I leave this stage today,
I don't want you to have hope.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:24.053
I want you to have certainty,
real certainty

00:00:24.077 --> 00:00:28.529
that we can make a dent
in this problem and live to see it.
