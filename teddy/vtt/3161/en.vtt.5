00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:36.318
Pound for pound, its immediate impact
is far greater than carbon dioxide.

00:02:37.173 --> 00:02:41.797
Eighty four times greater
over a 20-year period.

00:02:44.022 --> 00:02:46.594
One of the largest sources
of methane pollution

00:02:46.618 --> 00:02:48.485
is the oil and gas industry.

00:02:49.038 --> 00:02:52.638
But that's not obvious,
because methane is invisible.

00:02:53.411 --> 00:02:56.299
Let's take a look
at this natural gas storage facility

00:02:56.323 --> 00:02:58.053
outside of Los Angeles.

00:02:58.657 --> 00:03:00.257
Can you see the methane?
