00:02:58.657 --> 00:03:00.257
Can you see the methane?

00:03:02.022 --> 00:03:03.172
Neither can I.

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:04.933
How about now?

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.672
We shot this using an infrared camera,
at the same spot,

00:03:09.696 --> 00:03:14.256
exposing one of the worst methane leaks
in the history of the United States.

00:03:14.847 --> 00:03:16.823
That's a very different picture.

00:03:17.251 --> 00:03:21.910
It turns out that natural gas
is displacing our dependence on coal,

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:24.672
which emits far more carbon dioxide.

00:03:25.466 --> 00:03:27.847
But natural gas is mostly methane.

00:03:28.427 --> 00:03:30.967
So, as it's produced and processed
