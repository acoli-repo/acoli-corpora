00:01:58.949 --> 00:02:01.617
Because of the power of information,

00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:03.950
information from technology

00:02:03.974 --> 00:02:07.390
that is coming down in price
and going up in precision.

00:02:09.014 --> 00:02:12.815
You see, there's something
about climate change that we didn't grasp

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:14.188
just a decade ago.

00:02:14.855 --> 00:02:18.947
The world was so focused on carbon dioxide

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:22.288
that we overlooked another important gas.

00:02:22.312 --> 00:02:24.245
We didn't appreciate methane.

00:02:25.236 --> 00:02:28.283
Methane pollution causes one quarter
of the global warming

00:02:28.307 --> 00:02:30.574
that we're experiencing right now.
