(Applause)

00:06:30.387 --> 00:06:33.982
That will have the same near-term impact

00:06:34.006 --> 00:06:38.426
as shutting down
1,300 coal-fired power plants.

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:43.548
That's one third of all
the coal-fired power plants in the world.

00:06:43.997 --> 00:06:48.983
Nothing else can have this sort of
near-term impact at such a low cost.

00:06:50.302 --> 00:06:52.945
The fact that a single satellite

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:57.655
can help us put the brakes
on global warming is truly remarkable.

00:06:58.482 --> 00:07:02.823
This is our chance to create
change in our lifetimes,
