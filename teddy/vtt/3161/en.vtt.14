00:06:58.482 --> 00:07:02.823
This is our chance to create
change in our lifetimes,

00:07:02.847 --> 00:07:04.743
and we can do it now.

00:07:05.648 --> 00:07:08.482
Thanks to the generous giving
of the Audacious Project,

00:07:08.506 --> 00:07:10.706
we are on a path toward liftoff.

00:07:11.665 --> 00:07:15.641
But my time is running short,
and I promised you a vision

00:07:15.665 --> 00:07:18.738
of what a critical piece
of the solution would look like.

00:07:20.744 --> 00:07:21.894
Can you see it?

00:07:23.378 --> 00:07:25.426
Can you see how this satellite leverages

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.002
the best of science
and data and technology?
