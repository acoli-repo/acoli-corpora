00:12:59.649 --> 00:13:03.603
I'm going to be very quick
because I want to show you the latest.

00:13:03.603 --> 00:13:09.173
But what you see here
is the first rat getting informed

00:13:09.192 --> 00:13:12.125
by a light that is going to show up
on the left of the cage

00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:15.865
that he has to press the left cage
to basically get a reward.

00:13:15.865 --> 00:13:17.658
He goes there and does it.

00:13:17.658 --> 00:13:19.984
And the same time,
he is sending a mental message

00:13:19.984 --> 00:13:23.007
to the second rat
that didn't see any light,

00:13:23.007 --> 00:13:25.368
and the second rat,
in 70 percent of the times

00:13:25.368 --> 00:13:29.581
is going to press the left lever
and get a reward

00:13:29.581 --> 00:13:33.716
without ever experiencing
the light in the retina.
