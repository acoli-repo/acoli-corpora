00:00:57.062 --> 00:01:02.394
Juliano Pinto delivered the opening kick

00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:08.410
of the 2014 Brazilian 
World Soccer Cup here

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.880
just by thinking.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.697
He could not move his body,

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:17.584
but he could imagine the movements
needed to kick a ball.

00:01:17.584 --> 00:01:20.838
He was an athlete before the lesion.
He's a para-athlete right now.

00:01:20.838 --> 00:01:24.300
He's going to be in the Paralympic Games,
I hope, in a couple years.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.882
But what the spinal cord lesion 
did not rob from Juliano

00:01:28.882 --> 00:01:31.883
was his ability to dream.
