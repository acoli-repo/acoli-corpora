00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:01.171
it's just brain research.

00:03:01.171 --> 00:03:04.418
It's nothing but using sensors

00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:07.965
to read the electrical brainstorms
that a brain is producing

00:03:07.965 --> 00:03:09.971
to generate the motor commands

00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:12.184
that have to be downloaded
to the spinal cord,

00:03:12.184 --> 00:03:14.847
so we projected sensors that can read

00:03:14.847 --> 00:03:18.362
hundreds and now thousands
of these brain cells simultaneously,

00:03:18.362 --> 00:03:21.408
and extract from these electrical signals

00:03:21.408 --> 00:03:24.293
the motor planning
that the brain is generating

00:03:24.293 --> 00:03:27.256
to actually make us move into space.

00:03:27.256 --> 00:03:30.942
And by doing that, we converted
these signals into digital commands
