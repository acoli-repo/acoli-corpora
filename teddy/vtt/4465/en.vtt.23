00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.768
Basically, the blue lights pulsating
indicate that the exo is ready to go.

00:11:34.768 --> 00:11:37.843
It can receive thoughts
and it can deliver feedback,

00:11:37.843 --> 00:11:40.861
and when Juliano
makes the decision to kick the ball,

00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:43.964
you are going to see
two streams of green and yellow light

00:11:43.964 --> 00:11:46.641
coming from the helmet
and going to the legs,

00:11:46.641 --> 00:11:50.742
representing the mental commands
that were taken by the exo

00:11:50.742 --> 00:11:52.641
to actually make that happen.

00:11:52.641 --> 00:11:55.336
And in basically 13 seconds,

00:11:55.336 --> 00:11:57.419
Juliano actually did.

00:11:57.419 --> 00:11:59.135
You can see the commands.

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:03.475
He gets ready, 
the ball is set, and he kicks.
