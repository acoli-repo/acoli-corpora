00:04:27.025 --> 00:04:31.429
as it explores three different
visually identical spheres

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:33.088
in virtual space.

00:04:33.088 --> 00:04:37.130
And to get a reward,
a drop of orange juice that monkeys love,

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.942
this animal has to detect,
select one of these objects

00:04:40.942 --> 00:04:42.703
by touching,

00:04:42.703 --> 00:04:44.355
not by seeing it, by touching it,

00:04:44.355 --> 00:04:47.400
because every time this virtual hand
touches one of the objects,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.483
an electrical pulse goes back
to the brain of the animal

00:04:50.483 --> 00:04:54.876
describing the fine texture
of the surface of this object,

00:04:54.876 --> 00:04:58.774
so the animal can judge what is 
the correct object that he has to grab,

00:04:58.774 --> 00:05:04.018
and if he does that, he gets a reward
without moving a muscle.
