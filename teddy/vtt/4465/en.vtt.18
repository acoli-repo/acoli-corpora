that can be commanded by brain signals

00:09:02.707 --> 00:09:06.925
recorded by a non-invasive technology
called electroencephalography

00:09:06.925 --> 00:09:10.114
that can basically allow the patient
to imagine the movements

00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:14.065
and send his commands
to the controls, the motors,

00:09:14.065 --> 00:09:15.867
and get it done.

00:09:15.867 --> 00:09:18.730
This exoskeleton was covered
with an artificial skin

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.814
invented by Gordon Cheng,
one of my greatest friends, in Munich,

00:09:22.814 --> 00:09:27.400
to allow sensation from the joints moving
and the foot touching the ground

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.940
to be delivered back to the patient
through a vest, a shirt.
