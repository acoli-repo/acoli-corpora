00:05:25.887 --> 00:05:30.190
to actually use the brain-machine
interface to regain mobility.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.368
The idea was that if you suffered --

00:05:32.368 --> 00:05:34.641
and that can happen to any one of us.

00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:36.653
Let me tell you, it's very sudden.

00:05:36.653 --> 00:05:38.378
It's a millisecond of a collision,

00:05:38.378 --> 00:05:41.840
a car accident that
transforms your life completely.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.697
If you have a complete lesion
of the spinal cord,

00:05:44.697 --> 00:05:48.080
you cannot move because your brainstorms
cannot reach your muscles.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.330
However, your brainstorms
continue to be generated in your head.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.245
Paraplegic, quadriplegic patients
dream about moving every night.

00:05:56.245 --> 00:05:58.397
They have that inside their head.

00:05:58.397 --> 00:06:01.738
The problem is how
to get that code out of it
