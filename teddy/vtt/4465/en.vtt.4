00:01:58.795 --> 00:02:01.561
because it has about 100 billion elements

00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:04.263
talking to each other
through electrical brainstorms,

00:02:04.263 --> 00:02:09.504
what Juliano accomplished
took 30 years to imagine in laboratories

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:12.107
and about 15 years to plan.

00:02:12.107 --> 00:02:16.606
When John Chapin and I,
15 years ago, proposed in a paper

00:02:16.606 --> 00:02:21.788
that we would build something
that we called a brain-machine interface,

00:02:21.788 --> 00:02:24.745
meaning connecting a brain to devices

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:28.289
so that animals and humans
could just move these devices,

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.140
no matter how far they are
from their own bodies,
