next to the subject, next door,
or across the planet.

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:07.670
And as this message gave feedback
back to the brain,

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.888
the brain realized its goal:
to make us move.

00:04:11.888 --> 00:04:15.346
So this is just one experiment
that we published a few years ago,

00:04:15.346 --> 00:04:17.673
where a monkey, without moving its body,

00:04:17.673 --> 00:04:21.777
learned to control the movements
of an avatar arm,

00:04:21.777 --> 00:04:23.823
a virtual arm that doesn't exist.

00:04:23.823 --> 00:04:27.025
What you're listening to
is the sound of the brain of this monkey

00:04:27.025 --> 00:04:31.429
as it explores three different
visually identical spheres
