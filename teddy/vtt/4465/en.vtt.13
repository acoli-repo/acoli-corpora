00:06:26.768 --> 00:06:32.242
What I'm going to show you is how
156 people from 25 countries

00:06:32.242 --> 00:06:35.011
all over the five continents
of this beautiful Earth,

00:06:35.011 --> 00:06:38.029
dropped their lives,
dropped their patents,

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:42.139
dropped their dogs, wives,
kids, school, jobs,

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:47.656
and congregated to come to Brazil
for 18 months to actually get this done.

00:06:47.656 --> 00:06:51.531
Because a couple years after Brazil
was awarded the World Cup,

00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:55.183
we heard that the Brazilian government
wanted to do something meaningful

00:06:55.183 --> 00:06:56.881
in the opening ceremony

00:06:56.881 --> 00:07:00.621
in the country that reinvented
and perfected soccer
