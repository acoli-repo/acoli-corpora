The first brain-controlled
exoskeleton to be built

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.896
was named after the most famous
Brazilian scientist ever,

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:18.869
Alberto Santos Dumont,

00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:24.672
who, on October 19, 1901,

00:08:24.672 --> 00:08:31.899
the first controlled airship on air
in Paris for a million people to see.
