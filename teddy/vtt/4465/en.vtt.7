00:03:27.256 --> 00:03:30.942
And by doing that, we converted
these signals into digital commands

00:03:30.942 --> 00:03:35.934
that any mechanical, electronic,
or even a virtual device can understand

00:03:35.934 --> 00:03:42.490
so that the subject can imagine
what he, she or it wants to make move,

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.941
and the device obeys that brain command.

00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:49.845
By sensorizing these devices
with lots of different types of sensors,

00:03:49.845 --> 00:03:51.630
as you are going to see in a moment,

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.099
we actually sent messages
back to the brain to confirm

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.054
that that voluntary motor will
was being enacted, no matter where --

00:03:59.054 --> 00:04:04.429
next to the subject, next door,
or across the planet.
