00:05:58.397 --> 00:06:01.738
The problem is how
to get that code out of it

00:06:01.738 --> 00:06:04.662
and make the movement be created again.

00:06:04.662 --> 00:06:07.883
So what we proposed was,
let's create a new body.

00:06:07.883 --> 00:06:09.619
Let's create a robotic vest.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:14.462
And that's exactly why Juliano could
kick that ball just by thinking,

00:06:14.462 --> 00:06:18.781
because he was wearing
the first brain-controlled robotic vest

00:06:18.781 --> 00:06:22.060
that can be used by paraplegic,
quadriplegic patients to move

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.871
and to regain feedback.

00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:26.768
That was the original idea, 15 years ago.

00:06:26.768 --> 00:06:32.242
What I'm going to show you is how
