00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.140
no matter how far they are
from their own bodies,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.726
just by imagining what they want to do,

00:02:32.726 --> 00:02:37.313
our colleagues told us that
we actually needed professional help,

00:02:37.313 --> 00:02:40.010
of the psychiatry variety.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.452
And despite that,
a Scot and a Brazilian persevered,

00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:50.471
because that's how we were raised
in our respective countries,

00:02:50.471 --> 00:02:52.607
and for 12, 15 years,

00:02:52.607 --> 00:02:56.996
we made demonstration after demonstration
suggesting that this was possible.

00:02:56.996 --> 00:02:59.445
And a brain-machine interface
is not rocket science,

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:01.171
it's just brain research.
