and if he does that, he gets a reward
without moving a muscle.

00:05:04.018 --> 00:05:06.498
The perfect Brazilian lunch:

00:05:06.498 --> 00:05:10.213
not moving a muscle
and getting your orange juice.

00:05:10.213 --> 00:05:13.017
So as we saw this happening,

00:05:13.017 --> 00:05:17.962
we actually came and proposed the idea
that we had published 15 years ago.

00:05:17.962 --> 00:05:19.991
We reenacted this paper.

00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:21.960
We got it out of the drawers,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.887
and we proposed that perhaps we could get
a human being that is paralyzed

00:05:25.887 --> 00:05:30.190
to actually use the brain-machine
interface to regain mobility.
