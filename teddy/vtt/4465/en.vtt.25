00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:31.282
the first brain-to-brain interface

00:12:31.282 --> 00:12:34.909
that allows two animals
to exchange mental messages

00:12:34.909 --> 00:12:38.485
so that one animal that sees something
coming from the environment

00:12:38.485 --> 00:12:44.037
can send a mental SMS,
a torpedo, a neurophysiological torpedo,

00:12:44.042 --> 00:12:45.648
to the second animal,

00:12:45.648 --> 00:12:49.525
and the second animal performs
the act that he needed to perform

00:12:49.525 --> 00:12:53.983
without ever knowing what
the environment was sending as a message,

00:12:53.983 --> 00:12:57.279
because the message came
from the first animal's brain.

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:59.649
So this is the first demo.

00:12:59.649 --> 00:13:03.603
I'm going to be very quick
because I want to show you the latest.
