through a vest, a shirt.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.910
It is a smart shirt

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:39.733
that basically delivers the feedback
and fools the patient's brain

00:09:39.733 --> 00:09:43.204
by creating a sensation that it is not
a machine that is carrying him,

00:09:43.204 --> 00:09:46.454
but it is he who is walking again.

00:09:46.454 --> 00:09:49.313

00:09:49.313 --> 00:09:54.003
is the first time one of our patients,
Bruno, actually walked.

00:09:54.003 --> 00:09:56.881
And he takes a few seconds
because we are setting everything,

00:09:56.881 --> 00:10:00.178
and you are going to see a blue light
cutting in front of the helmet
