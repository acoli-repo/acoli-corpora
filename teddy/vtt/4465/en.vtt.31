Thank you.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.004
Bruno Giussani: Miguel,
thank you for sticking to your time.

00:15:51.004 --> 00:15:53.529
I actually would have given you
a couple more minutes,

00:15:53.529 --> 00:15:56.913
because there are a couple of points
we want to develop, and, of course,

00:15:56.913 --> 00:16:00.810
clearly it seems that we need connected 
brains to figure out where this is going.
