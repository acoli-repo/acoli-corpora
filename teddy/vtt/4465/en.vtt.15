00:07:27.104 --> 00:07:30.472
well, let's have the kickoff
of the 2014 World Cup

00:07:30.472 --> 00:07:32.844
be given by a Brazilian paraplegic

00:07:32.844 --> 00:07:37.734
using a brain-controlled exoskeleton
that allows him to kick the ball

00:07:37.734 --> 00:07:40.010
and to feel the contact of the ball.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.624
They looked at us,
thought that we were completely nuts,

00:07:42.624 --> 00:07:45.480
and said, "Okay, let's try."

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.720
We had 18 months to do everything
from zero, from scratch.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.956
We had no exoskeleton, we had no patients,

00:07:52.956 --> 00:07:54.173
we had nothing done.

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:56.509
These people came all together

00:07:56.509 --> 00:08:00.757
and in 18 months, we got eight patients
in a routine of training
