00:00:07.163 --> 00:00:09.663
You’re the realm’s greatest mathematician,

00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:13.079
but ever since you criticized
the emperor's tax laws,

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:17.371
you’ve been locked in the dungeon 
with only a marker to count the days.

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:21.038
But one day you're suddenly brought
before the emperor,

00:00:21.246 --> 00:00:23.371
who looks even angrier than usual.

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.996
One of his 12 governors has been convicted
of paying his taxes

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:29.621
with a counterfeit coin,

00:00:29.621 --> 00:00:32.329
which has already made its way 
into the Treasury.
