00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:02.163
Now take three of them and weigh them
against three unmarked coins.

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.413
If they balance, the remaining unmarked
coin must be the fake.

00:02:06.913 --> 00:02:11.163
If they don’t, draw a plus 
on the three unmarked coins

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:14.288
if they’re heavier, 
or a minus if they’re lighter.

00:02:14.788 --> 00:02:18.996
Now take two of the newly marked coins
and weigh them against each other.

00:02:19.413 --> 00:02:21.996
If they balance, the third coin is fake.

00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:24.329
Otherwise, look at their marks.

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.954
If they are plus coins, 
the heavier one is the impostor.

00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:30.829
If they are marked with minus,
it's the lighter one.
