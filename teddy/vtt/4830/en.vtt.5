00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:30.829
If they are marked with minus,
it's the lighter one.

00:02:31.496 --> 00:02:35.079
But what if the first two piles
you way don't balance?

00:02:35.954 --> 00:02:39.121
Mark the coins on the heavier side
with a plus

00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:41.829
and those on the lighter side 
with a minus.

00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:46.288
You can also mark the remaining four
coins with zeros,

00:02:46.663 --> 00:02:50.538
since you know the fake one 
is already somewhere on the scale.

00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:53.371
Now you'll need to think strategically

00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:57.829
so you can remove all remaining ambiguity
in just two more ways.

00:02:58.163 --> 00:03:01.246
To do this, you’ll need 
to reassemble the piles.
