00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.746
You look around for
anything else you can use,

00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:05.704
but there's nothing in the room,
just the coins,

00:01:05.704 --> 00:01:08.329
the scale, and your trusty marker.

00:01:08.663 --> 00:01:10.454
How do you identify the counterfeit?

00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:13.996
Pause now to figure it out yourself!

00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:22.954
Obviously, you can't weigh each coin
against all of the others,

00:01:22.954 --> 00:01:25.954
so you’ll have to weigh several coins
at the same time

00:01:25.954 --> 00:01:28.788
by splitting the stack 
into multiple piles,

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:31.913
then narrowing down where
the false coin is.
