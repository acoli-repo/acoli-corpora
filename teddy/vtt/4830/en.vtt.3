00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:31.913
then narrowing down where
the false coin is.

00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:36.871
Start by dividing the 12 coins 
into three equal piles of four.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.288
Placing two of these on the scale
gives us two possible outcomes.

00:01:42.496 --> 00:01:46.871
If the two sides balance, 
all eight coins on the scale are real

00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:49.538
and the fake must be among 
the remaining four.

00:01:50.121 --> 00:01:54.038
So how do you keep track of these results?
That’s where the marker comes in.

00:01:54.371 --> 00:01:57.288
Mark the eight authentic
coins with a zero.

00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:02.163
Now take three of them and weigh them
against three unmarked coins.
