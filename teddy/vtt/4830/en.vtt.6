00:02:58.163 --> 00:03:01.246
To do this, you’ll need 
to reassemble the piles.

00:03:01.663 --> 00:03:04.704
One method is to replace three 
of the plus coins

00:03:04.704 --> 00:03:06.788
with three of the minus coins

00:03:06.788 --> 00:03:10.079
and replace those
with three of the zero coins.

00:03:10.663 --> 00:03:12.954
From here, you have three possibilities.

00:03:13.746 --> 00:03:17.246
If the previously heavier side 
of the scale is still heavier,

00:03:17.454 --> 00:03:20.788
that means either the remaining 
plus coin on that side

00:03:20.788 --> 00:03:22.621
is actually the heavier one,

00:03:22.621 --> 00:03:27.371
or the remaining minus coin on the 
lighter side is actually the lighter one.

00:03:27.954 --> 00:03:31.704
Choose either one of them and weigh it 
against one of the regular coins
