00:03:27.954 --> 00:03:31.704
Choose either one of them and weigh it 
against one of the regular coins

00:03:31.704 --> 00:03:33.163
to see which is true.

00:03:33.454 --> 00:03:36.288
If the previously heavier side 
became lighter,

00:03:36.288 --> 00:03:40.746
that means one of the three minus coins
you moved is actually the lighter one.

00:03:41.204 --> 00:03:43.454
Weigh two of them against each other.

00:03:43.663 --> 00:03:46.163
If they balance, the third is counterfeit.

00:03:46.371 --> 00:03:48.954
If not, the lighter one is.

00:03:49.538 --> 00:03:53.454
Similarly, if the two sides balanced
after your substitution,

00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:57.788
then one of the three plus coins 
you removed must be the heavier one.

00:03:58.246 --> 00:04:00.329
Weigh two of them against each other.
