How much money do we need

00:00:03.332 --> 00:00:07.670
in order to remove a significant
amount of carbon dioxide

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:09.380
out of our atmosphere?

00:00:09.964 --> 00:00:13.009
And what are the mechanisms
that we should use

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.636
to spend all of that money?

00:00:16.554 --> 00:00:18.973
I'm the head of sustainability at Shopify,

00:00:19.015 --> 00:00:23.144
a company you may not know
but you might interact with every day

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:27.774
because our technology
powers millions of online retailers.

00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:29.942
In 2019,

00:00:29.942 --> 00:00:33.112
we wanted to become
a carbon-neutral company
