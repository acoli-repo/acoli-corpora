00:00:01.575 --> 00:00:04.682
I'd like to start with a simple question:

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.840
Why do the poor make
so many poor decisions?

00:00:11.852 --> 00:00:13.403
I know it's a harsh question,

00:00:13.427 --> 00:00:15.392
but take a look at the data.

00:00:15.416 --> 00:00:17.259
The poor borrow more, save less,

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.942
smoke more, exercise less, drink more

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.486
and eat less healthfully.

00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:23.533
Why?

00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:25.978
Well, the standard explanation

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:29.382
was once summed up by the British
Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.

00:00:29.406 --> 00:00:32.791
And she called poverty
"a personality defect."
