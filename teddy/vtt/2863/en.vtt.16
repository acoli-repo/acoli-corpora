In 1974, everybody in this small town
was guaranteed a basic income,

00:08:02.655 --> 00:08:05.390
ensuring that no one fell
below the poverty line.

00:08:05.414 --> 00:08:07.010
At the start of the experiment,

00:08:07.034 --> 00:08:10.507
an army of researchers
descended on the town.

00:08:11.367 --> 00:08:13.898
For four years, all went well.

00:08:14.511 --> 00:08:17.943
But then a new government
was voted into power,

00:08:17.967 --> 00:08:21.477
and the new Canadian cabinet saw
little point to the expensive experiment.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:25.754
So when it became clear there was
no money left to analyze the results,

00:08:25.778 --> 00:08:30.580
the researchers decided to pack
their files away in some 2,000 boxes.
