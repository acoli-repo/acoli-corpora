00:08:25.778 --> 00:08:30.580
the researchers decided to pack
their files away in some 2,000 boxes.

00:08:32.175 --> 00:08:34.965
Twenty-five years went by,

00:08:34.989 --> 00:08:37.677
and then Evelyn Forget,
a Canadian professor,

00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:38.917
found the records.

00:08:38.941 --> 00:08:42.908
For three years, she subjected the data
to all manner of statistical analysis,

00:08:42.932 --> 00:08:44.518
and no matter what she tried,

00:08:44.542 --> 00:08:47.278
the results were the same every time:

00:08:47.968 --> 00:08:51.786
the experiment had been
a resounding success.

00:08:53.311 --> 00:08:54.471
Evelyn Forget discovered

00:08:54.495 --> 00:08:57.079
that the people in Dauphin
had not only become richer

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:58.634
but also smarter and healthier.

00:08:58.658 --> 00:09:02.164
The school performance of kids
improved substantially.
