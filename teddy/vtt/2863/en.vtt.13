00:06:26.522 --> 00:06:30.497
But is this really
an old-fashioned, leftist idea?

00:06:31.394 --> 00:06:33.381
I remembered reading about an old plan --

00:06:33.405 --> 00:06:36.889
something that has been proposed
by some of history's leading thinkers.

00:06:36.913 --> 00:06:40.729
The philosopher Thomas More
first hinted at it in his book, "Utopia,"

00:06:40.753 --> 00:06:42.652
more than 500 years ago.

00:06:43.205 --> 00:06:46.755
And its proponents have spanned
the spectrum from the left to the right,

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:49.549
from the civil rights campaigner,
Martin Luther King,

00:06:49.573 --> 00:06:52.324
to the economist Milton Friedman.

00:06:53.273 --> 00:06:56.093
And it's an incredibly simple idea:

00:06:57.243 --> 00:06:59.878
basic income guarantee.
