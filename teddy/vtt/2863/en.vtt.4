What they subsequently discovered
completely blew my mind.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.608
The farmers scored much worse
on the test before the harvest.

00:02:08.457 --> 00:02:10.757
The effects of living
in poverty, it turns out,

00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:14.149
correspond to losing 14 points of IQ.

00:02:14.173 --> 00:02:16.042
Now, to give you an idea,

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:18.507
that's comparable
to losing a night's sleep

00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:20.704
or the effects of alcoholism.

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:24.944
A few months later,
I heard that Eldar Shafir,

00:02:24.968 --> 00:02:28.515
a professor at Princeton University
and one of the authors of this study,

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.858
was coming over to Holland, where I live.
