00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:02.083
But the underlying assumption is the same:

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.224
there's something wrong with them.

00:01:06.057 --> 00:01:07.915
If we could just change them,

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.431
if we could just teach them
how to live their lives,

00:01:10.455 --> 00:01:11.988
if they would only listen.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:14.930
And to be honest,

00:01:14.954 --> 00:01:18.292
this was what I thought for a long time.

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:21.192
It was only a few years ago
that I discovered

00:01:21.216 --> 00:01:24.713
that everything I thought I knew
about poverty was wrong.

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:28.937
It all started when I accidentally
stumbled upon a paper

00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:30.569
by a few American psychologists.
