00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.315
A recent analysis of 201 studies

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:03.651
on the effectiveness
of money-management training

00:04:03.675 --> 00:04:07.424
came to the conclusion

00:04:07.448 --> 00:04:08.893
Now, don't get me wrong --

00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:11.413
this is not to say the poor
don't learn anything --

00:04:11.437 --> 00:04:13.342

and then throwing them in a stormy sea."

00:04:24.688 --> 00:04:26.283

00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:30.448
