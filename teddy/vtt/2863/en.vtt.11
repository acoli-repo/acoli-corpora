00:05:26.422 --> 00:05:31.129
This type of solution is hugely popular
with modern politicians,

00:05:31.153 --> 00:05:32.856
mostly because,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.940
well, they cost next to nothing.

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:40.145
These solutions are, I think,
a symbol of this era

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.346
in which we so often treat the symptoms,

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.213
but ignore the underlying cause.

00:05:45.674 --> 00:05:46.928
So I wonder:

00:05:47.786 --> 00:05:51.133
Why don't we just change the context
in which the poor live?

00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:53.850
Or, going back to our computer analogy:

00:05:53.874 --> 00:05:56.011
Why keep tinkering around
with the software

00:05:56.035 --> 00:06:00.100
when we can easily solve the problem
by installing some extra memory instead?
