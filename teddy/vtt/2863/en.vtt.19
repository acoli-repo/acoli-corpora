00:09:29.613 --> 00:09:30.833
So ...

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.014
here's what I've learned.

00:09:33.995 --> 00:09:36.151
When it comes to poverty,

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:41.291
we, the rich, should stop
pretending we know best.

00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:44.965
We should stop sending shoes
and teddy bears to the poor,

00:09:44.989 --> 00:09:46.510
to people we have never met.

00:09:46.534 --> 00:09:50.067
And we should get rid of the vast
industry of paternalistic bureaucrats

00:09:50.091 --> 00:09:52.272
when we could simply
hand over their salaries

00:09:52.296 --> 00:09:54.102
to the poor they're supposed to help.

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:56.422
(Applause)

00:09:56.446 --> 00:09:59.319
Because, I mean, the great
thing about money

00:09:59.343 --> 00:10:01.694
is that people can use it
to buy things they need
