00:10:58.175 --> 00:11:01.739
What they did in Dauphin is finance it
with a negative income tax.

00:11:01.763 --> 00:11:03.771
This means that your income is topped up

00:11:03.795 --> 00:11:06.207
as soon as you fall
below the poverty line.

00:11:06.231 --> 00:11:07.593
And in that scenario,

00:11:07.617 --> 00:11:10.131
according to our economists'
best estimates,

00:11:10.155 --> 00:11:13.180
for a net cost of 175 billion --

00:11:13.204 --> 00:11:18.111
a quarter of US military spending,
one percent of GDP --

00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:21.689
you could lift all impoverished Americans
above the poverty line.

00:11:22.566 --> 00:11:25.707
You could actually eradicate poverty.

00:11:26.142 --> 00:11:27.944
Now, that should be our goal.

00:11:28.716 --> 00:11:29.800
(Applause)

00:11:29.824 --> 00:11:32.756
The time for small thoughts
and little nudges is past.
