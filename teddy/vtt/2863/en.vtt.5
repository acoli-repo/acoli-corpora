00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.858
was coming over to Holland, where I live.

00:02:30.882 --> 00:02:32.284
So we met up in Amsterdam

00:02:32.308 --> 00:02:35.859
to talk about his revolutionary
new theory of poverty.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.493
And I can sum it up in just two words:

00:02:39.415 --> 00:02:41.432
scarcity mentality.

00:02:42.647 --> 00:02:44.801
It turns out that people
behave differently

00:02:44.825 --> 00:02:47.311
when they perceive a thing to be scarce.

00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:49.550
And what that thing is
doesn't much matter --

00:02:49.574 --> 00:02:52.587
whether it's not enough time,
money or food.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.738
You all know this feeling,

00:02:54.762 --> 00:02:56.725
when you've got too much to do,

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:58.765
or when you've put off breaking for lunch

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:00.452
and your blood sugar takes a dive.
