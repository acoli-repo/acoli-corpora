00:13:28.499 --> 00:13:31.712
I know that many of you
may feel pessimistic

00:13:31.736 --> 00:13:33.799
about a future of rising inequality,

00:13:33.823 --> 00:13:35.100
xenophobia

00:13:35.124 --> 00:13:36.320
and climate change.

00:13:36.986 --> 00:13:39.204
But it's not enough
to know what we're against.

00:13:39.228 --> 00:13:40.840
We also need to be for something.

00:13:40.864 --> 00:13:43.398
Martin Luther King didn't say,
"I have a nightmare."

00:13:43.422 --> 00:13:45.295
(Laughter)

00:13:45.319 --> 00:13:46.478
He had a dream.

00:13:46.502 --> 00:13:47.581
(Applause)

00:13:47.605 --> 00:13:48.757
So ...

00:13:49.835 --> 00:13:51.060
here's my dream:

00:13:52.303 --> 00:13:53.941
I believe in a future

00:13:53.965 --> 00:13:56.318
where the value of your work
is not determined

00:13:56.342 --> 00:13:57.819
by the size of your paycheck,

00:13:57.843 --> 00:13:59.875
but by the amount of happiness you spread

00:13:59.899 --> 00:14:01.876
and the amount of meaning you give.
