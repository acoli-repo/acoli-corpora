00:07:01.465 --> 00:07:02.623
What it is?

00:07:03.004 --> 00:07:04.166
Well, that's easy.

00:07:04.727 --> 00:07:07.458
It's a monthly grant, enough to pay
for your basic needs:

00:07:07.482 --> 00:07:09.160
food, shelter, education.

00:07:09.683 --> 00:07:11.504
It's completely unconditional,

00:07:11.528 --> 00:07:14.288
so no one's going to tell you
what you have to do for it,

00:07:14.312 --> 00:07:17.130
and no one's going to tell you
what you have to do with it.

00:07:17.154 --> 00:07:19.444
The basic income
is not a favor, but a right.

00:07:19.468 --> 00:07:21.601
There's absolutely no stigma attached.

00:07:22.372 --> 00:07:25.002
So as I learned about the true
nature of poverty,

00:07:25.026 --> 00:07:26.516
I couldn't stop wondering:

00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:30.048
Is this the idea
we've all been waiting for?
