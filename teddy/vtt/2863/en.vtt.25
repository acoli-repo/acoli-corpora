00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.347
we'd be in trouble.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.615
I'm talking about all those well-paid
professionals with excellent résumés

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:36.444
who earn their money doing ...

00:12:36.468 --> 00:12:38.504
strategic transactor peer-to-peer meetings

00:12:38.528 --> 00:12:41.560
while brainstorming the value
add-on of disruptive co-creation

00:12:41.584 --> 00:12:42.757
in the network society.

00:12:42.781 --> 00:12:43.804
(Laughter)

00:12:43.828 --> 00:12:44.846
(Applause)

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.072
Or something like that.

00:12:46.096 --> 00:12:49.020
Just imagine again how much
talent we're wasting,

00:12:49.044 --> 00:12:52.884
simply because we tell our kids
they'll have to "earn a living."

00:12:53.638 --> 00:12:57.380
Or think of what a math whiz working
at Facebook lamented a few years ago:

00:12:57.404 --> 00:12:59.266
"The best minds of my generation

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.403
are thinking about how
to make people click ads."
