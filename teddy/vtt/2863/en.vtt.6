00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:00.452
and your blood sugar takes a dive.

00:03:00.476 --> 00:03:03.304
This narrows your focus
to your immediate lack --

00:03:03.328 --> 00:03:05.338
to the sandwich you've got to have now,

00:03:05.362 --> 00:03:07.624
the meeting that's starting
in five minutes

00:03:07.648 --> 00:03:10.527
or the bills that have
to be paid tomorrow.

00:03:11.048 --> 00:03:14.264
So the long-term perspective
goes out the window.

00:03:15.835 --> 00:03:18.366
You could compare it to a new computer

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.577
that's running 10 heavy programs at once.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:23.974
It gets slower and slower, making errors.

00:03:23.998 --> 00:03:25.820
Eventually, it freezes --

00:03:25.844 --> 00:03:27.950
not because it's a bad computer,

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:30.594
but because it has too much to do at once.
