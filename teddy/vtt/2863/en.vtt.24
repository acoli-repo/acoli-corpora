00:11:58.902 --> 00:12:00.808
in 142 countries

00:12:00.832 --> 00:12:05.497
found that only 13 percent of workers
actually like their job.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.267
And another poll found that as much
as 37 percent of British workers

00:12:10.291 --> 00:12:13.221
have a job that they think
doesn't even need to exist.

00:12:14.387 --> 00:12:16.681
It's like Brad Pitt says in "Fight Club,"

00:12:16.705 --> 00:12:20.361
"Too often we're working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need."

00:12:20.385 --> 00:12:21.863
(Laughter)

00:12:21.887 --> 00:12:23.284
Now, don't get me wrong --

00:12:23.308 --> 00:12:25.862
I'm not talking about the teachers
and the garbagemen

00:12:25.886 --> 00:12:27.368
and the care workers here.

00:12:27.392 --> 00:12:29.006
If they stopped working,

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.347
we'd be in trouble.
