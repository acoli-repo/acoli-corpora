00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:30.569
by a few American psychologists.

00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:33.146
They had traveled 8,000 miles,
all the way to India,

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.745
for a fascinating study.

00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:38.013
And it was an experiment
with sugarcane farmers.

00:01:38.838 --> 00:01:42.186
You should know that these farmers
collect about 60 percent

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.343
of their annual income all at once,

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:46.075
right after the harvest.

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:49.639
This means that they're relatively
poor one part of the year

00:01:49.663 --> 00:01:51.257
and rich the other.

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:56.651
The researchers asked them to do
an IQ test before and after the harvest.

00:01:57.902 --> 00:02:01.922
What they subsequently discovered
completely blew my mind.
