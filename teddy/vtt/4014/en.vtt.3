00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.616
How do I know that these young people

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.096
have the potential
and the promise to change?

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.160
I know this because I am one of them.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.016
You see, I grew up
in dire poverty in the inner city,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.256
without a father --

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.360
he abandoned me before I was even born.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.096
We were on welfare,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.416
sometimes homeless,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.920
many times hungry.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.016
By the time I was 15 years old,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.320
I had been incarcerated in juvy
three times for three felonies.
