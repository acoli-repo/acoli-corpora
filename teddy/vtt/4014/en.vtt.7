00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.136
She was culturally relevant,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.296
she respected my community,
my people, my family.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.640
I told her a story about my Uncle Ruben.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.896
He would take me to work with him
because I was broke,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.776
and he knew I needed some money.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.480
He collected glass bottles for a living.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.376
Four in the morning on a school day,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.000
we'd throw the glass bottles
in the back of his van,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.120
and the bottles would break.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.816
And my hands and arms would start to bleed

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.520
and my tennis shoes and pants
would get all bloody.
