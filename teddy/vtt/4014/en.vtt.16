00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:07.056
So we went out to test these ideas
in the community of Watts in LA

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.336
with 40 young people
that had been pushed out of school.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.040
William was one of them.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.896
William was the kind of kid
that had been given every label.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.136
He had dropped out, he was a gang member,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.400
a criminal.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.776
And when we met him he was very resistant.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.216
But I remember what Ms. Russ used to say.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.536
"Hey, I'm here for you
whenever you're ready."
