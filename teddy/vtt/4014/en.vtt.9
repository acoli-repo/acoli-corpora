00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.240
This is your potential.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.136
Your family, your culture, your community
have taught you a hard-work ethic

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.496
and you will use it to empower
yourself in the academic world

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.240
so you can come back
and empower your community."

With Ms. Russ's help,

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.320
I ended up returning to school.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.040
I even finished my credits on time

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.720
and graduated with my class.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.200
