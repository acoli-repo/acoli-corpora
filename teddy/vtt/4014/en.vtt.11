00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.016
got a letter of acceptance,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.256
and one of the paragraphs read,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.640
"You've been admitted
under probationary status."

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.896
I said, "Probation?
I'm already on probation,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.136
that don't matter?"

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.416
(Laughter)

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.320
It was academic probation,
not criminal probation.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.136
But what do teachers like Ms. Russ
do to succeed with young people

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.056
like the ones I study?

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.256
I propose three strategies.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.496
The first:

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.696
let's get rid of our
deficit perspective in education.
