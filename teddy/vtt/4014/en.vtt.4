00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.480
My best friend had already been killed.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.256
And soon after,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.816
while I'm standing next to my uncle,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.039
he gets shot.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.056
And as I'm waiting
for the ambulance to arrive

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.840
for over an hour ...

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.680
he bleeds to death on the street.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.400
I had lost faith and hope in the world,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.496
and I had given up on the system
because the system had failed me.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.616
I had nothing to offer
