identify their grit,
resilience and character

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.880
that they've already developed --

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:09.120
their academic performance will improve.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.696
Let's believe in young people.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.016
Let's provide them
the right kinds of resources.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.696
I'll tell you what my teacher did for me.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.200
She believed in me so much

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.216
that she tricked me
into believing in myself.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.456
Thank you.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.040
