00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.656
For over a decade,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.736
I have studied young people
that have been pushed out of school,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.680
so called "dropouts."

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.776
As they end up failed
by the education system,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.336
they're on the streets
where they're vulnerable to violence,

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.816
police harassment,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.296
police brutality

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.960
and incarceration.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.776
I follow these young people
for years at a time,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.216
across institutional settings,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.400
to try to understand what some of us call
the "school-to-prison pipeline."
