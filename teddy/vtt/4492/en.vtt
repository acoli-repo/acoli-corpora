I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
tell a very well known interviewer on television,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
"I'm really getting into the Internet lately.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I just wish it were more organized."

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So ...

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
(Laughter)

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If I controlled the Internet,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you could auction your broken heart on eBay.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Take the money; go to Amazon;

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
buy a phonebook for a country you've never been to -- call folks at random

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language.
