00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
as I think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get, but, ooh-eee,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
you want to bet just how whack and un-PC

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
your Mac or PC is going to be when I'm rocking

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
hot-shit-hot-shot-god.net?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I guess it's just like life.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It is not a question of if you can --

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
it's: do ya?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
We can interfere with the interface.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
We can make "You've got Hallelujah" the national anthem of cyberspace

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
every lucky time we log on.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
You don't say a prayer.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
You don't write a psalm.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
You don't chant an "om."

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
You send one blessed email to whomever you're thinking of
