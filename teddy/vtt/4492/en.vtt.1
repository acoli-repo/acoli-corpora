buy a phonebook for a country you've never been to -- call folks at random

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If I were in charge of the Internet,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
you could Mapquest your lover's mood swings.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Hang left at cranky, right at preoccupied,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
U-turn on silent treatment,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Some days, I'm as shallow as a baking pan,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but I still stretch miles in all directions.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If I owned the Internet, Napster, Monster and Friendster.com
