WEBVTT

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If I owned the Internet, Napster, Monster and Friendster.com

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
would be one big website.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
That way you could listen to cool music

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
while you pretend to look for a job

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and you're really just chattin' with your pals.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
(Laughter)

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Heck, if I ran the Web, you could email dead people.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
(Laughter)

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
They would not email you back

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
(Laughter) --

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but you'd get an automated reply.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
(Laughter)

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Their name in your inbox

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
(Laughter) --

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
it's all you wanted anyway.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And a message saying, "Hey, it's me. I miss you.
