00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:01.980
Our curiosity was in overdrive,

00:04:02.004 --> 00:04:05.792
and we desired to analyze
more than just a descriptor.

00:04:06.998 --> 00:04:11.944
So, we ingested the entire
first paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries,

00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:14.742
but we did this separately
for two groups of people:

00:04:14.766 --> 00:04:17.543
people that are famous
and people that are not famous.

00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:20.256
Famous people -- Prince,
Ali, Zaha Hadid --

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.515
people who are not famous
are people like Jocelyn Cooper,

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:25.693
Reverend Curry

00:04:25.717 --> 00:04:26.886
or Lorna Kelly.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.098
I'm willing to bet you haven't heard
of most of their names.
