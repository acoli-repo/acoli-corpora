00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:30.951
Talk about having to be patient.

00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:32.032
(Laughter)

00:03:32.056 --> 00:03:34.145
Of course, it varies by profession.

00:03:34.566 --> 00:03:35.759
If you're a sports star,

00:03:35.783 --> 00:03:37.910
you'll probably hit
your stride in your 20s.

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:40.579
And if you're in your 40s like me,

00:03:40.603 --> 00:03:42.594
you can join the fun world of politics.

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:43.674
(Laughter)

00:03:43.698 --> 00:03:47.613
Politicians do their first and sometimes
only commendable act in their mid-40s.

00:03:47.637 --> 00:03:48.894
(Laughter)

00:03:48.918 --> 00:03:50.855
If you're wondering what "others" are,

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.355
here are some examples.

00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:54.937
Isn't it fascinating, the things people do

00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:56.843
and the things they're remembered for?

00:03:56.867 --> 00:03:58.619
(Laughter)
