You have to wonder
why in so many societies

00:03:01.007 --> 00:03:05.442
we insist that our kids pursue
engineering or medicine or business or law

00:03:05.466 --> 00:03:07.053
to be construed as successful.

00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:09.564
And while we're talking profession,

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:10.739
let's look at age --

00:03:10.763 --> 00:03:13.273
the average age at which
they achieved things.

00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:15.143
That number is 37.

00:03:16.274 --> 00:03:19.930
What that means is,
you've got to wait 37 years ...

00:03:19.954 --> 00:03:23.349
before your first significant achievement
that you're remembered for --

00:03:23.373 --> 00:03:24.524
on average --

00:03:24.548 --> 00:03:27.026
44 years later, when you
die at the age of 81 --

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.218
on average.

00:03:28.242 --> 00:03:29.243
(Laughter)

00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:30.951
Talk about having to be patient.
