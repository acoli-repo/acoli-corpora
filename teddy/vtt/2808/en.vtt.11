00:05:29.574 --> 00:05:32.684
They made a positive dent
in the fabric of life.

00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:33.945
They helped.

00:05:34.772 --> 00:05:37.363
So ask yourselves as you go
back to your daily lives:

00:05:37.387 --> 00:05:40.307
How am I using my talents to help society?

00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:43.304
Because the most powerful lesson here is,

00:05:43.328 --> 00:05:47.664
if more people lived their lives
trying to be famous in death,

00:05:47.688 --> 00:05:50.293
the world would be a much better place.

00:05:51.062 --> 00:05:52.231
Thank you.

00:05:52.255 --> 00:05:55.103
