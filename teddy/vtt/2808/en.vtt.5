00:02:28.843 --> 00:02:30.591
So we took these descriptors

00:02:30.615 --> 00:02:33.139
and did what's called
natural language processing,

00:02:33.163 --> 00:02:34.934
where you feed these into a program,

00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:36.823
it throws out the superfluous words --

00:02:36.847 --> 00:02:41.070
"the," "and," -- the kind of words
you can mime easily in "Charades," --

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.287
and leaves you with the most
significant words.

00:02:43.311 --> 00:02:45.132
And we did it not just for these four,

00:02:45.156 --> 00:02:47.675
but for all 2,000 descriptors.

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.442
And this is what it looks like.

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:55.831
Film, theatre, music, dance
and of course, art, are huge.

00:02:56.485 --> 00:02:58.431
Over 40 percent.

00:02:58.455 --> 00:03:00.983
You have to wonder
why in so many societies
