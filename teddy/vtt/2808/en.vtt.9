00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.098
I'm willing to bet you haven't heard
of most of their names.

00:04:30.122 --> 00:04:33.934
Amazing people, fantastic achievements,
but they're not famous.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.508
So what if we analyze
these two groups separately --

00:04:37.532 --> 00:04:39.057
the famous and the non-famous?

00:04:39.081 --> 00:04:40.500
What might that tell us?

00:04:40.524 --> 00:04:41.764
Take a look.

00:04:44.556 --> 00:04:46.025
Two things leap out at me.

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:47.739
First:

00:04:48.106 --> 00:04:49.304
"John."

00:04:49.328 --> 00:04:50.628
(Laughter)

00:04:51.914 --> 00:04:55.302
Anyone here named John
should thank your parents --

00:04:55.326 --> 00:04:56.655
(Laughter)

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:59.761
and remind your kids to cut out
your obituary when you're gone.
