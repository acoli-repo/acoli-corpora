and cues man's failures.

00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:03.443
An instance where bad news
cues accomplishment

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:06.702
is at the end of the paper,
in the obituaries.

00:01:07.405 --> 00:01:08.769
In my day job,

00:01:08.793 --> 00:01:11.269
I run a company that focuses
on future insights

00:01:11.293 --> 00:01:13.713
that marketers can derive
from past data --

00:01:13.737 --> 00:01:16.681
a kind of rearview-mirror analysis.

00:01:17.092 --> 00:01:18.247
And we began to think:

00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:23.389
What if we held a rearview mirror
to obituaries from the New York Times?

00:01:24.514 --> 00:01:27.982
Were there lessons on how you could get
your obituary featured --

00:01:28.006 --> 00:01:29.983
even if you aren't around to enjoy it?
