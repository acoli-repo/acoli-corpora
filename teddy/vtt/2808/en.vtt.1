I read about him in the New York Times,

00:00:31.457 --> 00:00:32.889
in the obituaries.

00:00:32.913 --> 00:00:36.685
The Times had half a page
of editorial dedicated to him,

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:40.631
which you can imagine is premium space
for a newspaper of their stature.

00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:43.710
I read the obituaries almost every day.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.712
My wife understandably thinks
I'm rather morbid

00:00:47.736 --> 00:00:52.136
to begin my day with scrambled eggs
and a "Let's see who died today."

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.310
(Laughter)

00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:55.317
But if you think about it,

00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:58.754
the front page of the newspaper
is usually bad news,

00:00:58.778 --> 00:01:00.753
and cues man's failures.
