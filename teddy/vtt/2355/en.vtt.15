00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:30.184
identify what type of units they were in,

00:07:30.208 --> 00:07:34.226
what contingencies and operations
did they participate in,

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.768
and let's build the data points
to try to figure out

00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:41.809
are there units that are more susceptible
to develop post-traumatic stress disorder

00:07:41.833 --> 00:07:43.809
so that we can get them the mental health

00:07:43.833 --> 00:07:45.268
prior to going on deployment,

00:07:45.292 --> 00:07:46.934
prior to being in theater.

00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:48.226
If they're in theater,

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.684
get them the mental health
while they're in theater,

00:07:50.708 --> 00:07:53.309
and get them mental health
counseling and help

00:07:53.333 --> 00:07:55.351
before they even come home out of theater.

00:07:55.375 --> 00:08:01.851
