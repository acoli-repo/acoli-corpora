00:07:55.375 --> 00:08:01.851
(Applause)

00:08:01.875 --> 00:08:03.143
And by the way,

00:08:03.167 --> 00:08:06.476
if we can build those sets of data points
to be able to do that,

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.809
we don't just apply them to the military,

00:08:08.833 --> 00:08:11.625
we can also use that
for the general population.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.684
If we put our minds together

00:08:14.708 --> 00:08:16.393
and our resources together,

00:08:16.417 --> 00:08:18.559
and we openly talk about this,

00:08:18.583 --> 00:08:20.518
and try to find solutions

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:24.101
for this epidemic
that's going on in America,

00:08:24.125 --> 00:08:26.042
hopefully we can save a life.

00:08:27.042 --> 00:08:28.601
Those are my thoughts, my ideas,

00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:31.476
I hope that this talk
is not the end of this discussion
