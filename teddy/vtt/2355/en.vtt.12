00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.018
And so all of your doctors,
all your health care

00:06:01.042 --> 00:06:03.184
is in that category.

00:06:03.208 --> 00:06:04.684
When you leave the service,

00:06:04.708 --> 00:06:07.559
you are now part of the Department
of Veteran Affairs.

00:06:07.583 --> 00:06:10.059
So these active duty members

00:06:10.083 --> 00:06:13.476

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.768
and are diagnosed with PTSD

there's no transition to a doctor

00:06:21.292 --> 00:06:23.309
that's in the Department
of Veteran Affairs

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:25.143
or perhaps out in the civilian world

00:06:25.167 --> 00:06:27.101
because of privacy acts.

00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:28.976
Now there's some good news in this.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.768
Just recently, it was legislated
