00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.226
and the only thing he could think of

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.018
was, "How quick can I get off this?"

00:04:33.042 --> 00:04:35.476
And I think the call lasted
maybe 10 or 15 minutes.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.268
But yet the national studies tell us

00:04:37.292 --> 00:04:39.684

one-hour interview.

00:04:39.708 --> 00:04:42.458
I think that's something
that we can improve upon.

00:04:43.792 --> 00:04:46.851

They said that our service members
that are self-medicating

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:56.684
tend to be at a significantly
higher risk of suicide.

00:04:56.708 --> 00:04:59.476
So those veterans that are
self-medicating with alcohol,

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.768
or drug abuse --
