00:03:58.042 --> 00:04:00.250
That's something I think
that needs to change.

00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:03.226
Number two,

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.976
when you leave the service --

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.184
When I left the service in 2003,

00:04:07.208 --> 00:04:09.309
I had to attend some mandatory classes,

00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:11.518
about two days' worth of classes,

00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:13.208
and then I was on my way.

00:04:14.042 --> 00:04:15.559
Today, it's a little different.

00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:17.476
Today you'll actually get a call

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.476
if you're on what we call terminal leave

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.643
or paid time off
that you're trying to use up

00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:24.375
before you actually are fully discharged.

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:27.809
I talked to one veteran who got a call.

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:29.476
He was on his way home from work,

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.226
and the only thing he could think of
