00:06:58.458 --> 00:07:00.851
When I talk to senior
leadership in the battalion,

00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:03.309
and battalion is about
six to seven hundred marines,

00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:07.208
they estimate that we're in the hundreds
who have committed suicide.

00:07:08.583 --> 00:07:10.851
So let's take this database
that we're building,

00:07:10.875 --> 00:07:12.917
and let's go a little bit further with it.

00:07:13.917 --> 00:07:16.643
What if when a veteran passes away,

00:07:16.667 --> 00:07:18.518
whether it's natural causes,

00:07:18.542 --> 00:07:21.559
overdose or suicide,

00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:23.851
we're able to feed that
into the Veteran Affairs

00:07:23.875 --> 00:07:26.583
who is then able to access
Department of Defense records,

00:07:27.792 --> 00:07:30.184
identify what type of units they were in,
