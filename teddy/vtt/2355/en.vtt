00:00:02.417 --> 00:00:04.934
So on May 6 of 2019,

00:00:04.958 --> 00:00:08.518
the sun was shining, the sky was blue,

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:10.601
clouds were that puffy white.

00:00:10.625 --> 00:00:12.934
It was a perfect spring day.

00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:15.101
I was walking back to my office,

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:16.684
and my phone rang.

00:00:16.708 --> 00:00:19.434
And it was one of my lieutenants.

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:21.018
I said, "Hey, John.

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:22.393
How are you?"

00:00:22.417 --> 00:00:23.684
He said, "Sir, I'm good.

00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:25.809
But I've got some bad news."

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:29.042
He said our executive officer
died that weekend.
