00:00:30.542 --> 00:00:31.934
We went back and forth,

00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:34.476
"What do you mean,
what are you talking about?"

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.250
I asked him what happened.

00:00:37.417 --> 00:00:39.375
He said, "Sir, he killed himself."

00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:47.309
I walked around my office
for a couple of hours in a complete fog,

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:50.893
trying to understand
what had happened, why.

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:54.226
I had just communicated with him
a few months earlier.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.976
And I had no idea
that this officer was in trouble.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.875
And I fault myself as a leader
for not having known that.
