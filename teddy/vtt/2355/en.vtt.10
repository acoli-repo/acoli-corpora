or drug abuse --

00:05:00.792 --> 00:05:04.018
and in fact, the Department
of Veteran Affairs has classified

00:05:04.042 --> 00:05:06.476
opioid use disorder, OUD,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.351
as one of the epidemics.

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:10.268
So as I talked to marines from my unit

00:05:10.292 --> 00:05:12.684
and tried to learn more about it,

00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:15.934
I started to find out
some really, really alarming things.

00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.976
I had a marine who came back from Iraq

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.351
and he went to the hospital
for a "back pain"

00:05:23.375 --> 00:05:25.292
and he was prescribed some opioids.

00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.184
He also suffered from
post-traumatic stress disorder.
