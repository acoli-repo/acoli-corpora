00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:31.018
you're going to take
a physical fitness test,

00:03:31.042 --> 00:03:33.476
you're going to take a drug test,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.310
you're going to take a vocational test

00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:37.351
so they can figure out what you're good at

00:03:37.375 --> 00:03:39.893
and hopefully place you
in that type of job category.

00:03:39.917 --> 00:03:41.184
But would you believe

00:03:41.208 --> 00:03:45.393
that with approximately 115,000 suicides
over the last 20 years,

00:03:45.417 --> 00:03:47.809
and the data that we know
from the national studies

00:03:47.833 --> 00:03:50.601
on how to determine if somebody
is going to be able to cope

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:52.393
with post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:03:52.417 --> 00:03:55.476
we still don't have a standardized
mental health evaluation

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.018
for our recruits
entering into the service.

00:03:58.042 --> 00:04:00.250
That's something I think
that needs to change.
