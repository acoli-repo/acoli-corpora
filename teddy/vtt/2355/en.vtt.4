00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:02.976
During that time frame
and the Global War on Terror,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.542
there have been 5,440
active duty members killed in action.

00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:13.143
So by my numbers,
115,000 approximate suicides,

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:16.309
5,440 killed in action.

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:18.143
What does that mean to me?

00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:24.143
We have approximately 21 veterans
ending their lives by their own hand

00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:28.042
for every one that is killed
by an enemy combatant.

00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:32.167
It's a staggering, staggering number.
