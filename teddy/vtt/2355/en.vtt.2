00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.875
And I fault myself as a leader
for not having known that.

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:05.684
I went on this process
of trying to figure out

00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:07.934
why, what's happening
in the veteran community,

00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.434
why are these things going on.

00:01:09.458 --> 00:01:12.351
I read reports from
the Department of Veteran Affairs,

00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:13.893
Department of Defense,

00:01:13.917 --> 00:01:16.226
I've read national studies
on mental health

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.809
and the issues associated with it.

00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:21.875
I'm going to share with you
some of the things I found out.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.684
Department of Veteran Affairs
has taken the lead on veteran suicide,

00:01:26.708 --> 00:01:28.768
and it's actually
their number one priority.

00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:32.018
Based on the reports they have
and the numbers that I've calculated,
