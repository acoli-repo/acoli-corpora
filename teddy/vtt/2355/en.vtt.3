00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:32.018
Based on the reports they have
and the numbers that I've calculated,

00:01:32.042 --> 00:01:34.559
between 2001 and 2019,

00:01:34.583 --> 00:01:37.851
during the time
of the Global War on Terror,

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:41.768
my approximation is
there's 115,000 veterans

00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:43.583
who have died by their own hands.

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:47.768
I also looked at the Department
of Defense report

00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:49.851
that lists casualties.

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.643
This particular report

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:56.143
lists the casualties from October of 2001

00:01:56.167 --> 00:01:58.875
specifically to November 18 of last year.
