The sloth, on the other hand,
has poor hearing, bad eyesight,

00:09:34.675 --> 00:09:37.606
and running from danger
is clearly not an option.

00:09:38.175 --> 00:09:42.147
No, they survive by wearing
an invisibility cloak

00:09:42.171 --> 00:09:44.067
worthy of Harry Potter.

00:09:44.965 --> 00:09:48.093
Their fur has grooves
that attract moisture

00:09:48.117 --> 00:09:51.450
and act as tiny hydroponic
gardens for algae,

00:09:51.474 --> 00:09:54.101
and they also attract
a host of invertebrates.

00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:58.942
So they are their own slow-moving,
miniature ecosystem.

00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:01.569
They become one with the trees.
