00:05:57.498 --> 00:06:00.807
Hard at work, that sloth,
very hard at work.

00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:03.498
And of course, leaves
have little calorific value,

00:06:03.522 --> 00:06:07.736
so sloths have evolved to spend
as little energy as possible.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.125
They do about 10 percent of the work
of a similar-sized mammal

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:14.982
and survive on as little
as 100 calories a day,

00:06:15.006 --> 00:06:18.174
thanks to some ingenious adaptations.

00:06:19.053 --> 00:06:20.863
The Bradypus, three-toed sloths,

00:06:20.887 --> 00:06:23.355
they've got more neck bones
than any other mammal,

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:24.545
even a giraffe.

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:29.096
Which means they can turn their head
through 270 degrees

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.254
and graze all around them,
