00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:03.466
and wear an unusually thick coat
for the tropics to keep that heat in.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.561
Sloths have a freakishly low metabolism.

00:12:07.585 --> 00:12:10.157
And we think that this might be
one of the reasons

00:12:10.181 --> 00:12:12.646
that they can sometimes
recover from injuries

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.632
that would kill most animals.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.331
This sloth recovered
from a double amputation,

00:12:18.355 --> 00:12:21.982
and I've known sloths
that have managed to survive

00:12:22.006 --> 00:12:24.379
even power line electrocutions.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:30.196
And we now think that a low metabolism
may well be key to surviving extinction.
