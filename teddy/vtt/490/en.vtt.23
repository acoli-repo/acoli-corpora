00:11:28.002 --> 00:11:31.859
so that he doesn't waste precious energy
scaling the wrong one.

00:11:32.807 --> 00:11:36.244
Sex, by the way, is the only thing
that sloths do swiftly.

00:11:36.268 --> 00:11:37.879
I've seen them do it in the wild,

00:11:37.903 --> 00:11:41.339
and it's over and done
with in a matter of seconds.

00:11:41.363 --> 00:11:44.061
But then, why waste precious energy on it,

00:11:44.085 --> 00:11:46.093
particularly after that journey?

00:11:46.117 --> 00:11:47.799
(Laughter)

00:11:47.823 --> 00:11:49.101
Unlike other mammals,

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:54.268
sloths don't also waste time maintaining
a constant warm body temperature.

00:11:54.292 --> 00:11:55.982
Energy from the sun is free,

00:11:56.006 --> 00:11:58.276
so they bask in the sun like lizards

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:03.466
and wear an unusually thick coat
for the tropics to keep that heat in.
