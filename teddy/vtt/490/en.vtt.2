and how understanding
the truth about the sloth

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:06.438
may help save us and this planet
we both call home.

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:10.029
I traced sloth-based slander

00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:14.339
back to a Spanish
conquistador called Valdés,

00:01:14.363 --> 00:01:19.601
who gave the first description of a sloth
in his encyclopedia of the New World.

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:21.540
He said the sloth was

00:01:21.564 --> 00:01:24.847
"the stupidest animal
that can be found in the world ...

00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:30.061
I have never seen such an ugly animal
or one that is more useless."
