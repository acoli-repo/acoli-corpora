They become one with the trees.

00:10:01.593 --> 00:10:04.163
And we think that
their movements are so slow,

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.839
they slip under the radar
of the monstrous harpy

00:10:06.863 --> 00:10:10.236
as it's flying about the canopy,
scanning for action.

00:10:11.244 --> 00:10:13.903
Sloths are stealth ninjas,

00:10:13.927 --> 00:10:16.537
and they rarely leave
the safety of the canopy --

00:10:16.561 --> 00:10:18.339
except to defecate,

00:10:18.363 --> 00:10:21.704
which they do about once a week
at the base of a tree.

00:10:22.387 --> 00:10:26.863
Now, this risky and energetic behavior
has long been a mystery,

00:10:26.887 --> 00:10:29.776
and there are lots of theories
as to why they do it.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:36.288
But I think they're leaving surreptitious
scented messages for potential mates.
