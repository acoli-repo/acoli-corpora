00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:30.061
I have never seen such an ugly animal
or one that is more useless."

00:01:30.085 --> 00:01:31.235
(Laughter)

00:01:31.744 --> 00:01:33.866
Tell us what you really think, Valdés.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.040
(Laughter)

00:01:35.522 --> 00:01:39.697
I'd like to have a word
about Valdés's drawing skills.

00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:41.792
(Laughter)

00:01:41.816 --> 00:01:44.263
I mean, what is that?

00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:46.134
(Laughter)

00:01:46.158 --> 00:01:49.695
I've never seen an illustration
of a sloth that's more useless.

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:50.950
(Laughter)

00:01:50.974 --> 00:01:52.379
But I mean, on the plus side,

00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:54.854
he has given the sloth
a remarkably humanlike face,

00:01:54.878 --> 00:01:58.445
and sloths do have remarkably
humanlike faces.

00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:03.976
This sloth I photographed in Costa Rica,
I think looks a lot like Ringo Starr.
