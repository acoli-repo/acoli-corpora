(Applause)

00:03:01.254 --> 00:03:05.144
Today, there are six surviving species,
and they fall into two groups.

00:03:05.168 --> 00:03:07.768
You've got your Bradypus
three-toed sloths,

00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:11.638
they're the ones with the Beatles haircuts
and the Mona Lisa smiles.

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.902
Then, there are the two-toed sloths.

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:18.756
They look a little bit more like a cross
between a Wookiee and a pig.

00:03:19.891 --> 00:03:22.501
They live in the jungles
of Central and South America,

00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:24.021
and they're extremely prolific.

00:03:24.045 --> 00:03:26.998
There was a survey
that was done in the 1970s

00:03:27.022 --> 00:03:29.276
in a Panamanian tropical forest

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.204
that found that sloths were the most
numerically abundant large animal.
