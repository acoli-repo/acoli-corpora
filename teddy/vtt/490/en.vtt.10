00:04:59.181 --> 00:05:00.331
(Laughter)

00:05:00.355 --> 00:05:01.752
The sloth, on the other hand,

00:05:01.776 --> 00:05:04.704
has taken a more stealthy
approach to dinner.

00:05:04.728 --> 00:05:08.467
They survive by capturing and consuming

00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:10.328
static leaves.

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:12.421
(Laughter)

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:15.715
But you see, leaves don't want
to be eaten any more than antelope do,

00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:19.087
so they're loaded full of toxins
and very hard to digest.

00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:20.746
So in order to consume them,

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.230
the sloth has also
had to become an athlete --

00:05:24.254 --> 00:05:26.420
a digesting athlete.

00:05:26.444 --> 00:05:27.556
(Laughter)

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.288
The sloth's secret weapon
is a four-chambered stomach
