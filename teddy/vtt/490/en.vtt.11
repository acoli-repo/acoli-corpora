The sloth's secret weapon
is a four-chambered stomach

00:05:30.312 --> 00:05:32.537
and plenty of time.

00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:35.458
They have the slowest
digestion rate of any mammal.

00:05:35.482 --> 00:05:39.077
And it can take up to a month
to process a single leaf,

00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:43.415
which gives their liver plenty of time
to process those toxins.

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:47.510
So, sloths aren't lazy.

00:05:48.122 --> 00:05:50.277
No, they're busy.

00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:52.033
Digesting.

00:05:52.057 --> 00:05:53.553
(Laughter)

00:05:53.577 --> 00:05:55.670
Yeah, really busy.

00:05:55.694 --> 00:05:57.474
(Laughter)

00:05:57.498 --> 00:06:00.807
Hard at work, that sloth,
very hard at work.
