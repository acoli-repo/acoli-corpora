00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:10.768
But then, sloths do bear an uncanny
resemblance to the The Beatles.

00:02:10.792 --> 00:02:14.108
(Laughter)

00:02:14.132 --> 00:02:17.808
Particularly pleased

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:24.149
But like The Beatles,
sloths are also extremely successful.

00:02:24.173 --> 00:02:28.122
They come from an ancient line of mammals,
and there were once dozens of species

00:02:28.146 --> 00:02:32.688
including the giant ground sloth,
which was the size of a small elephant
