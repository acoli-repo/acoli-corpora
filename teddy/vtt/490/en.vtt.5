including the giant ground sloth,
which was the size of a small elephant

00:02:32.712 --> 00:02:36.975
and one of the only animals big enough
to eat avocado pits whole

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:38.391
and disperse them.

00:02:39.384 --> 00:02:40.534
So ... 
(Laughter)

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.203
Some of you have worked it out already.

00:02:43.227 --> 00:02:44.229
(Laughter)

00:02:44.253 --> 00:02:46.246
That means that without sloths,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.569
there might be no avocado on toast today,

00:02:49.593 --> 00:02:53.934
leaving hipsters everywhere
totally bereft at breakfast.

00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:55.769
(Laughter)

00:02:55.793 --> 00:03:01.230
(Applause)
