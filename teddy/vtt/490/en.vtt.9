00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:30.007
(Laughter)

00:04:30.031 --> 00:04:33.767
(Applause)

00:04:34.109 --> 00:04:35.260
So what?

00:04:35.284 --> 00:04:36.776
The sloth, on the other hand,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.760
can reach a leisurely 17 feet a minute

00:04:40.784 --> 00:04:42.395
with the wind behind it.

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.521
(Laughter)

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:47.395
But being fast is costly.

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.403
The cheetah is speedy,
but at the expense of strength.

00:04:51.427 --> 00:04:53.180
They can't risk getting in a fight,

00:04:53.204 --> 00:04:57.569
so they lose one in nine kills
to tougher predators like hyenas.

00:04:57.593 --> 00:04:59.157
No wonder they're laughing.

00:04:59.181 --> 00:05:00.331
(Laughter)
