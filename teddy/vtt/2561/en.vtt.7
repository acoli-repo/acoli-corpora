00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:32.924
It reminds one of biology classes,
if you remember the human body

00:03:32.948 --> 00:03:35.852
with all its organs
and circulatory systems, like at school.

00:03:35.876 --> 00:03:39.873
And suddenly you think of architecture
no longer as built substance,

00:03:39.897 --> 00:03:41.999
but as an organism, as a life form.

00:03:42.436 --> 00:03:44.783
And as you start to dissect this organism,

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:49.536
you can identify a series
of primary technical clusters --

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.254
program production,
broadcasting center and news.

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:56.337
Those are tightly intertwined
with social clusters:

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:59.425
meeting rooms, canteens, chat areas --

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.533
informal spaces for people
to meet and exchange.
