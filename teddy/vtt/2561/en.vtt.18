00:08:58.873 --> 00:09:01.788
the human beings and the spaces alike.

00:09:02.502 --> 00:09:05.393
And the detailed quality
of everything we designed

00:09:05.417 --> 00:09:09.249
was about animating the space
and giving the space to the inhabitants.

00:09:09.273 --> 00:09:10.670
And, in fact, it was a system

00:09:10.694 --> 00:09:14.162
where we would layer
primarily communal spaces,

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:18.146
stacked to more and more
individual and private spaces.

00:09:18.662 --> 00:09:20.505
So we would open up a spectrum

00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:23.719
between the collective and the individual.

00:09:24.203 --> 00:09:25.354
A little piece of math:

00:09:25.378 --> 00:09:27.929
if we count all the green
that we left on the ground,

00:09:27.953 --> 00:09:30.038
minus the footprint of the buildings,
