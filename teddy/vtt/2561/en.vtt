For much of the past century,

00:00:02.882 --> 00:00:05.690
architecture was under the spell
of a famous doctrine.

00:00:06.396 --> 00:00:09.991
"Form follows function" had become
modernity's ambitious manifesto

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:12.268
and detrimental straitjacket,

00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:15.261
as it liberated architecture
from the decorative,

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:19.186
but condemned it to utilitarian rigor
and restrained purpose.

00:00:20.418 --> 00:00:23.124
Of course, architecture is about function,

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:26.815
but I want to remember a rewriting
of this phrase by Bernard Tschumi,

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.552
and I want to propose
a completely different quality.
