00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.533
informal spaces for people
to meet and exchange.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.498
So the organizational structure
of this building was a hybrid

00:04:07.522 --> 00:04:09.968
between the technical and the social,

00:04:09.992 --> 00:04:11.826
the human and the performative.

00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:15.973
And of course, we used the loop
of the building as a circulatory system,

00:04:15.997 --> 00:04:19.906
to thread everything together
and to allow both visitors and staff

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.515
to experience all these different
functions in a great unity.

00:04:25.118 --> 00:04:28.178
With 473,000 square meters,

00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:31.213
it is one of the largest buildings
ever built in the world.
