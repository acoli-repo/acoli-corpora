you can see its organizational structure
is actually a hexagonal grid,

00:08:34.762 --> 00:08:38.499
in which these horizontal
building blocks are stacked up

00:08:38.523 --> 00:08:43.592
to create huge outdoor courtyards --
central spaces for the community,

00:08:43.616 --> 00:08:46.972
programmed with a variety
of amenities and functions.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.087
And you see that these courtyards
are not hermetically sealed spaces.

00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:53.603
They're open, permeable;
they're interconnected.

00:08:53.627 --> 00:08:55.851
We called the project "The Interlace,"

00:08:55.875 --> 00:08:58.849
thinking that we interlace
and interconnect

00:08:58.873 --> 00:09:01.788
the human beings and the spaces alike.
