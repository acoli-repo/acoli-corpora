00:01:27.928 --> 00:01:31.079
How can we arrange things
in both a functional

00:01:31.103 --> 00:01:32.868
and experiential way?

00:01:34.188 --> 00:01:36.856
How can we create structures
that generate a series

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.299
of relationships and narratives?

00:01:39.672 --> 00:01:41.263
And how can fictive stories

00:01:41.287 --> 00:01:44.101
of the inhabitants and users
of our buildings

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:46.077
script the architecture,

00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:49.468
while the architecture scripts
those stories at the same time?

00:01:50.428 --> 00:01:52.413
And here comes the second term into play,

00:01:52.437 --> 00:01:54.675
what I call "narrative hybrids" --

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:57.444
structures of multiple
simultaneous stories

00:01:57.468 --> 00:02:00.198
that unfold throughout
the buildings we create.
