00:13:26.515 --> 00:13:30.158
It can function as a double-loaded
corridor, has daylight, has ventilation.

00:13:30.182 --> 00:13:31.333
It can be glazed over

00:13:31.357 --> 00:13:34.230
and turned into a giant
exhibitional performance space.

00:13:34.254 --> 00:13:36.379
These modules were stacked together

00:13:36.403 --> 00:13:40.165
with the idea that almost any
function could, over time,

00:13:40.189 --> 00:13:41.926
occupy any of these modules.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.066
So institutions could shrink or contract,

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:49.811
as, of course, the future of culture
is, in a way, the most uncertain of all.

00:13:50.733 --> 00:13:53.688
This is how the building sits,
adjacent to the Aquatics Centre,

00:13:53.712 --> 00:13:55.663
opposite the Olympic Stadium.

00:13:56.608 --> 00:13:58.941
And you can see how
its cantilevering volumes

00:13:58.965 --> 00:14:01.755
project out and engage the public space
