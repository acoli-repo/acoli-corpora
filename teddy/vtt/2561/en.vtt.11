it can broadcast over 200
channels simultaneously.

00:05:33.643 --> 00:05:37.063
And this is how the building
stands in Beijing today.

00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:41.095
Its first broadcast live
was the London Olympics 2012,

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:45.174
after it had been completed
from the outside for the Beijing Olympics.

00:05:45.998 --> 00:05:50.061
And you can see at the very tip
of this 75-meter cantilever,

00:05:50.085 --> 00:05:51.639
those three little circles.

00:05:51.663 --> 00:05:55.164
And they're indeed part of a public loop
that goes through the building.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.740
They're a piece of glass
that you can stand on

00:05:57.764 --> 00:06:01.867
and watch the city pass by
below you in slow motion.
