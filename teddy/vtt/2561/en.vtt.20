In the tropics, the sun is the most
important thing to pay attention to,

00:10:01.815 --> 00:10:04.877
and, in fact, it is seeking
protection from the sun.

00:10:04.901 --> 00:10:08.038
We first proved that all apartments
would have sufficient daylight

00:10:08.062 --> 00:10:09.235
through the year.

00:10:09.648 --> 00:10:12.309
We then went on to optimize
the glazing of the facades

00:10:12.333 --> 00:10:14.902
to minimize the energy
consumption of the building.

00:10:15.981 --> 00:10:19.396
But most importantly, we could prove
that through the geometry

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.996
of the building design,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.382
the building itself would provide
sufficient shading to the courtyards

00:10:24.406 --> 00:10:27.408
so that those would be usable
throughout the entire year.

00:10:27.432 --> 00:10:30.910
We further placed water bodies
along the prevailing wind corridors,
