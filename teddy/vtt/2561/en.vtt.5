00:02:28.236 --> 00:02:30.307
to emerge in the central
business district,

00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:32.952
except at that time,
only a handful of them existed.

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.652
So we had to design in a context
that we knew almost nothing about,

00:02:36.676 --> 00:02:39.771
except one thing:
it would all be about verticality.

00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:45.145
Of course, the skyscraper is vertical --
it's a profoundly hierarchical structure,

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.585
the top always the best,
the bottom the worst,

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.772
and the taller you are,
the better, so it seems.

00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:53.170
And we wanted to ask ourselves,

00:02:53.194 --> 00:02:55.987
could a building be about
a completely different quality?

00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:59.964
Could it undo this hierarchy,
and could it be about a system

00:02:59.988 --> 00:03:03.212
that is more about collaboration,
rather than isolation?
