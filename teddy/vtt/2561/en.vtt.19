00:09:27.953 --> 00:09:30.038
minus the footprint of the buildings,

00:09:30.062 --> 00:09:33.489
and we would add back
the green of all the terraces,

00:09:33.513 --> 00:09:35.567
we have 112 percent green space,

00:09:35.591 --> 00:09:38.074
so more nature than not
having built a building.

00:09:38.463 --> 00:09:42.465
And of course this little piece of math
shows you that we are multiplying

00:09:42.489 --> 00:09:45.346
the space available
to those who live there.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.014
This is, in fact, the 13th floor
of one of these terraces.

00:09:49.038 --> 00:09:53.657
So you see new datum planes,
new grounds planes for social activity.

00:09:54.792 --> 00:09:57.730
We paid a lot of attention
to sustainability.

00:09:58.212 --> 00:10:01.791
In the tropics, the sun is the most
important thing to pay attention to,
