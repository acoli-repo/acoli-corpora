00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:00.741
would have looked like this:

00:08:00.765 --> 00:08:03.511
24-story height limit given
by the planning authorities,

00:08:03.535 --> 00:08:07.509
12 towers with nothing
but residual in between --

00:08:07.533 --> 00:08:10.446
a very tight system that,
although the tower isolates you,

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:13.977
it doesn't even give you privacy,
because you're so close to the next one,

00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:17.291
that it is very questionable
what the qualities of this would be.

00:08:18.488 --> 00:08:22.782
So I proposed to topple the towers,
throw the vertical into the horizontal

00:08:22.806 --> 00:08:24.596
and stack them up,

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.167
and what looks a bit random from the side,

00:08:27.191 --> 00:08:29.985
if you look from the viewpoint
of the helicopter,
