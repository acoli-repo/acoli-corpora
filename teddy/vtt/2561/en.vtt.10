00:05:02.005 --> 00:05:05.251
we identified five characters,
hypothetical characters,

00:05:05.275 --> 00:05:09.844
and we followed them throughout their day
in a life in this building,

00:05:09.868 --> 00:05:12.751
thought of where they would meet,
what they would experience.

00:05:12.775 --> 00:05:15.914
So it was a way to script and design
the building, but of course,

00:05:15.938 --> 00:05:17.975

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:21.287

00:05:24.865 --> 00:05:27.064
This is the main broadcast control room,

00:05:27.088 --> 00:05:28.906
a technical installation so large,

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.262
it can broadcast over 200
channels simultaneously.
