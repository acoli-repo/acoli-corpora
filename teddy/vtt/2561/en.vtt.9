it is one of the largest buildings
ever built in the world.

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:33.905
It has a population of over 10,000 people,

00:04:33.929 --> 00:04:37.515
and of course, this is a scale
that exceeds the comprehension

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.299
of many things and the scale
of typical architecture.

00:04:40.323 --> 00:04:41.951
So we stopped work for a while

00:04:41.975 --> 00:04:46.280
and sat down and cut 10,000 little sticks
and glued them onto a model,

00:04:46.304 --> 00:04:50.327

with what that quantity actually meant.

00:04:51.261 --> 00:04:52.871

00:04:52.895 --> 00:04:57.504
it is the people, it is a community
that inhabits the building,

00:04:57.528 --> 00:05:01.981
and in order to both comprehend
this, but also script this architecture,
