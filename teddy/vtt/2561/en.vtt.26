00:12:59.761 --> 00:13:03.150
We live in a world in which
boundaries start to blur

00:13:03.174 --> 00:13:04.642
between the different domains,

00:13:04.666 --> 00:13:08.656
and in which collaboration and interaction
becomes far more important

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.464
than keeping separations.

00:13:11.408 --> 00:13:14.427
So we wanted to think
of a giant culture machine,

00:13:14.451 --> 00:13:19.228
a building that would orchestrate
and animate the various domains,

00:13:19.252 --> 00:13:22.306
but allow them to interact
and collaborate.

00:13:23.211 --> 00:13:25.316
At the base of it is a very simple module,

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.491
a ring module.

00:13:26.515 --> 00:13:30.158
It can function as a double-loaded
corridor, has daylight, has ventilation.
