00:12:00.159 --> 00:12:03.738
Finally, we come to London,
a project commissioned

00:12:03.762 --> 00:12:06.340
by the London Legacy
Development Corporation

00:12:06.364 --> 00:12:07.793
of the Mayor of London.

00:12:08.309 --> 00:12:10.497
We were asked to undertake a study

00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:13.313
and investigate the potential of a site

00:12:13.337 --> 00:12:15.808
out in Stratford in the Olympic Park.

00:12:16.229 --> 00:12:19.813
In the 19th century, Prince Albert
had created Albertopolis.

00:12:20.513 --> 00:12:24.251
And Boris Johnson thought
of creating Olympicopolis.

00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:29.483
The idea was to bring together
some of Britain's greatest institutions,

00:12:29.507 --> 00:12:33.367
some international ones,
and to create a new system of synergies.
