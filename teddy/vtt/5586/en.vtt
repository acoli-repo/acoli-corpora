For 3 billion people around the world,

00:00:08.747 --> 00:00:12.457
seafood provides a significant source 
of protein and nutrition.

00:00:12.457 --> 00:00:16.857
But recent studies show that 33% of wild 
fisheries are overfished,

00:00:16.857 --> 00:00:20.987
while another 60% are fished at their 
maximum capacity.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.427
In fact, over half the seafood we eat–

00:00:23.427 --> 00:00:26.027
from finfish and shellfish to 
seaweed and algae–

00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:27.687
isn’t caught in the wild.

00:00:27.687 --> 00:00:31.287
It’s grown through aquaculture, 
or aquatic farming.
