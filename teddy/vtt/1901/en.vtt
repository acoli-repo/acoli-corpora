This is where I live. I live in Kenya,

00:00:03.756 --> 00:00:06.823
at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park.

00:00:06.823 --> 00:00:08.811
Those are my dad's cows at the back,

00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:10.791
and behind the cows,

00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:13.095
that's the Nairobi National Park.

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:16.600
Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.062
which means wild animals like zebras

00:00:20.062 --> 00:00:23.983
migrate out of the park freely.

00:00:23.983 --> 00:00:27.996
So predators like lions follow them,

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:30.791
and this is what they do.
