Liz Ogbu: So Lisa,

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.851
Apple is on target
to become carbon neutral

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:08.266
across its entire business
and manufacturing supply chain

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.616
by 2030.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.463
Can you explain exactly what that means?

00:00:12.487 --> 00:00:13.648
Lisa Jackson: Sure.

00:00:13.672 --> 00:00:19.266
So today Apple is carbon neutral
for all of our own operations.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.554
And we're running

00:00:22.578 --> 00:00:24.456
for our corporate campuses,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.766
for our stores

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.486
and for our data centers.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.521
So we know how to do this work.

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:34.041
The challenge for 2030
is to convert our supply chain,
