00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
these evenly spaced lines,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
which get closer and closer together,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
which describes how gravity works.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
There's something very appealing

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
about the exactitude of science

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
that I really enjoy.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And I love the shapes that I see

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
in scientific observations

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and apparatus,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
especially astronomical forms

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and the idea of the vastness of it,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
the scale,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
is very interesting to me.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
My focus in recent years
