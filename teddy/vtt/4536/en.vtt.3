00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in playing with these forces.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
TS: Well, like the magnetically levitated objects --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
like that silver one there,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
that was the result

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
of hundreds of experiments with magnets,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
trying to find a way to make something float

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
with the least possible connection to the ground.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So I got it down to just one tether

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to be able to support that.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
JH: Now is this electromagnetic here, or are these static?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
TS: Those are permanent magnets, yeah.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
JH: Because if the power went out, there would just be a big noise.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
TS: Yeah.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's really unsatisfactory having plug-in art.
