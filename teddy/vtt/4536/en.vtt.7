00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
so I had to run in there,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
didn't have any control over the spigot remotely.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So that told me right away: I need a remote control device.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
But then I started dreaming of having six colors.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I sort of think about it as the DNA --

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
these colors, the red, blue, yellow,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
the primary colors and white and black.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And if you put them together in different combinations --

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
just like printing in a sense,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
like how a magazine color is printed --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and put them under certain forces,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
which is orbiting them

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
or passing them back and forth
