00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and it's more playful,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
but inevitably,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
all of this can be used.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I can redeem this painting,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
just continuing on,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
doing layers upon layers.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And I keep it around for a couple of weeks,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and I'm contemplating it,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and I'll do another session with it

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and bring it up to another level,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
where all of this

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
becomes the background, the depth of it.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
JH: That's fantastic.
