00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
of a kind of radio interference patterns,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
which are so ubiquitous

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
and such an important part of our lives.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
JH: Is that a literal part of the image,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
or is my eye making that interference pattern --

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
is my eye completing that interference pattern?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
TS: It is the paint actually,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
makes it real.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
It's really manifested there.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
If I throw a very concentric circle,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
or concentric ellipse,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
it just dutifully makes

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
these evenly spaced lines,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
which get closer and closer together,
