00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that magnetism takes in the universe.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But with the pendulum,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
it allows me to manifest

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
these invisible forces

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
that are holding the magnets up.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
My sculptures

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
are normally very simplified.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I try to refine them down

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
to very simple forms.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
But the paintings become very complex,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
because I think the fields

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that are supporting them,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
they're billowing, and they're interpenetrating,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and they're interference patterns.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
JH: And they're non-deterministic.
