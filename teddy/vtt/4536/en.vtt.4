It's really unsatisfactory having plug-in art.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
JH: I agree.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
TS: The magnetic works

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
are a combination of gravity and magnetism,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
so it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that influence everything.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The sun has a tremendous field

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
that extends way beyond the planets

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So there's this huge

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
invisible shape structures

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that magnetism takes in the universe.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But with the pendulum,
