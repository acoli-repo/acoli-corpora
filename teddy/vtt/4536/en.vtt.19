00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and complex.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So I think, conceivably, those could be predictive.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Because since it has the ability

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
to make forms

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
that look like forms that we're familiar with

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
in biology,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And maybe it's the kind of forms

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
we'll discover underneath the surface of Mars,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
where there are probably lakes

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
with fish swimming under the surface.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
JH: Oh, let's hope so. Oh, my God, let's.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Oh, please, yes. Oh, I'm so there.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
You know, it seems
