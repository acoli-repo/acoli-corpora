00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and they're interference patterns.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
JH: And they're non-deterministic.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I mean, you don't know necessarily where you're headed when you begin,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
even though the forces can be calculated.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So the evolution of this --

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I gather this isn't your first pendulum.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
TS: No. (JH: No.)

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
TS: The first one I did was in the late 70's,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and I just had a simple cone

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
with a spigot at the bottom of it.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I threw it into an orbit,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and it only had one color,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and when it got to the center, the paint kept running out,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
so I had to run in there,
