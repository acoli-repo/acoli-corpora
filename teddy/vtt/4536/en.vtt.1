What does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
if you could connect the two spheres?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And in proportion, what would the size of the sphere

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and the length, and what would the taper be to the Earth?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And so I went about and made that sculpture,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
turning it out of solid bronze.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And I did one that was about 35 feet long.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The sun end was about four inches in diameter,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and then it tapered over about 35 feet

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to about a millimeter at the Earth end.
