00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
My focus in recent years

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
has kind of shifted more toward biology.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Some of these paintings, when you look at them very close,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
odd things appear

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
that really look like horses or birds

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
or crocodiles, elephants.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
There are lots of things that appear.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
When you look into it, it's sort of like looking at cloud patterns,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
but sometimes they're very modeled and highly rendered.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And then there are all these forms

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
that we don't know what they are,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
but they're equally well-resolved

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and complex.
