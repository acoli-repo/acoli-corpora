00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
just by the marriage

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
of two events that are happening,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and I'm very interested in that.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Like the occurrence of moire patterns.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Like this green one,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
this is a painting I did about 10 years ago,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
but it has some --

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
see, in the upper third --

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
there are these moires and interference patterns

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
that are radio kind of imagery.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And that's something that in painting

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I've never seen done.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I've never seen a representation

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
of a kind of radio interference patterns,
