I guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
In my case,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
my left hand has a significant tremor

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and my left leg also.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I'm left-handed, and so I draw.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
All my creations

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
really start on small drawings,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
which I have thousands of,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
and it's my way of just thinking.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I draw with a simple pencil,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and at first, the Parkinson's

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
was really upsetting,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
because I couldn't get the pencil to stand still.
