00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
this device kind of comes in handy,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
because I don't have to have

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
the fine motor skills to do,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that I can operate slides,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
which is more of a mental process.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I'm looking at it and making decisions:

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
It needs more red, it needs more blue,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
it needs a different shape.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And so I make these creative decisions

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and can execute them

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
in a much, much simpler way.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I mean, I've got the symptoms.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
I guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms.
