00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to about a millimeter at the Earth end.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And so for me, it was really exciting

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
just to see what it looks like

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
if you could step outside and into a larger context,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
as though you were an astronaut,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and see these two things as an object,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
because they are so intimately bound,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and one is meaningless without the other.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
JH: Is there a relief

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in playing with these forces?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in playing with these forces.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
TS: Well, like the magnetically levitated objects --
