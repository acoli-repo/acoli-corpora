John Hockenberry: It's great to be here with you, Tom.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And I want to start with a question

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that has just been consuming me

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I had the question popped into my head:

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
