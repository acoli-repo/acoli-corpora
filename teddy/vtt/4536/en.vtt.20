You know, it seems

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
at this stage in your life,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
you also very personally

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
are in this state of confrontation

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
with a sort of dissonant --

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I suppose it's an electromagnetic force

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
that somehow governs your Parkinson's

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and this creative force

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that is both the artist

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
who is in the here and now

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and this sort of arc of your whole life.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Is that relevant to your work?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
TS: As it turns out,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
this device kind of comes in handy,
