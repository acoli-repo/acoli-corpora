00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
was really upsetting,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
because I couldn't get the pencil to stand still.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
JH: So you're not a gatekeeper for these forces.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
You don't think of yourself as the master of these forces.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
You think of yourself as the servant.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
TS: Nature is -- well, it's a godsend.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
It just has so much in it.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And I think nature

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
wants to express itself

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
in the sense that we are nature,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
humans are of the universe.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
The universe is in our mind,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
and our minds are in the universe.
