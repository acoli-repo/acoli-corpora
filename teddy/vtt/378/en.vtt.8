And the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
you can go into Trending Topics.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And you tend to find topics

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
that are almost entirely African-American conversations.

This was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and Martin Wattenberg,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
two amazing visualization designers,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000

and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and in ways that you wouldn't expect.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that cookout
