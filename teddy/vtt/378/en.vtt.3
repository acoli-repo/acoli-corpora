00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
again, my Brazilian friends tell me --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
is pitching in to help out.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It turns out that Lady Gaga

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
has released a new single --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
actually five or six new singles, as near as I can tell --

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
titled "Cala a boca, Galvao."

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And my Brazilian friends tell me that

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
if I just tweet the phrase "Cala a boca, Galvao,"

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
10 cents will be given

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
to a global campaign

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
to save this rare and beautiful bird.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Now, most of you have figured out that this was a prank,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and actually a very, very good one.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
"Cala a boca, Galvao" actually means something very different.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
In Portugese, it means "Shut your mouth, Galvao."
