a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
rather than to the rest of the world.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
In the U.K., you can get up,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
from Canada, God forbid from the U.S.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
You probably won't.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
If you look at online media consumption --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
in this case, in the top 10 users of the internet --

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
more than 95 percent of the news readership

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
is on domestic news sites.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
It's one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than [the U.K.],

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
because we actually like reading your media,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
rather than vice versa.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
So all of this starts leading me
