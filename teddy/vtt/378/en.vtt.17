00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
based on what American

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
television news casts

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
looked at for a month.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And you see that when you distort a map based on attention,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
the world within American television news

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
is basically reduced to

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
this giant bloated U.S.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and a couple of other countries which we've invaded.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And that's basically what our media is about.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news --

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
which is dreadful, and I agree that it's dreadful --

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I've been mapping elite media like the New York Times,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and I get the same thing.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
When you look at the New York Times, you look at other elite media,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations
