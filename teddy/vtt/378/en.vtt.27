00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
They translate roughly 100 articles a day

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
from major newspapers, major websites.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
They put it online for free.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
It's the project of a guy named Zhang Lei,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
who was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and who couldn't believe how biased

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
American media coverage was.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And he said, "If there's one thing I can do, I can start translating,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
so that people between these countries

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
start understanding each other a little bit better."

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And my question to you is:

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
if Yeeyan can line up 150,000 people

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
to translate the English internet into Chinese,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
where's the English language Yeeyan?
