native to Brazil.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Every year, more than 300,000 Galvao birds

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
are killed during Carnival parades.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Ethan Zuckerman: Obviously, this is a tragic situation,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and it actually gets worse.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It turns out that, not only is the Galvao parrot

very attractive, useful for headdresses,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
which means that there's a terrible problem

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
with Galvao abuse.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And it's terribly endangered.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The good news about this is that the global community --

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
again, my Brazilian friends tell me --
