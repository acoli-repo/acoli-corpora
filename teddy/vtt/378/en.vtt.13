There's crackdowns on the press.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
It's actually a place that we probably should

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
be paying attention to at the moment.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Here's what I think is going on.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I think that we tend to look a lot

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000

It includes things like the Internet cables.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
We look at a map like this one,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and it looks like the entire world is flat

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
because everything is a hop or two away.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
You can get on a flight in London,
