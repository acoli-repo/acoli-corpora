tell a lot of people what to read.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And you can listen to her as well,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
if this is a way that you're interested in having your web widened.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
So once you start widening like this,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
once you start translating, once you start curating,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
you end up in some really weird places.

This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And AfriGadget is a blog that looks

at technology in an Africa context.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
And specifically, it's looking at a blacksmith

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
in Kibera in Nairobi,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
who is turning the shaft of a Landrover
