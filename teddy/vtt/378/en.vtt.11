He's at a technology conference in Florida.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And he's looking at something really, truly absurd,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
which is bottles of Evian water on the table.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And Negroponte says this is crazy.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
This is the old economy.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
It's the economy of moving these

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
heavy, slow atoms over long distances that's very difficult to do.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
We're heading to the future of bits,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
where everything is speedy, it's weightless.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
It can be anywhere in the world at any time.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And it's going to change the world as we know it.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Now, Negroponte has been right about a lot of things.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
He's totally wrong about this one.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It turns out that in many cases
