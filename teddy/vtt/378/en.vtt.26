Unfortunately, it's a machine translation of the page.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And while Google is very, very good with some languages,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
it's actually pretty dreadful with Chinese.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And the results can be pretty funny.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
What you really want -- what I really want,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
is eventually the ability to push a button

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and have this queued

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
so a human being can translate this.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And if you think this is absurd, it's not.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
There's a group right now in China called Yeeyan.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And Yeeyan is a group

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
of 150,000 volunteers

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
who get online every day.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
They look for the most interesting content in the English language.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
They translate roughly 100 articles a day
