I'm an American, which means, generally,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I ignore football unless it involves

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
guys my size or Bruno's size

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
running into each other at extremely high speeds.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That said, it's been really hard

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to ignore football

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
for the last couple of weeks.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I go onto Twitter, there are all these strange words that I've never heard before:

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
FIFA, vuvuzela,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
weird jokes about octopi.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But the one that's really been sort of stressing me out,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that I haven't been able to figure out,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
is this phrase "Cala a boca, Galvao."

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If you've gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks,
