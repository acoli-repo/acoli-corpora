00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
as we're discussing here at TED,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
the real problems in the world

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
the interesting problems to solve

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
are global in scale and scope,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
they require global conversations

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
to get to global solutions.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
This is a problem we have to solve.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
So here's the good news.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
For six years, I've been hanging out with these guys.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
This is a group called Global Voices.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
This is a team of bloggers from around the world.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Our mission was to fix the world's media.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
We started in 2004.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
You might have noticed, we haven't done all that well so far.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Nor do I think we are by ourselves,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
actually going to solve the problem.
