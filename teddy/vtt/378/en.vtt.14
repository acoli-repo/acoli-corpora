00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
You can get on a flight in London,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
you can end up in Bangalore later today.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Two hops, you're in Suva, the capitol of Fiji.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
It's all right there.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
When you start looking at what actually

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
flows on top of these networks,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
you get a very different picture.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
You start looking at how

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
the global plane flights move,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and you suddenly discover that the world isn't even close to flat.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
It's extremely lumpy.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
There are parts of the world that are very, very well connected.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
There's basically a giant pathway in the sky

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
between London and New York.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
but look at this map, and you can watch this

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
for, you know, two or three minutes.
