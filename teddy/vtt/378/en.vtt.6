00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
There's more than five million of them.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
As far as national representation,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
11 percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
That's a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Next to Japan,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
it's the second most represented by population.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Now if you're using Twitter or other social networks,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and you didn't realize

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
you're like most of us.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Because what happens on a social network

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
is you interact with the people

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
that you have chosen to interact with.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And if you are like me, a big, geeky, white, American guy,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky, white, American guys.
