00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
So all of this starts leading me

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
to think that we're in a state that I refer to

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
as imaginary cosmopolitanism.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
We look at the internet.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
We think we're getting this wide view of the globe.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
to connect us to the rest of the world.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And we forget that most of the time

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
we're checking Boston Red Sox scores.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So this is a real problem --

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
but it's a real problem because,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
as we're discussing here at TED,
