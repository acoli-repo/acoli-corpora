00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that cookout

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
is a mostly black conversation.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And what's crazy about this is that

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter,

You click on that cookout tag, there an entirely different conversation

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
where we see the people we already know

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and the people who are similar to the people we already know.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And we tend not to see that wider picture.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Now for me, I'm surprised by this,
