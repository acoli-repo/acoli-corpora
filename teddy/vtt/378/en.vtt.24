and to learn computers and the internet.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
but what happened was that Madagascar

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
went through a violent coup.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Most independent media was shut down.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And the high school students

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
publishing their own thoughts, publishing independent media,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
ended up having a huge impact

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
on what we know about this country.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Now the trick with this is that I'm guessing
