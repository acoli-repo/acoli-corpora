00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
she has to know something about a global audience.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
She has to know something about what stories are available.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Basically, she's a deejay.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
She's a skilled human curator

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
who knows what material is available to her,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
who's able to listen to the audience,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and who's able to make a selection

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and push people forward in one fashion or another.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I don't think this is necessarily an algorithmic process.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
I think what's great about the internet

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
is that it actually makes it much easier

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
for deejays to reach a wider audience.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I know Amira.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I can ask her what to read.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
But with the internet, she's in a position where she can

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
tell a lot of people what to read.
