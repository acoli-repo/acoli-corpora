In Portugese, it means "Shut your mouth, Galvao."

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And it specifically refers to this guy, Galvao Bueno,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
who's the lead soccer commentator

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
for Rede Globo.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And what I understand from my Brazilian friends

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
is that this guy is just a cliche machine.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
He can ruin the most interesting match

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
by just spouting cliche again and again and again.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So Brazilians went to that first match

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
against North Korea,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
put up this banner, started a Twitter campaign

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and tried to convince the rest of us

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
to tweet the phrase: "Cala a boca, Galvao."

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And in fact, were so successful at this
