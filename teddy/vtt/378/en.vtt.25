on what we know about this country.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Now the trick with this is that I'm guessing

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
most people here don't speak Malagasy.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
I'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak Chinese --

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
which is sort of sad if you think about it,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
as it's now the most represented language on the internet.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
If you're using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
you notice this really cute box at the top,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
which automatically detects that the page is in Chinese

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and very quickly at a mouse click

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
will give you a translation of the page.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Unfortunately, it's a machine translation of the page.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And while Google is very, very good with some languages,
