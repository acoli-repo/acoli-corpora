If you've gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
you've probably seen this.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's been a major trending topic.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Being a monolingual American, I obviously don't know what the phrase means.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So I went onto Twitter,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and I asked some people if they could explain to me "Cala a boca, Galvao."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And fortunately, my Brazilian friends

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
were more than ready to help.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
They explained that the Galvao bird

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is a rare and endangered parrot

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that's in terrible, terrible danger.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
In fact, I'll let them tell you a bit more about it.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Narrator: A word about Galvao, a very rare kind of bird

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
native to Brazil.
