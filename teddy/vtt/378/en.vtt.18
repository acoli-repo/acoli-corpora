When you look at the New York Times, you look at other elite media,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and the nations we've invaded.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It turns out that new media

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
isn't necessarily helping us all that much.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Here's a map made by Mark Graham

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
who's down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
that have been geo-coded.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And you'll notice that there's a very heavy bias

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
towards North America and Western Europe.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Even within Wikipedias,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
where we're creating their own content online,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
there's a heavy bias towards the place where

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
rather than to the rest of the world.
