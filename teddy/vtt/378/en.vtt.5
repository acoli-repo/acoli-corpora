00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And in fact, were so successful at this

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that it topped Twitter for two weeks.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Now there's a couple --

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
there's a couple of lessons that you can take from this.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And the first lesson, which I think is a worthwhile one,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
is that you cannot go wrong

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000

it's pretty easy to get away with.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The other thing you can take from this, by the way,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
There's more than five million of them.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
As far as national representation,
