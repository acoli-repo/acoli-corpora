00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And if you are like me, a big, geeky, white, American guy,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky, white, American guys.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And you don't necessarily have the sense

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
that Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
It's also extremely surprising to many Americans,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
a heavily African-American space.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Twitter recently did some research.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
They looked at their local population.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
They believe that 24 percent

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
of American Twitter users are African-American.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
That's about twice as high as African-Americans

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
are represented in the population.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And again, that was very shocking to many Twitter users,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
but it shouldn't be.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day
