00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
that you didn't know you needed,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
our main philosophy is to look to our social networks,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
to look for our friends.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
What are they looking at? Maybe we should be looking at it.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
The problem with this is that essentially

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
You end up flocking with a lot of people

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
who are probably similar to you,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
who have similar interests.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And it's very, very hard to get information

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
from the other flocks, from the other parts of the world

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
where people getting together and talking about their own interests.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
To do this, at a certain point,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
You need a guide.
