Now for me, I'm surprised by this,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
because this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
If you go back into the early days of the internet,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
when cyber-utopians like Nick Negroponte

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
were writing big books like "Being Digital,"

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
the prediction was that the internet

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
was going to be an incredibly powerful force

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
to smooth out cultural differences,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Negroponte started his book with a story

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
about how hard it is to build connections

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
in the world of atoms.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
