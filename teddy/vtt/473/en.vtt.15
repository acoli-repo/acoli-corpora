Or if it was even British.

00:07:32.712 --> 00:07:37.682
And I'm not even going to go into
the lies that Arron Banks has told

00:07:37.706 --> 00:07:41.299
about his covert relationship
with the Russian government.

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:46.656
Or the weird timing of Nigel Farage's
meetings with Julian Assange

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.776
and with Trump's buddy,
Roger Stone, now indicted,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.220
immediately before
two massive WikiLeaks dumps,

00:07:53.244 --> 00:07:55.950
both of which happened
to benefit Donald Trump.

00:07:55.974 --> 00:08:00.749
But I will tell you that Brexit
and Trump were intimately entwined.
