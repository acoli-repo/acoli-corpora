00:05:58.153 --> 00:06:00.535
Turkey is not joining the European Union.

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:05.769
There's not even any discussions
of it joining the European Union.

00:06:05.793 --> 00:06:08.230
And most of us, we never saw these ads,

00:06:08.254 --> 00:06:10.601
because we were not the target of them.

00:06:10.944 --> 00:06:14.625
"Vote Leave" identified
a tiny sliver of people

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:17.498
who it identified as persuadable,
and they saw them.

00:06:17.522 --> 00:06:19.982
And the only reason
we are seeing these now

00:06:20.006 --> 00:06:24.322
is because parliament forced
Facebook to hand them over.

00:06:25.587 --> 00:06:26.761
And maybe you think,

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:28.746
"Well, it was just a bit of overspending.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.920
It's a few lies."
