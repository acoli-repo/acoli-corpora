Because you set out to connect people.

00:14:01.807 --> 00:14:03.835
And you are refusing to acknowledge

00:14:03.859 --> 00:14:07.317
that the same technology
is now driving us apart.

00:14:09.038 --> 00:14:11.308
And my question to everybody else is,

00:14:11.332 --> 00:14:12.732
is this what we want:

00:14:13.903 --> 00:14:16.545
to let them get away with it,

00:14:16.569 --> 00:14:20.505
and to sit back and play with our phones,
as this darkness falls?

00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:28.474
The history of the South Wales Valleys
is of a fight for rights.

00:14:28.498 --> 00:14:32.713
And this is not a drill --
it's a point of inflection.
