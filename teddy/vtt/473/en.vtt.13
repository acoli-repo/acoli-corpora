in Britain for 100 years.

00:06:37.405 --> 00:06:40.674
In a once-in-a-generation vote

00:06:40.698 --> 00:06:45.190
that hinged upon just
one percent of the electorate.

00:06:47.075 --> 00:06:50.646
And it was just one of the crimes
that took place in the referendum.

00:06:51.027 --> 00:06:52.570
There was another group,

00:06:52.594 --> 00:06:56.392
which was headed
by this man, Nigel Farage,

00:06:57.522 --> 00:06:59.299
the one to the right of Trump.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.648
And his group, "Leave.EU" --
it also broke the law.
