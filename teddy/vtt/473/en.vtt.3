00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:32.630
And this is the new 77-million-pound
road-improvement scheme,

00:01:32.654 --> 00:01:35.122
and there's a new train line,
a new railway station,

00:01:35.146 --> 00:01:37.550
and they're all being funded
by the European Union.

00:01:37.574 --> 00:01:39.588
And it's not as if
any of this is a secret,

00:01:39.612 --> 00:01:41.843
because there's big signs
like this everywhere.

(Laughter)

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:47.800
I had this sort of
weird sense of unreality,

00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:49.630
walking around the town.

00:01:49.654 --> 00:01:51.046
And it came to a head

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.870
when I met this young man
in front of the sports center.

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:59.117
And he told me that he had voted to leave,

00:01:59.141 --> 00:02:03.537
because the European Union
had done nothing for him.
