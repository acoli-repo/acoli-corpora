So, on the day after the Brexit vote,

00:00:04.198 --> 00:00:07.151
in June 2016,

when Britain woke up to the shock

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:12.125
of discovering that we're leaving
the European Union,

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:14.982
my editor at the "Observer"
newspaper in the UK

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:19.202
asked me to go back to South Wales,
where I grew up, and to write a report.

00:00:20.075 --> 00:00:22.608

00:00:23.178 --> 00:00:24.455

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:28.109

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:33.022
So it's had this very, sort of rich,
working-class culture,
