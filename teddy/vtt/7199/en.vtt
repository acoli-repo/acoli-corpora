00:00:01.116 --> 00:00:05.436
I’m here, in the heart of London’s
financial district, the Square Mile.

00:00:06.036 --> 00:00:08.476
This is the area where I worked

00:00:08.516 --> 00:00:12.396
at the start of my investment-banking
career in the ’90s,

00:00:12.436 --> 00:00:14.236
as a fresh-faced youth.

00:00:15.036 --> 00:00:19.956
But if you told me then
that I would end up as COP26 president,

00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:23.236
I think I’d have asked you what COP26 was.

00:00:23.516 --> 00:00:27.476
It’s the 26th United Nations
climate conference

00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:29.716
and it’s taking place in the UK.
