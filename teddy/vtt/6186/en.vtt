Mia Birdsong: Why is Black Lives Matter
important for the US right now

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.600
and in the world?

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.840
Patrisse Cullors: Black Lives Matter
is our call to action.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.696
It is a tool to reimagine a world

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.936
where black people are free to exist,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.896
free to live.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.520
It is a tool for our allies
to show up differently for us.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.360
I grew up in a neighborhood
