My name is Glenn,

00:00:02.542 --> 00:00:04.059
I'm 25,

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:06.542
and I don't know my real last name.

00:00:07.542 --> 00:00:09.893
It's not uncommon in America.

00:00:09.917 --> 00:00:12.893
Most black people in this country
are walking around

00:00:12.917 --> 00:00:14.625
with a slave owner's last name.

00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:20.726
Black history has been systemically erased
and altered for centuries.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.018
As I give this talk,

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:26.768
there are more than 700 Confederate
monuments standing nationwide.

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:29.559
These were erected
to honor Confederate soldiers

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:31.434
who fought to maintain slavery --
