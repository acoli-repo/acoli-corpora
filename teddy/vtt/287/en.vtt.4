00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:00.851
to highlight the narratives
of the oppressed.

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:03.851
In our campaign to knock
Columbus off his pedestal,

00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:07.375
we engaged in a visually
provocative form of activism.

00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:10.434
We created an augmented
reality installation

00:02:10.458 --> 00:02:13.059
on the true story of Christopher Columbus

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:17.292
and used it to host teach-ins
in Columbus Circle and Times Square.

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:21.143
Many see the controversy around the statue

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:24.643
as tension between
the Italian-American community

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:26.726
and the indigenous community.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.226
The reality is that most black people
are here in this country
