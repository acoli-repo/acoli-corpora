00:05:57.583 --> 00:06:01.268
and be directed to the donation page
of The Bail Project,

00:06:01.292 --> 00:06:04.417
a fund that raises money for people
who cannot afford bail.

00:06:05.542 --> 00:06:07.018
With augmented reality,

00:06:07.042 --> 00:06:10.184
we the people have the power

00:06:10.208 --> 00:06:12.393
to highlight the narratives
of the oppressed

00:06:12.417 --> 00:06:14.708
when institutions refuse to do so.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:19.893
We can use this tool
to highlight the systemic implications

00:06:19.917 --> 00:06:22.059
of erasing someone's history.

00:06:22.083 --> 00:06:23.809
And more concretely,

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:27.268
we can use this technology
as a way to support initiatives

00:06:27.292 --> 00:06:29.750
that are fighting against systemic racism.
