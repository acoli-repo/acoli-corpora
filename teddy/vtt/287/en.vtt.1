00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:31.434
who fought to maintain slavery --

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:32.768
mostly in the South --

00:00:32.792 --> 00:00:35.268
from the 1890s to the 1950s,

00:00:35.292 --> 00:00:39.792
when Jim Crow laws enforcing
racial segregation were in full effect.

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:45.226
To this day, black people are forced
to confront monuments of slaveholders

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.393
in our public spaces.

00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:50.893
These memorials are a physical
representation of a system

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:54.643
that is actively working
to define whose lives matter

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:56.601
and whose lives do not.

00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:58.893
If we are going to disrupt the narrative,

00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:01.351
we have to start at the origin.
