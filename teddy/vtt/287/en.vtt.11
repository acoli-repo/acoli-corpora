00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.208
Our vision is a "Pokémon Go"
for a contextualized history.

00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:38.768
Augmented reality can also be used
as a tool to support organizations

00:05:38.792 --> 00:05:42.101
that are fighting
against systemic oppression.

00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:44.893
In 2019 we will release
our free smartphone app

00:05:44.917 --> 00:05:47.559
with augmented reality
monuments and content.

00:05:47.583 --> 00:05:50.934
You can take your smartphone
and hold it over any one-dollar bill

00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:52.726
and see a scene in augmented reality

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.976
that illustrates
the injustice of cash bail.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.559
You can then click on the screen

00:05:57.583 --> 00:06:01.268
and be directed to the donation page
of The Bail Project,
