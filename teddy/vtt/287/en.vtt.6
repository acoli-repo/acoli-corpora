00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:03.143
We gave it everything that we had,

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:04.518
but in the end,

00:03:04.542 --> 00:03:07.101
New York City decided to keep the statue,

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:11.101
and New York State unanimously voted
to make it a landmark.

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:13.809
The news was devastating,

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:15.851
but it opened up another door.

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:18.309
We realized that with augmented reality

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:20.643
you don't need permission
from the government

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:24.018
to put up a monument
or to make a statement.

00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:25.851
You can just do it.

00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:27.184
So New York City right now

00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:31.643
currently has more than 150 statues
of men and six of women
