WEBVTT

00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:31.643
currently has more than 150 statues
of men and six of women

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:35.101
and currently acknowledges slaveholders
in public spaces as well.

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:38.018
So we decided, why not just put up
a bunch of AR monuments

00:03:38.042 --> 00:03:40.333
of women and people of color
throughout the city?

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:43.309
Typically, monuments are created

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:46.684
to commemorate the achievements
of the deceased,

00:03:46.708 --> 00:03:49.708
but with augmented reality,
we can reroute the rules.

00:03:50.458 --> 00:03:52.434
We started with sports.

00:03:52.458 --> 00:03:54.059
Colin Kaepernick.

00:03:54.083 --> 00:03:57.434
He was the starting quarterback
of the San Francisco 49ers,

00:03:57.458 --> 00:03:59.059
and he wanted to use his platform

00:03:59.083 --> 00:04:01.976
to highlight the injustice
of systemic racism.
