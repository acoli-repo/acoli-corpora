00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:03.351
In 1969 in July,

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:06.309
three Americans launched into space.

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.726
Now, they went to the surface of the moon,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.226
they famously made
the great leap for mankind.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.351
Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong,
they walked on the surface,

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:16.643
they planted this flag.

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:22.101
It's rightly celebrated as a moment
that in America we say is a triumph.

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:25.101
We think it was this
amazing accomplishment.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.393
They didn't just leave behind
this flag, though.

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:28.894
They also left behind a plaque.

00:00:28.918 --> 00:00:30.559
This plaque is a beautiful object,
