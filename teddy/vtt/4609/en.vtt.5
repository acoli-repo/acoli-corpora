00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:31.717
looking out the window
at a little pond of water beneath the sea.

00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:35.022
We see ponds, we see
lakes, we see rivers --

00:02:35.046 --> 00:02:37.812
in fact, right here is a river
at the bottom of the ocean

00:02:37.836 --> 00:02:39.948
going from the lower
left to the upper right.

00:02:39.972 --> 00:02:41.916
Water is actually flowing through there.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.355
This totally blew our minds.

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.096
How can you have this at the bottom?

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.217
You're in the ocean looking at more water.

00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:49.952
And there's animals
that only live in that water.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.262
So, the bottom of the ocean --

00:02:52.286 --> 00:02:55.152
I love this map, because it shows
in the middle of the ocean,

00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:56.413
there's a mountain range.

00:02:56.437 --> 00:02:59.873
It's the greatest mountain range
on Earth, called the mid-ocean ridge --

00:02:59.897 --> 00:03:02.976
50,000 miles long,
and we've hardly had a peek at it.
