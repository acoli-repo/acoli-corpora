00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.318
or one person exploring,
it's a team of people.

00:03:30.342 --> 00:03:32.536
You've got to have the talent, the team.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.194
You've got to have the technology.

00:03:34.218 --> 00:03:37.373
In this case, it's our ship, Atlantis,
and the submarine, Alvin.

00:03:37.397 --> 00:03:39.897
Inside that submarine --
this is an Alvin launch --

00:03:39.921 --> 00:03:41.072
there's three people.

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:42.906
They're being wheeled out onto deck.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.140
There's 47 other people,

00:03:44.164 --> 00:03:47.781
the teamwork on that ship,
making sure that these people are okay.

00:03:47.805 --> 00:03:50.663
Everybody in that submarine
is thinking one thing right now:

00:03:50.687 --> 00:03:53.566
Should I have gone
to the bathroom one more time?

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.454
Because you're in there for 10 hours --

00:03:55.478 --> 00:03:57.000
10 hours in that little sphere.

00:03:57.024 --> 00:03:59.999
Three of you together
and nobody is going to be around you.
