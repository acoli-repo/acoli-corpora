00:01:28.644 --> 00:01:32.313
But what you probably don't know
is in the very deep part of the ocean,

00:01:32.337 --> 00:01:33.625
we have volcanic eruptions.

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.269
Most volcanoes on Earth
are at the bottom of the sea --

00:01:36.293 --> 00:01:37.542
more than 80 percent.

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:39.020
And we actually have fire,

00:01:39.044 --> 00:01:41.730
fire deep inside the ocean,
going on right now.

00:01:41.754 --> 00:01:45.023
All over the world -- in the Pacific,
the Atlantic, the Indian Ocean.

00:01:45.047 --> 00:01:48.171
In this place, the ocean floor,
the rocks actually turn to liquid.

00:01:48.195 --> 00:01:50.354
So you actually have waves
on the ocean floor.

00:01:50.378 --> 00:01:53.379
You'd say nothing could live there,
but when we look in detail,

00:01:53.403 --> 00:01:56.533
even there, in the deepest,
darkest places on Earth, we find life,

00:01:56.557 --> 00:01:58.908
which tells us that life
really wants to happen.

00:01:58.932 --> 00:02:00.821
So, pretty amazing stuff.
