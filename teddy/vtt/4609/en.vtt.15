00:07:28.246 --> 00:07:30.697
and this is a thing
that we haven't even explored --

00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:32.062
five percent.

00:07:32.086 --> 00:07:33.910
The thing I want to leave you with is,

00:07:33.934 --> 00:07:36.315
in that five percent,
I showed you some cool stuff.

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:37.872
There's a lot more cool stuff --

00:07:37.896 --> 00:07:41.984
every dive we go on in the ocean,
we find something new about the sea.

00:07:42.008 --> 00:07:43.749
So what's in that other 95 percent?

00:07:43.773 --> 00:07:46.458
Did we get the exciting stuff
or is there more out there?

00:07:46.482 --> 00:07:49.545
And I'm here to tell you
that the ocean is full of surprises.

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.776
There's a quote I love by Marcel Proust:

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.311
"The true voyage of exploration
is not so much in seeking new landscapes,"

00:07:55.335 --> 00:07:56.485
which we do,

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:57.712
"but in having new eyes."

00:07:57.736 --> 00:08:00.106
And so I hope today,
by showing you some of this,
