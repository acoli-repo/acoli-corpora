00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.456
We thought that nothing
could live inside that world

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.793
at the bottom of the ocean.

00:04:32.817 --> 00:04:35.396
And when we look,
we find some amazing things.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.643
All the way down --
we call it the mid-water --

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:40.443
from the top of the ocean
down to the bottom, we find life.

00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:42.442
Whenever we stop and look, we find life.

00:04:42.466 --> 00:04:44.141
I'm going to show you some jellies.

00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:46.908
They're absolutely some
of the coolest creatures on Earth.

00:04:46.932 --> 00:04:49.288
Look at that thing,
just flailing his arms around.

00:04:49.312 --> 00:04:50.712
That's like a little lobster.

00:04:50.736 --> 00:04:53.986
That one is like all these animals
with their mouths hooked together,

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.163
the colonial animals.

00:04:55.187 --> 00:04:58.158
Some animals are tiny,
some can be longer than this stage.

00:04:58.182 --> 00:04:59.333
Just amazing animals.

00:04:59.357 --> 00:05:01.273
And you can't collect them with a net --
