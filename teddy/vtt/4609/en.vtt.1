00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.231
and it's that planet called Earth.

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:33.271
But in this picture here,
you'll see that Earth is mostly water.

00:00:33.295 --> 00:00:34.446
That's the Pacific.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.704
Seventy percent of Earth
is covered with water.

00:00:36.728 --> 00:00:38.880
You can say, "Hey,
I know Earth. I live here."

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:40.174
You don't know Earth.

00:00:40.198 --> 00:00:43.437
You don't know this planet,
because most of it's covered with that --

00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:44.666
average depth, two miles.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.870
And when you go outside

00:00:45.894 --> 00:00:48.761
and look up at the Empire State
Building, Chrysler Building,

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:52.014
the average depth of the ocean
is 15 of those on top of one another.

00:00:52.038 --> 00:00:55.198
We've explored about five percent
of what's in that water.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:59.002
"Explored," meaning, for the first time,
go peek and see what's there.

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:01.622
So what I want to do today
is show you some things
