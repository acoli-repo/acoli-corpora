00:06:28.816 --> 00:06:30.974
this ship was supposed
to show up in New York.

00:06:30.998 --> 00:06:32.149
It's the Titanic.

00:06:32.173 --> 00:06:34.185
I co-led an expedition
out there last year.

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:36.623
We are learning so much about that ship.

00:06:36.647 --> 00:06:38.966
The Titanic is an interesting
place for biology,

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.123
because animals are moving
in to live on the Titanic.

00:06:42.147 --> 00:06:44.674
Microbes are actually
eating the hull of the Titanic.

00:06:44.698 --> 00:06:48.103
That's where Jack was king of the world
there on the bow of the Titanic.

00:06:48.127 --> 00:06:49.326
So we're doing real good.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.425
And what's exciting to me
is that we're making a virtual Titanic,

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:56.834
so you can sit there at home
with your joystick and your headset on,

00:06:56.858 --> 00:06:59.412
and you can actually explore
the Titanic for yourself.

00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:01.931
That's what we want to do,
make these virtual worlds,
