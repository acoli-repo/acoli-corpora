00:04:59.357 --> 00:05:01.273
And you can't collect them with a net --

00:05:01.297 --> 00:05:03.892
we have to go with our cameras
and take a look at them.

00:05:03.916 --> 00:05:06.171
So every time we go, new species of life.

00:05:06.195 --> 00:05:07.664
The ocean is full of life.

00:05:08.572 --> 00:05:10.485
And yet the deepest part of the ocean --

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.089
when we go to that mountain range,
we find hot springs.

00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:15.557
Now we were sure --
because this is poisonous water,

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:17.812
because it's so deep
it would crush the Titanic

00:05:17.836 --> 00:05:20.275
the same way you crush
an empty cup in your hand --

00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:22.633
we were sure there would be
no life there at all.

00:05:22.657 --> 00:05:25.815
Instead, we find more life
and diversity and density

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:27.452
than in the tropical rainforest.

00:05:27.476 --> 00:05:30.849
So, in one instance, in one peek
out the window of the sub,
