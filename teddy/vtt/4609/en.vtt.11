00:05:27.476 --> 00:05:30.849
So, in one instance, in one peek
out the window of the sub,

00:05:30.873 --> 00:05:32.024
we discover something

00:05:32.048 --> 00:05:34.790
that revolutionizes the way
we think about life on Earth;

00:05:34.814 --> 00:05:37.216
and that is, you don't always
have to have sunlight

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.398
to get life going.

00:05:38.858 --> 00:05:41.692
There's big animals down there too,
some that look familiar.

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:44.366
That guy's called Dumbo.
I love him. Dumbo's great.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.038
This guy -- oh man,
I wish I had more footage of this.

00:05:47.062 --> 00:05:49.967
We're trying to get an expedition
together to go look at this

00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:51.976
and maybe in a year we'll have that.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.315
Go online and look.

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:56.409
Vampyroteuthis infernalis.
The vampire squid.

00:05:56.433 --> 00:05:57.866
Incredibly cool.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.700
In the darkness of the deep sea,
he's got glowing tentacles,
