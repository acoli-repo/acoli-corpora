00:01:58.932 --> 00:02:00.821
So, pretty amazing stuff.

00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:02.869
Every time we go to the bottom of the sea,

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:05.162
we explore with our submarines,
with our robots,

00:02:05.186 --> 00:02:07.202
we see something
that's usually surprising,

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:09.857
sometimes it's startling
and sometimes revolutionary.

00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:12.316
You see that puddle
of water sitting there.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.602
And all around the water
there's a little cliff,

00:02:14.626 --> 00:02:16.316
there's a little white sandy beach.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.146
We'll get closer, you'll see
the beach a little bit better,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.250
some of the waves
in that water, down there.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:23.242
The thing that's special about this water

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:25.559
is that it's at the bottom
of the Gulf of Mexico.

00:02:25.583 --> 00:02:27.409
So you're sitting inside a submarine,

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:31.717
looking out the window
at a little pond of water beneath the sea.
