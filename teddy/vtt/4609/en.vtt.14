00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:01.931
That's what we want to do,
make these virtual worlds,

00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:05.268
so it's not Dave Gallo or someone else
exploring the world; it's you.

00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:06.672
You explore it for yourself.

00:07:06.696 --> 00:07:08.377
So here's the bottom line:

00:07:08.401 --> 00:07:11.257
The oceans are unexplored

00:07:11.281 --> 00:07:13.757
and I can't begin to tell
you how important that is,

00:07:13.781 --> 00:07:15.594
because they're important to us.

00:07:15.618 --> 00:07:18.249
Seven billion people live on this planet

00:07:18.273 --> 00:07:20.134
and all of us are impacted by the sea,

00:07:20.158 --> 00:07:24.674
because the oceans control the air
you breathe, the water you drink,

00:07:24.698 --> 00:07:25.849
the food you eat.

00:07:25.873 --> 00:07:28.222
All those are controlled
in some way by the ocean,

00:07:28.246 --> 00:07:30.697
and this is a thing
that we haven't even explored --
