00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.700
In the darkness of the deep sea,
he's got glowing tentacles,

00:06:00.724 --> 00:06:04.036
so if I'm coming at you like him,
I put my arms out in the darkness

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.458
so all you see are little
glowing things over here.

00:06:06.482 --> 00:06:07.946
Meanwhile, I'm coming at you.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.121
When he wants to escape,

00:06:09.145 --> 00:06:11.969
he's got these glowing pods
on his butt that look like eyes.

00:06:11.993 --> 00:06:14.036
Glowing eyes on his butt.
How cool is that?

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.236
Just an amazing animal.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.301
(Laughter)

00:06:16.325 --> 00:06:18.640
"Vampire" squid,
because when it gets protective,

00:06:18.664 --> 00:06:20.798
it pulls this black cape
over its whole body,

00:06:20.822 --> 00:06:22.130
and curls up into a ball.

00:06:22.154 --> 00:06:23.521
Outrageous animal.

00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:26.956
This ship, "The Ship of Dreams" --

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.792
a hundred years ago this coming April,

00:06:28.816 --> 00:06:30.974
this ship was supposed
to show up in New York.
