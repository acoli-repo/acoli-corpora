00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:01.622
So what I want to do today
is show you some things

00:01:01.646 --> 00:01:03.939
about this planet, about the oceans.

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:06.861
I want to take you from shallow water
down to the deep water,

00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:09.086
and hopefully, like me,
you'll see some things

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.765
that get you hooked
on exploring planet Earth.

00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:15.221
You know things like corals;
you've seen plenty of corals,

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:17.607
those of you who've been
to the beach, snorkeling,

00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:20.366
know corals are an amazing place
to go -- full of life,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.241
some big animals, small animals,
some nice, some dangerous,

00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:25.130
sharks, whales, all that stuff.

00:01:25.154 --> 00:01:27.432
They need to be protected from humanity.

00:01:27.456 --> 00:01:28.620
They're great places.

00:01:28.644 --> 00:01:32.313
But what you probably don't know
is in the very deep part of the ocean,
