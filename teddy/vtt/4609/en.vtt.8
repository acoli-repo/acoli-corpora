You go into the water
and once you hit the water, it's amazing.

00:04:03.231 --> 00:04:06.135
There's a lovely color blue
that penetrates right inside you.

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.223
You don't hear the surface ship anymore,

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:09.851
you hear that pinging of a sonar.

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:12.311
If you've got an iPhone
you've got sonar on there --

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:15.677
it's that same pinging that goes
down to the bottom and comes back up.

00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:18.838
Divers check out the sub to make
sure the outside is okay,

00:04:18.862 --> 00:04:20.022
and then they say "Go,"

00:04:20.046 --> 00:04:23.239
and down you go to the bottom
of the ocean and it's an amazing trip.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.976
So for two and a half hours,
you sink down to the bottom.

00:04:26.581 --> 00:04:28.976
And two hours of it
is totally pitch black.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.456
We thought that nothing
could live inside that world
