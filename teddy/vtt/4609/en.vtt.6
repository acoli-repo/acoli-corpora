WEBVTT

00:02:59.897 --> 00:03:02.976
50,000 miles long,
and we've hardly had a peek at it.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.150
Hardly had a peek at it.

00:03:04.174 --> 00:03:07.325
We find valleys,
many thousands of valleys,

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.476
larger, wider, deeper
than the Grand Canyon.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.215
We find, as I said, underwater
lakes, rivers, waterfalls.

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.906
The largest waterfall on the planet

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.454
is actually under the ocean,
up near Iceland.

00:03:17.873 --> 00:03:20.745
All that stuff is in that five percent
that we've explored.

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:23.888
So the deal about the ocean
is that to explore it,

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.760
you've got to have technology.

00:03:25.784 --> 00:03:28.085
Not only technology,
but it's not just Dave Gallo

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.318
or one person exploring,
it's a team of people.
