No one remembers when you're right,

00:00:01.836 --> 00:00:04.036
but no one forgets when you're wrong.

00:00:04.076 --> 00:00:06.436
That's a saying we can all
probably relate to.

00:00:06.476 --> 00:00:09.796
But arguably, no one deals
with the backlash of getting things wrong

00:00:09.836 --> 00:00:11.716
as regularly as a weather person.

00:00:11.756 --> 00:00:14.356

From angry Twitter posts to hate mail,

00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:17.676
people can get really annoyed

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:20.636
when the forecast
is nothing like the reality.

00:00:21.236 --> 00:00:24.596
In 1964, the director of the Taiwan
provincial weather bureau

00:00:24.596 --> 00:00:28.916
was even indicted for failing to correctly
forecast the path of a typhoon.

00:00:28.956 --> 00:00:30.756
So is our anger justified?
