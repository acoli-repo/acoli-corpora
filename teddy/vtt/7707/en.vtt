00:00:00.676 --> 00:00:04.996
There is a play
by one of my favorite writers,

00:00:05.036 --> 00:00:07.556
Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka,

00:00:07.596 --> 00:00:09.116
I would like to tell you about,

00:00:09.116 --> 00:00:10.796
"The Swamp Dwellers."

00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:15.276
"The Swamp Dwellers"
are about a blind beggar

00:00:15.316 --> 00:00:18.036
who attempts to buy a piece of swampland

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:21.396
because he believes
that the swamps will provide him

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:22.876
with a better livelihood.

00:00:22.876 --> 00:00:26.716
However, the villagers
in that swamp believe

00:00:26.716 --> 00:00:31.316
that deep in the forests
of the swamp lies a deity
