00:01:58.663 --> 00:02:00.538
and it's a part of the process.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:04.913
Three, and it's very subtle
but very important:

00:02:05.996 --> 00:02:08.663
Decide to settle
when growth is guaranteed.

00:02:08.704 --> 00:02:10.746
So when your life is going great,

00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:13.079
you have put together a great team,

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.454
and you have growing revenue,
and everything is set --

00:02:16.454 --> 00:02:17.788
time to settle.

00:02:18.454 --> 00:02:19.996
When I launched my first book,

00:02:20.038 --> 00:02:23.163
I worked really, really hard
to distribute it everywhere in Brazil.

00:02:23.204 --> 00:02:25.579
With that, over three million
people downloaded it,

00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:28.288
over 50,000 people bought physical copies.

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.788
When I wrote a sequel,
some impact was guaranteed.
