Two: Believe someone else
has the answers for you.

00:01:30.454 --> 00:01:32.788
Constantly, people want
to help out, right?

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.163
All sorts of people: your family,
your friends, your business partners,

00:01:36.204 --> 00:01:39.413
they all have opinions
on which path you should take:

00:01:39.413 --> 00:01:41.663
"And let me tell you,
go through this pipe."

00:01:41.704 --> 00:01:43.454
But whenever you go inside,

00:01:43.496 --> 00:01:46.204
there are other ways
you have to pick as well.

00:01:46.246 --> 00:01:48.913
And you need to make
those decisions yourself.

00:01:49.413 --> 00:01:52.621
No one else has the perfect
answers for your life.

00:01:53.288 --> 00:01:55.871
And you need to keep picking
those decisions, right?

00:01:55.871 --> 00:01:58.663
The pipes are infinite
and you're going to bump your head,

00:01:58.663 --> 00:02:00.538
and it's a part of the process.
