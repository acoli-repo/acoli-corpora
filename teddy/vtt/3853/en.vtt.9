00:04:26.871 --> 00:04:30.121
I'm going to celebrate, so,
"Yes! We made it, we're at the top!"

00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:33.496
Two seconds later,
one looks at the other and says,

00:04:33.496 --> 00:04:35.413
"OK, let's go down."

00:04:35.454 --> 00:04:36.704
(Laughter)

00:04:36.746 --> 00:04:39.454
Life is never about the goals themselves.

00:04:39.454 --> 00:04:40.829
Life is about the journey.

00:04:41.954 --> 00:04:44.288
Yes, you should enjoy
the goals themselves,

00:04:44.288 --> 00:04:47.121
but people think that you have dreams,

00:04:47.163 --> 00:04:49.746
and whenever you get to reaching
one of those dreams,

00:04:49.788 --> 00:04:52.954
it's a magical place
where happiness will be all around.

00:04:53.829 --> 00:04:57.246
But achieving a dream
is a momentary sensation,

00:04:57.288 --> 00:04:58.621
and your life is not.

00:04:59.204 --> 00:05:02.496
The only way to really achieve
all of your dreams
