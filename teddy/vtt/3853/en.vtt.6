00:02:59.121 --> 00:03:01.038
And I can already see a higher peak.

00:03:01.038 --> 00:03:02.746
There's no time to settle down.

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:06.454
Fourth tip, and that's really important:

00:03:06.496 --> 00:03:08.996
Believe the fault is someone else's.

00:03:09.954 --> 00:03:12.121
I constantly see people saying,

00:03:12.163 --> 00:03:16.121
"Yes, I had this great idea,
but no investor had the vision to invest."

00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:17.913
"Oh, I created this great product,

00:03:17.913 --> 00:03:21.788
but the market is so bad,
the sales didn't go well."

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.663
Or, "I can't find good talent;
my team is so below expectations."

00:03:26.663 --> 00:03:28.204
If you have dreams,

00:03:28.204 --> 00:03:30.746
it's your responsibility
to make them happen.
