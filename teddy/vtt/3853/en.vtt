00:00:00.996 --> 00:00:03.204
I dedicated the past two years
to understanding

00:00:03.246 --> 00:00:05.579
how people achieve their dreams.

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:07.579
When we think about the dreams we have,

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:10.121
and the dent we want to leave
in the universe,

00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:13.663
it is striking to see how big
of an overlap there is

00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:17.288
between the dreams that we have,
and projects that never happen.

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:18.496
(Laughter)

00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:20.288
So I'm here to talk to you today

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:24.079
about five ways
how not to follow your dreams.

00:00:25.204 --> 00:00:29.538
One: Believe in overnight success.

00:00:29.538 --> 00:00:31.246
You know the story, right?
