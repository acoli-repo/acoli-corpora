And one last tip, and this one
is really important as well:

00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:10.871
Believe that the only things that matter
are the dreams themselves.

00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:14.079
Once I saw an ad,
and it was a lot of friends,

00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:17.079
they were going up a mountain,
it was a very high mountain,

00:04:17.121 --> 00:04:18.371
and it was a lot of work.

00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:21.371
You could see that they were sweating
and this was tough.

00:04:21.413 --> 00:04:24.746
And they were going up,
and they finally made it to the peak.

00:04:24.788 --> 00:04:26.829
Of course, they decided
to celebrate, right?

00:04:26.871 --> 00:04:30.121
I'm going to celebrate, so,
"Yes! We made it, we're at the top!"
