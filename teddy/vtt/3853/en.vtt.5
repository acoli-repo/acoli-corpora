00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.788
When I wrote a sequel,
some impact was guaranteed.

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.663
Even if I did little, sales would be OK.

00:02:36.204 --> 00:02:38.121
But OK is never OK.

00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:40.413
When you're growing towards a peak,

00:02:40.454 --> 00:02:43.829
you need to work harder than ever
and find yourself another peak.

00:02:44.538 --> 00:02:46.246
Maybe if I did little,

00:02:46.246 --> 00:02:48.454
a couple hundred thousand
people would read it,

00:02:48.496 --> 00:02:50.038
and that's great already.

00:02:50.413 --> 00:02:52.246
But if I work harder than ever,

00:02:52.246 --> 00:02:54.746
I can bring this number up to millions.

00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:59.079
That's why I decided, with my new book,
to go to every single state of Brazil.

00:02:59.121 --> 00:03:01.038
And I can already see a higher peak.
