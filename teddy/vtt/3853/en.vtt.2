00:00:58.787 --> 00:01:01.037
I come from a humble family,

00:01:01.037 --> 00:01:04.538
and two weeks before
the deadline to apply for MIT,

00:01:04.538 --> 00:01:06.788
I started the application process.

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:08.829
And, voilà! I got in.

00:01:09.746 --> 00:01:12.538
People may think
it's an overnight success,

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:16.871
but that only worked
because for the 17 years prior to that,

00:01:16.913 --> 00:01:19.121
I took life and education seriously.

00:01:19.163 --> 00:01:22.579
Your overnight success story
is always a result

00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:25.996
of everything you've done
in your life through that moment.

has the answers for you.
