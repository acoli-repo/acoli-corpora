00:03:28.204 --> 00:03:30.746
it's your responsibility
to make them happen.

00:03:31.663 --> 00:03:34.204
Yes, it may be hard to find talent.

00:03:34.204 --> 00:03:36.288
Yes, the market may be bad.

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.454
But if no one invested in your idea,

00:03:38.454 --> 00:03:40.329
if no one bought your product,

00:03:40.371 --> 00:03:43.371
for sure, there is something there
that is your fault.

00:03:43.371 --> 00:03:45.371
(Laughter)

00:03:45.413 --> 00:03:46.579
Definitely.

00:03:47.038 --> 00:03:49.913
You need to get your dreams
and make them happen.

00:03:49.954 --> 00:03:52.496
And no one achieved their goals alone.

00:03:53.163 --> 00:03:57.288
But if you didn't make them happen,
it's your fault and no one else's.

00:03:57.288 --> 00:03:59.579
Be responsible for your dreams.
