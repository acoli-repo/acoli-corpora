Standing at almost 84 meters tall,

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:13.675
this is the largest known living tree
on the planet.

00:00:13.675 --> 00:00:15.285
Nicknamed General Sherman,

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:22.268
this giant sequoia has sequestered
roughly 1,400 tons of atmospheric carbon

00:00:22.268 --> 00:00:26.888
over its estimated 2,500 years on earth.

00:00:26.888 --> 00:00:30.718
Very few trees can compete 
with this carbon impact,
