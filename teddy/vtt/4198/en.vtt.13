(Applause)

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.320
SRK: Ambarish here, has proudly failed his 8th

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.520
and then his 12th failed.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.816
And the good thing is

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.256
it’s not necessary that we keep
studying, face the pressure,

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:55.456
get troubled, live in stress
because life is so huge,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.656
all you need is curiosity,
like Ambarish just explained.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.720
So can you please give
a message to everyone?
