Shah Rukh Khan: At the age of 17,
a young man from Delhi,

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.736
unable to cope with the pressure
at school, runs away from home

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.856
and 20 years later, the same boy

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.670
in UK develops a technology

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.520
that could change the way
we experience the world.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.056
Sharing the stories of such
amazing Indian innovators

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.456
across the country is the main aim
at TED Talks India Nayi Soch.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.656

Ambarish Mitra,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.680

in the most mundane things.
