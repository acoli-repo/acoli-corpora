Imagine, if you could get information
on whatever you see,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.160
immediately, right then.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.416
Computer vision and artificial
intelligence makes this possible.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.976
I will now show you a demo

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.856
that tells you how,
via artificial intelligence,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.096
you can understand the world
better through images and visuals.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.016
I am switching on the Blippar app,

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.400

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.816
you can train the camera, give it a mind,
