00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.720
and during the rest of the day
I sold magazines on the road.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.056
I made very interesting friends,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.056
sharp minds full of curiosity.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.652
If they got a chance, they could
change the world, too.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.256
This experience changed both the direction
and thought of my life.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.976
I got stronger and I began an internet
company for women’s empowerment.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.920
I sold it a couple of years
later and moved to London.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.936
For ten years I was in jobs,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.056
founded some unsuccessful start-ups

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.480
and was broke and penniless once again.
