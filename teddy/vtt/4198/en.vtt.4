There while paying
the bill, I jokingly said,

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.296
“What if from this 20 pound
note, Queen Elizabeth II,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.844
the Queen of England stepped out?
What would happen?”

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.960
It was a strange imaginary thought,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.616

that changed my life.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.056
This time my curiosity showed me the way.
