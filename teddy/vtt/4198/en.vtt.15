00:07:29.548 --> 00:07:31.510
A living example of that is right
here in Ambarish.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.510
(Applause)

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.590
AM: I thought you would ask me, 
"If the app recognized so many things,

00:07:38.788 --> 00:07:41.518
can it recognize me?"

00:07:41.592 --> 00:07:46.262
(Cheers and applause)

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.416
SRK: I will tell you a small thing.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.896
There is a competition on the internet
about the most searched person,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.616
and then the person wins.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.260
I have never been featured in that,
so I always say:

00:07:59.284 --> 00:08:00.880
when the world knows me,
what’s the point of searching?
