I would have liked to get
the Taj Mahal here for you,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.315
but I could only afford a photograph.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.976
Like if we open the Taj
Mahal and the dome appears,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.896
the knowledge graph opens.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.216
Everyone knows that it was built
by Shah Jahan in Mumtaz Mahal’s memory,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.816
but what is the Indian rupee doing
here in the knowledge graph?

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.216
As soon as we click on it,
we get to know that

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.176
if the Taj mahal was built today
the cost would be Rs. 5200 crores.
