00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.056
This time my curiosity showed me the way.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.216
I started Blippar with the aim
of getting to know better

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.816
whatever we see with the naked
eye or through the camera.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.280
To understand it better.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.296
Today, whenever you have a question,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.936
you use words and use
the internet to find out.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.056
Actually, in our daily lives, there
are things we see for the first time,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.936
one has no words to describe them,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.736
what can one type to find out?
