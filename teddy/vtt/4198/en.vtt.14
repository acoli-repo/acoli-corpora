00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.720
So can you please give
a message to everyone?

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.680
(Applause)

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.410
AM: The biggest secret is

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.440
believing in the impossible
and keeping the strength going.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.840
Do not let anyone discourage you.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.160
SRK: Kids watching at home,
please don’t tell your parents

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.160
that Ambarish said failing is OK.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.208
You need to pass, you need to study,
just don’t get pressurized.

00:07:23.232 --> 00:07:24.216
Life is very big

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.976
so if you don’t fare well
in one or two exams,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.524
it does not mean that you
will not fare well in life.

00:07:29.548 --> 00:07:31.510
A living example of that is right
here in Ambarish.
