00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.985
Ultimately, I'm a quintessential
success story.

00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:05.199
I attended boarding school
and college in New England,

00:04:05.223 --> 00:04:07.303
studied abroad in Chile

00:04:07.327 --> 00:04:10.442
and returned to the Bronx
to be a middle school teacher.

00:04:11.027 --> 00:04:13.424
I received a Truman Scholarship,

00:04:13.448 --> 00:04:16.666
a Fulbright and a Soros Fellowship.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.220
And I could list more.

00:04:18.598 --> 00:04:19.759
(Laughter)

00:04:20.116 --> 00:04:21.312
But I won't.

00:04:21.336 --> 00:04:22.734
(Laughter)

00:04:23.908 --> 00:04:27.041
I earned my doctorate
at Columbia University.

00:04:27.792 --> 00:04:28.883
(Cheers)

00:04:28.907 --> 00:04:30.713
(Applause)
