00:00:01.112 --> 00:00:05.063
So, my journey began
in the Bronx, New York,

00:00:06.098 --> 00:00:07.866
in a one-bedroom apartment,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.561
with my two sisters and immigrant mother.

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:14.519
I loved our neighborhood.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:16.890
It was lively.

00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:19.359
There was all this merengue blasting,

00:00:19.383 --> 00:00:21.772
neighbors socializing on building stoops

00:00:21.796 --> 00:00:25.219
and animated conversations
over domino playing.

00:00:26.327 --> 00:00:27.789
It was home,

00:00:28.852 --> 00:00:30.344
and it was sweet.
