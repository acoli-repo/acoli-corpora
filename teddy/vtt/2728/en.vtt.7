00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:30.824
And then there was the time

00:03:30.848 --> 00:03:34.287
when another classmate
walked into my dorm room,

00:03:34.311 --> 00:03:38.341
and yelled, "Ew!" as I was applying
hair grease to my scalp.

00:03:41.072 --> 00:03:46.007
There is emotional damage done
when young people can't be themselves,

00:03:46.504 --> 00:03:51.238
when they are forced to edit who they are
in order to be acceptable.

00:03:52.627 --> 00:03:54.637
It's a kind of violence.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.985
Ultimately, I'm a quintessential
success story.
