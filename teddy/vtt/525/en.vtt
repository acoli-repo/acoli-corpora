00:00:00.917 --> 00:00:06.393
I want to talk today
about how reading can change our lives

00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:08.792
and about the limits of that change.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.018
I want to talk to you about how reading
can give us a shareable world

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:16.750
of powerful human connection.

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:21.393
But also about how that connection
is always partial.

00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:26.500
How reading is ultimately
a lonely, idiosyncratic undertaking.
