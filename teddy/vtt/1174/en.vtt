00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.559
I can't help but this wish:

00:00:01.583 --> 00:00:06.016
to think about when you're a little kid,
and all your friends ask you,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.628
"If a genie could give you
one wish in the world,

00:00:08.652 --> 00:00:09.806
what would it be?"

00:00:10.183 --> 00:00:11.572
And I always answered,

00:00:11.596 --> 00:00:12.906
"Well, I'd want the wish

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.418
to have the wisdom to know
exactly what to wish for."

00:00:16.772 --> 00:00:18.123
Well, then you'd be screwed,

00:00:18.147 --> 00:00:21.162
because you'd know what to wish for,
and you'd use up your wish,

00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:25.009
and now, since we only have one wish --
unlike last year they had three wishes --

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:26.519
I'm not going to wish for that.

00:00:26.543 --> 00:00:31.546
So let's get to what I would like,
which is world peace.
