00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.456
but you are probably
a robot operator, too.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.736
When you drive your car,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.976
it feels like you are operating machinery.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.816
You are also going
from point A to point B,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.056
but your car probably has power steering,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.776
it probably has automatic braking systems,

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.536
it might have an automatic transmission
and maybe even adaptive cruise control.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.496
And while it might not be
a fully autonomous car,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.816
it has bits of autonomy,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.176
and they're so useful

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.016
and they make us drive safer,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.696
and we just sort of feel
like they're invisible-in-use, right?

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.296
So when you're driving your car,

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.416
you should just feel like
you're going from one place to another.
