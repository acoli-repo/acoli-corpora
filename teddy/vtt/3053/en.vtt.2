My host explained to me,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.016
"Well, the robot is trying
to get from point A to point B,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.816
and you were an obstacle in his way,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.856
so he had to replan his path,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.136
figure out where to go,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.856
and then get there some other way,"

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.336
which was actually
not a very efficient thing to do.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.616
If that robot had figured out
that I was a person, not a chair,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.736
and that I was willing
to get out of its way

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.416
if it was trying to get somewhere,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.656
then it actually
would have been more efficient

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.936
at getting its job done

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.176
if it had bothered
to notice that I was a human

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.776
and that I have different affordances
than things like chairs and walls do.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.016
You know, we tend to think of these robots
as being from outer space
