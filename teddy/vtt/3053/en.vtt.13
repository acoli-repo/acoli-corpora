00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.656
You get to walk in my shoes for today.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.216
You get to see what it's like
to be on the shorter end of the spectrum."

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.616
And he actually ended up building
a lot of empathy for that experience,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.896
which was kind of great.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.576
So when he'd come visit in person,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.016
he no longer stood over me
as he was talking to me,

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.136
he would sit down
and talk to me eye to eye,

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.896
which was kind of a beautiful thing.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.576
So we actually decided
to look at this in the laboratory

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.256
and see what others kinds of differences
things like robot height would make.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.136
And so half of the people in our study
used a shorter robot,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.576
half of the people in our study
used a taller robot

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.856
and we actually found
that the exact same person
