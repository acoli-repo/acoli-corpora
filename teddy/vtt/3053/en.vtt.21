00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.136
And they would
chase them down the hallway.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.176
(Laughter)

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.136
I told them, "Um, those are real people.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.456
They're actually going to bleed
and feel pain if you hit them."

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.096
And they'd be like, "OK, got it."

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.176
But five minutes later,
they would be like,

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:43.816
"20 points for that guy over there,
he just looks like he needs to get hit."

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.976
It's a little bit
like "Ender's Game," right?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.936
There is a real world on that other side

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.376
and I think it's our responsibility
as people designing these interfaces

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.656
to help people remember

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.936
that there's real consequences
to their actions

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.256
and to feel a sense of responsibility

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.560
when they're operating
these increasingly autonomous things.
