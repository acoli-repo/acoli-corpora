You know, we tend to think of these robots
as being from outer space

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.176
and from the future
and from science fiction,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.616
and while that could be true,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.296
I'd actually like to argue
that robots are here today,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.096
and they live and work
amongst us right now.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.976
These are two robots that live in my home.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.496
They vacuum the floors
and they cut the grass

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.736
every single day,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.136
which is more than I would do
if I actually had time to do these tasks,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.496
and they probably
do it better than I would, too.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.016
This one actually takes care of my kitty.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.616
Every single time
he uses the box, it cleans it,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.616
which is not something I'm willing to do,
