00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.416
you should just feel like
you're going from one place to another.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.176
It doesn't feel like it's this big thing
that you have to deal with and operate

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.456
and use these controls

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.656
because we spent so long
learning how to drive

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.376
that they've become
extensions of ourselves.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.096
When you park that car
in that tight little garage space,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.696
you know where your corners are.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.976
And when you drive a rental car
that maybe you haven't driven before,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.056
it takes some time
to get used to your new robot body.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.056
And this is also true for people
who operate other types of robots,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.680
so I'd like to share with you
a few stories about that.
