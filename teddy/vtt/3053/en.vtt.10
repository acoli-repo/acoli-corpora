00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.776
And I'm not going to turn him off, right?
That's kind of rude.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.496
Not only was it good
for these one-on-one communications,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.456
but also for just showing up
at the company all-hands meeting.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.176
Getting your butt in that chair

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.416
and showing people that you're present
and committed to your project

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.696
is a big deal

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.896
and can help remote collaboration a ton.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.776
We saw this over the period
of months and then years,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.960
not only at our company
but at others, too.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.056
The best thing that can happen
with these systems

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.416
is that it starts to feel
like you're just there.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.136
It's just you, it's just your body,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.256
and so people actually start
to give these things personal space.
