around using these systems.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.096
Similarly, as you start
feeling like it's your body,

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.816
you start noticing things like,
"Oh, my robot is kind of short."

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.496
Dallas would say things to me --
he was six-foot tall --

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.976
and we would take him via robot
to cocktail parties and things like that,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.216
as you do,

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.576
and the robot was about five-foot-tall,
which is close to my height.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.816
And he would tell me,

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.376
"You know, people are not
really looking at me.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.096
I feel like I'm just looking
at this sea of shoulders,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.096
and it's just -- we need a taller robot."

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.376
And I told him,

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.696
"Um, no.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.656
You get to walk in my shoes for today.
