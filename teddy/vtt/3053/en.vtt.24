00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.496
We're trying to build
this human-robot world

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.936
in which we can coexist
and collaborate with one another,

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.336
and we don't need to be fully autonomous
and just do things on our own.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.856
We actually do things together.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.136
And to make that happen,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.416
we actually need help from people
like the artists and the designers,

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.296
the policy makers, the legal scholars,

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.536
psychologists, sociologists,
anthropologists --

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.376
we need more perspectives in the room

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.376
if we're going to do the thing
that Stu Card says we should do,

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.336
which is invent the future
that we actually want to live in.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.016
And I think we can continue to experiment
