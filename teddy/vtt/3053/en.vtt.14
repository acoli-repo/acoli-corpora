00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.856
and we actually found
that the exact same person

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.216
who has the exact same body
and says the exact same things as someone,

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.856
is more persuasive
and perceived as being more credible

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.536
if they're in a taller robot form.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.376
It makes no rational sense,

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.096
but that's why we study psychology.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.976
And really, you know,
the way that Cliff Nass would put this

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.016
is that we're having to deal
with these new technologies

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.776
despite the fact
that we have very old brains.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.776
Human psychology is not changing
at the same speed that tech is

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.616
and so we're always playing catch-up,

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.296
trying to make sense of this world

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.656
where these autonomous things
are running around.
