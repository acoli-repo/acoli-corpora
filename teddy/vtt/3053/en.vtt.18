00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.816
it took them a lot longer
to get through our obstacle course,

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.400
and we wanted to know why.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.136
It turns out that there's
this important human dimension --

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.456
a personality dimension
called locus of control,

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.616
and people who have
a strong internal locus of control,

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.696
they need to be the masters
of their own destiny --

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.816
really don't like giving up control
to an autonomous system --

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.976
so much so that they will
fight the autonomy;

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.096
"If I want to hit that chair,
I'm going to hit that chair."

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.736
And so they would actually suffer
from having that autonomous assistance,

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.336
which is an important thing for us to know
