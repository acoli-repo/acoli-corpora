Dealing with the problem
of remote collaboration.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.176
So, at Willow Garage
I had a coworker named Dallas,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.776
and Dallas looked like this.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.856
He worked from his home in Indiana
in our company in California.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.816
He was a voice in a box
on the table in most of our meetings,

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.055
which was kind of OK
except that, you know,

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.456
if we had a really heated debate
and we didn't like what he was saying,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.896
we might just hang up on him.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.935
(Laughter)

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.176
Then we might have a meeting
after that meeting

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.896
and actually make the decisions
in the hallway afterwards

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.336
when he wasn't there anymore.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.936
So that wasn't so great for him.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.696
And as a robotics company at Willow,
