00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.616
which is not something I'm willing to do,

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.216
and it actually makes
his life better as well as mine.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.656
And while we call these robot products --

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.376
it's a "robot vacuum cleaner,
it's a robot lawnmower,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.895
it's a robot littler box,"

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:15.056
I think there's actually a bunch
of other robots hiding in plain sight

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.936
that have just become so darn useful

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.416
and so darn mundane

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.936
that we call them things
like, "dishwasher," right?

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.176
They get new names.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.896
They don't get called robot anymore

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.336
because they actually
serve a purpose in our lives.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.856
Similarly, a thermostat, right?

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.656
I know my robotics friends out there

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.016
are probably cringing
at me calling this a robot,
