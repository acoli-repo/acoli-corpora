00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.016
are probably cringing
at me calling this a robot,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.296
but it has a goal.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.216
Its goal is to make my house
66 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.496
and it senses the world.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.096
It knows it's a little bit cold,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.736
it makes a plan and then
it acts on the physical world.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.016
It's robotics.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.616
Even if it might not
look like Rosie the Robot,

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.576
it's doing something
that's really useful in my life

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.976
so I don't have to take care

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.576
of turning the temperature
up and down myself.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.416
And I think these systems
live and work amongst us now,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.776
and not only are these systems
living amongst us

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.456
but you are probably
a robot operator, too.
