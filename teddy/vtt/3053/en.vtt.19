00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.336
which is an important thing for us to know

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.656
as we're building increasingly
autonomous, say, cars, right?

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.040
How are different people going
to grapple with that loss of control?

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.576
It's going to be different
depending on human dimensions.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.096
We can't treat humans
as if we're just one monolithic thing.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.536
We vary by personality, by culture,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.016
we even vary by emotional state
moment to moment,

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.016
and being able to design these systems,

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.336
these human-robot interaction systems,

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.096
we need to take into account
the human dimensions,

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.840
not just the technological ones.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.936
Along with a sense of control
also comes a sense of responsibility.
