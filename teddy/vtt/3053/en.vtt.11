00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.256
and so people actually start
to give these things personal space.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.256
So when you're having a stand-up meeting,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.936
people will stand around the space

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.176
just as they would
if you were there in person.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.776
That's great until
there's breakdowns and it's not.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.776
People, when they first see these robots,

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.376
are like, "Wow, where's the components?
There must be a camera over there,"

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.976
and they start poking your face.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.936
"You're talking too softly,
I'm going to turn up your volume,"

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.576
which is like having a coworker
walk up to you and say,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.496
"You're speaking too softly,
I'm going to turn up your face."

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.776
That's awkward and not OK,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.416
and so we end up having to build
these new social norms

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.656
around using these systems.
