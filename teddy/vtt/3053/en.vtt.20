Along with a sense of control
also comes a sense of responsibility.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.816
And if you were a robot operator
using one of these systems,

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.896
this is what the interface
would look like.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.856
It looks a little bit like a video game,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.856
which can be good because
that's very familiar to people,

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.096
but it can also be bad

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.576
because it makes people feel
like it's a video game.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.456
We had a bunch of kids
over at Stanford play with the system

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.936
and drive the robot
around our office in Menlo Park,

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.896
and the kids started saying things like,

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.096
"10 points if you hit that guy over there.
20 points for that one."

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.136
And they would
chase them down the hallway.
