You only get one chance
to make a first impression,

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.616
and that's true if you're a robot
as well as if you're a person.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.656
The first time that I met
one of these robots

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.576
was at a place
called Willow Garage in 2008.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.616
When I went to visit there,
my host walked me into the building

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.216
and we met this little guy.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.896
He was rolling into the hallway,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.736
came up to me, sat there,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.016
stared blankly past me,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.696
did nothing for a while,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.656
rapidly spun his head around 180 degrees

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.216
and then ran away.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.416
And that was not a great first impression.
