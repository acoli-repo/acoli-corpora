00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.696
And as a robotics company at Willow,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.056
we had some extra
robot body parts laying around,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.576
so Dallas and his buddy Curt
put together this thing,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.536
which looks kind of
like Skype on a stick on wheels,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.296
which seems like a techy, silly toy,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.096
but really it's probably
one of the most powerful tools

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.600
that I've seen ever made
for remote collaboration.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.656
So now, if I didn't answer
Dallas' email question,

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.896
he could literally roll into my office,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.496
block my doorway
and ask me the question again --

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.536
(Laughter)

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.776
until I answered it.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.776
And I'm not going to turn him off, right?
That's kind of rude.
