00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.656
where these autonomous things
are running around.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.416
Usually, things that talk are people,
not machines, right?

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.016
And so we breathe a lot of meaning
into things like just height of a machine,

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.296
not a person,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.680
and attribute that
to the person using the system.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.336
You know, this, I think,
is really important

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.096
when you're thinking about robotics.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.216
It's not so much about reinventing humans,

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.376
it's more about figuring out
how we extend ourselves, right?

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.376
And we end up using things
in ways that are sort of surprising.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:59.656
So these guys can't play pool
because the robots don't have arms,

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.016
but they can heckle the guys
who are playing pool
