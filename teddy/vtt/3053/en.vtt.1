00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.416
And that was not a great first impression.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.616
The thing that I learned
about robots that day

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.816
is that they kind of do their own thing,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.976
and they're not totally aware of us.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.239
And I think as we're experimenting
with these possible robot futures,

00:00:40.263 --> 00:00:42.936
we actually end up learning
a lot more about ourselves

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.616
as opposed to just these machines.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.976
And what I learned that day

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.416
was that I had pretty high
expectations for this little dude.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.616
He was not only supposed to be able
to navigate the physical world,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.296
but also be able
to navigate my social world --

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.496
he's in my space; it's a personal robot.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.536
wWhy didn't it understand me?

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.816
