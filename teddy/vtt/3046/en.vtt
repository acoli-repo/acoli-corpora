Chris Anderson: OK, Stewart,

00:00:02.421 --> 00:00:06.792
in the '60s, you -- I think it was '68 --
you founded this magazine.

00:00:07.887 --> 00:00:09.959
Stewart Brand: Bravo!
It's the original one.

00:00:09.983 --> 00:00:11.152
That's hard to find.

00:00:11.176 --> 00:00:12.540
CA: Right. Issue One, right?

00:00:12.564 --> 00:00:13.716
SB: Mm hmm.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.241
CA: Why did that make so much impact?

00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:20.750
SB: Counterculture was the main event
that I was part of at the time,

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.949
and it was made up
of hippies and New Left.

00:00:25.797 --> 00:00:27.701
That was sort of my contemporaries,

00:00:27.725 --> 00:00:29.977
the people I was just slightly older than.
