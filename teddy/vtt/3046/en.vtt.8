and just sort of trick the situation.

00:04:04.468 --> 00:04:06.482
So all of these photographs
that you see --

00:04:06.506 --> 00:04:08.588

they were carrying these
Whole Earth banners and so on --

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.164

but in some ways, the safest way,

00:04:27.051 --> 00:04:30.526
