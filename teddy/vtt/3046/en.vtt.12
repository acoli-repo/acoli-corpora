Bringing back this amount
of bio-abundance will take longer,

00:06:02.073 --> 00:06:03.230
but it's worth doing.

00:06:03.254 --> 00:06:04.997
CA: We'll come back to the mammoths,

00:06:05.021 --> 00:06:08.765
but explain how we
should think of extinctions.

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.058
Obviously, one of the huge
concerns right now

00:06:12.082 --> 00:06:16.928
is that extinction is happening
at a faster rate than ever in history.

00:06:16.952 --> 00:06:19.357
That's the meme that's out there.

00:06:19.381 --> 00:06:20.745
How should we think of it?

00:06:21.145 --> 00:06:22.681
SB: The story that's out there

00:06:22.705 --> 00:06:25.367
is that we're in the middle
of the Sixth Extinction

00:06:25.391 --> 00:06:27.891
or maybe in the beginning
of the Sixth Extinction.

00:06:27.915 --> 00:06:30.142
Because we're in
the de-extinction business,
