00:00:30.381 --> 00:00:35.582
And my mode is to look
at where the interesting flow is

00:00:35.606 --> 00:00:37.571
and then look in the other direction.

00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:38.985
CA: (Laughs)

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:41.653
SB: Partly, I was trained to do that
as an army officer,

00:00:41.677 --> 00:00:44.710
but partly, it's just a cheap heuristic
to find originalities:

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:47.203
don't look where everybody
else is looking,

00:00:47.227 --> 00:00:48.492
look the opposite way.

00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:52.357
So the deal with counterculture is,
the hippies were very romantic

00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:54.228
and kind of against technology,

00:00:54.252 --> 00:00:56.422
except very good LSD from Sandoz,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.942
and the New Left was against technology
