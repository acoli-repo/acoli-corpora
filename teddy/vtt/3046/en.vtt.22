Likewise, farmland has now peaked,

00:11:05.655 --> 00:11:09.175
and one of the ways
that plays out in Europe

00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:12.251

00:11:12.275 --> 00:11:14.028
which immediately reforests.

00:11:14.052 --> 00:11:16.463
They don't do wildlife

00:11:16.923 --> 00:11:20.021
They don't need to, because
so many of these farms are connected

00:11:20.045 --> 00:11:23.032
that they've made
reforested wildlife corridors,

00:11:23.056 --> 00:11:26.151
that the wolves are coming back,
in this case, to Spain.

00:11:26.175 --> 00:11:28.717
They've gotten all the way
to the Netherlands.

00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:32.297
There's bears coming back.
There's lynx coming back.
