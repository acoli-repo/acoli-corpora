SB: It was kind of a chance
that in the spring of '66,

00:02:30.347 --> 00:02:33.244
thanks to an LSD experience
on a rooftop in San Francisco,

00:02:33.268 --> 00:02:36.346
I got thinking about, again,
something that Fuller talked about,

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.749
that a lot of people assume
that the Earth is flat

00:02:38.773 --> 00:02:41.012
and kind of infinite
in terms of its resources,

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:43.276
but once you really grasp
that it's a sphere

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.536
and that there's only so much of it,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.003
then you start husbanding your resources

00:02:48.027 --> 00:02:50.017
and thinking about it as a finite system.

00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:52.211
"Spaceship Earth" was his metaphor.

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:55.175
And I wanted that to be the case,

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:59.848
but on LSD I was getting higher and higher
on my hundred micrograms

00:02:59.872 --> 00:03:01.913
on the roof of San Francisco,
