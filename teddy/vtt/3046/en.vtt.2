00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.942
and the New Left was against technology

00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:03.191
because they thought
it was a power device.

00:01:03.654 --> 00:01:06.992
Computers were: do not spindle,
fold, or mutilate.

00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:08.248
Fight that.

00:01:08.684 --> 00:01:13.910
And so, the Whole Earth Catalog
was kind of a counter-counterculture thing

00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:17.092
in the sense that I bought
Buckminster Fuller's idea

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:20.462
that tools of are of the essence.

00:01:21.053 --> 00:01:26.326
Science and engineers basically
define the world in interesting ways.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.188
If all the politicians
disappeared one week,

00:01:29.212 --> 00:01:30.963
it would be ... a nuisance.
