00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.415
CA: There people talking about
bringing back species, rewilding ...

00:10:32.439 --> 00:10:35.965
Well, first of all, rewilding species:
What's the story with these guys?

00:10:35.989 --> 00:10:37.702
SB: Ha-ha! Wolves.

00:10:38.433 --> 00:10:41.618
Europe, connecting to the previous point,

00:10:41.642 --> 00:10:44.001
we're now at probably peak farmland,

00:10:44.025 --> 00:10:45.965
and, by the way, in terms of population,

00:10:45.989 --> 00:10:48.565
we are already
at peak children being alive.

00:10:48.589 --> 00:10:51.074
Henceforth, there will be
fewer and fewer children.

00:10:51.098 --> 00:10:54.709
We are in the last doubling
of human population,

00:10:54.733 --> 00:10:58.837
and it will get to nine,
maybe nine and a half billion,

00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:02.256
and then start not just leveling off,
but probably going down.
