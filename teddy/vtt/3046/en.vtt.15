There's a lot of biology
going on out there.

00:07:30.584 --> 00:07:32.396
Since 1500,

00:07:33.587 --> 00:07:36.178
about 500 species have gone extinct,

00:07:37.077 --> 00:07:41.055
and you'll see the term "mass extinction"
kind of used in strange ways.

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:43.810
So there was, about a year and a half ago,

00:07:43.834 --> 00:07:46.883
a front-page story by Carl Zimmer
in the New York Times,

00:07:46.907 --> 00:07:49.993
"Mass Extinction in the Oceans,
Broad Studies Show."

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.283
And then you read into the article,
and it mentions that since 1500,

00:07:54.307 --> 00:07:59.266
15 species -- one, five --
have gone extinct in the oceans,

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.026
and, oh, by the way,
none in the last 50 years.
