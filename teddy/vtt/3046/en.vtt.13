00:06:27.915 --> 00:06:30.142
Because we're in
the de-extinction business,

00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:33.231
the preventing-extinction business
with Revive &amp; Restore,

00:06:33.255 --> 00:06:36.322
we started looking at what's actually
going on with extinction.

00:06:36.346 --> 00:06:40.678
And it turns out, there's a very confused
set of data out there

00:06:40.702 --> 00:06:43.095
which gets oversimplified

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:46.171
into the narrative of we're becoming ...

00:06:46.195 --> 00:06:51.849
Here are five mass extinctions that are
indicated by the yellow triangles,

00:06:51.873 --> 00:06:54.836
and we're now next.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.713
The last one there on the far right

00:06:56.737 --> 00:06:59.888
was the meteor that struck
66 million years ago

00:06:59.912 --> 00:07:01.361
and did in the dinosaurs.
