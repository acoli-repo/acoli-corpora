00:12:58.985 --> 00:13:02.276
where they're taking up
their proper place thanks to CRISPR.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.135
I mean, they're not shooting the genes in
like you did with genetic engineering.

00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:09.448
Now with CRISPR you're editing,
basically, one allele,

00:13:09.472 --> 00:13:12.792
and replacing it in the place
of another allele.

00:13:13.352 --> 00:13:19.655
So you're now getting basically
Asian elephant germline cells

00:13:19.679 --> 00:13:23.529
that are effectively in terms
of the traits that you're going for

00:13:23.553 --> 00:13:26.057
to be comfortable in the Arctic,

00:13:26.899 --> 00:13:28.346
you're getting them in there.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.970
So we go through the process

00:13:29.994 --> 00:13:32.678
of getting that through
a surrogate mother,
