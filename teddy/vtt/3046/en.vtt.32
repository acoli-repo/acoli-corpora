00:15:59.223 --> 00:16:01.011
they're bringing in some more now,

00:16:01.035 --> 00:16:04.211
and put them in at the density
that they used to be.

00:16:04.235 --> 00:16:07.227
And grasslands are made by grazers.

00:16:07.251 --> 00:16:10.842
So these animals are there, grazing away,

00:16:10.866 --> 00:16:12.722
and they're doing a couple of things.

00:16:12.746 --> 00:16:16.418
First of all, they're turning the tundra,
the moss, back into grassland.

00:16:16.442 --> 00:16:18.263
Grassland fixes carbon.

00:16:18.287 --> 00:16:23.097
Tundra, in a warming world, is thawing
and releasing a lot of carbon dioxide

00:16:23.121 --> 00:16:24.820
and also methane.

00:16:24.844 --> 00:16:27.741
So already in their little
25 square miles,

00:16:27.765 --> 00:16:30.055
they're doing a climate
stabilization thing.
