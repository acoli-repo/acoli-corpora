00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:32.297
There's bears coming back.
There's lynx coming back.

00:11:32.321 --> 00:11:35.502
There's the European jackal.
I had no idea such a thing existed.

00:11:35.526 --> 00:11:38.093
They're coming back from Italy
to the rest of Europe.

00:11:38.117 --> 00:11:41.608
And unlike here, these are all predators,
which is kind of interesting.

00:11:41.632 --> 00:11:45.047
They are being welcomed by Europeans.
They've been missed.

00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:48.068
CA: And counterintuitively,
when you bring back the predators,

00:11:48.092 --> 00:11:50.204
it actually increases rather than reduces

00:11:50.228 --> 00:11:52.491
the diversity of the underlying
ecosystem often.

00:11:52.515 --> 00:11:56.271
SB: Yeah, generally predators
and large animals --

00:11:56.295 --> 00:11:59.537
large animals and large animals
with sharp teeth and claws --

00:11:59.561 --> 00:12:04.667
are turning out to be highly important
for a really rich ecosystem.
