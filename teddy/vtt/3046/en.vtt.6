00:02:59.872 --> 00:03:01.913
on the roof of San Francisco,

00:03:02.961 --> 00:03:07.449
and noticed that the downtown buildings
which were right in front of me

00:03:07.473 --> 00:03:10.709
were not all parallel,
they were sort of fanned out like this.

00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:14.215
And that's because
they are on a curved surface.

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.205
And if I were even higher,
I would see that even more clearly,

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.011
higher than that, more clearly still,

00:03:19.035 --> 00:03:20.685
higher enough, and it would close,

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.043
and you would get
the circle of Earth from space.

00:03:23.067 --> 00:03:25.984
And I thought, you know, we've been
in space for 10 years --

00:03:26.008 --> 00:03:28.022
at that time, this is '66 --

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:29.986
and the cameras had never looked back.
