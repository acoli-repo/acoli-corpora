00:11:59.561 --> 00:12:04.667
are turning out to be highly important
for a really rich ecosystem.

00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:08.639
CA: Which maybe brings us to this rather

00:12:08.663 --> 00:12:10.552
that you've got yourself involved in.

00:12:10.576 --> 00:12:13.972
Why would someone want to bring back
these terrifying woolly mammoths?

00:12:13.996 --> 00:12:16.870
SB: Hmm. Asian elephants
are the closest relative

00:12:16.894 --> 00:12:19.187
to the woolly mammoth,

00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:22.100

genetically very close.

00:12:22.124 --> 00:12:26.177
They diverged quite recently
in evolutionary history.

00:12:26.201 --> 00:12:28.584

are closer to woolly mammoths

00:12:28.608 --> 00:12:30.403
than they are to African elephants,
