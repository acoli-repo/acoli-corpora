00:06:59.912 --> 00:07:01.361
and did in the dinosaurs.

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:04.250
And the story is, we're the next meteor.

00:07:05.494 --> 00:07:06.673
Well, here's the deal.

00:07:06.697 --> 00:07:09.612
I wound up researching this
for a paper I wrote,

00:07:09.636 --> 00:07:15.513
that a mass extinction is when
75 percent of all the species

00:07:15.537 --> 00:07:17.059
in the world go extinct.

00:07:19.163 --> 00:07:22.320
Well, there's on the order
of five-and-a-half-million species,

00:07:22.344 --> 00:07:24.852
of which we've identified
one and a half million.

00:07:24.876 --> 00:07:27.812
Another 14,000 are being
identified every year.

00:07:27.836 --> 00:07:30.071
There's a lot of biology
going on out there.
