00:12:28.608 --> 00:12:30.403
than they are to African elephants,

00:12:30.427 --> 00:12:32.634
but they're close enough
to African elephants

00:12:32.658 --> 00:12:34.707
that they have successfully hybridized.

00:12:35.486 --> 00:12:39.144
So we're working
with George Church at Harvard,

00:12:39.168 --> 00:12:43.237
who has already moved the genes
for four major traits

00:12:43.261 --> 00:12:49.333
from the now well-preserved, well-studied
genome of the woolly mammoth,

00:12:49.357 --> 00:12:52.305
thanks to so-called
"ancient DNA analysis."

00:12:53.178 --> 00:12:58.961
And in the lab, he has moved those genes
into living Asian elephant cell lines,

00:12:58.985 --> 00:13:02.276
where they're taking up
their proper place thanks to CRISPR.
