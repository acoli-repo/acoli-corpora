00:13:29.994 --> 00:13:32.678
of getting that through
a surrogate mother,

00:13:32.702 --> 00:13:34.245
an Asian elephant mother.

00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:38.967
You can get a proxy, as it's being called
by conservation biologists,

00:13:38.991 --> 00:13:40.392
of the woolly mammoth,

00:13:40.416 --> 00:13:45.603
that is effectively a hairy,
curly-trunked, Asian elephant

00:13:45.627 --> 00:13:48.572
that is perfectly comfortable
in the sub-Arctic.

00:13:48.596 --> 00:13:50.687
Now, it's the case, so many people say,

00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:52.719
"Well, how are you going
to get them there?

00:13:52.743 --> 00:13:55.110
And Asian elephants,
they don't like snow, right?"

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:57.018
Well, it turns out, they do like snow.

00:13:57.042 --> 00:13:58.582
There's some in an Ontario zoo

00:13:58.606 --> 00:14:00.889
that have made snowballs
bigger than people.
