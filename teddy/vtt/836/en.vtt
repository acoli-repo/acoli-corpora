00:00:00.446 --> 00:00:02.071
I am a neuroscientist

00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:05.882
with a mixed background in physics and medicine.

00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:10.923
My lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology

00:00:10.923 --> 00:00:14.113
focuses on spinal cord injury,

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:16.844
which affects more than 50,000 people

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:19.534
around the world every year,

00:00:19.534 --> 00:00:23.140
with dramatic consequences for affected individuals,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.373
whose life literally shatters

00:00:25.373 --> 00:00:28.608
in a matter of a handful of seconds.

00:00:28.608 --> 00:00:31.666
And for me, the Man of Steel,
