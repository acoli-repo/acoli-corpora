Odin, the king of Asgard, 
was plagued by nightmares.

00:00:16.637 --> 00:00:19.891
Three fearsome figures haunted his dreams:

00:00:20.308 --> 00:00:23.019
a massive, writhing shadow;

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.605
a shambling, rotting corpse;

00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:30.943
and worst of all, 
a monstrous beast with a deadly bite.
