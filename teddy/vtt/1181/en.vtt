There are a lot of web 2.0 consultants
who make a lot of money.

00:00:04.293 --> 00:00:06.467
In fact, they make
their living on this stuff.

00:00:06.491 --> 00:00:08.899
I'm going to try to save you
all the time and money

00:00:08.923 --> 00:00:11.781
and go through it in the next
three minutes, so bear with me.

00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:14.975
Started a website in 2005
with a few friends, called Reddit.com.

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.035
It's what you'd call
a social news website;

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:20.313
basically, the democratic front page
of the best stuff on the web.

00:00:20.337 --> 00:00:24.199
You find some interesting content --
say, a TED Talk -- submit it to Reddit,

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:27.788
and a community of your peers votes up
if they like it, down if they don't.

00:00:27.812 --> 00:00:29.149
That creates the front page.

00:00:29.173 --> 00:00:32.330
It's always rising, falling;
a half million people visit every day.
