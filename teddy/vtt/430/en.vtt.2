00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.018
a hypothesis.

00:01:00.042 --> 00:01:01.934
Well, you know what? Oceans are blue.

00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:04.917
Maybe the sky is reflecting
the colors from the ocean.

00:01:05.917 --> 00:01:07.934
Great, but now you have to test it

00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:10.601
so you predict what that might mean.

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:11.893
Your prediction would be,

00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:14.226
"Well, if the sky is reflecting
the ocean color,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.268
it will be bluer on the coasts

00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:18.726
than it will be
in the middle of the country."

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.309
OK, that's fair enough,

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.184
but you've got to test that prediction

00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:25.976
so you get on a plane,
you leave Denver on a nice gray day,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.601
you fly to LA, you look up
and the sky is gloriously blue.

00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:31.750
Hooray, your thesis is proven.
