00:07:28.792 --> 00:07:30.893
a bunch of other astronomers
commented on it,

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:33.143
and so they went back
and looked at their data

00:07:33.167 --> 00:07:35.934
and realized they had made
a very embarrassing mistake.

00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:39.018
They had not accounted
for some very subtle characteristics

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:41.226
of the Earth's motion around the Sun,

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:45.101
which affected how they measured
this planet going around the pulsar.

00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:48.351
And it turns out that when they did
account for it correctly,

00:07:48.375 --> 00:07:50.351
poof -- their planet disappeared.

00:07:50.375 --> 00:07:51.625
It wasn't real.

00:07:52.458 --> 00:07:55.309
So Andrew Lyne had a very formidable task.

00:07:55.333 --> 00:07:57.518
He had to admit this.

00:07:57.542 --> 00:08:01.601
So in 1992 at the American
Astronomical Society meeting,
