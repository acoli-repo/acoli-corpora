00:09:57.917 --> 00:10:01.143
(Laughter)

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:02.434
Eh.

00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:03.518
(Laughter)

00:10:03.542 --> 00:10:05.893
But now we know they're everywhere.

00:10:05.917 --> 00:10:07.184
Every star --

00:10:07.208 --> 00:10:10.768
for every star you see in the sky
there could be three, five, ten planets.

00:10:10.792 --> 00:10:12.458
The sky is filled with them.

00:10:14.375 --> 00:10:17.351
We think that planets
may outnumber stars in the galaxy.

00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:19.851
This is a profound statement,

00:10:19.875 --> 00:10:21.809
and it was made because of science.

00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:25.518
And it wasn't made just because of science
and the observatories and the data;

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:28.684
it was made because of the scientists
who built the observatories,

00:10:28.708 --> 00:10:29.976
who took the data,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.858
who made the mistakes and admitted them
