00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.726
We started finding them by the bucketload.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.851
We started finding thousands of them.

00:09:32.875 --> 00:09:36.351
We built observatories
specifically designed to look for them.

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:38.184
And now we know of thousands of them.

00:09:38.208 --> 00:09:40.893
We even know of planetary systems.

00:09:40.917 --> 00:09:45.667
That is actual data, animated, showing
four planets orbiting another star.

00:09:46.375 --> 00:09:48.601
This is incredible. Think about that.

00:09:48.625 --> 00:09:50.476
For all of human history,

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.018
you could count all the known planets
in the universe on two hands --

00:09:55.042 --> 00:09:56.559
nine -- eight?

00:09:56.583 --> 00:09:57.893
Nine? Eight -- eight.

00:09:57.917 --> 00:10:01.143
