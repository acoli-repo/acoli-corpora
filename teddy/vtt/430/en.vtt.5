00:02:29.417 --> 00:02:31.434
at least until a better idea

00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:33.625
or some contradictory
evidence comes along.

00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:39.042
Now, part of this process
is admitting when you're wrong.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:42.125
And that can be really, really hard.

00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:44.893
Science has its strengths and weaknesses

00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:47.101
and they depend on this.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:50.351
One of the strengths of science
is that it's done by people,

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:52.601
and it's proven itself
to do a really good job.

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:55.393
We understand the universe
pretty well because of science.

00:02:55.417 --> 00:02:58.934
One of science's weaknesses
is that it's done by people,

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:03.226
and we bring a lot of baggage
along with us when we investigate things.
