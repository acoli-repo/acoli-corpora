00:00:00.626 --> 00:00:03.393
Now, people have a lot
of misconceptions about science --

00:00:03.417 --> 00:00:05.768
about how it works and what it is.

00:00:05.792 --> 00:00:09.226
A big one is that science
is just a big old pile of facts.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.250
But that's not true --
that's not even the goal of science.

00:00:13.208 --> 00:00:15.393
Science is a process.

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:17.601
It's a way of thinking.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:20.518
Gathering facts is just a piece of it,
but it's not the goal.

00:00:20.542 --> 00:00:25.309
The ultimate goal of science
is to understand objective reality

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.768
the best way we know how,

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:29.309
and that's based on evidence.

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.018
The problem here
is that people are flawed.
