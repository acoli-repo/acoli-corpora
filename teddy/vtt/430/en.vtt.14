00:06:57.333 --> 00:07:00.143
And not just any star, but a pulsar,

00:07:00.167 --> 00:07:04.351
and this is the remnant of a star
that has previously exploded.

00:07:04.375 --> 00:07:06.476
It's blasting out radiation.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.059
This is the last place in the universe
you would expect to find a planet,

00:07:11.083 --> 00:07:13.559
but they had very methodically
looked at this pulsar,

00:07:13.583 --> 00:07:18.434
and they detected the gravitational tug
of this planet as it orbited the pulsar.

00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:20.018
It looked really good.

00:07:20.042 --> 00:07:23.643
The first planet orbiting
another star had been found ...

00:07:23.667 --> 00:07:26.101
except not so much.

00:07:26.125 --> 00:07:27.143
(Laughter)

00:07:27.167 --> 00:07:28.768
After they made the announcement,

00:07:28.792 --> 00:07:30.893
a bunch of other astronomers
commented on it,
