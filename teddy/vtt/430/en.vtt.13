00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:31.101
but scientists tend to be
pretty clever people

00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:33.226
and they used a lot
of different techniques

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.643
and started observing stars.

00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:35.934
And over the decades

00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:38.893
they started finding some things
that were pretty interesting,

00:06:38.917 --> 00:06:41.911
right on the thin, hairy edge
of what they were able to detect.

00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:44.030
But time and again,
it was shown to be wrong.

00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:47.143
That all changed in 1991.

00:06:47.167 --> 00:06:49.143
A couple of astronomers --

00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:51.309
Alexander Lyne --
Andrew Lyne, pardon me --

00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:52.601
and Matthew Bailes,

00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:54.101
had a huge announcement.

00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:57.309
They had found a planet
orbiting another star.

00:06:57.333 --> 00:07:00.143
And not just any star, but a pulsar,
