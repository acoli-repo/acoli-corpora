00:03:58.375 --> 00:04:00.101
I was very excited,

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:02.518
so I just dug right into this data.

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:06.458
I spent a long time trying to figure out
if this thing were a planet or not.

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:10.559
The problem is planets are faint
and stars are bright,

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.684
so trying to get
the signal out of this data

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:16.309
was like trying to hear a whisper
in a heavy metal concert --

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:17.767
it was really hard.

00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:20.101
I tried everything I could,

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:22.768
but after a month of working on this,

00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:25.726
I came to a realization ...
couldn't do it.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.059
I had to give up.

00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:29.143
And I had to tell this other scientist,

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:30.434
"The data's too messy.
