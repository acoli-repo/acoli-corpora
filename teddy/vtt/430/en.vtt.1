00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.018
The problem here
is that people are flawed.

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:33.351
We can be fooled --

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:35.684
we're really good at fooling ourselves.

00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:40.208
And so baked into this process
is a way of minimizing our own bias.

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:44.434
So sort of boiled down
more than is probably useful,

00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:45.750
here's how this works.

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:48.268
If you want to do some science,

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:50.934
what you want to do
is you want to observe something ...

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:53.976
say, "The sky is blue. Hey, I wonder why?"

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.393
You question it.

00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:58.726
The next thing you do is you come up
with an idea that may explain it:

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.018
a hypothesis.
