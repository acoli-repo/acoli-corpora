00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:32.476
I know, I've been there.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.143
Many years ago I was working
on Hubble Space Telescope,

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:38.976
and a scientist I worked with
came to me with some data,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.059
and he said, "I think
there may be a picture

00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:44.958
of a planet orbiting
another star in this data."

00:03:46.417 --> 00:03:50.601
We had not had any pictures taken
of planets orbiting other stars yet,

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:52.809
so if this were true,

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:54.476
then this would be the first one

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.559
and we would be the ones who found it.

00:03:56.583 --> 00:03:58.351
That's a big deal.

00:03:58.375 --> 00:04:00.101
I was very excited,
