Hooray, your thesis is proven.

00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:34.434
But is it really? No.

00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:36.184
You've made one observation.

00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:39.393
You need to think about your hypothesis,
think about how to test it

00:01:39.417 --> 00:01:41.059
and do more than just one.

00:01:41.083 --> 00:01:43.643
Maybe you could go
to a different part of the country

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:45.184
or a different part of the year

00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:47.268
and see what the weather's like then.

00:01:47.292 --> 00:01:49.976
Another good idea
is to talk to other people.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.601
They have different ideas,
different perspectives,

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:53.851
and they can help you.

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:56.268
This is what we call peer review.

00:01:56.292 --> 00:01:59.976
And in fact that will probably also
save you a lot of money and a lot of time,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.292
flying coast-to-coast
just to check the weather.
