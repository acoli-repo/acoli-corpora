00:04:59.042 --> 00:05:01.417
that even the follow-up data
showed we were wrong.

00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:06.208
Emotionally I was pretty unhappy.

00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:09.559
But if a scientist
is doing their job correctly,

00:05:09.583 --> 00:05:12.268
being wrong is not so bad

00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:14.934
because that means
there's still more stuff out there --

00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.476
more things to figure out.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.351
Scientists don't love being wrong
but we love puzzles,

00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:23.333
and the universe is
the biggest puzzle of them all.

00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:25.518
Now having said that,

00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:29.101
if you have a piece and it doesn't fit
no matter how you move it,

00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:32.226
jamming it in harder isn't going to help.
