00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:30.476
(Laughter)

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.809
And it gets better!

00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:32.976
(Laughter)

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.476
Lyne steps off the podium.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.643
The next guy to come up
is a man named Aleksander Wolszczan

00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:39.643
He takes the microphone and says,

00:08:39.667 --> 00:08:43.143
"Yeah, so Lyne's team
didn't find a pulsar planet,

00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:45.851
but my team found not just one

00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:48.643
but two planets
orbiting a different pulsar.

00:08:48.667 --> 00:08:50.726
We knew about the problem that Lyne had,

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.184
we checked for it,
and yeah, ours are real."

00:08:54.208 --> 00:08:56.309
And it turns out he was right.

00:08:56.333 --> 00:08:57.976
And in fact, a few months later,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.434
they found a third planet
orbiting this pulsar
