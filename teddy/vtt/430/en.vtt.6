00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:03.226
and we bring a lot of baggage
along with us when we investigate things.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.268
We are egotistical,

00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:07.809
we are stubborn, we're superstitious,

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:10.143
we're tribal, we're humans --

00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:13.601
these are all human traits
and scientists are humans.

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:18.101
And so we have to be aware of that
when we're studying science

00:03:18.125 --> 00:03:20.583
and when we're trying
to develop our theses.

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:23.768
But part of this whole thing,

00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:25.434
part of this scientific process,

00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:27.559
part of the scientific method,

00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:29.542
is admitting when you're wrong.
