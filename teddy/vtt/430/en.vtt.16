00:07:57.542 --> 00:08:01.601
So in 1992 at the American
Astronomical Society meeting,

00:08:01.625 --> 00:08:04.851
which is one of the largest gatherings
of astronomers on the planet,

00:08:04.875 --> 00:08:08.893
he stood up and announced
that he had made a mistake

00:08:08.917 --> 00:08:11.184
and that the planet did not exist.

00:08:11.208 --> 00:08:13.643
And what happened next --

00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:14.976
oh, I love this --

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.583
what happened next was wonderful.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.434
He got an ovation.

00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:22.101
The astronomers weren't angry at him;

00:08:22.125 --> 00:08:23.726
they didn't want to chastise him.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.851
They praised him
for his honesty and his integrity.

00:08:26.875 --> 00:08:28.143
I love that!

00:08:28.167 --> 00:08:29.434
Scientists are people.

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:30.476
(Laughter)
