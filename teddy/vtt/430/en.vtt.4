00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.292
flying coast-to-coast
just to check the weather.

00:02:03.542 --> 00:02:09.809
Now, what happens if your hypothesis
does a decent job but not a perfect job?

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:11.101
Well, that's OK,

00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:13.934
because what you can do
is you can modify it a little bit

00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.351
and then go through
this whole process again --

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:18.268
make predictions, test them --

00:02:18.292 --> 00:02:21.351
and as you do that over and over again,
you will hone this idea.

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:22.768
And if it gets good enough,

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:25.143
it may be accepted
by the scientific community,

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:26.434
at least provisionally,

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:29.393
as a good explanation of what's going on,

00:02:29.417 --> 00:02:31.434
at least until a better idea
