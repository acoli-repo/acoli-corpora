00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.434
they found a third planet
orbiting this pulsar

00:09:00.458 --> 00:09:04.851
and it was the first
exoplanet system ever found --

00:09:04.875 --> 00:09:07.542
what we call alien worlds -- exoplanets.

00:09:08.375 --> 00:09:11.351
That to me is just wonderful.

00:09:11.375 --> 00:09:13.976
At that point the floodgates were opened.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.434
In 1995 a planet was found
around a star more like the Sun,

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:22.143
and then we found another and another.

00:09:22.167 --> 00:09:26.083
This is an image of an actual planet
orbiting an actual star.

00:09:27.042 --> 00:09:28.476
We kept getting better at it.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.726
We started finding them by the bucketload.
