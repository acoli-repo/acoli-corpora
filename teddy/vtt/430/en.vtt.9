00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:30.434
"The data's too messy.

00:04:30.458 --> 00:04:33.184
We can't say whether
this is a planet or not."

00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:35.143
And that was hard.

00:04:35.167 --> 00:04:37.976
Then later on we got
follow-up observations with Hubble,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.726
and it showed that it wasn't a planet.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.458
It was a background star
or galaxy, something like that.

00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:47.101
Well, not to get too technical,
but that sucked.

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:48.143
(Laughter)

00:04:48.167 --> 00:04:50.667
I was really unhappy about this.

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:53.184
But that's part of it.

00:04:53.208 --> 00:04:57.184
You have to say, "Look, you know,
we can't do this with the data we have."

00:04:57.208 --> 00:04:59.018
And then I had to face up to the fact

00:04:59.042 --> 00:05:01.417
that even the follow-up data
showed we were wrong.
