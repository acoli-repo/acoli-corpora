00:00:01.146 --> 00:00:03.527
I am an astrodynamicist --

00:00:03.551 --> 00:00:07.011
you know, like that guy Rich Purnell
in the movie "The Martian."

00:00:07.885 --> 00:00:13.762
And it's my job to study and predict
motion of objects in space.

00:00:15.172 --> 00:00:20.924
Currently we track about one percent
of hazardous objects on orbit --

00:00:21.714 --> 00:00:24.831
hazardous to services like location,

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:27.205
agriculture, banking,

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:29.196
television and communications,

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.086
and soon -- very soon --
