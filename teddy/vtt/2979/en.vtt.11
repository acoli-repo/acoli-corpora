00:05:26.938 --> 00:05:31.786
so we need to emphasize the paramount
importance of reducing emissions

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.316
and how speculative these ideas are.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.695
But having done so,
we still need to examine them.

00:05:38.161 --> 00:05:39.986
Can we cure climate change?

00:05:40.706 --> 00:05:44.044
I don't know, but we certainly
can't if we don't try.

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.437
We need ambition without arrogance.

00:05:47.917 --> 00:05:51.188
We need the ambition
to restore the atmosphere,

00:05:51.212 --> 00:05:53.030
to draw down carbon dioxide

00:05:53.054 --> 00:05:57.761
back to a level that is compatible
with a stable climate and healthy oceans.

00:05:58.257 --> 00:06:00.751
This will be an enormous undertaking.
