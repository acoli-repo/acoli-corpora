00:05:58.257 --> 00:06:00.751
This will be an enormous undertaking.

00:06:00.775 --> 00:06:04.121
You could describe it
as a cathedral project.

00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:06.127
Those involved at the outset

00:06:06.151 --> 00:06:09.507
may draft the plans
and dig the foundations,

00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:12.394

00:06:12.418 --> 00:06:14.377
That task, that privilege,

00:06:14.401 --> 00:06:16.261
belongs to our descendants.

00:06:16.801 --> 00:06:20.221
None of us will see that day,
but we must start in the hope

00:06:20.245 --> 00:06:23.122
that future generations
will be able to finish the job.

00:06:24.442 --> 00:06:27.090
So, do you want to change the world?

00:06:28.114 --> 00:06:29.264
I don't.

00:06:29.904 --> 00:06:32.133
I do not seek the change the world,
