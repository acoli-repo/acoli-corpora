00:03:56.158 --> 00:04:00.039
we don't fully understand
what the environmental consequences are,

00:04:00.063 --> 00:04:03.293
and so we need to assess
whether this treatment

00:04:03.317 --> 00:04:06.841
is actually better than the disease
that it is seeking to cure.

00:04:06.865 --> 00:04:10.103
We need to put in place
step-by-step governance

00:04:10.127 --> 00:04:12.317
for experiments to assess this safely.

00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:14.557
And the scale:

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.844
to avoid dangerous climate change,

00:04:17.868 --> 00:04:20.947
we are going to need
to remove trillions --

00:04:20.971 --> 00:04:22.760
and yes, that's trillions with a T --

00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:27.947
trillions of tons of carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere in the decades ahead.

00:04:28.739 --> 00:04:33.934
It will cost a few percent of GDP --
think defense-sized expenditure,
