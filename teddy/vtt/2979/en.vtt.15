00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.614
CA: And who would fund such experiments?

00:07:31.638 --> 00:07:35.513
Because they kind of impact
the whole planet at some level.

00:07:35.537 --> 00:07:38.063
Is that why nothing is happening on this?

00:07:38.087 --> 00:07:41.908
TK: So I think you can do small-scale
experiments in national waters,

00:07:41.932 --> 00:07:46.977
and then it's probably the requirement
of national funders to do that.

00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:52.053
But ultimately, if you wanted
to counter ocean acidification in this way

00:07:52.077 --> 00:07:53.548
on a global scale,

00:07:53.572 --> 00:07:55.826
you would need to do it
in international waters,

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.570
and then you would need to have
an international community working on it.

00:07:59.594 --> 00:08:02.647
CA: Even in national waters,
you know, the ocean's all connected.
