00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:03.032
To avoid dangerous climate change,

00:00:03.056 --> 00:00:05.595
we're going to need
to cut emissions rapidly.

00:00:06.413 --> 00:00:09.497
That should be a pretty
uncontentious statement,

00:00:09.521 --> 00:00:11.377
certainly with this audience.

00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:14.325
But here's something
that's slightly more contentious:

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.405
it's not going to be enough.

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:21.330
We will munch our way through
our remaining carbon budget

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:22.919
for one and a half degrees

00:00:22.943 --> 00:00:25.328
in a few short years,

00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:26.974
and the two degree budget

00:00:26.998 --> 00:00:28.597
in about two decades.

00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:33.334
We need to not only cut emissions
extremely rapidly,
