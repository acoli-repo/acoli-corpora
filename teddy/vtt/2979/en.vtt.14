What would a responsible
experiment look like?

00:07:01.376 --> 00:07:04.338
Tim Kruger: So I think you need to do
a series of experiments,

00:07:04.362 --> 00:07:06.964
but you need to do them
just very small stage-by-stage.

00:07:06.988 --> 00:07:09.274
In the same way,
when you're trialing a new drug,

00:07:09.298 --> 00:07:11.784
you wouldn't just go
into human trials straight off.

00:07:11.808 --> 00:07:13.756
You would do a small experiment.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.372
And so the first things to do
are experiments entirely on land,

00:07:17.396 --> 00:07:20.978
in special containers,
away from the environment.

00:07:21.002 --> 00:07:24.481
And then once you are confident
that that can be done safely,

00:07:24.505 --> 00:07:25.836
you move to the next stage.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.532
If you're not confident, you don't.

00:07:27.556 --> 00:07:28.706
But step by step.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.614
CA: And who would fund such experiments?
