00:02:28.488 --> 00:02:33.709
And then the lime that you produce
can be used in industrial processes,

00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:37.289
and in being used,
it scrubs CO2 out of the air.

00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:40.802
Overall, the process is carbon negative.

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:43.182
It removes carbon dioxide from the air.

00:02:44.423 --> 00:02:49.049
If you normally generate
electricity from natural gas,

00:02:49.073 --> 00:02:52.878
you emit about 400 grams
of CO2 into the air

00:02:52.902 --> 00:02:54.411
for every kilowatt-hour.

00:02:55.127 --> 00:03:00.175
With this process,
that figure is minus 600.
