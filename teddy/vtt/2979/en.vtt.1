00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:33.334
We need to not only cut emissions
extremely rapidly,

00:00:33.358 --> 00:00:37.489
we also need to take carbon dioxide
out of the atmosphere.

00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:40.038
Thank you.

00:00:40.062 --> 00:00:41.654
(Laughter)

00:00:41.678 --> 00:00:46.423
I work assessing a whole range
of these proposed techniques

00:00:46.447 --> 00:00:47.920
to see if they can work.

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:51.986
We could use plants to take CO2 out,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.254
and then store it in trees,

00:00:54.278 --> 00:00:57.833
in the soil, deep underground
or in the oceans.

00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:02.181
We could build large machines,
so-called artificial trees,
