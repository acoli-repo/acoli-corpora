00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:00.405
and the remainder into heat,

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.071
which is used to break down limestone

00:02:03.095 --> 00:02:05.110
into lime and carbon dioxide.

00:02:05.697 --> 00:02:09.069
Now at this point, you're probably
thinking that I'm nuts.

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:11.966
It's actually generating carbon dioxide.

00:02:12.488 --> 00:02:16.203
But the key point is,
all of the carbon dioxide generated,

00:02:16.227 --> 00:02:19.886
both from the fuel cell
and from the lime kiln, is pure,

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.251
and that's really important,

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:23.864
because it means you can
either use that carbon dioxide

00:02:23.888 --> 00:02:27.649
or you can store it away
deep underground at low cost.

00:02:28.488 --> 00:02:33.709
And then the lime that you produce
can be used in industrial processes,
