00:02:55.127 --> 00:03:00.175
With this process,
that figure is minus 600.

00:03:01.157 --> 00:03:03.878
At the moment, power
generation is responsible

00:03:03.902 --> 00:03:07.825
for about a quarter
of all carbon dioxide emissions.

00:03:08.643 --> 00:03:13.606
Hypothetically, if you replaced
all power generation with this process,

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.570
then you would not only eliminate all
of the emissions from power generation

00:03:17.594 --> 00:03:21.644
but you would start removing emissions
from other sectors as well,

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:25.860
potentially cutting 60 percent
of overall carbon emissions.

00:03:26.682 --> 00:03:29.228
You could even use the lime

00:03:29.252 --> 00:03:34.552
to add it directly to seawater
to counteract ocean acidification,
