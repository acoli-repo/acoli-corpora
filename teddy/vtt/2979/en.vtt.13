I do not seek the change the world,

00:06:32.157 --> 00:06:34.592
but rather keep it as it's meant to be.

00:06:35.641 --> 00:06:36.792
Thank you.

00:06:36.816 --> 00:06:42.072
(Applause)

00:06:42.096 --> 00:06:45.678
Chris Anderson: Thanks. I just want
to ask you a couple of other questions.

00:06:45.702 --> 00:06:49.141
Tell us a bit more about this idea
of putting lime in the ocean.

00:06:49.165 --> 00:06:51.672
I mean, on the face of it,
it's pretty compelling --

00:06:51.696 --> 00:06:53.890
anti-ocean acidification --

00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:56.549
and it absorbs more CO2.

00:06:56.573 --> 00:06:59.115
You talked about,
we need to do an experiment on this.

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:01.352
What would a responsible
experiment look like?
