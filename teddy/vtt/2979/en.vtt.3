00:01:28.045 --> 00:01:31.731
but potentially together,
they may form the silver buckshot

00:01:31.755 --> 00:01:35.655
that we need to stop
climate change in its tracks.

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.086
I'm working independently
on one particular idea

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.592
which uses natural gas
to generate electricity

00:01:43.616 --> 00:01:46.571
in a way that takes
carbon dioxide out of the air.

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.649
Huh? How does that work?

00:01:49.345 --> 00:01:54.026
So the Origen Power Process
feeds natural gas into a fuel cell.

00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:58.342
About half the chemical energy
is converted into electricity,

00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:00.405
and the remainder into heat,
