00:03:29.252 --> 00:03:34.552
to add it directly to seawater
to counteract ocean acidification,

00:03:34.576 --> 00:03:38.628
one of the other issues that is caused
by CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.479
In fact, you get more bang for your buck.

00:03:42.503 --> 00:03:46.778
You absorb about twice as much
carbon dioxide when you add it to seawater

00:03:46.802 --> 00:03:48.464
as when you use it industrially.

00:03:49.118 --> 00:03:51.362
But this is where it gets
really complicated.

00:03:51.743 --> 00:03:56.134
While counteracting ocean
acidification is a good thing,

00:03:56.158 --> 00:04:00.039
we don't fully understand
what the environmental consequences are,
