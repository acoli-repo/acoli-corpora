00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:02.181
We could build large machines,
so-called artificial trees,

00:01:02.205 --> 00:01:04.330
that will scrub CO2 from the air.

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.930
For these ideas to be feasible,

00:01:06.954 --> 00:01:09.797
we need to understand
whether they can be applied

00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:14.872
at a vast scale in a way that is safe,
economic and socially acceptable.

00:01:15.878 --> 00:01:18.052
All of these ideas come with tradeoffs.

00:01:18.576 --> 00:01:20.429
None of them are perfect,

00:01:20.453 --> 00:01:22.080
but many have potential.

00:01:23.187 --> 00:01:26.659
It's unlikely that any one of them
will solve it on its own.

00:01:26.683 --> 00:01:28.021
There is no silver bullet,

00:01:28.045 --> 00:01:31.731
but potentially together,
they may form the silver buckshot
