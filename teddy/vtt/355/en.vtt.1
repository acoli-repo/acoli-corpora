00:00:29.683 --> 00:00:31.179
I found this sweet little poem,

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:32.780
"Four in the Morning."

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.045
"The hour from night to day.

00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:35.431
The hour from side to side.

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:37.229
The hour for those past thirty..."

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:39.316
And it goes on, but as soon as I read this poem,

00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:41.239
I fell for it hard,

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.180
so hard, I suspected we must have met

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.593
somewhere before.

00:00:45.593 --> 00:00:47.892
Had I shared an elevator ride with this poem?

00:00:47.892 --> 00:00:49.412
Did I flirt with this poem

00:00:49.412 --> 00:00:50.557
in a coffee shop somewhere?

00:00:50.557 --> 00:00:52.069
I could not place it, and it bugged me,

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:53.971
and then in the coming week or two,

00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:55.420
I would just be watching an old movie,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.702
and this would happen.

00:00:56.702 --> 00:00:57.965
(Video) Groucho Marx: Charlie, you
should have come to the first party.

00:00:57.965 --> 00:01:00.317
We didn't get home till around four in the morning.
