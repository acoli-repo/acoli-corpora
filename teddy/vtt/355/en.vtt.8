00:03:57.503 --> 00:04:00.422
(Video) Roy Neary: Get up, get up! I'm not kidding.
Ronnie Neary: Is there an accident?

00:04:00.422 --> 00:04:03.847
Roy: No, it's not an accident. You
wanted to get out of the house anyway, right?

00:04:03.847 --> 00:04:05.983
Ronnie: Not at four o'clock in the morning.

00:04:05.983 --> 00:04:07.177
Rives: So that's "Close Encounters,"

00:04:07.177 --> 00:04:08.501
and the main character is all worked up

00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:10.017
because aliens, momentously,

00:04:10.017 --> 00:04:11.539
have chosen to show themselves to earthlings

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:12.565
at four in the morning,

00:04:12.565 --> 00:04:14.319
which does make that a very solid example.

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.343
Those were all really solid examples.

00:04:16.343 --> 00:04:18.310
They did not get me any closer to understanding

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.911
why I thought I recognized this one particular poem.

00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:22.999
But they followed the pattern. They played along.

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:25.783
Right? Four in the morning as this scapegoat hour

00:04:25.783 --> 00:04:27.553
when all these dramatic occurrences

00:04:27.553 --> 00:04:29.919
allegedly occur.

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.591
Maybe this was some kind of cliche
