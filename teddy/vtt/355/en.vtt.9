Maybe this was some kind of cliche

00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:33.439
that had never been taxonomized before.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.189
Maybe I was on the trail

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:36.255
of a new meme or something.

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:39.027
Just when things were getting pretty interesting,

00:04:39.027 --> 00:04:40.636
things got really interesting.

00:04:40.636 --> 00:04:42.991
TED.com launched, later that year,

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:44.823
with a bunch of videos from past talks,

00:04:44.823 --> 00:04:45.723
including mine,

00:04:45.723 --> 00:04:48.597
and I started receiving "four in the morning" citations

00:04:48.597 --> 00:04:51.160
from what seemed like every
time zone on the planet.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.871
Much of it was content I never would have found

00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:55.295
on my own if I was looking for it,

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:56.833
and I was not.

00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:58.480
I don't know anybody with juvenile diabetes.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.110
I probably would have missed the booklet,
