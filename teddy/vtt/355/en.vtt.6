00:02:59.207 --> 00:03:01.670
and I'm thinking, this man is the Typhoid Mary

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.809
of ideas worth spreading, and I have infected him.

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:05.024
I am contagious,

00:03:05.024 --> 00:03:08.031
which was confirmed less than a week later

00:03:08.031 --> 00:03:10.070

makes me not really need to,"

00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:21.685
which I love, because together these are like,

00:03:21.685 --> 00:03:23.375
"Hallmark: When you care enough

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:25.438
to send the very best twice,

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:27.406

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:31.338
