00:01:59.147 --> 00:02:00.525
but it also had examples

00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:02.581
from my fellow TED speakers that year.

00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:04.035
I found four in the morning in a novel

00:02:04.035 --> 00:02:05.311
by Isabel Allende.

00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:06.842
I found a really great one

00:02:06.842 --> 00:02:08.998
in the autobiography of Bill Clinton.

00:02:08.998 --> 00:02:10.643
I found a couple in the work of Matt Groening,

00:02:10.643 --> 00:02:12.080
although Matt Groening told me later

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.898
that he could not make my talk

00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:14.662
because it was a morning session

00:02:14.662 --> 00:02:17.382
and I gather that he is not an early riser.

00:02:17.382 --> 00:02:20.970
However, had Matt been there,

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.948
he would have seen this mock conspiracy theory

00:02:23.948 --> 00:02:26.563
that was un-freaking-canny for me to assemble.

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:27.724
It was totally contrived

00:02:27.724 --> 00:02:29.740
just for that room, just for that moment.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.897
That's how we did it in the pre-TED.com days.
