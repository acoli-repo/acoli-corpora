00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.110
I probably would have missed the booklet,

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.647
"Grilled Cheese at Four O'Clock in the Morning."

00:05:01.647 --> 00:05:04.570
(Laughter)

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.475
I do not subscribe to Crochet Today! magazine,

00:05:07.475 --> 00:05:11.967
although it looks delightful. (Laughter)

00:05:11.967 --> 00:05:13.279
Take note of those clock ends.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.619
This is a college student's suggestion

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:16.285
for what a "four in the morning" gang sign

00:05:16.285 --> 00:05:18.639
should look like.

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.727
People sent me magazine ads.

00:05:20.727 --> 00:05:22.810
They took photographs in grocery stores.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.277
I got a ton of graphic novels and comics.

00:05:26.277 --> 00:05:27.981
A lot of good quality work, too:

00:05:27.981 --> 00:05:29.650
"The Sandman," "Watchmen."

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.081
There's a very cute example
here from "Calvin and Hobbes."
