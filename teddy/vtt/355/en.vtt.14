00:06:58.976 --> 00:07:00.448
You know, I was kind of interested.

00:07:00.448 --> 00:07:02.656
If this is confirmation bias,

00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:05.267
there is so much confirmation, I am biased.

00:07:05.267 --> 00:07:06.513
Literature probably shows it best.

00:07:06.513 --> 00:07:08.657
There are a couple three in
the mornings in Shakespeare.

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:10.000
There's a five in the morning.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.388
There are seven four in the mornings,

00:07:11.388 --> 00:07:12.241
and they're all very dire.

00:07:12.241 --> 00:07:15.592
In "Measure for Measure," it's
the call time for the executioner.

00:07:15.592 --> 00:07:18.488
Tolstoy gives Napoleon insomnia

00:07:18.488 --> 00:07:20.320
at four in the morning right before battle

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.030
in "War and Peace."

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.746
Charlotte Brontë's "Jane Eyre" has got kind of

00:07:23.746 --> 00:07:24.875
a pivotal four in the morning,

00:07:24.875 --> 00:07:28.103
as does Emily Brontë's "Wuthering Heights."

00:07:28.103 --> 00:07:31.301
"Lolita" has as a creepy four in the morning.
