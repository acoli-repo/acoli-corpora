00:12:27.448 --> 00:12:30.720
Instead, L.D. has used the U.S. Library of Congress

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.439
classification system, including page numbers,

00:12:33.439 --> 00:12:35.664
to leave me clues.

00:12:35.664 --> 00:12:37.296
When I got this mix tape,

00:12:37.296 --> 00:12:38.928
I put it in my cassette player,

00:12:38.928 --> 00:12:42.312
I took it to the campus library, her library,

00:12:42.312 --> 00:12:44.160
I found 14 books on the shelves.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.582
I remember bringing them all

00:12:45.582 --> 00:12:47.186
to my favorite corner table,

00:12:47.186 --> 00:12:51.199
and I read poems paired to songs

00:12:51.199 --> 00:12:52.860
like food to wine,

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.800
paired, I can tell you,

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.583
like saddle shoes

00:12:56.583 --> 00:12:59.589
to a cobalt blue vintage cotton dress.

00:12:59.589 --> 00:13:01.993
I did this again last October.
