00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.057
and feminist Simone de Beauvoir

00:10:01.057 --> 00:10:02.309
are not just different people.

00:10:02.309 --> 00:10:05.189
They are different people that
have this thing connecting them,

00:10:05.189 --> 00:10:08.586
and I did not know if that is trivia or knowledge

00:10:08.586 --> 00:10:11.213
or inadvertent expertise, but I did wonder,

00:10:11.213 --> 00:10:13.070
is there maybe a cooler way to do this?

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:17.582
So last October, in gentleman scholar tradition,

00:10:17.582 --> 00:10:19.796
I put the entire collection online

00:10:19.796 --> 00:10:21.428
as "Museum of Four in the Morning."

00:10:21.428 --> 00:10:23.426
You can click on that red "refresh" button.

00:10:23.426 --> 00:10:25.710
It will take you at random to one of

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.008
hundreds of snippets that are in the collection.

00:10:28.008 --> 00:10:29.656
Here is a knockout poem

00:10:29.656 --> 00:10:32.149
by Billy Collins called "Forgetfulness."
