00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:31.338
I was not surprised at the TEDster

00:03:31.338 --> 00:03:33.050
and New Yorker magazine overlap.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.075
A bunch of people sent me this when it came out.

00:03:35.075 --> 00:03:38.135
"It's 4 a.m.—maybe you'd sleep
better if you bought some crap."

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:41.877
I was surprised at the TEDster/"Rugrats" overlap.

00:03:41.877 --> 00:03:43.637
More than one person sent me this.

00:03:43.637 --> 00:03:45.516
(Video) Didi Pickles: It's
four o'clock in the morning.

00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:47.748
Why on Earth are you making chocolate pudding?

00:03:47.748 --> 00:03:49.884
Stu Pickles: Because I've lost control of my life.

00:03:49.884 --> 00:03:52.010
(Laughter)

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.607
Rives: And then there was the lone TEDster

00:03:53.607 --> 00:03:55.487
who was disgruntled I had overlooked

00:03:55.487 --> 00:03:57.503
what he considers to be a classic.

00:03:57.503 --> 00:04:00.422
(Video) Roy Neary: Get up, get up! I'm not kidding.
Ronnie Neary: Is there an accident?
