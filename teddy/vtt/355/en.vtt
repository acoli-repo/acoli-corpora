00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.015
The most romantic thing to ever happen to me online

00:00:04.015 --> 00:00:06.388
started out the way most things do:

00:00:06.388 --> 00:00:09.911
without me, and not online.

00:00:09.911 --> 00:00:12.819
On December 10, 1896, the man on the medal,

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:14.654
Alfred Nobel, died.

00:00:14.654 --> 00:00:16.910
One hundred years later, exactly, actually,

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.476
December 10, 1996,

00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:20.475

00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:22.636
won the Nobel Prize for literature.

00:00:22.636 --> 00:00:24.277
She's a Polish poet.

00:00:24.277 --> 00:00:25.525
She's a big deal, obviously,

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.164
but back in '96, I thought I had never heard of her,

00:00:28.164 --> 00:00:29.683
and when I checked out her work,

00:00:29.683 --> 00:00:31.179
I found this sweet little poem,
