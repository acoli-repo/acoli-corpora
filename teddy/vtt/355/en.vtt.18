00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.422
And when I got to that point, I embraced it.

00:09:00.422 --> 00:09:03.146
I got my curator on. I started fact checking,

00:09:03.146 --> 00:09:06.289
downloading, illegally screen-grabbing.

00:09:06.289 --> 00:09:07.660
I started archiving.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.847
My hobby had become a habit,

00:09:09.847 --> 00:09:12.573
and my habit gave me possibly the world's

00:09:12.573 --> 00:09:15.421
most eclectic Netflix queue.

00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:18.311
At one point, it went, "Guys and Dolls: The Musical,"

00:09:18.311 --> 00:09:19.699
"Last Tango in Paris,"

00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:20.949
"Diary of a Wimpy Kid,"

00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:22.623
"Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy."

00:09:22.623 --> 00:09:24.523
Why "Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy"?

00:09:24.523 --> 00:09:27.183
Because someone told me I
would find this clip in there.

00:09:27.183 --> 00:09:28.647
(Video) Ron Jeremy: I was born

00:09:28.647 --> 00:09:30.415
in Flushing, Queens
