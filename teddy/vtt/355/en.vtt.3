00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:31.600
was in me now, but mildly,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.114
like a groin injury.

00:01:34.114 --> 00:01:35.586
I always assumed it would just go away

00:01:35.586 --> 00:01:37.095
on its own eventually,

00:01:37.095 --> 00:01:38.681
and I never talked about it with anybody,

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:42.233
but it did not, and I totally did.

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:44.314
In 2007, I was invited to speak at TED

00:01:44.314 --> 00:01:45.230
for the second time,

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.732
and since I was still an authority on nothing,

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:51.123
I thought, what if I made a multimedia presentation

00:01:51.123 --> 00:01:52.711
on a topic so niche

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:54.558
it is actually inconsequential

00:01:54.558 --> 00:01:55.971
or actually cockamamie.

00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:59.147
So my talk had some of my
four in the morning examples,

00:01:59.147 --> 00:02:00.525
but it also had examples
