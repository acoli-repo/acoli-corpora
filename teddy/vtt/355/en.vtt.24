00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:02.581
and became my one that got away.

00:12:02.581 --> 00:12:06.728
But her mix tape did not get away.

00:12:06.728 --> 00:12:09.584
I have kept this mix tape in a box

00:12:09.584 --> 00:12:12.311
with notes and postcards, not just from L.D.,

00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:15.000
from my life, but for decades.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.310
It's the kind of box where,

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.428
if I have a girlfriend, I tend to hide it from her,

00:12:18.428 --> 00:12:20.138
and if I had a wife, I'm sure I would share it with her,

00:12:20.138 --> 00:12:23.504
but the story — (Laughter) — with this mix tape

00:12:23.504 --> 00:12:25.392
is there are seven songs per side,

00:12:25.392 --> 00:12:27.448
but no song titles.

00:12:27.448 --> 00:12:30.720
Instead, L.D. has used the U.S. Library of Congress
