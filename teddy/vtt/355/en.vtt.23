00:11:28.006 --> 00:11:30.200
and I knew immediately

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.262
what mix tape she was talking about.

00:11:33.262 --> 00:11:36.771
(Music)

00:11:36.771 --> 00:11:39.044
L.D. was my college romance.

00:11:39.044 --> 00:11:41.841
This is in the early '90s. I was an undegrad.

00:11:41.841 --> 00:11:45.159
She was a grad student in the
library sciences department.

00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:47.232
Not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off,

00:11:47.232 --> 00:11:49.408
lets her hair down, suddenly she's smoking hot.

00:11:49.408 --> 00:11:51.170
She was already smoking hot,

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:52.560
she was super dorky,

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.922
and we had a December-May romance,

00:11:54.922 --> 00:11:56.840
meaning we started dating in December,

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.135
and by May, she had graduated

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:02.581
and became my one that got away.
