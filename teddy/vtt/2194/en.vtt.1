WEBVTT

00:00:27.703 --> 00:00:31.749
Today, we have thousands
of amazing employees,

00:00:31.773 --> 00:00:35.221
and millions of people use
our software around the planet.

00:00:35.245 --> 00:00:37.267
And technically, even outside the planet,

00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:40.277
if you count those that are currently
on their way to Mars.

00:00:40.301 --> 00:00:43.012
So you'd think that I know
what I'm doing every day

00:00:43.036 --> 00:00:44.226
when I go to work.

00:00:45.194 --> 00:00:46.983
Well, let me let you in on something:

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:51.572
most days, I still feel like
I often don't know what I'm doing.

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:55.364
I've felt that way for 15 years,

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:59.419
and I've since learned that feeling
is called "impostor syndrome."
