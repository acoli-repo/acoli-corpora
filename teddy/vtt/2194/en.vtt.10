00:04:57.314 --> 00:05:00.091
we got a lot of champagne to the table
and the party began,

00:05:00.115 --> 00:05:01.576
and the night was surely over.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.448
We were having a royally great time.

00:05:03.472 --> 00:05:06.191
Fast-forward to the last
award of the night,

00:05:06.215 --> 00:05:08.780
and our shock turned
into everybody's shock

00:05:08.804 --> 00:05:11.238
when we won the Australian
Entrepreneur of the Year

00:05:11.262 --> 00:05:13.044
against all of the other categories.

00:05:13.068 --> 00:05:15.153
Now, so shocked was
everybody else, in fact,

00:05:15.177 --> 00:05:17.418

the CEO of Ernst and Young,

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:18.615
opened the envelope,

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:21.258
and the first words out of his mouth
were, "Oh my God."

00:05:21.282 --> 00:05:22.496
(Laughter)

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.272
And then he reset himself
and announced that we had won.

00:05:25.296 --> 00:05:26.661
(Laughter)

00:05:26.685 --> 00:05:28.654
So we knew we were in way too deep.

00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:31.259
And from there,
the water got a lot deeper,
