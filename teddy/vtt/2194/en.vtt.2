Have you ever felt out of your depth,

00:01:03.893 --> 00:01:05.051
like a fraud,

00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:09.862
and just kind of guessed/bullshitted
your way through the situation --

00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:10.911
(Laughter)

00:01:10.935 --> 00:01:12.880
petrified that anytime,

00:01:12.904 --> 00:01:14.830
someone was going to call you on it?

00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:18.556
Well, I can think of many examples
where I felt like this.

00:01:19.897 --> 00:01:21.922
Interviewing our first HR manager,

00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:24.954
having never worked in a company
that had an HR department --

00:01:24.978 --> 00:01:26.238
(Laughter)

00:01:26.262 --> 00:01:29.175
terrified as I walked into the interview,

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:31.684
thinking, "What am I going
to ask this person?"
