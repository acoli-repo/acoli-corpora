And I would cover the phone,

00:02:00.397 --> 00:02:02.262
cover the mouthpiece of the phone,

00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:04.069
and say, "Scott, you're in accounts,"

00:02:04.093 --> 00:02:05.403
and pass it across.

00:02:05.427 --> 00:02:06.450

00:02:25.316 --> 00:02:27.334
and you have to figure a way out,

00:02:27.358 --> 00:02:29.106
because you can't just get out.

00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:31.593
It's not a fear of failure,
