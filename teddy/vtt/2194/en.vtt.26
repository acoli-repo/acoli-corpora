00:12:59.353 --> 00:13:01.740
And it's important
that I say "harness" here,

00:13:01.764 --> 00:13:04.267
because this isn't sort of
pop-psychology BS

00:13:04.291 --> 00:13:06.519
about conquering impostor syndrome for me.

00:13:06.543 --> 00:13:08.359
It's merely about being aware of it.

00:13:08.904 --> 00:13:12.879
In fact, I'm extremely aware
of feeling like an impostor right now,

00:13:12.903 --> 00:13:15.403
as I'm up here, some sort of pseudo-expert

00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:18.600
on a feeling that I couldn't even
put a name to a few months ago,

00:13:18.624 --> 00:13:20.895
when I agreed to do this talk.

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:24.148
Which, if you think about it,
is kind of the point, isn't it?

00:13:24.172 --> 00:13:25.212
(Laughter)

00:13:25.236 --> 00:13:26.449
Thank you.

00:13:26.473 --> 00:13:29.347
(Applause)
