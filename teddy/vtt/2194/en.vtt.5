00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:31.593
It's not a fear of failure,

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:34.484
and it's not a fear
of being unable to do it.

00:02:35.032 --> 00:02:38.334
It's more a sensation
of getting away with something,

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:40.540
a fear of being discovered,

00:02:40.564 --> 00:02:43.645
that at any time, someone
is going to figure this out.

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:45.182
And if they did figure it out,

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:48.168
you'd honestly think, "Well,
that's fair enough, actually."

00:02:48.192 --> 00:02:49.842
(Laughter)

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:53.536
One of my favorite writers,
Neil Gaiman, put it so beautifully

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.893
in a commencement address he gave
at a university, called "Make Good Art."

00:02:57.917 --> 00:03:00.216
I want to make sure
I get his quote correct.
