I want to make sure
I get his quote correct.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.050
"I was convinced that there would be
a knock on the door,

00:03:04.074 --> 00:03:07.903
and a man with a clipboard would be there
to tell me that it was all over,

00:03:08.935 --> 00:03:10.524
that they'd caught up with me,

00:03:10.548 --> 00:03:13.363
and that I would now have to go
and get a real job."

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:17.251
Now, when there's a knock on my door,

00:03:17.275 --> 00:03:21.685
I still feel like some sort of dark-suited
clipboard man is going to be there

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.033
to tell me that my time is kind of up.

00:03:24.057 --> 00:03:25.237
And being a crap cook,

00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:28.523
I'm quite relieved when it's just
someone with a pizza for the kids.

00:03:28.547 --> 00:03:29.776
