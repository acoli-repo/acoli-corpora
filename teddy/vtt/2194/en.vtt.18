Try to keep the conversation going,

00:09:02.076 --> 00:09:04.736
even if she thinks that you're
somebody that you're not.

00:09:06.514 --> 00:09:09.239
Now, feeling like, or people
thinking I'm someone I'm not

00:09:09.263 --> 00:09:11.082
actually happens quite frequently.

00:09:11.622 --> 00:09:14.009
A great example from my more recent past,

00:09:14.033 --> 00:09:17.048
a few months ago, I was up
late at night with one of my kids,

00:09:17.072 --> 00:09:19.230
and I saw something on Twitter

00:09:19.254 --> 00:09:21.572
about Tesla saying that they could solve

00:09:21.596 --> 00:09:24.223
South Australia's rolling
series of power crises

00:09:24.247 --> 00:09:26.543
with one of their large
industrial batteries.

00:09:27.138 --> 00:09:29.961
Without thinking,
I fired off a bunch of tweets,

00:09:29.985 --> 00:09:33.171
challenging them and saying
were they really serious about this.
