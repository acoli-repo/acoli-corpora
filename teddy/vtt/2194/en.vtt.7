But it's important to note
that it's not all bad.

00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:35.825
There's a lot of goodness,
I think, in those feelings.

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.655
And this isn't some sort of
motivational-poster type talk,

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:43.211
a "Begin it now."

00:03:44.554 --> 00:03:48.942
It's more of an introspection into
my own experiences of impostor syndrome,

00:03:48.966 --> 00:03:50.989
and how I've tried
to learn to harness them

00:03:51.013 --> 00:03:53.402
and turn them into some sort
of a force for good.

00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:55.844
And a great example of those experiences

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:57.966
is in the early days
of Atlassian's history.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.791
We were about four years old,
and we had about 70 employees.
