And he had four billion euro in turnover.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.168
And after a couple of wines,

00:06:03.192 --> 00:06:07.407
I remember admitting to him that I felt
that we did not deserve to be there,

00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:09.120
that we were well out of our depth,

00:06:09.144 --> 00:06:11.726
and at some time, someone
was going to figure this out

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.311
and send us home to Australia.

00:06:13.962 --> 00:06:16.430
And he, I remember,
just paused and looked at me

00:06:16.454 --> 00:06:19.740
and said that he felt exactly the same way

00:06:19.764 --> 00:06:23.088
and that he suspected all the winners
were feeling that way,

00:06:23.112 --> 00:06:26.761
and that despite not knowing Scott or I
or really anything about technology,

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:29.264
he said that we were obviously
doing something right

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:31.022
and should probably just keep going.
