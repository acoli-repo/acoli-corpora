WEBVTT

00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:31.259
And from there,
the water got a lot deeper,

00:05:31.283 --> 00:05:33.313
because we jetted off to Monte Carlo

00:05:33.337 --> 00:05:36.453
to represent Australia
in the World Entrepreneur of the Year

00:05:36.477 --> 00:05:38.461
against 40 other different countries.

00:05:39.723 --> 00:05:43.571
Now, in another rented suit,
I was at one of the dinners

00:05:43.595 --> 00:05:47.570
and sitting next to a lovely man
called Belmiro de Azevedo,

00:05:47.594 --> 00:05:49.298
who was the winner from Portugal.

00:05:49.322 --> 00:05:50.547
Total champion.

00:05:50.571 --> 00:05:53.725
At 65, he had been running
his business for 40 years.

00:05:54.313 --> 00:05:56.133
He had 30,000 employees.

00:05:56.157 --> 00:05:58.107
Don't forget, at the time, we had 70.

00:05:58.468 --> 00:06:00.533
And he had four billion euro in turnover.
