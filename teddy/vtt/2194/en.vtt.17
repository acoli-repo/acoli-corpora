And I think she sometimes
feels the same way.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.784
And apparently, that's one of the reasons

00:08:33.808 --> 00:08:35.965
that we'll likely have
a successful marriage.

00:08:35.989 --> 00:08:37.667
You see, in researching this talk,

00:08:37.691 --> 00:08:41.161
I learned that one of the attributes
of the most successful relationships

00:08:41.185 --> 00:08:43.940
is when both partners
feel out of their league.

00:08:43.964 --> 00:08:46.412
They feel that their partner
is out of their league.

00:08:46.436 --> 00:08:48.153
They feel like impostors.

00:08:48.177 --> 00:08:50.769
And if they don't freeze,
and they're thankful,

00:08:50.793 --> 00:08:54.121
and they work harder and they stretch
to be the best partner they can,

00:08:54.145 --> 00:08:56.504
it's likely to be a very
successful relationship.

00:08:56.528 --> 00:08:59.209
So if you have this feeling, don't freeze.

00:08:59.233 --> 00:09:00.942
