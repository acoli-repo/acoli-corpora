00:10:59.816 --> 00:11:03.262
and the electricity grid and renewables
and the economics of all of this

00:11:03.286 --> 00:11:05.639
and whether this was even
a feasible proposal.

00:11:05.663 --> 00:11:08.467
I talked to the chief scientist,
I talked to the CSIRO,

00:11:08.491 --> 00:11:12.586
had multiple ministers and premiers
trying to give me their side of the story

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.396
from both sides of the aisle.

00:11:14.969 --> 00:11:17.507
I managed to exchange
tweets with the prime minister.

00:11:17.531 --> 00:11:21.112
I even managed to pull off
a passing impression, let's say,

00:11:21.136 --> 00:11:23.076
of an energy expert on ABC Lateline.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.938
(Laughter)

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.180
But as a result of all this,

00:11:27.204 --> 00:11:29.880
South Australia did put out
a battery tender,

00:11:29.904 --> 00:11:33.444
and they had more than 90 applications
for that battery tender.
