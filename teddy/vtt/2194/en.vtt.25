They know when the water is way too deep,

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.193
and they're not afraid to ask for advice.

00:12:35.217 --> 00:12:36.907
They don't see that as a bad thing.

00:12:36.931 --> 00:12:40.009
And they use that advice
to hone those ideas, to improve them

00:12:40.033 --> 00:12:41.372
and to learn.

00:12:41.396 --> 00:12:44.057
And it's OK to be
out of your depth sometimes.

00:12:44.081 --> 00:12:45.620
I'm frequently out of my depth.

00:12:45.644 --> 00:12:47.679
It's OK to be out of your depth.

00:12:47.703 --> 00:12:51.137
It's OK to be in a situation where
you just can't push the eject button,

00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:53.609
so long as you don't freeze,

00:12:53.633 --> 00:12:56.345
so long as you harness the situation,
don't be paralyzed

00:12:56.369 --> 00:12:58.957
and try to turn it into
some sort of a force for good.

00:12:59.353 --> 00:13:01.740
And it's important
that I say "harness" here,
