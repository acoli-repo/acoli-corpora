00:07:56.972 --> 00:08:03.295
And I took that girl to the awards
ceremony a couple of months later.

00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:05.016
And more than a decade later,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.232
I'm incredibly happy
that she is now my wife,

00:08:07.256 --> 00:08:09.343
and we have four amazing
children together.

00:08:09.367 --> 00:08:13.271
(Applause)

00:08:15.351 --> 00:08:17.723
But you'd think that when
I wake up every morning,

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:21.129
I wouldn't roll over and look at her
and think, "She's going to say,

00:08:21.153 --> 00:08:23.767
'Who are you, and who gave you
that side of the bed?'

00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:24.839
(Laughter)

00:08:24.863 --> 00:08:26.046
'Get out of here.'"

00:08:26.522 --> 00:08:28.133
But she doesn't.

00:08:28.157 --> 00:08:31.029
And I think she sometimes
feels the same way.
