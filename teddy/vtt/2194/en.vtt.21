00:10:29.457 --> 00:10:30.496
(Laughter)

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.936
and it got truly bizarre.

00:10:32.586 --> 00:10:35.282
And I remember thinking to myself,

00:10:35.306 --> 00:10:39.461
"Shit. I've kind of started something here
and I can't really get out.

00:10:39.485 --> 00:10:42.451
If I abandon the situation,

00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:45.318
I'm going to sort of set back
renewables in Australia

00:10:45.342 --> 00:10:47.566
and maybe just look like a complete idiot

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.103
because of my idiocy on Twitter."

00:10:50.127 --> 00:10:52.213
So I thought the only thing I could do

00:10:52.237 --> 00:10:54.679
was to try not to freeze
and to try to learn.

00:10:54.703 --> 00:10:56.318
So I spent a week

00:10:56.342 --> 00:10:59.792
trying to learn everything I could
about industrial-scale batteries

00:10:59.816 --> 00:11:03.262
and the electricity grid and renewables
and the economics of all of this
