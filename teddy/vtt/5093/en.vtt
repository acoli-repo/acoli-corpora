00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.305
We all start life as one single cell.

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:19.956
Then that cell divides and we are two cells,

00:00:19.956 --> 00:00:20.780
then four,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.855
then eight.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:22.957
Cells form tissues,

00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:24.133
tissues form organs,

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.058
organs form us.

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:29.007
These cell divisions, by which we go from a single cell

00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:30.874
to 100 trillion cells,
