00:00:00.596 --> 00:00:05.316
The last time I addressed
this august TED crowd was in 2019

00:00:05.316 --> 00:00:08.316
from the main stage in Vancouver,

00:00:08.356 --> 00:00:12.796
where I was giving my first TED Talk
on the case for having children.

00:00:13.236 --> 00:00:18.356
And that's where I shared the news
I had just received earlier in the week

00:00:18.396 --> 00:00:21.036
that my then two-year-old
daughter, Nusayba,

00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:26.636
was diagnosed with stage IV cancer
and needed a full liver transplant.

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:30.836
So how have your past three years been?
