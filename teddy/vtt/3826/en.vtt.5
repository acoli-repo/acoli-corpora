The lines of the paper, when magnified,

00:02:30.364 --> 00:02:32.324
are revealed to be micro-printed text

00:02:32.348 --> 00:02:37.094
that contains the details, the names,
the dates and locations

00:02:37.118 --> 00:02:39.840
of individual Iraqi civilians that died.

00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:46.348
So, for the last 5 years, I've been taking
pads of this paper, tons of this stuff,

00:02:46.372 --> 00:02:49.816
and smuggling it
into the stationery supplies

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.531
of the United States
and the Coalition governments.

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:53.642
(Laughter)

00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:58.631
(Applause)
