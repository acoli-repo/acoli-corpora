WEBVTT

00:04:29.047 --> 00:04:34.086
contains the details of Iraqi civilians
that died as result of the invasion.

00:04:38.115 --> 00:04:42.291
I'd like you to use this paper
and write a member of government.

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:46.157
You can help to smuggle
this civilian body count

00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:48.164
into government archives.

00:04:49.084 --> 00:04:52.505
Because every letter
that's sent in to the government,

00:04:53.053 --> 00:04:55.451
and this is all across
the world, of course --

00:04:55.475 --> 00:04:59.790
every letter that is sent in
is archived, filed and recorded.
