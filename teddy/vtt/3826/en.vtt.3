Monuments to war,
such as Maya Lin's Vietnam Memorial,

00:01:30.928 --> 00:01:32.729
are often enormous in scale.

00:01:32.753 --> 00:01:35.626
Very powerful and very one-sided.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.753
I wanted my monument to live
in the world, and to circulate.

00:01:42.642 --> 00:01:45.413
I remember when I was a boy in school,

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:49.358
my teacher assigned us
this classic civics assignment

00:01:49.382 --> 00:01:53.545
where you take a sheet of paper
and you write a member of your government.

00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:56.594
And we were told,
if we wrote a really good letter,

00:01:56.618 --> 00:01:58.092
if we really thought about it,

00:01:58.116 --> 00:02:01.381
we would get back more than just
a simple formed letter as a reply.
