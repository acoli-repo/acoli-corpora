00:00:58.744 --> 00:01:01.006
And someone told me --
I was eight years old --

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.730
someone told me that when
they were done with those tubs,

00:01:03.754 --> 00:01:05.968
they washed them out
and kept them in the back,

00:01:05.992 --> 00:01:07.946
and if you asked they would give you one.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.404
It took me a couple of weeks
to work up the courage,

00:01:10.428 --> 00:01:11.579
but I did, and they did.

00:01:11.603 --> 00:01:14.916
They gave me one -- I went home
with this beautiful cardboard tub.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.336
I was trying to figure out what
I could do with this exotic material --

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.745
metal ring, top and bottom.

00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:23.154
I started turning it over in my head,
and I realized, "Wait a minute --

00:01:23.178 --> 00:01:25.320
my head actually fits inside this thing."

00:01:25.344 --> 00:01:26.907
(Laughter)

00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:28.624
Yeah, I cut a hole out,

00:01:28.648 --> 00:01:30.167
I put some acetate in there
