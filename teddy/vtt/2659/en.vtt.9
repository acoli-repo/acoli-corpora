We drilled holes in the helmet
so that I could breathe,

00:04:32.584 --> 00:04:35.631
and I finished just in time
for Halloween and wore it to school.

00:04:35.655 --> 00:04:37.809
Now, this is the one thing in this talk

00:04:37.833 --> 00:04:39.650
that I don't have a slide to show you,

00:04:39.674 --> 00:04:41.676
because no photo exists of this armor.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.063
I did wear it to school,

00:04:43.087 --> 00:04:45.691
there was a yearbook photographer
patrolling the halls,

00:04:45.715 --> 00:04:49.105
but he never found me, for reasons
that are about to become clear.

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.207
There were things I didn't anticipate

00:04:51.231 --> 00:04:55.602
about wearing a complete suit
of aluminum armor to school.

00:04:56.061 --> 00:04:58.822
In third period math,
I was standing in the back of class,

00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:00.647
and I'm standing in the back of class
