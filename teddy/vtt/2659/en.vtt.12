00:05:57.523 --> 00:06:00.382
that costuming can play a key role
in this storytelling.

00:06:00.406 --> 00:06:04.441
I use costumes to add humor, comedy, color

00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:07.488
and narrative clarity
to the stories we're telling.

00:06:07.935 --> 00:06:10.694
And then we do an episode
called "Dumpster Diving,"

00:06:10.718 --> 00:06:12.985
and I learn a little bit more

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.440
about the deeper implications
of what costuming means to me.

00:06:16.464 --> 00:06:18.060
In the episode "Dumpster Diving,"

Is jumping into a dumpster as safe

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.706
as the movies would lead you to believe?

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.504
(Laughter)

00:06:25.528 --> 00:06:28.163
The episode was going to have
two distinct parts to it.

00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:31.242
One was where we get trained
to jump off buildings by a stuntman
