00:01:28.648 --> 00:01:30.167
I put some acetate in there

00:01:30.191 --> 00:01:31.905
and I made myself a space helmet.

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.082
(Laughter)

00:01:33.106 --> 00:01:36.066
I needed a place to wear the space helmet,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.794
so I found a refrigerator box
a couple blocks from home.

00:01:38.818 --> 00:01:40.105
I pushed it home,

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:42.897
and in my parents' guest room closet,

00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:45.312
I turned it into a spaceship.

00:01:45.336 --> 00:01:47.635
I started with a control panel
out of cardboard.

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.457
I cut a hole for a radar screen

00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:51.704
and put a flashlight
underneath it to light it.

00:01:51.728 --> 00:01:54.778
I put a view screen up,
which I offset off the back wall --

00:01:54.802 --> 00:01:57.435
and this is where I thought
I was being really clever --

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.506
without permission, I painted
the back wall of the closet black
