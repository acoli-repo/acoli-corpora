00:10:28.098 --> 00:10:30.362
and a lonely demon named No-Face.

00:10:30.386 --> 00:10:33.256
No-Face is lonely
and he wants to make friends,

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.445
and he thinks the way to do it
is by luring them to him

00:10:36.469 --> 00:10:38.539
and producing gold in his hand.

00:10:38.563 --> 00:10:40.314
But this doesn't go very well,

00:10:40.338 --> 00:10:43.155
and so he ends up going
on kind of a rampage

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:45.435
until Chihiro saves him,

00:10:45.459 --> 00:10:46.648
rescues him.

00:10:47.081 --> 00:10:49.616
So I put together a No-Face costume,

00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:52.988
and I wore it on the floor at Comic-Con.

00:10:53.012 --> 00:10:57.733
And I very carefully practiced
No-Face's gestures.

00:10:57.757 --> 00:11:01.371
I resolved I would not speak
in this costume at all.
