00:06:28.187 --> 00:06:31.242
One was where we get trained
to jump off buildings by a stuntman

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:32.599
into an air bag.

00:06:32.623 --> 00:06:35.104
And the second was the graduation
to the experiment:

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:37.973
we'd fill a dumpster full of material
and we'd jump into it.

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:40.284
I wanted to visually separate
these two elements,

00:06:40.308 --> 00:06:41.465
and I thought,

00:06:41.489 --> 00:06:45.173
"Well, for the first part we're training,
so we should wear sweatsuits --

00:06:45.197 --> 00:06:48.945
Oh! Let's put 'Stunt Trainee'
on the back of the sweatsuits.

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:50.313
That's for the training."

00:06:50.337 --> 00:06:53.702
But for the second part, I wanted
something really visually striking --

00:06:53.726 --> 00:06:56.204
"I know! I'll dress as Neo
from 'The Matrix.'"

00:06:56.228 --> 00:06:57.302
(Laughter)

00:06:57.326 --> 00:06:58.636
So I went to Haight Street.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.239
I bought some beautiful
knee-high, buckle boots.
