00:08:58.176 --> 00:09:00.002
it's called "cosplay."

00:09:00.026 --> 00:09:02.550
Now ostensibly, cosplay means
people who dress up

00:09:02.574 --> 00:09:05.137
as their favorite characters
from film and television

00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:06.345
and especially anime,

00:09:06.369 --> 00:09:09.110
but it is so much more than that.

00:09:09.134 --> 00:09:12.195
These aren't just people
who find a costume and put it on --

00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:13.616
they mash them up.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.100
They bend them to their will.

00:09:15.124 --> 00:09:18.916
They change them to be the characters
they want to be in those productions.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.856
They're super clever and genius.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.543
They let their freak flag fly
and it's beautiful.

00:09:23.567 --> 00:09:24.606
(Laughter)

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.781
But more than that,

00:09:25.805 --> 00:09:27.258
they rehearse their costumes.

00:09:27.282 --> 00:09:28.758
At Comic-Con or any other Con,

00:09:28.782 --> 00:09:31.329
you don't just take pictures
of people walking around.
