00:03:29.301 --> 00:03:33.478
And moreover, the knights in "Excalibur"
wear their armor everywhere.

00:03:33.502 --> 00:03:37.025
All the time -- they wear it at dinner,
they wear it to bed.

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.100
(Laughter)

00:03:38.124 --> 00:03:39.994
I was like, "Are they reading my mind?

00:03:40.018 --> 00:03:42.486
I want to wear armor all the time!"

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.525
(Laughter)

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.748
So I went back to my favorite material,

00:03:45.772 --> 00:03:47.321
the gateway drug for making,

00:03:47.345 --> 00:03:48.765
corrugated cardboard,

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:51.651
and I made myself a suit of armor,

00:03:51.675 --> 00:03:55.120
replete with the neck shields
and a white horse.

00:03:55.144 --> 00:03:56.410
Now that I've oversold it,

00:03:56.434 --> 00:03:58.460
here's a picture of the armor that I made.

00:03:58.484 --> 00:03:59.825
(Laughter)

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.299
(Applause)
