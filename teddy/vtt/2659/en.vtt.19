00:09:28.782 --> 00:09:31.329
you don't just take pictures
of people walking around.

00:09:31.353 --> 00:09:32.508
You go up and say,

00:09:32.532 --> 00:09:34.984
"Hey, I like your costume,
can I take your picture?"

00:09:35.008 --> 00:09:37.804
And then you give them time
to get into their pose.

00:09:37.828 --> 00:09:39.498
They've worked hard on their pose

00:09:39.522 --> 00:09:42.142
to make their costume look
great for your camera.

00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:44.656
And it's so beautiful to watch.

00:09:45.178 --> 00:09:46.609
And I take this to heart.

00:09:46.633 --> 00:09:48.139
At subsequent Cons,

00:09:48.163 --> 00:09:52.556
I learn Heath Ledger's shambling walk
as the Joker from "The Dark Knight."

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.630
I learn how to be a scary Ringwraith
from "Lord of the Rings,"

00:09:55.654 --> 00:09:57.715
and I actually frighten some children.

00:09:57.739 --> 00:09:59.639
I learned that "hrr hrr hrr" --

00:09:59.663 --> 00:10:01.800
that head laugh that Chewbacca does.
