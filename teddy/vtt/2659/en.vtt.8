(Applause)

00:04:04.736 --> 00:04:07.327
Now, this is only the first
suit of armor I made

00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:08.695
inspired by "Excalibur."

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:09.972
A couple of years later,

00:04:09.996 --> 00:04:14.094
I convinced my dad to embark
on making me a proper suit of armor.

00:04:14.118 --> 00:04:15.763
Over about a month,

00:04:15.787 --> 00:04:20.081
he graduated me from cardboard
to roofing aluminum called flashing

00:04:20.105 --> 00:04:22.921
and still, one of my all-time favorite
attachment materials,

00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:24.112
POP rivets.

00:04:24.136 --> 00:04:25.848
We carefully, over that month,

00:04:25.872 --> 00:04:28.446
constructed an articulated suit
of aluminum armor

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.631
with compound curves.

00:04:29.655 --> 00:04:32.560
We drilled holes in the helmet
so that I could breathe,
