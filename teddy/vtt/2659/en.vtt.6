00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:00.524
(Laughter)

00:03:00.548 --> 00:03:01.951
And I loved it.

00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:03.802
A couple years later,

00:03:03.826 --> 00:03:06.643
my dad took me to a film
called "Excalibur."

00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:08.709
I actually got him to take me to it twice,

00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:13.000
which is no small thing,
because it is a hard, R-rated film.

00:03:13.024 --> 00:03:15.180
But it wasn't the blood
and guts or the boobs

00:03:15.204 --> 00:03:17.101
that made me want to go see it again.

00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:18.283
They helped --

00:03:18.307 --> 00:03:19.309
(Laughter)

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:20.498
It was the armor.

00:03:20.522 --> 00:03:24.636
The armor in "Excalibur"
was intoxicatingly beautiful to me.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.277
These were literally knights
in shining, mirror-polished armor.

00:03:29.301 --> 00:03:33.478
And moreover, the knights in "Excalibur"
wear their armor everywhere.
