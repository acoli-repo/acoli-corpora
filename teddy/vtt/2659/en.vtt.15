00:07:29.623 --> 00:07:30.773
(Laughter)

00:07:31.328 --> 00:07:34.548
But the producer in my mind reminds myself

00:07:34.572 --> 00:07:36.999
that in the high-speed shot in slow-mo,

00:07:37.023 --> 00:07:40.116
that flowing coat is going to look
beautiful behind me.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:41.290
(Laughter)

00:07:42.012 --> 00:07:43.883
Five years into the "MythBusters" run,

00:07:43.907 --> 00:07:46.563
we got invited to appear
at San Diego Comic-Con.

00:07:46.587 --> 00:07:49.983
I'd known about Comic-Con for years
and never had time to go.

00:07:50.007 --> 00:07:53.611
This was the big leagues --
this was costuming mecca.

00:07:53.635 --> 00:07:55.675
People fly in from all over the world

00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:58.821
to show their amazing creations
on the floor in San Diego.

00:07:58.845 --> 00:08:00.370
And I wanted to participate.
