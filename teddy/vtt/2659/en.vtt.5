00:02:27.803 --> 00:02:31.938
she blew my freaking mind
by giving me this "Jaws" costume.

00:02:32.365 --> 00:02:34.765
Now, I recognize it's a bit of a trope

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:36.662
for people of a certain age to complain

00:02:36.686 --> 00:02:40.222
that kids these days have no idea
how good they have it,

00:02:40.246 --> 00:02:42.291
but let me just show you a random sampling

00:02:42.315 --> 00:02:46.013
of entry-level kids' costumes
you can buy online right now ...

00:02:46.037 --> 00:02:49.859
... and this is the "Jaws" costume
my mom bought for me.

00:02:49.883 --> 00:02:52.615
(Laughter)

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.890
This is a paper-thin shark face

00:02:55.914 --> 00:02:59.452
and a vinyl bib with the poster
of "Jaws" on it.

00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:00.524
(Laughter)
