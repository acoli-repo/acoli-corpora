00:09:59.663 --> 00:10:01.800
that head laugh that Chewbacca does.

00:10:02.625 --> 00:10:05.599
And then I dressed up as
No-Face from "Spirited Away."

00:10:05.623 --> 00:10:09.074
If you don't know about "Spirited Away"
and its director, Hayao Miyazaki,

00:10:09.098 --> 00:10:10.549
first of all, you're welcome.

00:10:10.573 --> 00:10:11.723
(Laughter)

00:10:12.136 --> 00:10:15.576
This is a masterpiece,
and one of my all-time favorite films.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.943
It's about a young girl named Chihiro
who gets lost in the spirit world

00:10:19.967 --> 00:10:22.300
in an abandoned Japanese theme park.

00:10:22.324 --> 00:10:24.220
And she finds her way back out again

00:10:24.244 --> 00:10:26.560
with the help of a couple
of friends she makes --

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.074
a captured dragon named Haku

00:10:28.098 --> 00:10:30.362
and a lonely demon named No-Face.
