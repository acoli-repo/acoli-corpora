00:08:27.031 --> 00:08:30.762
I even had contact lenses made
in my prescription.

00:08:30.786 --> 00:08:33.116
I wore it onto the floor at Comic-Con

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:37.769
and I can't even tell you
how balls hot it was in that costume.

00:08:37.793 --> 00:08:38.833
(Laughter)

00:08:38.857 --> 00:08:40.892
Sweating! I should've remembered this.

00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:43.805
I'm sweating buckets
and the contact lenses hurt my eyes,

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:47.378
and none of it matters
because I'm totally in love.

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:48.552
(Laughter)

00:08:49.066 --> 00:08:52.629
Not just with the process of putting
on this costume and walking the floor,

00:08:52.653 --> 00:08:56.232
but also with the community
of other costumers.

00:08:56.256 --> 00:08:58.152
It's not called costuming at Cons,

00:08:58.176 --> 00:09:00.002
it's called "cosplay."
