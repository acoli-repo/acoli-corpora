There's this fact that I love
that I read somewhere once,

00:00:03.476 --> 00:00:08.126
that one of the things that's contributed
to homo sapiens' success

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.493
as a species

00:00:09.517 --> 00:00:11.573
is our lack of body hair --

00:00:11.597 --> 00:00:14.021
that our hairlessness, our nakedness

00:00:14.045 --> 00:00:16.351
combined with our invention of clothing,

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:19.669
gives us the ability to modulate
our body temperature

00:00:19.693 --> 00:00:23.289
and thus be able to survive
in any climate we choose.

00:00:23.797 --> 00:00:27.322
And now we've evolved to the point
where we can't survive without clothing.

00:00:27.346 --> 00:00:28.876
And it's more than just utility,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.221
now it's a communication.
