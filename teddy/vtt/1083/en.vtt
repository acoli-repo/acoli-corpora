00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.976
My name is Joseph,
a Member of Parliament in Kenya.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.975
Picture a Maasai village,

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:06.166
and one evening,

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:08.975
government soldiers come,
surround the village

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.191
and ask each elder to bring
one boy to school.

00:00:11.215 --> 00:00:12.976
That's how I went to school --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
pretty much a government guy
pointing a gun

00:00:15.024 --> 00:00:17.263
and told my father,
"You have to make a choice."

00:00:17.287 --> 00:00:19.976
I walked very comfortably
to this missionary school,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.976
that was run by an American missionary.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.976
The first thing the American missionary
gave me was a candy.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.976
I had never in my life ever tasted candy.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.620
So I said to myself,
with all these hundred other boys,

00:00:29.644 --> 00:00:31.005
this is where I belong.
