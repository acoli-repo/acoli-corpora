00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:12.144
Chak Ek’ rose from the underworld 
to the surface of the eastern sea

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:14.324
and on into the heavens.

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:17.524
His brother K’in Ahaw followed.

00:00:17.524 --> 00:00:22.604
Though Chak Ek’ had risen first, 
K’in Ahaw outshone him,

00:00:22.604 --> 00:00:26.468
and the resentful Chak Ek’ descended back
to the underworld

00:00:26.468 --> 00:00:28.889
to plot against his brother.

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:36.189
In Mayan mythology, Chak Ek’ represents 
Venus and K’in Ahaw represents the sun.
