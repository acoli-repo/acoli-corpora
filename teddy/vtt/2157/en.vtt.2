Jump!

00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:03.298
Now, if you know how the trick is done,

00:01:03.322 --> 00:01:04.918
where is the illusion?

00:01:04.942 --> 00:01:10.447
But still, our imagination
is more powerful than our reasoning,

00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:15.707
and it's easy to attribute
personality to machines.

00:01:16.204 --> 00:01:18.630
These are quadcopters.

00:01:18.654 --> 00:01:22.446
But they are more than
mechanical flying machines.

00:01:22.888 --> 00:01:25.096
They analyze the environment around them

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.845
and react to everything I do.

00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:35.945
At once, algorithms allow these autonomous
machines to fly in close formation,
