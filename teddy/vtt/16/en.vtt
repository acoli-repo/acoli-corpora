00:00:00.896 --> 00:00:04.642
We know more about
other planets than our own,

00:00:05.446 --> 00:00:08.670
and today, I want to show you
a new type of robot

00:00:08.693 --> 00:00:12.733
designed to help us
better understand our own planet.

00:00:13.408 --> 00:00:15.020
It belongs to a category

00:00:15.044 --> 00:00:19.998
known in the oceanographic community
as an unmanned surface vehicle, or USV.

00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:22.595
And it uses no fuel.

00:00:23.047 --> 00:00:26.981
Instead, it relies
on wind power for propulsion.

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:30.760
And yet, it can sail around the globe
for months at a time.
