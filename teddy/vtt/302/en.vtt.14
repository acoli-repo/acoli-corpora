00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
You're going to see people be born and die --

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
dots will appear and disappear --

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
ties will form and break, marriages and divorces,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
friendings and defriendings.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
A lot of complexity, a lot is happening

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
just in this 30-year period

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
that includes the obesity epidemic.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And, by the end, you're going to see clusters

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
of obese and non-obese individuals

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
within the network.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Now, when looked at this,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
it changed the way I see things,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
because this thing, this network

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
that's changing across time,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
it has a memory, it moves,
