00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
for instance, in the first year.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And I had gone to take care of one particular patient,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
a woman who was dying of dementia.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And in this case, unlike this couple,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
she was being cared for

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
by her daughter.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And the daughter's husband,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
he also was sick

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
from his wife's exhaustion.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And I was driving home one day,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and I get a phone call from the husband's friend,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
calling me because he was depressed

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
about what was happening to his friend.
