00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the increase in the probability that a person is obese

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
given that a social contact of theirs is obese

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and, on the X-axis, the degrees of separation between the two people.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
On the far left, you see the purple line.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
It says that, if your friends are obese,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
your risk of obesity is 45 percent higher.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And the next bar over, the [red] line,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
says if your friend's friends are obese,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
your risk of obesity is 25 percent higher.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And then the next line over says

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
if your friend's friend's friend, someone you probably don't even know, is obese,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
your risk of obesity is 10 percent higher.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And it's only when you get to your friend's friend's friend's friends

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
that there's no longer a relationship
