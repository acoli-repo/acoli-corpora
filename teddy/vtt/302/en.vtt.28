00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
can also be attributed to their genes.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So whether you find yourself in the middle or on the edge

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
is also partially heritable.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Now, what is the point of this?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
How does this help us understand?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
How does this help us

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
figure out some of the problems that are affecting us these days?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Well, the argument I'd like to make is that networks have value.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
They are a kind of social capital.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
New properties emerge

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
because of our embeddedness in social networks,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and these properties inhere
