00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Could emotion spread,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
in a more sustained way than riots, across time

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and involve large numbers of people,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
not just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Maybe there's a kind of below the surface, quiet riot

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
that animates us all the time.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Maybe there are emotional stampedes

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
that ripple through social networks.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Maybe, in fact, emotions have a collective existence,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
not just an individual existence.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And this is one of the first images we made to study this phenomenon.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Again, a social network,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
but now we color the people yellow if they're happy

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and blue if they're sad and green in between.
