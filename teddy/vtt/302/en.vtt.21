I'm connected to you and you to her, on out endlessly into the distance --

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
this fabric is actually like

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
an old-fashioned American quilt,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and it has patches on it: happy and unhappy patches.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And whether you become happy or not

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
(Laughter)

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So, this work with emotions,

which are so fundamental,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
then got us to thinking about: Maybe

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
the fundamental causes of human social networks

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
are somehow encoded in our genes.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Because human social networks, whenever they are mapped,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
always kind of look like this:
