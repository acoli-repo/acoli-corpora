00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
because it confounds our ability to figure out what's going on.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And here, the idea is not that my weight gain

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
is causing your weight gain,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
nor that I preferentially form a tie with you

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
because you and I share the same body size,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
but rather that we share a common exposure

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
to something, like a health club

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that makes us both lose weight at the same time.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
When we studied these data, we found evidence for all of these things,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
including for induction.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And we found that if your friend becomes obese,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
it increases your risk of obesity by about 57 percent

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
in the same given time period.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
There can be many mechanisms for this effect:
