00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that there are clusters of obese and

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
non-obese people in the image.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
But the visual complexity is still very high.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It's not obvious exactly what's going on.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
In addition, some questions are immediately raised:

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
How much clustering is there?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
How big are the clusters? How far do they reach?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And, most importantly,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
what causes the clusters?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
This here shows, on the Y-axis,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the increase in the probability that a person is obese

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
given that a social contact of theirs is obese
