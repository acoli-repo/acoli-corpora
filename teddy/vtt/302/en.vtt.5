00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
we began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and could it spread from person to person

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
like the four people I discussed earlier.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So this is a slide of some of our initial results.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It's 2,200 people in the year 2000.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Every dot is a person. We make the dot size

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
proportional to people's body size;

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
so bigger dots are bigger people.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
In addition, if your body size,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
if your BMI, your body mass index, is above 30 --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
if you're clinically obese --

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
we also colored the dots yellow.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So, if you look at this image, right away you might be able to see

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that there are clusters of obese and
