An idea is spreading.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Now, headline writers

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
had a field day with our studies.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I think the headline in The New York Times was,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
"Are you packing it on?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Blame your fat friends." (Laughter)

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
What was interesting to us is that the European headline writers

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
had a different take: They said,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
"Are your friends gaining weight? Perhaps you are to blame."

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
(Laughter)

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And we thought this was a very interesting comment on America,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and a kind of self-serving,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
"not my responsibility" kind of phenomenon.
