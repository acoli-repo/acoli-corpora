00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and these properties inhere

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
in the structure of the networks,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
not just in the individuals within them.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
So think about these two common objects.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
They're both made of carbon,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
that are arranged in one particular way -- on the left --

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
and you get graphite, which is soft and dark.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
But if you take the same carbon atoms

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and interconnect them a different way,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
you get diamond, which is clear and hard.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And those properties of softness and hardness and darkness and clearness

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
do not reside in the carbon atoms;

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
they reside in the interconnections between the carbon atoms,
