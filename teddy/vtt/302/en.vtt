00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For me, this story begins about 15 years ago,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
when I was a hospice doctor at the University of Chicago.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And I was taking care of people who were dying and their families

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in the South Side of Chicago.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And I was observing what happened to people and their families

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
over the course of their terminal illness.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And in my lab, I was studying the widower effect,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which is a very old idea in the social sciences,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
going back 150 years,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
known as "dying of a broken heart."

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So, when I die, my wife's risk of death can double,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
for instance, in the first year.
