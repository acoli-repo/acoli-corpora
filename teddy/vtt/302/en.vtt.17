00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And, not only can they read them, but they copy them.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
There's emotional contagion

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
that takes place in human populations.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And so this function of emotions

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
suggests that, in addition to any other purpose they serve,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
they're a kind of primitive form of communication.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And that, in fact, if we really want to understand human emotions,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
we need to think about them in this way.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Now, we're accustomed to thinking about emotions in this way,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
in simple, sort of, brief periods of time.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So, for example,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I was giving this talk recently in New York City,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and I said, "You know when you're on the subway

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and the other person across the subway car
