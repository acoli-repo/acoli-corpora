00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
always kind of look like this:

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
the picture of the network.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
But they never look like this.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Why do they not look like this?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Why don't we form human social networks

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
that look like a regular lattice?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Well, the striking patterns of human social networks,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
their ubiquity and their apparent purpose

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
beg questions about whether we evolved to have

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
human social networks in the first place,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
and whether we evolved to form networks

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
with a particular structure.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And notice first of all -- so, to understand this, though,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
we need to dissect network structure a little bit first --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and notice that every person in this network
