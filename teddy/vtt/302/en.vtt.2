00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
about what was happening to his friend.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So here I get this call from this random guy

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that's having an experience

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that's being influenced by people

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
at some social distance.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And so I suddenly realized two very simple things:

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
First, the widowhood effect

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
was not restricted to husbands and wives.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And second, it was not restricted to pairs of people.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And I started to see the world

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in a whole new way,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
like pairs of people connected to each other.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And then I realized that these individuals

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby.
