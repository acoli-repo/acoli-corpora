00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
C and D both have six friends.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
If you talk to them, and you said, "What is your social life like?"

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
they would say, "I've got six friends.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
That's my social experience."

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
But now we, with a bird's eye view looking at this network,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
can see that they occupy very different social worlds.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And I can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you:

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Who would you rather be

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
if a deadly germ was spreading through the network?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Would you rather be C or D?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
You'd rather be D, on the edge of the network.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And now who would you rather be

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
if a juicy piece of gossip -- not about you --

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
was spreading through the network? (Laughter)
