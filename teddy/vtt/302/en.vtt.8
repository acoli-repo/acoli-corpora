00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
that there's no longer a relationship

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
between that person's body size and your own body size.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Well, what might be causing this clustering?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
There are at least three possibilities:

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
One possibility is that, as I gain weight,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
it causes you to gain weight.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
A kind of induction, a kind of spread from person to person.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Another possibility, very obvious, is homophily,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
or, birds of a feather flock together;

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
here, I form my tie to you

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
because you and I share a similar body size.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And the last possibility is what is known as confounding,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
because it confounds our ability to figure out what's going on.
