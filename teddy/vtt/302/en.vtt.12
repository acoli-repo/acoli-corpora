00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
"not my responsibility" kind of phenomenon.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Now, I want to be very clear: We do not think our work

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
should or could justify prejudice

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
against people of one or another body size at all.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Our next questions was:

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Could we actually visualize this spread?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Was weight gain in one person actually spreading

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
to weight gain in another person?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And this was complicated because

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
the architecture of the ties, was changing across time.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
In addition, because obesity is not a unicentric epidemic,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
there's not a Patient Zero of the obesity epidemic --
