00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
There can be many mechanisms for this effect:

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
One possibility is that your friends say to you something like --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
you know, they adopt a behavior that spreads to you --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
like, they say, "Let's go have muffins and beer,"

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
which is a terrible combination. (Laughter)

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
But you adopt that combination,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and then you start gaining weight like them.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Another more subtle possibility

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
is that they start gaining weight, and it changes your ideas

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
of what an acceptable body size is.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Here, what's spreading from person to person

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
is not a behavior, but rather a norm:

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
An idea is spreading.
