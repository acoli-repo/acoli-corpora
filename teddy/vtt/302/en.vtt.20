00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
but now we color the people yellow if they're happy

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and blue if they're sad and green in between.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And if you look at this image, you can right away see

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
clusters of happy and unhappy people,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
again, spreading to three degrees of separation.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And you might form the intuition

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
that the unhappy people

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
occupy a different structural location within the network.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
There's a middle and an edge to this network,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and the unhappy people seem to be

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
located at the edges.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So to invoke another metaphor,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
if you imagine social networks as a kind of

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
vast fabric of humanity --

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I'm connected to you and you to her, on out endlessly into the distance --
