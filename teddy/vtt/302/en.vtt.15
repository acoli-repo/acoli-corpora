00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
that's changing across time,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
it has a memory, it moves,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
things flow within it,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
it has a kind of consistency --

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
people can die, but it doesn't die;

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
it still persists --

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and it has a kind of resilience

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that allows it to persist across time.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And so, I came to see these kinds of social networks

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
as living things,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
as living things that we could put under a kind of microscope

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
to study and analyze and understand.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And we used a variety of techniques to do this.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena.
