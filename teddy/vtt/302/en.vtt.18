00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and I said, "You know when you're on the subway

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and the other person across the subway car

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
smiles at you,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and you just instinctively smile back?"

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And they looked at me and said, "We don't do that in New York City." (Laughter)

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And I said, "Everywhere else in the world,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
that's normal human behavior."

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And so there's a very instinctive way

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
in which we briefly transmit emotions to each other.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And, in fact, emotional contagion can be broader still.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Like we could have punctuated expressions of anger,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
as in riots.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
The question that we wanted to ask was:

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Could emotion spread,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
in a more sustained way than riots, across time
