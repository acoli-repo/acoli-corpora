So, social networks are these intricate things of beauty,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and they're so elaborate and so complex

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and so ubiquitous, in fact,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that one has to ask what purpose they serve.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Why are we embedded in social networks?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I mean, how do they form? How do they operate?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And how do they effect us?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So my first topic with respect to this,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
was not death, but obesity.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
It had become trendy

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
to speak about the "obesity epidemic."

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And, along with my collaborator, James Fowler,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
we began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic
