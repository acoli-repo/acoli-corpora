00:00:00.607 --> 00:00:03.319
So I was trained to become a gymnast

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.975
for two years in Hunan, China in the 1970s.

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:09.520
When I was in the first grade, the government

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.127
wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes,

00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:14.175
all expenses paid.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:16.823
But my tiger mother said, "No."

00:00:16.823 --> 00:00:18.959
My parents wanted me to become

00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:21.063
an engineer like them.

00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:23.150
After surviving the Cultural Revolution,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.959
they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness:

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:29.892
a safe and well-paid job.

00:00:29.892 --> 00:00:32.687
It is not important if I like the job or not.
