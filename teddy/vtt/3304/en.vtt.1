Arunabha Ghosh: Let me tell you
a story from China.

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:46.476
In 2014, China declared war on pollution.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.101
In November that year,

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:50.184
there was an international summit there.

00:00:50.208 --> 00:00:53.393
Presidents and prime ministers
from many countries arrived.

00:00:53.417 --> 00:00:55.934
So industries around Beijing
were shut down,

00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.059
half the cars were taken off the road.

00:00:58.083 --> 00:01:03.101
That week, I took a photograph
of the unusually blue sky in Beijing.
