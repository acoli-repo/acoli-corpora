00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:32.393
city dweller or village folk,

00:02:32.417 --> 00:02:34.768
those living inland
or those living on the coast,

00:02:34.792 --> 00:02:36.934
and it's affecting our health,

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:39.726
our economic growth, our quality of life.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.851
In 2017, more than
1.2 million deaths in India

00:02:44.875 --> 00:02:46.768
were attributable to air pollution.

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:49.559
That's more than those deaths
caused by HIV/AIDS,

00:02:49.583 --> 00:02:52.059
tuberculosis, malaria or diarrhea.

00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:55.518
At the Council on Energy,
Environment and Water,

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:59.726
my colleagues find that today,
one in two Indians is breathing air

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.059
that does not meet
our air quality standards.
