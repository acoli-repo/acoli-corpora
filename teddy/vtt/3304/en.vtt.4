for a face wash,

00:02:00.083 --> 00:02:04.226
which claimed that the polluting particles
lodged deeply in our skin

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.518

When it's difficult

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:16.434

Air pollution is the great leveler.

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:28.434
It affects us all,

00:02:28.458 --> 00:02:29.809
rich and poor,

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:32.393
city dweller or village folk,
