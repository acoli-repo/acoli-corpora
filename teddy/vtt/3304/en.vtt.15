00:07:27.708 --> 00:07:30.476
that landfills can be
eliminated altogether.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.976
Now I'm not saying that officials
have no responsibility here,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.434
but it is our collective apathy

00:07:37.458 --> 00:07:40.893
that takes the pressure
off of our parliamentarians,

00:07:40.917 --> 00:07:42.643
the bureaucrats

00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:44.726
or the enforcement agencies.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.726
Mission 80-80-80 will only begin

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.208
when we demand it.

00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:54.893
We have to create
a democratic demand for clean air,

00:07:54.917 --> 00:07:58.851
because citizens, you and me,

00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:01.625
can decide what kind of air we breathe.
