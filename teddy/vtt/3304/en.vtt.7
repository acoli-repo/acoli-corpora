00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:30.684
can we ensure that, by then,

00:03:30.708 --> 00:03:35.643
80 cities in India have reduced
air pollution by 80 percent?

00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:39.934
Let's called this Mission 80-80-80,

00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:41.268
and this is possible,

00:03:41.292 --> 00:03:43.893
but the role of citizens
is going to be critical.

00:03:43.917 --> 00:03:45.934
To combat air pollution,

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:50.018
we have to create a democratic demand

00:03:50.042 --> 00:03:51.434
for clean air.

00:03:51.458 --> 00:03:53.351
We can make this happen.

00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:56.518
First, we have to educate ourselves.

00:03:56.542 --> 00:04:00.684
Low-cost sensors give us real-time
information about the air quality,
