That week, I took a photograph
of the unusually blue sky in Beijing.

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:06.309
A few days later,
when the summit had ended,

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.393
the factories were humming again,

00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:11.101
the sky had again turned light grey.

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:13.559
So newspapers started
urging the government

00:01:13.583 --> 00:01:16.768
to make the blue skies permanent.

00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:21.893
Then in early 2015, a private citizen
produced a documentary on air pollution

00:01:21.917 --> 00:01:23.559
called "Under the Dome."

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:28.101
Just within four days,
it was viewed 300 million times,

00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:31.434
and millions more continued
discussing it on social media.
