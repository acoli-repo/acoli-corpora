WEBVTT

00:06:29.167 --> 00:06:32.684
that it's the combination
of our agricultural policy

00:06:32.708 --> 00:06:34.018
and our groundwater crisis

00:06:34.042 --> 00:06:38.226
that often leaves the farmer
with no option but to burn the stubble.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.601
So we need to draw in
the urban poor laborer

00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:43.184
or the rural poor farmer

00:06:43.208 --> 00:06:46.268
into our collective call for clean air.

00:06:46.292 --> 00:06:50.309
Farmers come and tell us that they
want to adopt sustainable agriculture,

00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:51.684
but they need some help.

00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:56.809
And fifth, we have to
change our lifestyles.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.976
Yes, public transport
is often not available,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.809
but the choice to buy a cleaner,
less polluting private vehicle is ours.
