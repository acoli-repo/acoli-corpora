00:05:57.917 --> 00:06:03.101
As citizens, we have to reduce
the demand for these polluting products

00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:06.250
or be prepared to pay more
for cleaner products.

00:06:07.208 --> 00:06:11.250
Fourth step: let's build some empathy
for our fellow citizens.

00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:15.059
How much does it take
to keep a night guard warm

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:18.851
rather than force them to burn rubbish
to stay warm in winter?

00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:20.184
Or, let's take farmers.

00:06:20.208 --> 00:06:23.226
You know, it's very easy to blame them
for burning the stubble

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.768
of the rice paddy crop every winter,
which causes air pollution.

00:06:26.792 --> 00:06:29.143
It's much harder to understand

00:06:29.167 --> 00:06:32.684
that it's the combination
of our agricultural policy
