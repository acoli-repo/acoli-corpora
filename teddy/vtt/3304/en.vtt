Shah Rukh Khan: Something goes wrong
with the air that we take for granted.

00:00:05.042 --> 00:00:06.809
The ill effects are suffered by all,

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:09.559
rich and poor, city people
and village folks,

00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:11.476
those inland and those on the coast.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.226
Nobody is exempt.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.018
So how do we give our children
the chance to grow up in a world

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:18.726
where the air is clean?

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.184
Our next speaker
addresses this vital question.

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:24.101
So join me in giving
a wholehearted welcome

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:26.893
to the public policy expert and author,

00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:30.643
the multifaceted Dr. Arunabha Ghosh.
