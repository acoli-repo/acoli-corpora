00:03:56.542 --> 00:04:00.684
Low-cost sensors give us real-time
information about the air quality,

00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:02.768
but we still need information

00:04:02.792 --> 00:04:06.059
about how to interpret it and how to act.

00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:09.518
So we need to target information
to schools and children,

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:11.559
to resident welfare associations,

00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:13.893
to the elderly, who are more at risk.

00:04:13.917 --> 00:04:17.309
You know, when the temperature outside
is 30 degrees versus 40 degrees,

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:19.059
we know how to dress,

00:04:19.083 --> 00:04:20.809
we know what to do, what not to do.

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:24.809
We need, similarly, information
on what precautions to take

00:04:24.833 --> 00:04:26.601
when the air quality outside is poor,

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:29.250
very poor, severe or hazardous.

00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:35.018
Second, we need to become active monitors.
