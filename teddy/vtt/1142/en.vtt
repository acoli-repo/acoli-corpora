00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So I want to tell you a story -- an encouraging story --

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
about addressing

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
desperation, depression and despair in Afghanistan,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and what we have learned from it,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and how to help people

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to overcome traumatic experiences

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and how to help them to regain some confidence

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in the time ahead -- in the future --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and how to participate again in everyday life.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and I went to Afghanistan in January 2004, by chance,
