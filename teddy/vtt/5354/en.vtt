00:00:00.952 --> 00:00:04.103
Let's put the care back into health care.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.511
I've been working in the healthcare sector
for the last 15 years,

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:10.912
and one of the things
that drew me to this sector

00:00:10.936 --> 00:00:15.154
was my interest in the care component
of our healthcare systems --

00:00:15.178 --> 00:00:16.517
more specifically,

00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:19.154
to the invaluable role played by carers.

00:00:20.173 --> 00:00:23.838
Now, how many of you in this room
consider yourself a carer?

00:00:26.473 --> 00:00:29.072
By this, I mean how many of you
have cared for someone

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:32.723
suffering from an illness,
injury or disability?
