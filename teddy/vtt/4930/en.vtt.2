This ensures constant water 
and lush grass in summer,

00:01:01.267 --> 00:01:04.617
and protection from harsh winds in winter.

00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:07.787
The whole operation requires 
weeks of strict planning,

00:01:07.787 --> 00:01:11.317
liaising with the other camps in her 
domain, strategic delegation –

00:01:11.317 --> 00:01:15.447
and the patience to move at the speed 
of dawdling animals.

00:01:15.447 --> 00:01:17.475
Today is moving day,

00:01:17.475 --> 00:01:22.445
and she’ll have to direct throngs of her
ladies, commanders, slaves and animals

00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:25.091
up the river Volga for the summer.

00:01:25.091 --> 00:01:27.131
As Boraqchin steps outside,

00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:29.461
she’s greeted by a commotion –

00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:33.491
her unwanted visitor is now running 
circles around her stewards.
