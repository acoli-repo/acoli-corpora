00:01:57.161 --> 00:02:01.031
Next, Boraqchin and her woolly companion 
meet with the guards.

00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:04.971
She orders them to keep close watch
on her husband's special reception yurt

00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:08.101
and port-able throne during the journey.

00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:09.981
They’ll also act as outriders,

00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:13.291
and she tells them how to secure the 
route, surround her for safety –

00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:16.371
and keep the animals in check.

00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:19.731
But when the sheep finally breaks free 
and makes for the fields,

00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:21.341
the guards can barely keep up

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:24.801
as it scampers through crowds 
packing up their yurts.

00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:28.781
Exasperated, Boraqchin rides down 
to the pastures herself.

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:29.801
When she gets there,

00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:35.161
she catches sight of the troublesome sheep
wriggling into the middle of a flock.
