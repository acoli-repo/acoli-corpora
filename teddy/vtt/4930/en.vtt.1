00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.861
a huge kingdom in the Mongolian Empire,

00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:34.211
Boraqchin has a hands-on 
approach to ruling.

00:00:34.211 --> 00:00:36.131
She’s been married to Batu Khan,

00:00:36.131 --> 00:00:38.771
the fearsome grandson 
of Genghis Khan himself,

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:40.531
since she was fifteen –

00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:42.781
and while her husband is out on his raids,

00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:48.211
she juggles the duties of flocks, 
family and empire at home.

00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:52.784
This makes her the manager – 
and the mover – of a city of thousands.

00:00:52.784 --> 00:00:57.474
Twice a year, Boraqchin moves the city 
between two seasonal camping grounds.

00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:01.267
This ensures constant water 
and lush grass in summer,
