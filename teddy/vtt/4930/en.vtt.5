WEBVTT

00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:35.161
she catches sight of the troublesome sheep
wriggling into the middle of a flock.

00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:36.400
When she follows him in,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.390
he’s nestled next to a ewe, his mother.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.220
She’s pregnant,
and seems to be in pain.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.020
With a start, Boraqchin realizes 
that this ewe’s impending delivery

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.190
has been forgotten in 
the flurry of moving day.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.140
There’s no time to find a shepherd –

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.150
instead, Boraqchin rolls up her sleeves, 
greases her arm

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.180
and helps the ewe give birth to two new 
additions to the empire.
