00:00:06.659 --> 00:00:07.995
Studies have shown that

00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:10.198
taking vitamins is good for your health

00:00:10.198 --> 00:00:11.916

00:00:11.916 --> 00:00:14.417
That newly discovered herb can improve your memory

00:00:14.417 --> 00:00:16.086
or destroy your liver.

Headlines proclaim a promising new cancer treatment

00:00:18.453 --> 00:00:20.450
and never mention it again.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.866
On a daily basis,

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:25.722
backed up by scientific studies,

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:27.306
but what are these studies?

00:00:27.306 --> 00:00:28.654

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:30.392
And how do we know whether they're reliable?
