In 2016, I filmed
an episode of "Black Mirror"

00:00:06.627 --> 00:00:08.129
called "Nosedive."

00:00:08.171 --> 00:00:11.924
It's about a woman named Lacie
who lives in a futuristic world

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:15.219
where everyone rates
your social interactions.

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.516
And for anyone who hasn't seen it,
a little spoiler.

00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:24.604
I basically have a nervous breakdown,
trying really hard to get liked.

00:00:26.147 --> 00:00:29.317
For many, the episode
felt a little too familiar.
