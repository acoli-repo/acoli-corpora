00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
As an Indian, and now as a politician

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and a government minister,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I've become rather concerned about

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the hype we're hearing about our own country,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
all this talk about India becoming a world leader,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
even the next superpower.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In fact, the American publishers of my book,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
"The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cell Phone,"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
added a gratuitous subtitle saying,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
"India: The next 21st-century power."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And I just don't think that's what India's all about,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
or should be all about.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Indeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
seems to me terribly archaic.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's redolent of James Bond movies
