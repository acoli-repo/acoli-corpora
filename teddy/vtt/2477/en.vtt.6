00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.885
sitting next to the central passenger

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.615
not exactly having a great time.

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.825
And when we take a look
at that from the side,

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.842
you'll also notice those pathogens
spreading across the length of the cabin.

00:03:10.017 --> 00:03:12.367
The first thing I thought was,
"This is no good."

00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:15.899
So I actually conducted
more than 32 different simulations

00:03:15.923 --> 00:03:19.288
and ultimately, I came up
with this solution right here.

00:03:19.312 --> 00:03:22.828
This is what I call a -- patent pending --
Global Inlet Director.

00:03:22.852 --> 00:03:25.418
With this, we're able to reduce
pathogen transmission

00:03:25.442 --> 00:03:27.210
by about 55 times,

00:03:27.234 --> 00:03:30.387
and increase fresh-air inhalation
by about 190 percent.
