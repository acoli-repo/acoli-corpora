00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:01.017
so I decided to build a computer instead.

00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:04.313
It actually turns out that
with computational fluid dynamics,

00:02:04.337 --> 00:02:06.938
what we're able to do
is create these simulations

00:02:06.962 --> 00:02:08.756
that give us higher resolutions

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.400
than actually physically going
in and taking readings in the plane.

00:02:12.836 --> 00:02:15.850
And so how, essentially, this works
is you would start out

00:02:15.874 --> 00:02:17.546
with these 2D drawings --

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.698
these are floating around
in technical papers around the Internet.

00:02:20.722 --> 00:02:23.615
I take that and then I put it
into this 3D-modeling software,

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.418
really building that 3D model.

00:02:25.442 --> 00:02:29.901
And then I divide that model
that I just built into these tiny pieces,

00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:33.502
essentially meshing it so that
the computer can better understand it.
