00:00:59.504 --> 00:01:02.912
That's not exactly my idea
of a great superpower.

00:01:03.658 --> 00:01:06.222
When we take a look at this,
what we also find

00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:09.222
is that it's very difficult
to pre-screen for these diseases.

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.710
So when someone actually
goes on a plane,

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:12.940
they could be sick

00:01:12.964 --> 00:01:15.359
and they could actually
be in this latency period

00:01:15.383 --> 00:01:17.542
in which they could actually
have the disease

00:01:17.566 --> 00:01:19.138
but not exhibit any symptoms,

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:21.353
and they could, in turn,
spread the disease

00:01:21.377 --> 00:01:23.050
to many other people in the cabin.

00:01:23.074 --> 00:01:25.156
How that actually works is that right now

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.466
we've got air coming in
from the top of the cabin

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.916
and from the side of the cabin,
as you see in blue.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.142
And then also, that air goes out
through these very efficient filters
