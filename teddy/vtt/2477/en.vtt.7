00:03:27.234 --> 00:03:30.387
and increase fresh-air inhalation
by about 190 percent.

00:03:30.411 --> 00:03:32.015
So how this actually works

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:35.168
is we would install this piece
of composite material

00:03:35.192 --> 00:03:38.160
into these existing spots
that are already in the plane.

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:40.185
So it's very cost-effective to install

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.057
and we can do this directly overnight.

00:03:42.081 --> 00:03:45.629
All we have to do is put a couple
of screws in there and you're good to go.

00:03:45.653 --> 00:03:48.512
And the results that we get
are absolutely amazing.

00:03:48.536 --> 00:03:52.072
Instead of having those problematic
swirling airflow patterns,

00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:53.838
we can create these walls of air

00:03:53.862 --> 00:03:56.032
that come down in-between the passengers

00:03:56.056 --> 00:03:57.954
to create personalized breathing zones.

00:03:57.978 --> 00:04:00.963
So you'll notice the middle passenger
here is sneezing again,
