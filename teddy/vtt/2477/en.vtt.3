00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.142
And then also, that air goes out
through these very efficient filters

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:38.714
that eliminate 99.97 percent
of pathogens near the outlets.

00:01:39.444 --> 00:01:40.921
What happens right now, though,

00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:43.012
is that we have this
mixing airflow pattern.

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:44.868
So if someone were to actually sneeze,

00:01:44.892 --> 00:01:47.596
that air would get swirled
around multiple times

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.865
before it even has a chance
to go out through the filter.

00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:54.998
So I thought: clearly, this
is a pretty serious problem.

00:01:55.022 --> 00:01:58.755
I didn't have the money
to go out and buy a plane,

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:01.017
so I decided to build a computer instead.
