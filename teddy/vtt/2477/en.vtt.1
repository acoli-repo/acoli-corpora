00:00:29.747 --> 00:00:31.207
And it turns out that,

00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:34.061
although Ebola spreads
through these more range-limited,

00:00:34.085 --> 00:00:35.419
large-droplet routes,

00:00:35.443 --> 00:00:37.421
there's all these other sorts of diseases

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:39.421
that can be spread in the airplane cabin.

00:00:39.445 --> 00:00:42.629
The worst part is, when we take
a look at some of the numbers,

00:00:42.653 --> 00:00:44.066
it's pretty scary.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.850
So with H1N1,

00:00:45.874 --> 00:00:48.263
there was this guy that decided
to go on the plane

00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:50.058
and in the matter of a single flight

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:52.336
actually spread the disease
to 17 other people.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.488
And then there was this
other guy with SARS,

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:56.614
who managed to go on a three-hour flight

00:00:56.638 --> 00:00:59.480
and spread the disease to 22 other people.

00:00:59.504 --> 00:01:02.912
That's not exactly my idea
of a great superpower.
