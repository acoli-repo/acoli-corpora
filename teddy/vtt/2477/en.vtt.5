essentially meshing it so that
the computer can better understand it.

00:02:33.526 --> 00:02:37.247
And then I tell the computer where
the air goes in and out of the cabin,

00:02:37.271 --> 00:02:38.770

and basically sit there and wait until
the computer calculates the simulation.

00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:47.642
So what we get, actually,
with the conventional cabin is this:

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.913

00:02:50.767 --> 00:02:54.159

From the front, you'll notice

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.885
sitting next to the central passenger
