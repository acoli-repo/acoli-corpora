00:04:28.943 --> 00:04:31.176
are breathing virtually
no pathogens at all.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.728
Take a look at that from the side as well,

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:35.307
you see a very efficient system.

00:04:35.331 --> 00:04:37.953
And in short, with this system, we win.

00:04:39.255 --> 00:04:42.144
When we take a look at what this means,

00:04:42.168 --> 00:04:45.640
what we see is that this not only works
if the middle passenger sneezes,

00:04:45.664 --> 00:04:48.438
but also if the window-seat
passenger sneezes

00:04:48.462 --> 00:04:50.557
or if the aisle-seat passenger sneezes.

00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:54.254
And so with this solution, what does
this mean for the world?

00:04:54.278 --> 00:04:57.792
Well, when we take a look at this

00:04:57.816 --> 00:05:00.385
from the computer simulation
into real life,
