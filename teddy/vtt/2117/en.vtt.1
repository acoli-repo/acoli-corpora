00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And I went to the IT guys here

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and a gentleman mended my computer,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and then he said, "What are you doing here?"

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and I said "I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of singing,"

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and he said, "Oh, I sort of play the cello as well."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And I said, "Do you really?"

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Anyway, so you're in for a treat,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
because he's fantastic, and his name's Mark.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
(Applause)

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I am also joined by my partner in crime, Thomas Dolby.
