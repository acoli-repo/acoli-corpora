00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.503
is that because they're all done

00:13:00.503 --> 00:13:02.093
using Mechanical Turk,

00:13:02.093 --> 00:13:03.905
these are not people's real passwords.

00:13:03.905 --> 00:13:06.010
They're the passwords that they created

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.505
or the computer created for them for our study.

00:13:08.505 --> 00:13:10.073
And we wanted to know whether people

00:13:10.073 --> 00:13:12.385
would actually behave the same way

00:13:12.385 --> 00:13:14.612
with their real passwords.

00:13:14.612 --> 00:13:18.293
So we talked to the information
security office at Carnegie Mellon

00:13:18.293 --> 00:13:22.096
and asked them if we could
have everybody's real passwords.

00:13:22.096 --> 00:13:23.850
Not surprisingly, they were a little bit reluctant

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.400
to share them with us,

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.210
but we were actually able to work out

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:28.250
a system with them

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.359
where they put all of the real passwords
