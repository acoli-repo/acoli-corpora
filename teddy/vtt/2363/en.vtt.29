00:14:29.042 --> 00:14:31.327
So that was good news.

00:14:31.327 --> 00:14:33.741
Okay, I want to close by talking about

00:14:33.741 --> 00:14:35.809
some insights I gained while on sabbatical

00:14:35.809 --> 00:14:39.010
last year in the Carnegie Mellon art school.

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.291
One of the things that I did

00:14:40.291 --> 00:14:41.815
is I made a number of quilts,

00:14:41.815 --> 00:14:43.363
and I made this quilt here.

00:14:43.363 --> 00:14:45.262
It's called "Security Blanket."

00:14:45.262 --> 00:14:47.693
(Laughter)

00:14:47.693 --> 00:14:50.788
And this quilt has the 1,000

00:14:50.788 --> 00:14:53.116
most frequent passwords stolen

00:14:53.116 --> 00:14:55.687
from the RockYou website.

00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:57.748
And the size of the passwords is proportional

00:14:57.748 --> 00:14:59.649
to how frequently they appeared

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.897
in the stolen dataset.
