stronger passwords is to use a password meter.

00:09:00.976 --> 00:09:02.361
Here are some examples.

00:09:02.361 --> 00:09:03.762
You may have seen these on the Internet

00:09:03.762 --> 00:09:06.819
when you were creating passwords.

00:09:06.819 --> 00:09:09.067
We decided to do a study to find out

00:09:09.067 --> 00:09:11.954
whether these password meters actually work.

00:09:11.954 --> 00:09:13.375
Do they actually help people

00:09:13.375 --> 00:09:14.828
have stronger passwords,

00:09:14.828 --> 00:09:16.914
and if so, which ones are better?

00:09:16.914 --> 00:09:19.421
So we tested password meters that were

00:09:19.421 --> 00:09:21.519
different sizes, shapes, colors,

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.935
different words next to them,

00:09:22.935 --> 00:09:26.210
and we even tested one that was a dancing bunny.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:27.792
As you type a better password,

00:09:27.792 --> 00:09:30.331
the bunny dances faster and faster.
