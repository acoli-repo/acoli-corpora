00:04:29.433 --> 00:04:31.910
and they often go and post these passwords

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.247
on the Internet.

00:04:33.247 --> 00:04:34.920
So we were able to get access

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.890
to some of these stolen password sets.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.218
This is still not really ideal for research, though,

00:04:41.218 --> 00:04:43.255
because it's not entirely clear

00:04:43.255 --> 00:04:45.439
where all of these passwords came from,

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.681
or exactly what policies were in effect

00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:49.789
when people created these passwords.

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.341
So we wanted to find some better source of data.

00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:54.975
So we decided that one thing we could do

00:04:54.975 --> 00:04:57.104
is we could do a study and have people

00:04:57.104 --> 00:05:00.344
actually create passwords for our study.
