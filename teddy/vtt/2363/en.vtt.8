00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.348
So CMU allows 32 possible symbols,

00:04:02.348 --> 00:04:04.781
but as you can see, there's only a small number

00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:06.583
that most people are using,

00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:09.524
so we're not actually getting very much strength

00:04:09.524 --> 00:04:11.990
from the symbols in our passwords.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.701
So this was a really interesting study,

00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:17.165
and now we had data from 470 people,

00:04:17.165 --> 00:04:18.470
but in the scheme of things,

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.050
that's really not very much password data,

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.495
and so we looked around to see

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:25.055
where could we find additional password data?

00:04:25.055 --> 00:04:27.231
So it turns out there are a lot of people

00:04:27.231 --> 00:04:29.433
going around stealing passwords,

00:04:29.433 --> 00:04:31.910
and they often go and post these passwords
