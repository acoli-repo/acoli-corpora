00:07:29.434 --> 00:07:31.568
So they're going to start by guessing "password,"

00:07:31.568 --> 00:07:34.319
and then they'll guess "I love you," and "monkey,"

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:36.902
and "12345678,"

00:07:36.902 --> 00:07:38.214
because these are the passwords

00:07:38.214 --> 00:07:40.119
that are most likely for people to have.

00:07:40.119 --> 00:07:43.380
In fact, some of you probably have these passwords.

00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:46.489
So what we found

00:07:46.489 --> 00:07:49.895
by running all of these 5,000 passwords we collected

00:07:49.895 --> 00:07:54.001
through these tests to see how strong they were,

00:07:54.001 --> 00:07:56.753
we found that the long passwords

00:07:56.753 --> 00:07:58.033
were actually pretty strong,

00:07:58.033 --> 00:08:01.295
and the complex passwords were pretty strong too.
