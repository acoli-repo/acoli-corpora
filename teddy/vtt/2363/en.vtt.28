00:13:58.302 --> 00:14:00.460
by people affiliated with the
school of computer science

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.784
were actually 1.8 times stronger

00:14:02.784 --> 00:14:06.522
than those affiliated with the business school.

00:14:06.522 --> 00:14:08.562
We have lots of other really interesting

00:14:08.562 --> 00:14:10.800
demographic information as well.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.646
The other interesting thing that we found

00:14:12.646 --> 00:14:15.086
is that when we compared
the Carnegie Mellon passwords

00:14:15.086 --> 00:14:17.369
to the Mechanical Turk-generated passwords,

00:14:17.369 --> 00:14:19.988
there was actually a lot of similarities,

00:14:19.988 --> 00:14:21.936
and so this helped validate our research method

00:14:21.936 --> 00:14:24.446
and show that actually, collecting passwords

00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:26.254
using these Mechanical Turk studies

00:14:26.254 --> 00:14:29.042
is actually a valid way to study passwords.

00:14:29.042 --> 00:14:31.327
So that was good news.
