I am a computer science and engineering
professor here at Carnegie Mellon,

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.228
and my research focuses on
usable privacy and security,

00:00:08.228 --> 00:00:10.996
and so my friends like to give me examples

00:00:10.996 --> 00:00:13.198
of their frustrations with computing systems,

00:00:13.198 --> 00:00:16.552
especially frustrations related to

00:00:16.552 --> 00:00:20.664
unusable privacy and security.

00:00:20.664 --> 00:00:23.375
So passwords are something that I hear a lot about.

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:26.255
A lot of people are frustrated with passwords,

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:27.949
and it's bad enough

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.593
when you have to have one really good password
