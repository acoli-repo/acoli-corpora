00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:00.294
run it through a hashing function,

00:07:00.294 --> 00:07:02.059
and see whether it matches

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:06.009
the passwords they have on
their stolen password list.

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:09.114
So a dumb attacker will try every password in order.

00:07:09.114 --> 00:07:12.682
They'll start with AAAAA and move on to AAAAB,

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.100
and this is going to take a really long time

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.626
before they get any passwords

00:07:16.626 --> 00:07:19.323
that people are really likely to actually have.

00:07:19.323 --> 00:07:21.506
A smart attacker, on the other hand,

00:07:21.506 --> 00:07:22.892
does something much more clever.

00:07:22.892 --> 00:07:24.718
They look at the passwords

00:07:24.718 --> 00:07:26.518
that are known to be popular

00:07:26.518 --> 00:07:28.245
from these stolen password sets,

00:07:28.245 --> 00:07:29.434
and they guess those first.

00:07:29.434 --> 00:07:31.568
So they're going to start by guessing "password,"
