00:04:57.104 --> 00:05:00.344
actually create passwords for our study.

00:05:00.344 --> 00:05:03.165
So we used a service called
Amazon Mechanical Turk,

00:05:03.165 --> 00:05:05.499
and this is a service where you can post

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:07.803
a small job online that takes a minute,

00:05:07.803 --> 00:05:09.303
a few minutes, an hour,

00:05:09.303 --> 00:05:11.887
and pay people, a penny, ten cents, a few dollars,

00:05:11.887 --> 00:05:13.233
to do a task for you,

00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:15.355
and then you pay them through Amazon.com.

00:05:15.355 --> 00:05:17.649
So we paid people about 50 cents

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:20.245
to create a password following our rules

00:05:20.245 --> 00:05:21.655
and answering a survey,

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:24.180
and then we paid them again to come back

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.251
two days later and log in

00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:28.825
using their password and answering another survey.

00:05:28.825 --> 00:05:33.289
So we did this, and we collected 5,000 passwords,
