00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.927
Pretty easy. But then they changed things,

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:03.597
and at the end of 2009, they announced

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:05.973
that we were going to have a new policy,

00:01:05.973 --> 00:01:07.836
and this new policy required

00:01:07.836 --> 00:01:10.517
passwords that were at least eight characters long,

00:01:10.517 --> 00:01:12.292
with an uppercase letter, lowercase letter,

00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:13.580
a digit, a symbol,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.218
you couldn't use the same
character more than three times,

00:01:16.218 --> 00:01:18.652
and it wasn't allowed to be in a dictionary.

00:01:18.652 --> 00:01:20.834
Now, when they implemented this new policy,

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:23.144
a lot of people, my colleagues and friends,

00:01:23.144 --> 00:01:24.998
came up to me and they said, "Wow,

00:01:24.998 --> 00:01:26.510
now that's really unusable.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.703
Why are they doing this to us,

00:01:27.703 --> 00:01:29.414
and why didn't you stop them?"

00:01:29.414 --> 00:01:30.770
And I said, "Well, you know what?
