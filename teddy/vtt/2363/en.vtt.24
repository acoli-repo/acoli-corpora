00:11:59.946 --> 00:12:01.342
And then we decided to try something called

00:12:01.342 --> 00:12:02.988
a pronounceable password.

00:12:02.988 --> 00:12:05.233
So here the computer picks random syllables

00:12:05.233 --> 00:12:06.367
and puts them together

00:12:06.367 --> 00:12:08.842
so you have something sort of pronounceable,

00:12:08.842 --> 00:12:11.444
like "tufritvi" and "vadasabi."

00:12:11.444 --> 00:12:13.591
That one kind of rolls off your tongue.

00:12:13.591 --> 00:12:15.807
So these were random passwords that were

00:12:15.807 --> 00:12:18.551
generated by our computer.

00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:21.529
So what we found in this study was that, surprisingly,

00:12:21.529 --> 00:12:25.297
pass phrases were not actually all that good.

00:12:25.297 --> 00:12:28.090
People were not really better at remembering

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.043
the pass phrases than these random passwords,
