00:07:58.033 --> 00:08:01.295
and the complex passwords were pretty strong too.

00:08:01.295 --> 00:08:03.737
However, when we looked at the survey data,

00:08:03.737 --> 00:08:06.761
we saw that people were really frustrated

00:08:06.761 --> 00:08:09.100
by the very complex passwords,

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.730
and the long passwords were a lot more usable,

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.055
and in some cases, they were actually

00:08:13.055 --> 00:08:15.963
even stronger than the complex passwords.

00:08:15.963 --> 00:08:17.132
So this suggests that,

00:08:17.132 --> 00:08:18.835
instead of telling people that they need

00:08:18.835 --> 00:08:20.357
to put all these symbols and numbers

00:08:20.357 --> 00:08:23.199
and crazy things into their passwords,

00:08:23.199 --> 00:08:25.221
we might be better off just telling people

00:08:25.221 --> 00:08:27.873
to have long passwords.

00:08:27.873 --> 00:08:29.665
Now here's the problem, though:

00:08:29.665 --> 00:08:31.920
Some people had long passwords
