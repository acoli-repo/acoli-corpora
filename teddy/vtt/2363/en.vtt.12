00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:00.595
and there were a whole bunch more,

00:06:00.595 --> 00:06:02.835
but one of the ones we tried was called Basic16,

00:06:02.835 --> 00:06:05.467
and the only requirement here

00:06:05.467 --> 00:06:08.620
was that your password had
to have at least 16 characters.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.078
All right, so now we had 5,000 passwords,

00:06:11.078 --> 00:06:14.641
and so we had much more detailed information.

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:17.200
Again we see that there's only a small number

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.115
of symbols that people are actually using

00:06:19.115 --> 00:06:21.001
in their passwords.

00:06:21.001 --> 00:06:23.600
We also wanted to get an idea of how strong

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.371
the passwords were that people were creating,

00:06:26.371 --> 00:06:28.991
but as you may recall, there isn't a good measure

00:06:28.991 --> 00:06:30.745
of password strength.
