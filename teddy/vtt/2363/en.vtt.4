00:01:59.449 --> 00:02:02.247
but basically it measures the strength of passwords.

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.226
But the thing is, there isn't actually

00:02:04.226 --> 00:02:06.175
a standard measure of entropy.

00:02:06.175 --> 00:02:08.574
Now, the National Institute
of Standards and Technology

00:02:08.574 --> 00:02:10.127
has a set of guidelines

00:02:10.127 --> 00:02:12.695
which have some rules of thumb

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:14.135
for measuring entropy,

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:17.030
but they don't have anything too specific,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.367
and the reason they only have rules of thumb

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:22.503
is it turns out they don't actually have any good data

00:02:22.503 --> 00:02:24.023
on passwords.

00:02:24.023 --> 00:02:26.335
In fact, their report states,

00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:28.663
"Unfortunately, we do not have much data

00:02:28.663 --> 00:02:31.505
on the passwords users
choose under particular rules.
