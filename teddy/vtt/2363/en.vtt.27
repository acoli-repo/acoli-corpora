00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.359
where they put all of the real passwords

00:13:30.359 --> 00:13:33.450
for 25,000 CMU students, faculty and staff,

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.898
into a locked computer in a locked room,

00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:37.292
not connected to the Internet,

00:13:37.292 --> 00:13:39.140
and they ran code on it that we wrote

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.292
to analyze these passwords.

00:13:41.292 --> 00:13:42.618
They audited our code.

00:13:42.618 --> 00:13:43.930
They ran the code.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.668
And so we never actually saw

00:13:45.668 --> 00:13:48.485
anybody's password.

00:13:48.485 --> 00:13:50.000
We got some interesting results,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.696
and those of you Tepper students in the back

00:13:51.696 --> 00:13:54.571
will be very interested in this.

00:13:54.571 --> 00:13:58.302
So we found that the passwords created

00:13:58.302 --> 00:14:00.460
by people affiliated with the
school of computer science
