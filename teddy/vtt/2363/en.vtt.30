00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.897
in the stolen dataset.

00:15:01.897 --> 00:15:04.529
And what I did is I created this word cloud,

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.661
and I went through all 1,000 words,

00:15:06.661 --> 00:15:08.456
and I categorized them into

00:15:08.456 --> 00:15:10.836
loose thematic categories.

00:15:10.836 --> 00:15:12.739
And it was, in some cases,

00:15:12.739 --> 00:15:14.777
it was kind of difficult to figure out

00:15:14.777 --> 00:15:16.532
what category they should be in,

00:15:16.532 --> 00:15:18.431
and then I color-coded them.

00:15:18.431 --> 00:15:21.050
So here are some examples of the difficulty.

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.231
So "justin."

00:15:22.231 --> 00:15:24.060
Is that the name of the user,

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.382
their boyfriend, their son?

00:15:25.382 --> 00:15:28.270
Maybe they're a Justin Bieber fan.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.495
Or "princess."
