00:08:29.665 --> 00:08:31.920
Some people had long passwords

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.475
that actually weren't very strong.

00:08:33.475 --> 00:08:35.472
You can make long passwords

00:08:35.472 --> 00:08:37.028
that are still the sort of thing

00:08:37.028 --> 00:08:38.770
that an attacker could easily guess.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:42.135
So we need to do more than
just say long passwords.

00:08:42.135 --> 00:08:44.071
There has to be some additional requirements,

00:08:44.071 --> 00:08:47.040
and some of our ongoing research is looking at

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.479
what additional requirements we should add

00:08:49.479 --> 00:08:51.583
to make for stronger passwords

00:08:51.583 --> 00:08:53.895
that also are going to be easy for people

00:08:53.895 --> 00:08:56.593
to remember and type.

00:08:56.593 --> 00:08:58.719
Another approach to getting people to have

00:08:58.719 --> 00:09:00.976
stronger passwords is to use a password meter.
