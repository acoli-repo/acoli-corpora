00:02:28.663 --> 00:02:31.505
on the passwords users
choose under particular rules.

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:33.838
NIST would like to obtain more data

00:02:33.838 --> 00:02:36.300
on the passwords users actually choose,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.763
but system administrators
are understandably reluctant

00:02:38.763 --> 00:02:41.703
to reveal password data to others."

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:44.800
So this is a problem, but our research group

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.940
looked at it as an opportunity.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.040
We said, "Well, there's a need
for good password data.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.188
Maybe we can collect some good password data

00:02:52.188 --> 00:02:54.892
and actually advance the state of the art here.

00:02:54.892 --> 00:02:56.564
So the first thing we did is,

00:02:56.564 --> 00:02:58.120
we got a bag of candy bars

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.206
and we walked around campus

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:02.004
and talked to students, faculty and staff,
