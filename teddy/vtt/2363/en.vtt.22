00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:02.547
and we had the computer pick the random words

00:11:02.547 --> 00:11:03.647
in the pass phrase.

00:11:03.647 --> 00:11:04.800
Now the reason we did this

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.386
is that humans are not very good

00:11:06.386 --> 00:11:07.770
at picking random words.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.032
If we asked a human to do it,

00:11:09.032 --> 00:11:12.030
they would pick things that were not very random.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.062
So we tried a few different conditions.

00:11:14.062 --> 00:11:16.152
In one condition, the computer picked

00:11:16.152 --> 00:11:18.368
from a dictionary of the very common words

00:11:18.368 --> 00:11:19.730
in the English language,

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:21.494
and so you'd get pass phrases like

00:11:21.494 --> 00:11:23.418
"try there three come."

00:11:23.418 --> 00:11:25.150
And we looked at that, and we said,

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.200
"Well, that doesn't really seem very memorable."

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.440
So then we tried picking words
