00:06:28.991 --> 00:06:30.745
of password strength.

00:06:30.745 --> 00:06:33.057
So what we decided to do was to see

00:06:33.057 --> 00:06:35.427
how long it would take to crack these passwords

00:06:35.427 --> 00:06:36.841
using the best cracking tools

00:06:36.841 --> 00:06:38.649
that the bad guys are using,

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:40.665
or that we could find information about

00:06:40.665 --> 00:06:42.202
in the research literature.

00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:44.960
So to give you an idea of how bad guys

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.130
go about cracking passwords,

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.081
they will steal a password file

00:06:49.081 --> 00:06:51.234
that will have all of the passwords

00:06:51.234 --> 00:06:54.123
in kind of a scrambled form, called a hash,

00:06:54.123 --> 00:06:56.685
and so what they'll do is they'll make a guess

00:06:56.685 --> 00:06:58.397
as to what a password is,

00:06:58.397 --> 00:07:00.294
run it through a hashing function,
