00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:02.004
and talked to students, faculty and staff,

00:03:02.004 --> 00:03:03.534
and asked them for information

00:03:03.534 --> 00:03:05.086
about their passwords.

00:03:05.086 --> 00:03:08.090
Now we didn't say, "Give us your password."

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.751
No, we just asked them about their password.

00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:12.229
How long is it? Does it have a digit?

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:13.297
Does it have a symbol?

00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:15.342
And were you annoyed at having to create

00:03:15.342 --> 00:03:18.086
a new one last week?

00:03:18.086 --> 00:03:21.292
So we got results from 470 students,

00:03:21.292 --> 00:03:22.263
faculty and staff,

00:03:22.263 --> 00:03:24.777
and indeed we confirmed that the new policy

00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:26.230
was very annoying,

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.022
but we also found that people said

00:03:28.022 --> 00:03:31.152
they felt more secure with these new passwords.
