00:03:28.022 --> 00:03:31.152
they felt more secure with these new passwords.

00:03:31.152 --> 00:03:33.458
We found that most people knew

00:03:33.458 --> 00:03:35.610
they were not supposed to
write their password down,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.001
and only 13 percent of them did,

00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:40.417
but disturbingly, 80 percent of people

00:03:40.417 --> 00:03:42.541
said they were reusing their password.

00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:44.337
Now, this is actually more dangerous

00:03:44.337 --> 00:03:46.359
than writing your password down,

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.920
because it makes you much
more susceptible to attackers.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.038
So if you have to, write your passwords down,

00:03:53.038 --> 00:03:54.837
but don't reuse them.

00:03:54.837 --> 00:03:56.588
We also found some interesting things

00:03:56.588 --> 00:03:59.549
about the symbols people use in passwords.

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.348
So CMU allows 32 possible symbols,
