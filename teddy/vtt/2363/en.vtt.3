00:01:29.414 --> 00:01:30.770
And I said, "Well, you know what?

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.278
They didn't ask me."

00:01:32.278 --> 00:01:35.743
But I got curious, and I decided to go talk

00:01:35.743 --> 00:01:37.680
to the people in charge of our computer systems

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.511
and find out what led them to introduce

00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:42.359
this new policy,

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:43.943
and they said that the university

00:01:43.943 --> 00:01:46.309
had joined a consortium of universities,

00:01:46.309 --> 00:01:48.943
and one of the requirements of membership

00:01:48.943 --> 00:01:51.191
was that we had to have stronger passwords

00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:53.463
that complied with some new requirements,

00:01:53.463 --> 00:01:55.567
and these requirements were that our passwords

00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:57.171
had to have a lot of entropy.

00:01:57.171 --> 00:01:59.449
Now entropy is a complicated term,

00:01:59.449 --> 00:02:02.247
but basically it measures the strength of passwords.
