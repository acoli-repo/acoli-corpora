00:09:27.792 --> 00:09:30.331
the bunny dances faster and faster.

00:09:30.331 --> 00:09:32.860
So this was pretty fun.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.427
What we found

00:09:34.427 --> 00:09:37.999
was that password meters do work.

00:09:37.999 --> 00:09:39.800
(Laughter)

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.133
Most of the password meters were actually effective,

00:09:43.133 --> 00:09:45.654
and the dancing bunny was very effective too,

00:09:45.654 --> 00:09:48.535
but the password meters that were the most effective

00:09:48.535 --> 00:09:50.890
were the ones that made you work harder

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.870
before they gave you that thumbs up and said

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.247
you were doing a good job,

00:09:54.247 --> 00:09:55.759
and in fact we found that most

00:09:55.759 --> 00:09:58.040
of the password meters on the Internet today

00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:58.992
are too soft.

00:09:58.992 --> 00:10:01.195
They tell you you're doing a good job too early,
