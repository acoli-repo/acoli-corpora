00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.593
when you have to have one really good password

00:00:30.593 --> 00:00:32.415
that you can remember

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:35.309
but nobody else is going to be able to guess.

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.946
But what do you do when you have accounts

00:00:36.946 --> 00:00:38.754
on a hundred different systems

00:00:38.754 --> 00:00:41.030
and you're supposed to have a unique password

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.067
for each of these systems?

00:00:44.067 --> 00:00:46.251
It's tough.

00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:48.010
At Carnegie Mellon, they used to make it

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.309
actually pretty easy for us

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.046
to remember our passwords.

00:00:51.046 --> 00:00:53.449
The password requirement up through 2009

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.828
was just that you had to have a password

00:00:55.828 --> 00:00:58.039
with at least one character.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.927
Pretty easy. But then they changed things,
