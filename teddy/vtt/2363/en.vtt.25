00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.043
the pass phrases than these random passwords,

00:12:31.043 --> 00:12:33.797
and because the pass phrases are longer,

00:12:33.797 --> 00:12:35.023
they took longer to type

00:12:35.023 --> 00:12:38.033
and people made more errors while typing them in.

00:12:38.033 --> 00:12:41.260
So it's not really a clear win for pass phrases.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.605
Sorry, all of you xkcd fans.

00:12:44.605 --> 00:12:46.497
On the other hand, we did find

00:12:46.497 --> 00:12:48.301
that pronounceable passwords

00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:49.772
worked surprisingly well,

00:12:49.772 --> 00:12:52.190
and so we actually are doing some more research

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:55.385
to see if we can make that
approach work even better.

00:12:55.385 --> 00:12:57.197
So one of the problems

00:12:57.197 --> 00:12:58.820
with some of the studies that we've done

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.503
is that because they're all done
