00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:32.155
We have the ability to connect
seemingly disparate threads

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:34.417
to solve problems we've never seen before.

00:02:34.808 --> 00:02:39.219
Percy Spencer was a physicist
working on radar during World War II,

00:02:39.243 --> 00:02:42.256
when he noticed the magnetron
was melting his chocolate bar.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.265
He was able to connect his understanding
of electromagnetic radiation

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:47.773
with his knowledge of cooking

00:02:47.797 --> 00:02:51.055
in order to invent -- any guesses? --
the microwave oven.

00:02:51.444 --> 00:02:54.517
Now, this is a particularly remarkable
example of creativity.

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:58.205
But this sort of cross-pollination
happens for each of us in small ways

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:00.057
thousands of times per day.
