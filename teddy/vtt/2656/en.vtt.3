00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:30.621
given by human teachers.

00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:34.076
Last year, we issued
an even more difficult challenge.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.053
Can you take images of the eye
and diagnose an eye disease

00:01:37.077 --> 00:01:38.771
called diabetic retinopathy?

00:01:39.164 --> 00:01:43.204
Again, the winning algorithms
were able to match the diagnoses

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:45.053
given by human ophthalmologists.

00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:48.773
Now, given the right data,
machines are going to outperform humans

00:01:48.797 --> 00:01:49.962
at tasks like this.

00:01:49.986 --> 00:01:53.978
A teacher might read 10,000 essays
over a 40-year career.

00:01:54.407 --> 00:01:56.767
An ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes.

00:01:56.791 --> 00:02:00.704
A machine can read millions of essays
or see millions of eyes
