00:01:56.791 --> 00:02:00.704
A machine can read millions of essays
or see millions of eyes

00:02:00.728 --> 00:02:02.004
within minutes.

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:05.314
We have no chance of competing
against machines

00:02:05.338 --> 00:02:07.659
on frequent, high-volume tasks.

00:02:08.665 --> 00:02:12.389
But there are things we can do
that machines can't do.

00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:14.991
Where machines have made
very little progress

00:02:15.015 --> 00:02:16.869
is in tackling novel situations.

00:02:16.893 --> 00:02:20.792
They can't handle things
they haven't seen many times before.

00:02:21.321 --> 00:02:23.905
The fundamental limitations
of machine learning

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:27.323
is that it needs to learn
from large volumes of past data.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.101
Now, humans don't.

00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:32.155
We have the ability to connect
seemingly disparate threads
