thousands of times per day.

00:03:00.501 --> 00:03:02.162
Machines cannot compete with us

00:03:02.186 --> 00:03:04.437
when it comes to tackling
novel situations,

00:03:04.461 --> 00:03:07.578
and this puts a fundamental limit
on the human tasks

00:03:07.602 --> 00:03:09.319
that machines will automate.

00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:12.446
So what does this mean
for the future of work?

00:03:12.804 --> 00:03:17.336
The future state of any single job lies
in the answer to a single question:

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.341
To what extent is that job reducible
to frequent, high-volume tasks,

00:03:22.365 --> 00:03:25.618
and to what extent does it involve
tackling novel situations?

00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:30.010
On frequent, high-volume tasks,
machines are getting smarter and smarter.
