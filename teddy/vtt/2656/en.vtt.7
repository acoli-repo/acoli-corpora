00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:30.010
On frequent, high-volume tasks,
machines are getting smarter and smarter.

00:03:30.034 --> 00:03:32.748
Today they grade essays.
They diagnose certain diseases.

00:03:32.772 --> 00:03:35.929
Over coming years,
they're going to conduct our audits,

00:03:35.953 --> 00:03:38.920
and they're going to read boilerplate
from legal contracts.

Now, as mentioned,

00:03:49.864 --> 00:03:52.813
machines are not making progress
on novel situations.

00:03:52.837 --> 00:03:56.294
The copy behind a marketing campaign
needs to grab consumers' attention.

00:03:56.318 --> 00:03:58.033
It has to stand out from the crowd.

00:03:58.057 --> 00:04:00.501
Business strategy means
finding gaps in the market,
