00:00:57.316 --> 00:01:00.866
Machine learning started making its way
into industry in the early '90s.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.014
It started with relatively simple tasks.

00:01:03.406 --> 00:01:07.521
It started with things like assessing
credit risk from loan applications,

00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:11.598
sorting the mail by reading
handwritten characters from zip codes.

00:01:12.036 --> 00:01:15.205
Over the past few years, we have made
dramatic breakthroughs.

00:01:15.586 --> 00:01:19.502
Machine learning is now capable
of far, far more complex tasks.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.091
In 2012, Kaggle challenged its community

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:26.304
to build an algorithm
that could grade high-school essays.

00:01:26.328 --> 00:01:28.932
The winning algorithms
were able to match the grades

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:30.621
given by human teachers.
