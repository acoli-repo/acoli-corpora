Machine learning is the technology

00:00:30.317 --> 00:00:32.595
that's responsible for most
of this disruption.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.409
It's the most powerful branch
of artificial intelligence.

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:37.315
It allows machines to learn from data

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:39.931
and mimic some of the things
that humans can do.

00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:43.370
My company, Kaggle, operates
on the cutting edge of machine learning.

00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:45.780
We bring together
hundreds of thousands of experts

00:00:45.804 --> 00:00:48.922
to solve important problems
for industry and academia.

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:52.501
This gives us a unique perspective
on what machines can do,

00:00:52.525 --> 00:00:53.760
what they can't do

00:00:53.784 --> 00:00:56.723
and what jobs they might
automate or threaten.

00:00:57.316 --> 00:01:00.866
Machine learning started making its way
into industry in the early '90s.
