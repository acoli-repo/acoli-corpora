00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So I work in marketing, which I love,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but my first passion was physics,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
when I had a little less gray hair.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So he taught me

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that physics is cool

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
because it teaches us so much about the world around us.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that physics can teach us something about marketing.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So quick show of hands --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
who studied some marketing in university?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Who studied some physics in university?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Pretty good. And at school?
