00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.430
and counter-clockwise 
in the southern hemisphere.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.620
That’s because of the way 
the Earth’s rotation

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.630
affects the wind patterns that
give rise to these currents.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.280
If the earth didn’t rotate,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.740
air and water would simply 
move back and forth

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.820
between low pressure at the equator

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.610
and high pressure at the poles.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.350
But as the earth spins,

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.860
air moving from the equator to the 
North Pole is deflected eastward,

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.509
and air moving back down 
is deflected westward.

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:27.299
The mirror image happens 
in the southern hemisphere,

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.229
so that the major streams of wind

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.789
form loop-like patterns 
around the ocean basins.
