00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:32.789
form loop-like patterns 
around the ocean basins.

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.679
This is called the Coriolis Effect.

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:40.129
The winds push the ocean beneath 
them into the same rotating gyres.

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.793
And because water holds onto heat 
more effectively than air,

00:02:43.793 --> 00:02:48.303
these currents help redistribute 
warmth around the globe.

00:02:48.303 --> 00:02:49.864
Unlike surface currents,

00:02:49.864 --> 00:02:55.014
deep ocean currents are driven primarily 
by changes in the density of seawater.

00:02:55.014 --> 00:02:57.326
As water moves towards the North Pole,

00:02:57.326 --> 00:02:58.496
it gets colder.

00:02:58.496 --> 00:03:01.036
It also has a higher 
concentration of salt,
