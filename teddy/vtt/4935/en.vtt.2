00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.050
Surface currents control the motion

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.660
of the top 10 percent 
of the ocean’s water,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.230
while deep-ocean currents mobilize 
the other 90 percent.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.930
Though they have different causes,

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.960
surface and deep ocean currents 
influence each other

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.160
in an intricate dance that keeps 
the entire ocean moving.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.185
Near the shore,

00:01:16.185 --> 00:01:19.635
surface currents are driven 
by both the wind and tides,

00:01:19.635 --> 00:01:24.505
which draw water back and forth 
as the water level falls and rises.

00:01:24.505 --> 00:01:29.773
Meanwhile, in the open ocean, wind is the 
major force behind surface currents.

00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:31.517
As wind blows over the ocean,
