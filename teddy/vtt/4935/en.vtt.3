00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:31.517
As wind blows over the ocean,

00:01:31.517 --> 00:01:34.507
it drags the top layers 
of water along with it.

00:01:34.507 --> 00:01:37.477
That moving water pulls on 
the layers underneath,

00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:39.697
and those pull on the ones beneath them.

00:01:39.697 --> 00:01:43.197
In fact, water as deep as 400 meters

00:01:43.197 --> 00:01:47.027
is still affected by the wind 
at the ocean’s surface.

00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:51.337
If you zoom out to look at the patterns 
of surface currents all over the earth,

00:01:51.337 --> 00:01:54.820
you’ll see that they form 
big loops called gyres,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.580
which travel clockwise 
in the northern hemisphere

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.430
and counter-clockwise 
in the southern hemisphere.
