00:03:29.486 --> 00:03:32.606
it carries nutrients that nourish the 
microorganisms

00:03:32.606 --> 00:03:35.726
which form the base of many 
ocean food chains.

00:03:35.726 --> 00:03:39.306
The global conveyor belt is the
longest current in the world,

00:03:39.306 --> 00:03:41.306
snaking all around the globe.

00:03:41.306 --> 00:03:44.906
But it only moves a few 
centimeters per second.

00:03:44.906 --> 00:03:49.456
It could take a drop of water 
a thousand years to make the full trip.

00:03:49.456 --> 00:03:52.996
However, rising sea temperatures are 
causing the conveyor belt

00:03:52.996 --> 00:03:54.956
to seemingly slow down.

00:03:54.956 --> 00:03:57.746
Models show this causing havoc with 
weather systems

00:03:57.746 --> 00:03:59.616
on both sides of the Atlantic,

00:03:59.616 --> 00:04:02.856
and no one knows what would happen if it 
continues to slow
