00:00:29.557 --> 00:00:33.727
to chart a better understanding
of ocean currents.

00:00:33.727 --> 00:00:36.493
Ocean currents are driven 
by a range of sources:

00:00:36.493 --> 00:00:40.043
the wind, tides, changes in water density,

00:00:40.043 --> 00:00:43.073
and the rotation of the Earth.

00:00:43.073 --> 00:00:47.733
The topography of the ocean floor 
and the shoreline modifies those motions,

00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:49.360
causing currents to speed up,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.200
slow down, or change direction.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.030
Ocean currents fall into 
two main categories:

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.290
surface currents and deep ocean currents.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.050
Surface currents control the motion
