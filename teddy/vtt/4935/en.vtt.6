00:02:58.496 --> 00:03:01.036
It also has a higher 
concentration of salt,

00:03:01.036 --> 00:03:05.956
because the ice crystals that form 
trap water while leaving salt behind.

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:08.796
This cold, salty water is more dense,

00:03:08.796 --> 00:03:09.946
so it sinks,

00:03:09.946 --> 00:03:12.616
and warmer surface water takes its place,

00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:17.076
setting up a vertical current called 
thermohaline circulation.

00:03:17.076 --> 00:03:21.563
Thermohaline circulation of deep water 
and wind-driven surface currents

00:03:21.563 --> 00:03:26.319
combine to form a winding loop 
called the Global Conveyor Belt.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.486
As water moves from the depths of 
the ocean to the surface,

00:03:29.486 --> 00:03:32.606
it carries nutrients that nourish the 
microorganisms
