00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:07.989
In 1992,

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:12.211
a cargo ship carrying bath toys 
got caught in a storm.

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.647
Shipping containers washed overboard,

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:20.837
and the waves swept 28,000 rubber ducks 
and other toys into the North Pacific.

00:00:20.837 --> 00:00:22.697
But they didnâ€™t stick together.

00:00:22.697 --> 00:00:23.977
Quite the oppositeâ€“

00:00:23.977 --> 00:00:27.307
the ducks have since washed up 
all over the world,

00:00:27.307 --> 00:00:29.557
and researchers have used their paths

00:00:29.557 --> 00:00:33.727
to chart a better understanding
of ocean currents.
