00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.114
remember that Generation X,
in the American Public Report,

00:04:30.138 --> 00:04:33.541
they found that 91 percent of women

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:36.277
had had premarital sex by the age of 30.

00:04:36.301 --> 00:04:38.069
Ninety-one percent.

00:04:39.383 --> 00:04:43.876
It's a particularly good thing that
these relationships are happening later.

00:04:44.358 --> 00:04:46.675
See, boomers in the '60s --

00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:51.206
they were getting married
at an average age for women of 20

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.140
and 23 for men.

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:55.761
2015 in Australia?

00:04:55.785 --> 00:05:00.717
That is now 30 for women and 32 for men.
