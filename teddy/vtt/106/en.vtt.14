were relationships in which
the couple shared power.

00:07:02.531 --> 00:07:04.485
They were influenceable:

00:07:06.854 --> 00:07:11.077
big decisions, like buying a house,
overseas trips, buying a car,

00:07:11.101 --> 00:07:12.522
having children.

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:15.818
But when Gottman
drilled down on this data,

00:07:15.842 --> 00:07:21.177
what he found was that women
were generally pretty influenceable.

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:23.768
Guess where the problem lay?

00:07:23.792 --> 00:07:24.815
(Laughter)

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:27.266
Yeah, there's only
two options here, isn't there?

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.986
Yeah, we men were to blame.
