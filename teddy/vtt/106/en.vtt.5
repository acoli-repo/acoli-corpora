00:02:33.713 --> 00:02:37.553
You can't control the way in which
people attract other people

00:02:37.577 --> 00:02:39.427
and build relationships."

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.685
Not so, our dear millennials.

00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:49.487
This is the most information-connected,
analytical and skeptical generation,

00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:54.499
making the most informed decisions
of any generation before them.

00:02:54.523 --> 00:02:57.775

I get a very different reaction.

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:00.245
They actually want to hear about this.
