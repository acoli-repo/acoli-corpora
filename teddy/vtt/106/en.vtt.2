00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.975
So for the purposes of this talk,
I'm going to be including

00:01:04.282 --> 00:01:06.370
de facto relationships,
common-law marriages

00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:09.128
and same-sex marriages,

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:13.262
or same-sex relationships
soon hopefully to become marriages.

00:01:14.432 --> 00:01:16.799
And I can say from my work
with same-sex couples,

00:01:16.823 --> 00:01:19.980
the principles I'm about
to talk about are no different.

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:22.724
They're the same across all relationships.

00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:26.225
So in a modern society,

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:30.125
we know that prevention
is better than cure.
