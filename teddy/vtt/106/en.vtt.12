00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.030
So when I ask somebody
who got married young why they broke up,

00:06:04.054 --> 00:06:05.534
and they say, "We grew apart,"

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:08.383
they're being surprisingly accurate,

00:06:08.407 --> 00:06:12.811
because the 20s is a decade
of rapid change and maturation.

00:06:13.197 --> 00:06:18.949
So the first thing you want to get
before you get married is older.

00:06:18.973 --> 00:06:21.062

00:06:22.218 --> 00:06:23.417
Number two,

00:06:23.998 --> 00:06:28.206
John Gottman, psychologist
and relationship researcher,

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.406
can tell us many factors that correlate
with a happy, successful marriage.
