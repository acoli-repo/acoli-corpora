Number two,

00:05:30.563 --> 00:05:32.925
neuroplasticity research tell us

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:39.183
that the human brain is still growing
until at least the age of 25.

00:05:39.207 --> 00:05:42.009
So that means how you're thinking
and what you're thinking

00:05:42.033 --> 00:05:44.359
is still changing up until 25.

00:05:45.034 --> 00:05:48.879
And thirdly, and most importantly
to my mind, is personality.

00:05:48.903 --> 00:05:51.212
Your personality at the age of 20

00:05:51.236 --> 00:05:54.980
does not correlate with
your personality at the age of 50.

00:05:55.004 --> 00:05:57.545
But your personality at the age of 30

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:00.985
does correlate with
your personality at the age of 50.
