00:08:58.901 --> 00:09:04.023
or you're suffering from
a really disabling illness,

00:09:04.047 --> 00:09:07.923
does your partner step up
and do what needs to be done

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:10.680
to leave you feeling
cared for and protected?

00:09:11.497 --> 00:09:13.257
And here's the rub:

00:09:13.281 --> 00:09:15.206
if you're facing old age,

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.613
and your partner
isn't doing that for you --

00:09:17.637 --> 00:09:19.816
in fact, you're having
to do that for them --

00:09:20.523 --> 00:09:23.718
then in an already-fragile relationship,

00:09:23.742 --> 00:09:28.680
it can look a bit like you might
be better off out of it rather than in it.

00:09:29.834 --> 00:09:35.895
So is your partner there for you
when it really matters?
