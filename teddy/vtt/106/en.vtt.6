They actually want to hear about this.

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.108
They want to know about how do we
have relationships that last?

00:03:06.278 --> 00:03:11.322
So for those of you who want to embrace
the post- "romantic destiny" era with me,

00:03:11.346 --> 00:03:16.332
let me talk about my three life hacks
for preventing divorce.

00:03:16.356 --> 00:03:20.576

to prevent divorce at two points:

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.292
later, once the cracks begin to appear
in an established relationship;

00:03:25.316 --> 00:03:30.251

before we have children.
