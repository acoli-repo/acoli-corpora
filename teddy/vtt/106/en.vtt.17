They'll forgive all betrayals,
even infidelities,

00:08:31.663 --> 00:08:34.024
because they're focused
on caring for each other.

00:08:34.048 --> 00:08:35.674
So what pulls them apart?

00:08:35.698 --> 00:08:38.446
The best word I have
for this is reliability,

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:39.929
or the lack thereof.

00:08:40.563 --> 00:08:42.434
Does your partner have your back?

00:08:42.458 --> 00:08:43.725
It takes two forms.

00:08:43.749 --> 00:08:49.505
Firstly, can you rely on your partner
to do what they say they're going to do?

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.056
Do they follow through?

00:08:51.706 --> 00:08:52.930
Secondly,

00:08:54.356 --> 00:08:56.047
if, for example,

00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:58.877
you're out and you're being
verbally attacked by somebody,

00:08:58.901 --> 00:09:04.023
or you're suffering from
a really disabling illness,
