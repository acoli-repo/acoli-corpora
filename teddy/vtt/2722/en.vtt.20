00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.376
"Hey, can I plant this flower
in your backyard?"

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.936
(Laughter)

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.680
And he said, "No."

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.376
But before he could leave I said,

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.336
"Hey, can I know why?"

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.416
And he said, "Well, I have this dog

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.776
that would dig up
anything I put in the backyard.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.456
I don't want to waste your flower.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.656
If you want to do this,
go across the street and talk to Connie.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.896
She loves flowers."

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.136
So that's what I did.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.216
I went across and knocked
on Connie's door.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.096
And she was so happy to see me.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.816
(Laughter)

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.216
And then half an hour later,

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.296
there was this flower
in Connie's backyard.
