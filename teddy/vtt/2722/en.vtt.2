00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.616
And the teacher was freaking out.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.296
She was like, "Hey, would anyone
say anything nice about these people?"

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:05.536
(Laughter)

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.536
"No one? OK, why don't you
go get your gift and sit down.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.816
So behave next year --

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.936
someone might say
something nice about you."

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.720
(Laughter)

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.136
Well, as I'm describing this you,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.536
you probably know
I remember this really well.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.160
(Laughter)

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.896
But I don't know who felt worse that day.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.096
Was it me or the teacher?

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.256
She must have realized
that she turned a team-building event

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.080
into a public roast
for three six-year-olds.
