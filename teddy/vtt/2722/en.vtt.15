00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.576
"Hi, can I get a burger refill?"

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.776
(Laughter)

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.256
He was all confused,
like, "What's a burger refill?"

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.536
(Laughter)

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.216
I said, "Well, it's just like
a drink refill but with a burger."

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.736
And he said, "Sorry,
we don't do burger refill, man."

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.096
(Laughter)

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.176
So this is where rejection happened
and I could have run, but I stayed.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.336
I said, "Well, I love your burgers,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.776
I love your joint,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.896
and if you guys do a burger refill,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.256
I will love you guys more."

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.536
(Laughter)

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.176
And he said, "Well, OK,
I'll tell my manager about it,

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.176
and maybe we'll do it,
but sorry, we can't do this today."
