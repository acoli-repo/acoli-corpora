00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.216
I came downstairs

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.456
and I saw this big guy
sitting behind a desk.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.216
He looked like a security guard.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.776
So I just approached him.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.536
And I was just walking

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.896
and that was the longest
walk of my life --

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.056
hair on the back
of my neck standing up,

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.536
I was sweating and my heart was pounding.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.776
And I got there and said,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.456
"Hey, sir, can I borrow
100 dollars from you?"

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.816
(Laughter)

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.640
And he looked up, he's like, "No."

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.840
"Why?"

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.496
And I just said, "No? I'm sorry."

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.235
Then I turned around,
and I just ran.

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:29.619
(Laughter)
