00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.376
When I was six years old,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.640
I received my gifts.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.776
My first grade teacher
had this brilliant idea.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.136
She wanted us to experience
receiving gifts

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.160
but also learning the virtue
of complimenting each other.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.536
So she had all of us
come to the front of the classroom,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.536
and she bought all of us gifts
and stacked them in the corner.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.776
And she said,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.456
"Why don't we just stand here
and compliment each other?

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.056
If you hear your name called,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.280
go and pick up your gift and sit down."
