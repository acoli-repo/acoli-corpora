00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.736
What I really wanted to do was learn,

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.976
and to change myself.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.616
So I turned the rest
of my 100 days of rejection

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.536
into this playground --

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.696
into this research project.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.800
I wanted to see what I could learn.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.016
And then I learned a lot of things.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.616
I discovered so many secrets.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.536
For example, I found if I just don't run,

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.816
if I got rejected,

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.896
I could actually turn a "no" into a "yes,"

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.536
and the magic word is, "why."

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.656
So one day I went to a stranger's house,
I had this flower in my hand,

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.096
knocked on the door and said,

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.376
"Hey, can I plant this flower
in your backyard?"
