00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.536
I was presented
with an investment opportunity,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.360
and then I was turned down.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.776
And that rejection hurt me.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.400
It hurt me so bad
that I wanted to quit right there.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.496
But then I thought,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.360
hey, would Bill Gates quit
after a simple investment rejection?

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.776
Would any successful
entrepreneur quit like that?

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.176
No way.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.176
And this is where it clicked for me.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.016
OK, I can build a better company.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.256
I can build a better
team or better product,

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.816
but one thing for sure:

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.696
I've got to be a better leader.
