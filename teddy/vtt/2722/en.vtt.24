By the way, I don't know
what your career trajectory is,

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.976
don't be a greeter.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.216
(Laughter)

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.440
It was really boring.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.136
But then I found I could do this
because I mentioned, "Is that weird?"

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.296
I mentioned the doubt that he was having.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.856
And because I mentioned, "Is that weird?",
that means I wasn't weird.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.416
That means I was actually
thinking just like him,

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.816
seeing this as a weird thing.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.096
And again, and again,

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.256
I learned that if I mention
some doubt people might have

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.096
before I ask the question,

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.376
I gained their trust.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.360
People were more likely to say yes to me.
