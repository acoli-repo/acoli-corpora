00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.176
And he was like, "Oh" --

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.456
yeah, this is how he looked,
his name is Eric --

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.056
and he was like, "I'm not sure."

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.136
This is how he was hearing me. "Not sure."

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.816
Then I ask him, "Is that weird?"

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.880
He's like, "Yeah, it's really weird, man."

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.656
But as soon as he said that,

It's as if he's putting
all the doubt on the floor.

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.376
And he said, "Yeah, you can do this,

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.656
just don't get too weird."

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.096
(Laughter)

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.496
So for the next hour
I was the Starbucks greeter.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.656
I said "hi" to every customer
that walked in,

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.056
and gave them holiday cheers.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.736
By the way, I don't know
what your career trajectory is,
