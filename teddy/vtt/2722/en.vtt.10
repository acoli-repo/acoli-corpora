Who doesn't know that?

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.456
(Laughter)

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.616
But why was I still so scared?

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.656
Then I found this website by luck.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.056
It's called rejectiontherapy.com.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.616
(Laughter)

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.576
"Rejection Therapy" was this game
invented by this Canadian entrepreneur.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.296
His name is Jason Comely.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.416
And basically the idea is for 30 days
you go out and look for rejection,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.696
and every day get rejected at something,

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.240
and then by the end,
you desensitize yourself from the pain.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.896
And I loved that idea.
