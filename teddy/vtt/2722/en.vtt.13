00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.696
I felt so embarrassed.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.176
But because I filmed myself --

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.336
so that night I was watching
myself getting rejected,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.456
I just saw how scared I was.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.936
I looked like this kid
in "The Sixth Sense."

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.376
I saw dead people.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.016
(Laughter)

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.576
But then I saw this guy.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.496
You know, he wasn't that menacing.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.896
He was a chubby, loveable guy,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.376
and he even asked me, "Why?"

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.816
In fact, he invited me to explain myself.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.416
And I could've said many things.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.736
I could've explained,
I could've negotiated.
