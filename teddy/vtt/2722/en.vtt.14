00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.736
I could've explained,
I could've negotiated.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.200
I didn't do any of that.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.200
All I did was run.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.320
I felt, wow, this is like
a microcosm of my life.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.456
Every time I felt the slightest rejection,

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.616
I would just run as fast as I could.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.896
And you know what?

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.736
The next day, no matter what happens,

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.256
I'm not going to run.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.480
I'll stay engaged.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.136
Day Two: Request a "burger refill."

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.136
(Laughter)

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.456
It's when I went to a burger joint,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.976
I finished lunch,
and I went to the cashier and said,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.576
"Hi, can I get a burger refill?"
