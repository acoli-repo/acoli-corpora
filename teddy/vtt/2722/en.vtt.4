00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.936
I fell in love with that guy.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.856
I thought, wow,
I know what I want to do now.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.016
That night I wrote a letter to my family

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.336
telling them: "By age 25,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.976
I will build the biggest
company in the world,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.936
and that company will buy Microsoft."

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.856
(Laughter)

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.496
I totally embraced this idea
of conquering the world --

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.720
domination, right?

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.976
And I didn't make this up,
I did write that letter.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.336
And here it is --

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.336
(Laughter)

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.176
You don't have to read this through --

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.976
(Laughter)

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.240
This is also bad handwriting,
but I did highlight some key words.
