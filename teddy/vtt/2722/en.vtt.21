00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.296
there was this flower
in Connie's backyard.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.736
I'm sure it looks better now.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.056
(Laughter)

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.016
But had I left
after the initial rejection,

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.256
I would've thought,

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.336
well, it's because
the guy didn't trust me,

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.576
it's because I was crazy,

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.016
because I didn't dress up well,
I didn't look good.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.256
It was none of those.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.976
It was because what I offered
did not fit what he wanted.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.256
And he trusted me enough
to offer me a referral,

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.936
using a sales term.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.480
I converted a referral.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.776
Then one day --

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.696
and I also learned that I can
actually say certain things

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.656
and maximize my chance to get a yes.
