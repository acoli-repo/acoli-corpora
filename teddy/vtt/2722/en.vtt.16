WEBVTT

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.176
and maybe we'll do it,
but sorry, we can't do this today."

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.616
Then I left.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.496
And by the way,

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.776
I don't think they've
ever done burger refill.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.016
(Laughter)

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.600
I think they're still there.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.456
But the life and death feeling
I was feeling the first time

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:15.816
was no longer there,

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.576
just because I stayed engaged --

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.216
because I didn't run.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.600
I said, "Wow, great,
I'm already learning things.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.736
Great."

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.960
And then Day Three:
Getting Olympic Doughnuts.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.280
This is where my life
was turned upside down.
