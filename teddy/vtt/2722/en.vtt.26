00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.096
so I went to University
of Texas at Austin

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.336
and knocked on professors' doors
and said, "Can I teach your class?"

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.856
I didn't get anywhere
the first couple of times.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.376
But because I didn't run --
I kept doing it --

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.736
and on the third try
the professor was very impressed.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.816
He was like, "No one
has done this before."

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.856
And I came in prepared
with powerpoints and my lesson.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.936
He said, "Wow, I can use this.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.296
Why don't you come back in two months?
I'll fit you in my curriculum."

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.416
And two months later
I was teaching a class.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.696
This is me -- you probably can't see,
this is a bad picture.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.496
You know, sometimes you get
rejected by lighting, you know?
