00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.736
I went to a Krispy Kreme.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.976
It's a doughnut shop

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.616
in mainly the Southeastern part
of the United States.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.496
I'm sure they have some here, too.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.775
And I went in,

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.936
I said, "Can you make me doughnuts
that look like Olympic symbols?

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.856
Basically, you interlink
five doughnuts together ... "

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.120
I mean there's no way
they could say yes, right?

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.016
The doughnut maker took me so seriously.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.256
(Laughter)

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.496
So she put out paper,

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.696
started jotting down
the colors and the rings,

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.736
and is like, "How can I make this?"

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.656
And then 15 minutes later,

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.096
she came out with a box
that looked like Olympic rings.
