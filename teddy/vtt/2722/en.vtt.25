00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.360
People were more likely to say yes to me.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.136
And then I learned
I could fulfill my life dream ...

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.576
by asking.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.696
You know, I came
from four generations of teachers,

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.536
and my grandma has always told me,

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.856
"Hey Jia, you can do anything you want,

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.936
but it'd be great
if you became a teacher."

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.376
(Laughter)

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.656
But I wanted to be
an entrepreneur, so I didn't.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.056
But it has always been my dream
to actually teach something.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.896
So I said, "What if I just ask

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.536
and teach a college class?"

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.016
I lived in Austin at the time,

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.096
so I went to University
of Texas at Austin
