00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.696
I've got to be a better leader.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.240
I've got to be a better person.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.096
I cannot let that six-year-old
keep dictating my life anymore.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.200
I have to put him back in his place.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.416
So this is where I went online
and looked for help.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.696
Google was my friend.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.856
(Laughter)

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.440
I searched, "How do I overcome
the fear of rejection?"

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.816
I came up with a bunch
of psychology articles

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.696
about where the fear
and pain are coming from.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.016
Then I came up with a bunch
of "rah-rah" inspirational articles

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.421
about "Don't take it personally,
just overcome it."

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.856
Who doesn't know that?
