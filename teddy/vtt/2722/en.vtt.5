00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.240
This is also bad handwriting,
but I did highlight some key words.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.816
You get the idea.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.616
(Laughter)

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.840
So ...

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.296
that was another version of me:

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.000
one who will conquer the world.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.336
Well, then two years later,

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.296
I was presented with the opportunity
to come to the United States.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.896
I jumped on it,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.136
because that was
where Bill Gates lived, right?

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.376
(Laughter)

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.040
I thought that was the start
of my entrepreneur journey.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.856
Then, fast-forward another 14 years.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.296
I was 30.
