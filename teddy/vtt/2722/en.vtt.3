00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.080
into a public roast
for three six-year-olds.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.056
And without the humor.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.416
You know, when you see
people get roasted on TV,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.656
it was funny.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.538
There was nothing funny about that day.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.336
So that was one version of me,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.856
and I would die to avoid
being in that situation again --

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.760
to get rejected in public again.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.896
That's one version.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.376
Then fast-forward eight years.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.376
Bill Gates came to my hometown --

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.616
Beijing, China --

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.856
to speak,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.616
and I saw his message.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.936
I fell in love with that guy.
