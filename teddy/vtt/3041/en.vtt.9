00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.096
Now, justice for the people for Oaxaca

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.536
is still far off,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.040
but their stories, their truths,
can no longer be denied.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.016
So we started thinking:

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.736
What if you had "Proof Mode?"

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.896
What if everybody had
a camera in their hands

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.416
and all the platforms
had that kind of validating ability.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.696
So we developed --

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.176
together with amazing Android developers
called the Guardian Project,

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.496
we developed something called
a technology that's called Proof Mode,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.696
that marries those metadata
together with your image,
