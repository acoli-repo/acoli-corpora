00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.696
and with that tool,

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.136
LGBT organizations are now using that data

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.720
to fight for rights.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.616
And we take that data
and we take it back to Silicon Valley,

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.136
and we say to them:

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.760
"How is it possible

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.576
that these videos are still out there

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.496
in a climate of hate

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.376
egging on more hate,

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.416
summoning more violence,

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.856
when you have policies that actually say

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.096
you do not allow this kind of content? --
