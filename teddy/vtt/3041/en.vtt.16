00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.416
And it could be as simple
as this little app that we created

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.496
that just shows the perpetrator
on the other side of the phone

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.840
how many people are watching him.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.216
But now, imagine that you could put
a layer of computer task routing

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.656
on top of that.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.720
Imagine that you're a community
facing an immigration raid,

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.256
and at that very moment,
at that right moment, via livestream,

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.760
you could pull in
a hundred legal observers.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.320
How would that change the situation?

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.015
So we started piloting this
with our partner communities in Brazil.
