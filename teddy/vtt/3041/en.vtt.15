What if you could pull in
their expertise, their leverage,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.616
their solidarity, their skills

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.680

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.296

a project that's called Mobilize Us,

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.536
because many of us, I would assume,

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.216
want to help

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.856
and lend our skills and our expertise,

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.736

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.416
And it could be as simple
as this little app that we created
