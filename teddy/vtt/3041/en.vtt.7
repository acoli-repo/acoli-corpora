00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.960
The federal police came down in buses
and started shooting at the protesters.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.256
At least seven people died
and many, many more were wounded.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.656
Images started circulating
of the shootings,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.096
and the Mexican government
did what it always does.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.536
It issued a formal statement,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.936
and the statement basically
accused the independent media

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.016
of creating fake news.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.816
It said, "We were not there,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.576
that was not us doing the shooting,

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.960
this did not happen."

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.976
But we had just trained
activists in Mexico

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.776
to use metadata strategically
with their images.
