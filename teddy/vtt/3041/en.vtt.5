00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.256
and those stories
helped convince lawmakers

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.440
to pass landmark legislation
to protect older Americans.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.216
So I wonder,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.896
billions of us now have this powerful tool
right at our fingertips.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.416
It's a camera.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.256
So why are all of us not a more
powerful army of civic witnesses,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.336
like Mary and Bukeni?

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.216
Why is it that so much more video

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.760
is not leading to more rights
and more justice?
