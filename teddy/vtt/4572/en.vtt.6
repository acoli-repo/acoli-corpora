00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.722
the bottles that were supposedly
being thrown at police

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:01.897
were turned into bricks

00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:04.570
by the time they reached
this edition of the newspaper.

00:03:04.594 --> 00:03:05.745
So we were suspicious,

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.218
and we wanted to see if there
was more to the story.

00:03:08.242 --> 00:03:10.890
We needed to find those protesters
you see in the image,

00:03:10.914 --> 00:03:14.293
but, of course, they had vanished
by the time we started investigating.

00:03:14.317 --> 00:03:15.930
So how do you find the witnesses?

00:03:15.954 --> 00:03:18.248
This is, for me,
where it got really interesting.

00:03:18.272 --> 00:03:19.515
We turned to the internet.

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:21.933
This is Twitter;
you've heard a lot about it today.

00:03:21.957 --> 00:03:25.067
Essentially, for me,
when I began investigating this case,

00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:28.001
I was completely new to this;
I'd signed up two days earlier.

00:03:28.025 --> 00:03:31.229
I discovered that Twitter
was a microblogging site.
