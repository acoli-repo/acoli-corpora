10 years ago, possibly even
five years ago.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.086
I think there's a very good argument
to say that the two deaths,

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.946
the death of Ian Tomlinson
and the death of Jimmy Mubenga,

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.506
we still today wouldn't know
exactly what had happened in those cases.

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:12.916
And "Why not?" for people like yourselves?

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.535
Well, I think that's very simple, too.

00:16:15.559 --> 00:16:19.196
If you encounter something
that you believe is problematic,

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.281
that disturbs you, that concerns you,
an injustice of some kind,

00:16:23.305 --> 00:16:26.326
something that just
doesn't feel quite right,

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:31.022
then why not witness it,
record it and share it?
