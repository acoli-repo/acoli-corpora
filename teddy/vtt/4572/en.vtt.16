00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.222
Finally, it landed, and I clicked on it.

00:08:01.246 --> 00:08:04.133
And I realized: this is really
something quite significant.

00:08:04.157 --> 00:08:06.727
Within 15 hours, we put it on our website.

00:08:06.751 --> 00:08:09.456
The first thing police did
was they came to our office --

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.269
senior officers came to our office --

00:08:11.293 --> 00:08:13.026
and asked us to take the video down.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:14.209
We said no.

00:08:14.233 --> 00:08:15.983
It would have been too late, anyway,

00:08:16.007 --> 00:08:17.993
because it had traveled around the world.

00:08:18.017 --> 00:08:20.536
And the officer in that film,
in two days' time,

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.846
will appear before
an inquest jury in London,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.788
and they have the power to decide
that Ian Tomlinson was unlawfully killed.

00:08:26.812 --> 00:08:29.326
So that's the first case;
I said two cases today.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.896
The second case is this man.
