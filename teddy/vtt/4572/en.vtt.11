00:05:29.463 --> 00:05:31.173
We've plotted them here on the map.

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:33.256
This is the scene
of Ian Tomlinson's death,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.985
the Bank of England in London.

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.627
And each of these witnesses
that we plotted on the map,

00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:40.316
you could click on these
small bullet points,

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.618
and you could hear what they had to say,

00:05:42.642 --> 00:05:44.438
see their photographic image

00:05:44.462 --> 00:05:47.181
and at times,
see their videographic images as well.

00:05:47.716 --> 00:05:49.805
But still, at this stage,

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:53.735
with witnesses telling us that they'd seen
police attack Ian Tomlinson

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:54.910
before his death,

00:05:54.934 --> 00:05:57.793
still, police refused to accept that.

00:05:58.452 --> 00:06:00.970
There was no official
investigation into his death.
