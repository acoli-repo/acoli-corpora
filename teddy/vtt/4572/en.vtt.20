maybe the kind of things
journalists shouldn't do.

00:10:01.008 --> 00:10:03.996
But we needed to do it,
and we needed to use Twitter also.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.281
Here I'm saying an Angolan man
dies on a flight.

00:10:06.305 --> 00:10:08.656
This story could be big;
a level of speculation.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.176
This next tweet says, "Please RT."

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.558
That means "please retweet,"
please pass down the chain.

00:10:15.375 --> 00:10:18.227
And one of the fascinating
things about Twitter

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:20.410
is that the pattern of flow of information

00:10:20.434 --> 00:10:22.766
is unlike anything we've ever seen before.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.256
We don't really understand it,

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.502
but once you let go
of a piece of information,

00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:27.890
it travels like wind.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.345
You can't determine where it ends up.
