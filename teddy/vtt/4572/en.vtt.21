You can't determine where it ends up.

00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:32.571
But strangely,

00:10:32.595 --> 00:10:36.422
tweets have an uncanny ability
to reach their intended destination.

00:10:36.446 --> 00:10:38.697
And in this case, it was this man.

00:10:39.591 --> 00:10:43.606
He says, "I was also there on the BA77" --
that's the flight number --

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.566
"And the man was begging for help,

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.120
and I now feel so guilty
that I did nothing."

00:10:48.144 --> 00:10:49.748
This was Michael.

00:10:49.772 --> 00:10:54.181
He was on an Angolan oil field
when he sent me this tweet.

00:10:54.205 --> 00:10:55.691
I was in my office in London.

00:10:56.126 --> 00:10:58.896
He had concerns about
what happened on the flight.

00:10:59.526 --> 00:11:02.472
He'd gone onto his laptop,
he typed in the flight number.
