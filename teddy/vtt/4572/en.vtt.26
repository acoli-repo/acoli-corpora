00:12:59.126 --> 00:13:01.526
for journalists who utilize social media

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.579
and who utilize citizen journalism

00:13:03.603 --> 00:13:05.996
is making sure we get our facts correct.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.623
Verification is absolutely essential.

00:13:08.647 --> 00:13:11.462
So in the case
of the Ian Tomlinson witnesses,

00:13:11.486 --> 00:13:13.936
I got them to return
to the scene of the death

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.112
and physically walk me through

00:13:16.136 --> 00:13:18.158
and tell me exactly what they had seen.

00:13:18.819 --> 00:13:20.509
That was absolutely essential.

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:22.600
In the case of Mubenga,
we couldn't do that,

00:13:22.624 --> 00:13:24.740
but they could send us
their boarding passes.

00:13:24.764 --> 00:13:26.980
And we could interrogate
what they were saying

00:13:27.004 --> 00:13:30.474
and ensure it was consistent with what
other passengers were saying, too.
