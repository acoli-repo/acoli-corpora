I discovered that Twitter
was a microblogging site.

00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:35.373
It enabled me to send out
short, 140-character messages.

00:03:35.397 --> 00:03:37.638
Also, an amazing search facility.

00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:42.592
But it was a social arena
in which other people were gathering

00:03:42.616 --> 00:03:44.086
with a common motive.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.386
And in this case,
independently of journalists,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.086
people themselves were interrogating
exactly what had happened to Ian Tomlinson

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.644
in his last 30 minutes of life.

00:03:56.768 --> 00:03:58.434
Individuals like these two guys.

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:02.422
They went to Ian Tomlinson's aid
after he collapsed.
