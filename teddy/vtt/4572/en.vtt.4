00:01:59.324 --> 00:02:01.393
and Tomlinson died moments later.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.331
But that wasn't the story
the police wanted us to tell.

00:02:05.777 --> 00:02:09.026
Initially, through official statements
and off-the-record briefings,

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.230
they said that Ian Tomlinson
had died of natural causes.

00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:17.196
They said that there had been
no contact with the police,

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.562
that there were no marks on his body.

00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:22.950
In fact, they said that when police
tried to resuscitate him,

00:02:22.974 --> 00:02:26.183
the police medics
were impeded from doing so,

00:02:26.207 --> 00:02:30.703
because protesters were throwing missiles,
believed to be bottles, at police.
