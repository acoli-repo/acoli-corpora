00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:02.422
They went to Ian Tomlinson's aid
after he collapsed.

00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:05.185
They phoned the ambulance.

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.480
They didn't see any bottles,
they didn't see any bricks.

00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:12.084
So they were concerned
that the stories weren't quite as accurate

00:04:12.108 --> 00:04:13.929
as police were claiming them to be.

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:16.766
And again, through social media,
we started encountering

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.492
individuals with material like this:
photographs, evidence.

00:04:20.516 --> 00:04:24.190
Now, this does not show the attack
on Ian Tomlinson,

00:04:24.214 --> 00:04:26.259
but he appears to be in some distress.

00:04:26.746 --> 00:04:28.586
Was he drunk? Did he fall over?

00:04:29.024 --> 00:04:32.193
Did this have anything to do
with the police officers next to him?
