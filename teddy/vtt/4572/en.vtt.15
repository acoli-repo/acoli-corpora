Paul Lewis: OK. So, shocking stuff.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.237
That video wasn't playing too well,

00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:39.007
but I remember when I first watched
the video for myself,

00:07:39.031 --> 00:07:42.206
I'd been in touch with
this investment fund manager in New York,

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.426
and I had become obsessed with this story.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.323
I had spoken to so many people
who said they had seen this happen,

00:07:48.347 --> 00:07:50.894
and the guy on the other end
of the phone was saying,

00:07:50.918 --> 00:07:52.283
"Look, the video shows it."

00:07:52.307 --> 00:07:54.927
I didn't want to believe him
until I saw it for myself.

00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:58.006
It was two o'clock in the morning,
I was there with an IT guy --

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.256
the video wasn't coming.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.222
Finally, it landed, and I clicked on it.
