As long as your news is the right side
of a paywall, i.e, it's free,

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:05.860
anybody can access it.

00:05:05.884 --> 00:05:07.055
And stories like these,

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:09.638
which were questioning
the official version of events,

00:05:09.662 --> 00:05:11.216
which were skeptical in tone,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.996
allowed people to realize
that we had questions ourselves.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.478
They were online magnets.

00:05:16.838 --> 00:05:20.410
Individuals with material that could
help us were drawn toward us

00:05:20.434 --> 00:05:22.473
by some kind of gravitational force.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.297
And after six days, we had managed
to track down around 20 witnesses.

00:05:29.463 --> 00:05:31.173
We've plotted them here on the map.
