utilizing social media,
particularly Twitter.

00:01:06.306 --> 00:01:09.916
Essentially, what I'm talking about here
is, as I said, citizen journalism.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.354
So, to take the first case:

00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:15.035
this is Ian Tomlinson,
the man in the foreground.

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:18.127
He was a newspaper vendor from London,

00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:24.578
and on the 1st of April 2009,
he died at the G20 protests in London.

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:27.125
Now, he had been -- he wasn't a protester,

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.357
he'd been trying to find
his way home from work

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:30.755
through the demonstrations.
