I'm here to talk to you about
a new way of doing journalism.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.063
Some people call this
"citizen journalism,"

00:00:08.087 --> 00:00:10.400
other people call it
"collaborative journalism."

00:00:10.424 --> 00:00:15.604
But really, it kind of means this:
for the journalists, people like me,

00:00:15.628 --> 00:00:18.804
it means accepting
that you can't know everything,

00:00:18.828 --> 00:00:21.386
and allowing other people,
through technology,

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.282
to be your eyes and your ears.

00:00:24.048 --> 00:00:27.600
And for people like you,
for other members of the public,

00:00:27.624 --> 00:00:30.949
it can mean not just being
the passive consumers of news,
