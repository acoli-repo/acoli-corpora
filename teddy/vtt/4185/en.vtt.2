Some of you are thinking of robots 
from science fiction films

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.850
or probably machines in factories.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.230
Some robots don’t even have bodies,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.930
like the ones who interact 
on the phone or text.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.320
We call them bots.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.390
Would you believe
I have bots even at home?

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.200
My bots shop for me,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.880
clean the house,

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.770
mow the grass on my lawn,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.640
and soon they will be driving my car, too!

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.720
For years we have been dreaming
of such personal bots,
