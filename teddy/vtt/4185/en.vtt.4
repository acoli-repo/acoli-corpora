00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.200
the locks to your home, light switches,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.240
the tea machine,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.350
they will all be
part of your digital life,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.440
along with your phone, calendar,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.280
social network and music.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.600
There is one problem 
in this picture-perfect life:

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.480
Think ...

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.040
How will you control all these devices?

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.760
You already have
so many apps in your phone.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.200
Calendar app,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.320
an app for shopping,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.440
a music app,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.920
now an app for the car,

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.080
an app for the fridge,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.360
an app for light switches,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.880
an app to make tea?

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.720
You will have to learn 
the interface for each app.
