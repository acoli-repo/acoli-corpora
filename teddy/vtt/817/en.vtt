00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I love video games.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm also slightly in awe of them.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm in awe of their power

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in terms of imagination, in terms of technology,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in terms of concept.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But I think, above all,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm in awe at their power

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to motivate, to compel us,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to transfix us,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
like really nothing else we've ever invented

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
has quite done before.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And I think that we can learn some pretty amazing things

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
by looking at how we do this.
