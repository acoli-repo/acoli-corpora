00:02:59.553 --> 00:03:00.851
Here's an analogy.

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:02.512
We all know that in childhood,

00:03:02.536 --> 00:03:05.016
boys tend to be taller than girls,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.550
but go into any elementary
school classroom,

00:03:07.574 --> 00:03:10.747
and you'll find some girls
who are taller than some boys.

00:03:11.778 --> 00:03:14.485
So while growing up in poverty
is certainly a risk factor

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:16.237
for a smaller brain surface,

00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:20.144
in no way can I know an individual
child's family income

00:03:20.168 --> 00:03:21.439
and know with any accuracy

00:03:21.463 --> 00:03:24.293
what that particular child's brain
would look like.

00:03:25.167 --> 00:03:28.009
I want you to imagine,
for a moment, two children.

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:30.943
One is a young child
born into poverty in America;
