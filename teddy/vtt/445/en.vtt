00:00:00.971 --> 00:00:04.210
What I'm about to share with you
are findings from a study

00:00:04.234 --> 00:00:07.385
of the brains of more than 1,000
children and adolescents.

00:00:08.038 --> 00:00:10.038
Now, these were children
who were recruited

00:00:10.062 --> 00:00:12.352
from diverse homes
around the United States,

00:00:12.376 --> 00:00:15.422
and this picture is an average
of all of their brains.

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.403
The front of this average brain
is on your left

00:00:18.427 --> 00:00:20.875
and the back of this average brain
is on your right.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.686
Now, one of the things
we were very interested in

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.825
was the surface area
of the cerebral cortex,

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.863
or the thin, wrinkly layer
on the outer surface of the brain

00:00:29.887 --> 00:00:32.807
that does most
of the cognitive heavy lifting.
