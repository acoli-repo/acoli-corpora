00:02:29.278 --> 00:02:33.611
is that this link between family income
and children's brain structure

00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:35.800
didn't depend on the children's age,

00:02:35.824 --> 00:02:38.045
it didn't depend on their sex

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.485
and it didn't depend
on their race or ethnicity.

00:02:41.982 --> 00:02:43.132
And the final point --

00:02:43.156 --> 00:02:44.510
and this one's key --

00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:49.006
there was tremendous variability
from one child to the next,

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.334
by which I mean there were plenty
of children from higher-income homes

00:02:52.358 --> 00:02:54.193
with smaller brain surfaces

00:02:54.217 --> 00:02:56.997
and plenty of children
from lower-income homes

00:02:57.021 --> 00:02:58.644
with larger brain surfaces.

00:02:59.553 --> 00:03:00.851
Here's an analogy.
