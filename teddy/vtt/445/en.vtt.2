00:01:04.943 --> 00:01:08.652
was associated with a larger
cortical surface area in that spot.

00:01:09.592 --> 00:01:12.203
And there were some regions,
shown here in yellow,

00:01:12.227 --> 00:01:14.856
where that association
was particularly pronounced.

00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:19.895
And those are regions that we know support
a certain set of cognitive skills:

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:23.329
language skills
like vocabulary and reading

00:01:23.353 --> 00:01:25.645

to avoid distraction

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:27.091
and exert self-control.

00:01:27.525 --> 00:01:29.022
And that's important,

00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:31.025
because those are the very skills
