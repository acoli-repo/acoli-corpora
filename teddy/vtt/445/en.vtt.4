00:01:59.588 --> 00:02:01.952
relatively small differences
in family income

00:02:01.976 --> 00:02:05.646
were associated with proportionately
greater differences in brain structure

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.113
among the most disadvantaged families.

00:02:08.137 --> 00:02:10.297
And intuitively, that makes sense, right?

00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:14.583
An extra 20,000 dollars for a family
earning, say, 150,000 dollars a year

00:02:14.607 --> 00:02:18.917
would certainly be nice,
but probably not game-changing,

00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:20.765
whereas an extra 20,000 dollars

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.190
for a family only earning
20,000 dollars a year

00:02:23.214 --> 00:02:26.420
would likely make a remarkable difference
in their day-to-day lives.

00:02:27.254 --> 00:02:29.254
Now, the second point
I'd like to highlight

00:02:29.278 --> 00:02:33.611
is that this link between family income
and children's brain structure
