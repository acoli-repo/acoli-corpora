00:05:27.896 --> 00:05:30.161
most commonly through
school-based initiatives.

00:05:30.486 --> 00:05:33.772
Now, should we be encouraging teachers
to focus on the kinds of skills

00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:36.770
that disadvantaged kids
are most likely to struggle with?

00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:37.945
Of course.

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:41.237
The importance of high-quality education
based in scientific evidence

00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:42.695
really can't be overstated.

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:45.577
And there are a number of examples
of excellent interventions

00:05:45.601 --> 00:05:48.029
targeting things like literacy
or self-regulation

00:05:48.053 --> 00:05:51.609
that do in fact improve kids' cognitive
development and their test scores.

00:05:52.647 --> 00:05:56.184
But as any intervention scientist
doing this work would tell you,

00:05:56.208 --> 00:05:57.574
this work is challenging.

00:05:57.598 --> 00:06:00.823
It's hard to implement high-quality,
evidence-based education.
