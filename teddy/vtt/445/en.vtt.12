00:05:57.598 --> 00:06:00.823
It's hard to implement high-quality,
evidence-based education.

00:06:00.847 --> 00:06:02.297
And it can be labor-intensive,

00:06:02.321 --> 00:06:04.754
it's sometimes costly.

00:06:04.778 --> 00:06:08.611
And in many cases, these disparities
in child development emerge early --

00:06:08.635 --> 00:06:10.737
well before the start
of formal schooling --

00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:12.996
sometimes when kids are just toddlers.

00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:15.004
And so I would argue:

00:06:15.028 --> 00:06:16.980
school is very important,

00:06:17.004 --> 00:06:20.110
but if we're focusing
all of our policy efforts

00:06:20.134 --> 00:06:21.709
on formal schooling,

00:06:21.733 --> 00:06:23.920
we're probably starting too late.

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:27.095
So what about taking a step back

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:29.898
and focusing on trying to change
children's experiences?
