00:01:29.046 --> 00:01:31.025
because those are the very skills

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.512
that children living in poverty
are most likely to struggle with.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.029
In fact, a child living with poverty

00:01:38.053 --> 00:01:42.519
is likely to perform worse on tests
of language and impulse control

00:01:42.543 --> 00:01:44.664
before they even turn two.

00:01:46.013 --> 00:01:49.486
Now, there are a few points
I'd like to highlight about this study.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.677
Number one:

00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:54.359
this link between family income
and children's brain structure

00:01:54.383 --> 00:01:56.898
was strongest at the lowest income levels.

00:01:57.447 --> 00:01:59.564
So that means that dollar for dollar,

00:01:59.588 --> 00:02:01.952
relatively small differences
in family income
