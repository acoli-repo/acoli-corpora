00:06:58.406 --> 00:07:00.430
to promote children's brain development

00:07:00.454 --> 00:07:02.701
and ultimately improve
their learning outcomes.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.310
As one example,

00:07:04.334 --> 00:07:07.583
take something I'll call
the home language environment,

00:07:07.607 --> 00:07:11.242
by which I mean, we know
that the number of words kids hear

00:07:11.266 --> 00:07:14.076
and the number of conversations
they're engaged in every day

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.527
can vary tremendously.

00:07:16.067 --> 00:07:17.351
By some estimates,

00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:19.632
kids from more advantaged backgrounds

00:07:19.656 --> 00:07:22.792
hear an average of 30 million
more spoken words

00:07:22.816 --> 00:07:24.493
in the first few years of life

00:07:24.517 --> 00:07:27.045
compared to kids from less
advantaged backgrounds.

00:07:27.745 --> 00:07:29.285
Now, in our work, we're finding

00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:32.230
that kids who experience
more back-and-forth,
