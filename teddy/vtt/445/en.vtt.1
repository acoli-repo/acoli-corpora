00:00:29.887 --> 00:00:32.807
that does most
of the cognitive heavy lifting.

00:00:34.673 --> 00:00:37.814
And that's because past work
by other scientists has suggested

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:39.382
that in many cases,

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:41.660
a larger cortical surface area

00:00:41.684 --> 00:00:44.287
is often associated
with higher intelligence.

00:00:45.221 --> 00:00:48.258
Now, in this study, we found one factor

00:00:48.282 --> 00:00:50.855
that was associated
with the cortical surface area

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.061
across nearly the entire
surface of the brain.

00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:58.765
That factor was family income.
