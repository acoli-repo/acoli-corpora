00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:32.230
that kids who experience
more back-and-forth,

00:07:32.254 --> 00:07:34.481
responsive conversational turns

00:07:34.505 --> 00:07:37.868
tend to have a larger brain surface
in parts of the brain

00:07:37.892 --> 00:07:40.811
that we know are responsible
for language and reading skills.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.854
And in fact, the number
of conversations they hear

00:07:43.878 --> 00:07:47.457
seems to matter a little bit more
than the sheer number of words they hear.

00:07:48.432 --> 00:07:50.384
So one tantalizing possibility

00:07:50.408 --> 00:07:53.384
is that we should be teaching parents
not just to talk a lot,

00:07:53.408 --> 00:07:56.319
but to actually have more conversations
with their children.

00:07:56.752 --> 00:07:59.705
In this way, it's possible
that we'll promote brain development

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.455
and perhaps their kids' language
and reading skills.
