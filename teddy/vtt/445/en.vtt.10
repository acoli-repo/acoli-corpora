00:04:57.934 --> 00:05:00.462
So what can we tell schools,
teachers and parents

00:05:00.486 --> 00:05:03.296
who want to help support kids
from disadvantaged backgrounds

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.265
to do their best in school and in life?

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.748
Well, emerging science suggests

00:05:07.772 --> 00:05:12.040
that growing up in poverty is associated
with a host of different experiences

00:05:12.064 --> 00:05:14.713
and that these experiences
in turn may work together

00:05:14.737 --> 00:05:17.920
to help shape brain development
and ultimately help kids learn.

00:05:18.225 --> 00:05:19.580
And so if this is right,

00:05:19.604 --> 00:05:20.928
it begs the question:

00:05:20.952 --> 00:05:23.977
Where along this pathway
can we step in and provide help?

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.872
So let's consider first intervening
at the level of learning itself --

00:05:27.896 --> 00:05:30.161
most commonly through
school-based initiatives.
