00:08:58.027 --> 00:09:00.599
I'm privileged to be working
with a team of economists,

00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:02.708
social policy experts and neuroscientists

00:09:02.732 --> 00:09:04.925
in leading Baby's First Years,

00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:07.145
the first-ever randomized study

00:09:07.169 --> 00:09:12.514
to test whether poverty reduction causes
changes in children's brain development.

00:09:13.846 --> 00:09:15.928
Now, the ambition of the study is large,

00:09:15.952 --> 00:09:18.044
but the premise is actually quite simple.

00:09:18.626 --> 00:09:19.776
In May of 2018,

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.841
we began recruiting 1,000 mothers
living below the federal poverty line

00:09:23.865 --> 00:09:26.900
shortly after they gave birth
in a number of American hospitals.

00:09:28.076 --> 00:09:29.673
Upon enrolling in our study,

00:09:29.697 --> 00:09:33.859
all mothers receive
an unconditional monthly cash gift
