00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:30.943
One is a young child
born into poverty in America;

00:03:30.967 --> 00:03:33.484
the other is also an American child,

00:03:33.508 --> 00:03:36.171
but one who was born
into more fortunate circumstances.

00:03:37.286 --> 00:03:41.228
Now, at birth, we find
absolutely no differences

00:03:41.252 --> 00:03:42.778
in how their brains work.

00:03:44.322 --> 00:03:47.333
But by the time those two kids
are ready to start kindergarten,

00:03:47.357 --> 00:03:49.710
we know that the child living in poverty

00:03:49.734 --> 00:03:54.607
is likely to have cognitive scores
that are, on average, 60 percent lower

00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:56.173
than those of the other child.

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:59.216
Later on, that child living in poverty

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.542
will be five times more likely
to drop out of high school,
