What particular experiences
are associated with growing up in poverty

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.925
and might be able to be targeted
to promote brain development

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:38.576
and learning outcomes for kids?

00:06:38.957 --> 00:06:40.928
Of course, there are many, right?

00:06:40.952 --> 00:06:44.155
Nutrition, access to health care,

00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:47.588
exposure to second-hand smoke or lead,

00:06:47.612 --> 00:06:49.737
experience of stress or discrimination,

00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:51.084
to name a few.

00:06:51.653 --> 00:06:52.803
In my laboratory,

00:06:52.827 --> 00:06:55.689
we're particularly focused
on a few types of experiences

00:06:55.713 --> 00:06:58.382
that we believe may be able to be targeted

00:06:58.406 --> 00:07:00.430
to promote children's brain development
