00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.455
and perhaps their kids' language
and reading skills.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.231
And in fact, a number
of scientists are testing

00:08:05.255 --> 00:08:07.403
that exciting possibility right now.

00:08:08.055 --> 00:08:09.305
But of course, we all know

00:08:09.329 --> 00:08:12.864
that growing up in poverty is associated
with lots of different experiences

00:08:12.888 --> 00:08:15.323
beyond just how many
conversations kids are having.

00:08:15.347 --> 00:08:17.971
So how do we choose what else to focus on?

00:08:18.679 --> 00:08:20.766
The list can be overwhelming.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.152
There are a number
of high-quality interventions

00:08:23.176 --> 00:08:25.418
that do try to change
children's experience,

00:08:25.442 --> 00:08:27.078
many of which are quite effective.

00:08:27.733 --> 00:08:29.876
But again, just like
school-based initiatives,

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.080
this is hard work.
