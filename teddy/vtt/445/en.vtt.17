00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.080
this is hard work.

00:08:31.104 --> 00:08:32.366
It can be challenging,

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.878
it can be labor-intensive,

00:08:33.902 --> 00:08:36.524
sometimes costly ...

00:08:36.548 --> 00:08:37.833
and on occasion,

00:08:37.857 --> 00:08:40.820
it can be somewhat patronizing
for scientists to swoop in

00:08:40.844 --> 00:08:44.762
and tell a family what they need to change
in order for their child to succeed.

00:08:45.619 --> 00:08:48.019
So I want to share an idea with you.

00:08:49.639 --> 00:08:53.064
What if we tried to help
young children in poverty

00:08:53.088 --> 00:08:55.735
by simply giving
their families more money?

00:08:58.027 --> 00:09:00.599
