00:01:26.696 --> 00:01:31.139
At the moment, we have about
1.3 billion tons of material every year

00:01:31.163 --> 00:01:32.616
going into landfills.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.336
By 2100, it's going to be
about four billion tons.

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.663
See, instead, I'd prefer
if we started thrifting.

00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:44.234
What that means is, we consider materials
when they go into products

00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:45.649
and also when they get used,

00:01:45.673 --> 00:01:48.457
and, at the end of their life:
When can they be used again?

00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:51.594
It's the idea of completely changing
the way we think about waste,

00:01:51.618 --> 00:01:53.391
so waste is no longer a dirty word --

00:01:53.415 --> 00:01:55.550
we almost remove
the word "waste" completely.

00:01:55.574 --> 00:01:57.473
All we're looking to is resources.

00:01:57.497 --> 00:01:58.831
Resource goes into a product

00:01:58.855 --> 00:02:01.251
and then can basically go
into another product.
