00:03:28.626 --> 00:03:30.982
but it's certainly good,
and it's getting better.

00:03:31.403 --> 00:03:34.700
The industry that's not doing so well
is the architecture industry.

00:03:36.045 --> 00:03:38.648
One of the challenges
with architecture has always been

00:03:38.672 --> 00:03:41.077
when we build up, we don't think
about taking down.

00:03:41.101 --> 00:03:44.466
We don't dismantle,
we don't disassemble, we demolish.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.649
That's a challenge,

00:03:45.673 --> 00:03:48.953
because it ends up that about a third
of all landfill waste in the US

00:03:48.977 --> 00:03:50.142
is architecture.

00:03:50.911 --> 00:03:52.895
We need to think differently about this.

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.053
There are programs that can actually
reduce some of this material.

00:03:56.077 --> 00:03:57.323
A good example is this.

00:03:57.347 --> 00:04:00.688
These are actually bricks that are made
from old demolition waste,
