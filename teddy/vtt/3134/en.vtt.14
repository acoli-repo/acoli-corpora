00:06:57.824 --> 00:07:00.497
Nature also is very effective at thrift.

00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:02.728
Think about it: nature has zero waste.

00:07:02.752 --> 00:07:04.887
Everything is useful for another process.

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:07.664
So, in this case, nanocellulose,

00:07:07.688 --> 00:07:10.943
which is basically one of the very fine
building blocks of cellulose,

00:07:10.967 --> 00:07:14.637
which is one of the materials
that makes trees strong,

00:07:15.053 --> 00:07:18.339
you can isolate it, and it works
very much like carbon fiber.

00:07:18.363 --> 00:07:21.141
So, take that from a tree,
form it into fibers,

00:07:21.165 --> 00:07:23.356
and then those fibers
can strengthen things,

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.980
such as airplanes, buildings, cars.

00:07:26.291 --> 00:07:29.095
The advantage of this, though,
is it's not just bioderived,

00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:30.745
comes from a renewable resource,
