00:01:58.855 --> 00:02:01.251
and then can basically go

00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:04.861
We used to be good at thrifting.

00:02:05.236 --> 00:02:07.942
My grandmother, again,
used to use old seed packets

00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:09.369
to paper the bathroom walls.

00:02:09.393 --> 00:02:12.830
I think, though, there are companies
out there who understand this value

00:02:12.854 --> 00:02:14.060
and are promoting it.

00:02:14.466 --> 00:02:17.879
And a lot of the technologies
that have been developed for the smart age

00:02:17.903 --> 00:02:21.900
can also be adapted to reduce,
reuse and also thrift more proficiently.

00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:24.323
And as a materials scientist,

00:02:24.347 --> 00:02:26.942
what I've been tracking
over the last couple of decades

00:02:26.966 --> 00:02:29.245
is how companies
are getting smart at thrifting,

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.300
how they're able
to understand this concept
