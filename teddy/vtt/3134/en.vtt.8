These are actually bricks that are made
from old demolition waste,

00:04:00.712 --> 00:04:04.101
which includes the glass,
the rubble, the concrete.

00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:06.707
You put up a grinder,
put it all together, heat it up

00:04:06.731 --> 00:04:09.810
and make these bricks we can
basically build more buildings from.

00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:11.805
But it's only a fraction of what we need.

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:16.410
My hope is that with big data
and geotagging,

00:04:16.434 --> 00:04:17.776
we can actually change that,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.053
and be more thrifty
when it comes to buildings.

00:04:20.077 --> 00:04:23.212
If there's a building down the block
which is being demolished,

00:04:23.236 --> 00:04:24.664
are there materials there

00:04:24.688 --> 00:04:27.140
that the new building
being built here can use?

00:04:27.482 --> 00:04:30.165
Can we use that, the ability to understand
