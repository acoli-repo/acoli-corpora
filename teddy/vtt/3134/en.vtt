00:00:00.865 --> 00:00:02.465
Let's talk about thrift.

00:00:03.206 --> 00:00:07.744
Thrift is a concept where you
reduce, reuse and recycle,

00:00:07.768 --> 00:00:11.326
but yet with an economic aspect
I think has a real potential for change.

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:15.343
My grandmother, she knew about thrift.

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:17.058
This is her string jar.

00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:18.478
She never bought any string.

00:00:18.502 --> 00:00:20.218
Basically, she would collect string.

00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:23.163
It would come from the butcher's,
it would come from presents.

00:00:23.187 --> 00:00:26.182
She would put it in the jar
and then use it when it was needed.

00:00:26.206 --> 00:00:28.780
When it was finished,
whether it was tying up the roses

00:00:28.804 --> 00:00:29.955
or a part of my bike,

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.362
once finished with that,
it'd go back into the jar.
