All of our current products
are replaceable.

00:01:00.238 --> 00:01:02.592
When we get that bright, new, shiny toy,

00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:05.078
it's because, basically,
we got rid of the old one.

00:01:05.807 --> 00:01:09.789
The idea of that is, of course,
it's great in the moment,

00:01:09.813 --> 00:01:12.727
but the challenge is,
as we keep doing this,

00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:14.457
we're going to cause a problem.

00:01:14.481 --> 00:01:17.791
That problem is that
there is really no way.

00:01:17.815 --> 00:01:21.248
When you throw something away,
it typically goes into a landfill.

00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:25.482
Now, a landfill is basically something
which is not going to go away,

00:01:25.506 --> 00:01:26.672
and it's increasing.

00:01:26.696 --> 00:01:31.139
At the moment, we have about
1.3 billion tons of material every year
