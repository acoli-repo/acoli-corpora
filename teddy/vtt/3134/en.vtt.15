00:07:29.119 --> 00:07:30.745
comes from a renewable resource,

00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:32.609
but also that it is transparent,

00:07:32.633 --> 00:07:36.013
so it can be used in consumer electronics,
as well as food packaging.

00:07:36.363 --> 00:07:39.406
Not bad for something that basically
comes from the backyard.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.260
Another one from the biosource
is synthetic spider silk.

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:46.514
Now, it's very hard to actually
create spider silk naturally.

00:07:46.538 --> 00:07:48.358
You can basically get it from spiders,

00:07:48.382 --> 00:07:51.539
but in large numbers, they tend
to kill each other, eat each other,

00:07:51.563 --> 00:07:53.524
so you've got a problem with creating it,

00:07:53.548 --> 00:07:55.504
in the same way you do with regular silk.

00:07:55.528 --> 00:07:58.324
So what you can do is instead
take the DNA from the spider,

00:07:58.348 --> 00:08:00.333
and put it into various different things.
