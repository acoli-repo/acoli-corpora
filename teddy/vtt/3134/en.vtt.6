but then also the plastics
from the fender and the interiors,

00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:05.006
glass from the windows and the windshield

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.498
and also the tires.

00:03:06.522 --> 00:03:10.514
There's a mature and successful industry
that deals with these old cars

00:03:10.538 --> 00:03:13.561
and basically recycles them
and puts them back into use

00:03:13.585 --> 00:03:15.711
as new cars or other new products.

00:03:16.165 --> 00:03:18.910
Even as we move towards
battery-powered cars,

00:03:19.496 --> 00:03:22.553
there are companies that claim
they can recycle up to 90 percent

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:26.318
of the 11 million tons of batteries
that are going to be with us in 2020.

00:03:27.117 --> 00:03:28.602
That, I think, is not perfect,

00:03:28.626 --> 00:03:30.982
but it's certainly good,
and it's getting better.
