00:04:59.704 --> 00:05:02.228
Turns out, there's a company
called Land Detector

00:05:02.252 --> 00:05:05.255
that's actually working in China
and also soon in South Africa,

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:08.178
that's able to take that waste gas --

00:05:08.202 --> 00:05:11.474
about 700,000 tons per smelter --

00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:15.048
and then turn it into
about 400,000 tons of ethanol,

00:05:15.072 --> 00:05:19.615
which is equivalent to basically powering
250,000, or quarter of a million, cars

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:20.790
for a year.

00:05:20.814 --> 00:05:22.694
That's a very effective use of waste.

00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:26.589
How about products more close to home?

00:05:26.613 --> 00:05:28.276
This is a simple solution.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.164
And it, again, takes the idea
of reducing, reusing,
