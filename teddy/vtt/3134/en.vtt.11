00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.164
And it, again, takes the idea
of reducing, reusing,

00:05:31.188 --> 00:05:33.331
but then also with economic advantage.

00:05:33.355 --> 00:05:36.260
So it's a simple process
of changing from a cut and sew,

00:05:36.284 --> 00:05:39.435
where typically between
20 and 30 materials are used

00:05:39.459 --> 00:05:43.418
which are cut from a large cloth and then
sewn together or even sometimes glued,

00:05:43.442 --> 00:05:46.118
they changed it and said
that they just knitted the shoe.

00:05:46.142 --> 00:05:49.403
The advantage with this is not just
a simplification of the process,

00:05:49.427 --> 00:05:52.594
it's also, "I've got one material.
I have zero waste,"

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:56.474
and then also, "I'm able to potentially
recycle that at the end of its life."

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.569
Digital manufacturing is also allowing us
to do this more effectively.
