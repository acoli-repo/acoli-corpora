any aspect where you make something,

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.974
think about how that product
could potentially be used

00:10:04.998 --> 00:10:07.394
as a second life, or third life
or fourth life.

to be taken apart.

00:10:11.466 --> 00:10:13.236
That, to me, is the ultimate thrift,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.349
and I think that's basically
what my grandmother would love.
