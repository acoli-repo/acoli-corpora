00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.362
once finished with that,
it'd go back into the jar.

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:35.017
This is a perfect idea of thrift;
you use what you need,

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:37.732
you don't actually purchase anything,
so you save money.

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:40.676
Kids also inherently know this idea.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.707
When you want to throw out
a cardboard box,

00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:45.900
the average kid will say, "Don't!
I want to use it for a robot head

00:00:45.924 --> 00:00:48.164
or for a canoe to paddle down a river."

00:00:48.188 --> 00:00:51.622
They understand the value
of the second life of products.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.783
So, I think thrift is
a perfect counterpoint

00:00:55.807 --> 00:00:57.553
to the current age which we live in.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.214
All of our current products
are replaceable.
