00:08:28.256 --> 00:08:30.552
to again be potentially used
as a new material.

00:08:32.201 --> 00:08:34.979
I'd like to leave you with one
last form which is biobased,

00:08:35.003 --> 00:08:37.217
but this, I think,
is like the ultimate thrift.

00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:39.955
Think about the poster child
for conspicuous consumption.

00:08:39.979 --> 00:08:41.248
It's the water bottle.

00:08:41.712 --> 00:08:44.595
We have too many of them,
they're basically going everywhere,

00:08:44.619 --> 00:08:46.457
they're a problem in the ocean.

00:08:46.481 --> 00:08:48.014
What do we do with them?

00:08:48.038 --> 00:08:50.617
This process is able
not just to recycle them,

00:08:50.641 --> 00:08:52.139
but to recycle them infinitely.

00:08:52.163 --> 00:08:53.420
Why is that interesting?

00:08:53.444 --> 00:08:55.945
Because when we think
about reusing and recycling,

00:08:56.538 --> 00:09:01.680
metals, glass, things like that,
can be recycled as many times as you like.
