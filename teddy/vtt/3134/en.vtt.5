00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.300
how they're able
to understand this concept

00:02:31.324 --> 00:02:32.498
and profit from it.

00:02:33.341 --> 00:02:35.067
I'm going to give you two examples.

00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:37.711
The first one, a good one;
the second one, not so good.

00:02:37.735 --> 00:02:39.797
The first is the automotive industry.

00:02:39.821 --> 00:02:42.938
Not always known as the most
innovative or creative of industries,

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:46.490
but it turns out, they're really,

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:49.727

that goes on the road

00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:51.061
gets recycled here.

00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:54.418
And of that car, about

00:02:54.442 --> 00:02:56.109
actually gets used again.

00:02:56.584 --> 00:02:59.154
That includes, of course,
the old steel and aluminum

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:02.991
but then also the plastics
from the fender and the interiors,
