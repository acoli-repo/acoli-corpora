00:04:27.482 --> 00:04:30.165
Can we use that, the ability to understand

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:33.372
that all the materials available
in that building are still usable?

00:04:33.396 --> 00:04:36.085
Can we then basically put them
into a new building,

00:04:36.752 --> 00:04:39.512
without actually losing
any value in the process?

00:04:41.068 --> 00:04:43.164
So now let's think about other industries.

00:04:43.188 --> 00:04:45.715
What are other industries doing
to create thrift?

00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:48.301
Well, it turns out
that there are plenty of industries

00:04:48.325 --> 00:04:50.386
that are also thinking
about their own waste

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.701
and what we can do with it.

00:04:51.725 --> 00:04:54.609
A simple example is the waste
that they basically belch out

00:04:54.633 --> 00:04:56.202
as part of industrial processes.

00:04:56.226 --> 00:04:59.397
Most metal smelters give off
an awful lot of carbon dioxide.

00:04:59.704 --> 00:05:02.228
Turns out, there's a company
called Land Detector
