I basically put it in with a few enzymes,
they break it apart,

00:09:32.252 --> 00:09:34.866
they basically put it back
into its original molecules.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.341
And then from those molecules,

00:09:36.365 --> 00:09:39.247
you can build another chair
or carpet or bottle.

00:09:39.673 --> 00:09:41.406
So, the cycle is infinite.

00:09:41.966 --> 00:09:43.664
The advantage with that, of course,

00:09:43.688 --> 00:09:46.942
is that you have potentially
zero loss of material resources.

00:09:46.966 --> 00:09:48.890
Again, the perfect idea of thrift.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:54.682
So in conclusion, I just want to have
you think about -- if you make anything,

00:09:54.706 --> 00:09:56.475
if you're any part of a design firm,

00:09:56.499 --> 00:09:59.101
if you basically
are refurbishing your house --

00:09:59.125 --> 00:10:01.736
any aspect where you make something,
