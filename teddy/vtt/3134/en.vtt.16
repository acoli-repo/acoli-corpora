00:07:58.348 --> 00:08:00.333
and put it into various different things.

00:08:00.357 --> 00:08:03.046
You can put it into bacteria,
you can put it into yeast,

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.276
you can put it into milk.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.236
And what you can do then is,

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.188
the milk or the bacteria produce
in much larger volumes

00:08:09.212 --> 00:08:13.297
and then from that, spin a yarn
and then create a fabric or a rope.

00:08:13.677 --> 00:08:17.240
Again, bioderived, has incredible
strength -- about the same as Kevlar --

00:08:17.264 --> 00:08:20.344
so they're using it in things like
bulletproof vests and helmets

00:08:20.368 --> 00:08:21.521
and outdoor jackets.

00:08:21.545 --> 00:08:22.848
It has a great performance.

00:08:22.872 --> 00:08:25.469
But again, it's bioderived,
and at the end of its life,

00:08:25.493 --> 00:08:28.232
it potentially can go back
into the soil and get composted

00:08:28.256 --> 00:08:30.552
to again be potentially used
as a new material.
