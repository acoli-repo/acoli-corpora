Digital manufacturing is also allowing us
to do this more effectively.

00:06:01.593 --> 00:06:04.904
In this case, it's actually creating
the theoretical limit of strength

00:06:04.928 --> 00:06:06.080
for a material:

00:06:06.104 --> 00:06:08.686
you cannot get any stronger
for the amount of material

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.879
than this shape.

00:06:10.624 --> 00:06:12.244
So it's a basic simple block,

00:06:12.268 --> 00:06:15.851
but the idea is, I can extrapolate this,
I can make it into large formats,

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.869
I can make it into buildings, bridges,

00:06:17.893 --> 00:06:19.829
but also airplane wings and shoes.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.094
The idea here is, I'm minimizing
the amount of material.

00:06:24.101 --> 00:06:26.138
Here's a good example from architecture.

00:06:26.895 --> 00:06:31.030
Typically, these sorts of metal nodes
are used to hold up large tent structures.
