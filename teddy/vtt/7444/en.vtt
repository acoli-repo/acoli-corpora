00:00:01.998 --> 00:00:05.084
So I'm an infectious disease
epidemiologist,

00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:08.546
and it used to be the case
that when I would tell people that,

00:00:08.588 --> 00:00:11.340
they would ask me if it had
something to do with the skin.

00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:13.593
(Laughter)

00:00:15.428 --> 00:00:18.973
But thanks to COVID-19, most people
have now heard of epidemiologists.

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.144
So these days,
when I tell people what I do,

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:26.439
the questions I get asked
most frequently are more like:

00:00:27.273 --> 00:00:28.524
When does this end?

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:32.278
When do things go back to how they were?
