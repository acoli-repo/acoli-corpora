00:00:00.913 --> 00:00:02.999
It should be no surprise

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:06.711
that every community should have
a right to a clean environment.

00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:10.131
Yet, some are sacrifice zones.

00:00:10.173 --> 00:00:11.466
Sacrifice zones:

00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:16.262
communities living on the front lines
of pollution and environmental hazards.

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:20.349
But the good news is that we have
a unique opportunity

00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:21.976
to address legacy pollution

00:00:22.018 --> 00:00:27.231
as we together build an equitable
and just climate future.

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:30.860
Now, this is a story
about communities in crisis.
