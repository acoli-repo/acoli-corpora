00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.896
Now with these 40 bullock carts and garlands,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.490
the priest perched on the shoulders
of the crowd who kept hailing him,

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.680
reached home with this procession.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.296
As he stepped into the house,
the priestess asked,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.560
“So, you’re back?"

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.080
(Applause)

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.696
"You should have done
at least something in life.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.656
Today a man was gliding in the air.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.576
At least you should have done that much.”.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.170
Now that the priest realized that

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.590
she was talking about the man
gliding in the air,

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.920
he was ecstatic.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.896
He thought, "As soon as she realizes it
was me, she too will fall at my feet."
