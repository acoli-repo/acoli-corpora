00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.280
Now the priest was an honorable man

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.680
who knew nothing except
religious hymns and verses.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.536
So he decided to meditate.
Fierce meditation.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.496
Intense meditation.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.856
He meditated so much
that he found a magical spell.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.056
He started flying like a kite.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.536
Now that the priest started flying,

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.660
the villagers who were already
following him ardently,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.800
became even more ardent fans.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.315
This news spread like wildfire --

00:03:59.315 --> 00:04:02.205
not just in one or two villages
but the entire neighborhood.
