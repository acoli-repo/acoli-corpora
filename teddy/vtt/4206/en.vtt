Shah Rukh Khan: As kids, we all heard stories
from our grandmothers of flying fairies,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.630
talking parrots,
and wish-granting magic lamps.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.576
As grown ups we may have forgotten
the plots and characters in those stories,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.426
but what we always remember
is the wonderful feeling we experienced

00:00:23.426 --> 00:00:25.776
while listening ... that happy space.

00:00:25.776 --> 00:00:28.136
Our performer today is of the opinion

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.496
that stories, tales and fables have
a close bond with happiness.
