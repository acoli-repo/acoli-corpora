WEBVTT

00:04:29.341 --> 00:04:31.959
We connect people
from all across the world

00:04:31.983 --> 00:04:34.507
who discuss, work together and understand

00:04:34.531 --> 00:04:36.189
that global is the new normal

00:04:36.213 --> 00:04:38.979
and that they have more in common
than what separates them.

00:04:39.003 --> 00:04:40.902
We host weekly events

00:04:40.926 --> 00:04:44.303
in which we discuss topics
such as LGBT rights,

00:04:44.327 --> 00:04:45.478
pandemics,

00:04:45.502 --> 00:04:46.653
fiscal justice

00:04:46.677 --> 00:04:48.190
or mental health.

00:04:48.214 --> 00:04:50.192
We break down those global challenges

00:04:50.216 --> 00:04:53.298
to see how they impact people
in various parts of the world.

00:04:53.322 --> 00:04:56.059
And our members have
already shown a global thinking,

00:04:56.083 --> 00:04:59.784
actively rallying their governments
to solve those issues,

00:04:59.808 --> 00:05:03.236
like ensuring a fair distribution
of vaccines across the world.
