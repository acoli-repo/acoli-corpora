00:05:58.216 --> 00:06:01.273
Finally, we must have
the courage to leap forward

00:06:01.273 --> 00:06:03.747
to create the world of tomorrow.

00:06:03.747 --> 00:06:08.280
We need a system of governance
that works for us all across the world.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.918
And while some supernational institutions
like the United Nations exist,

00:06:12.942 --> 00:06:15.524
their enforcement mechanisms
are extremely limited.

00:06:15.924 --> 00:06:17.650
Citizens cannot participate,

00:06:17.674 --> 00:06:20.271
and national interests often prevail.

00:06:20.295 --> 00:06:21.629
And on the national level,

00:06:21.653 --> 00:06:25.694
political parties are bound
by electoral timetables and borders,

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:29.348
which means that they cannot operate
in a coordinated global manner.
