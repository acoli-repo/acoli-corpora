00:06:56.646 --> 00:07:00.053
get priority access
to future COVID-19 vaccines.

00:07:00.077 --> 00:07:03.816
We leveraged a network of doctors
on social media to raise awareness

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.099
and started a petition
targeted at the WHO.

00:07:07.591 --> 00:07:08.742
For two weeks,

00:07:08.766 --> 00:07:12.656
our members spread the word
digitally and on the streets,

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.728
and then we got a response
from the Director-General of the WHO

00:07:16.752 --> 00:07:18.411
welcoming our campaign,

00:07:18.435 --> 00:07:21.964
reemphasizing that the power to do so
lies within member states,

00:07:21.988 --> 00:07:24.772
but committing to working
with them in that direction.

00:07:24.796 --> 00:07:28.781
And look -- this was a very nice letter,
but it was completely pointless.

00:07:28.805 --> 00:07:32.050
The WHO cannot act
meaningfully on this issue.
