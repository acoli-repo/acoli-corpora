WEBVTT

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:00.083
We also realized
that to solve European issues,

00:01:00.107 --> 00:01:03.840
the outdated model of always
putting national interests first

00:01:03.864 --> 00:01:05.120
had to go.

00:01:05.144 --> 00:01:06.736
So we decided to act.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.259
For a few months, we worked on
the idea of launching Volt,

00:01:10.283 --> 00:01:12.902
the first pan-European political movement.

00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:16.129
And then, naturally, we told
our Facebook friends,

00:01:16.153 --> 00:01:19.602
and a lot of them responded
saying they were up for the challenge

00:01:19.626 --> 00:01:21.074
and wanted to help.

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:25.372
People started holding small
community meetings in parks,

00:01:25.396 --> 00:01:26.938
universities and pubs

00:01:26.962 --> 00:01:28.954
to discuss their common future

00:01:28.978 --> 00:01:32.275
and share their solutions
to the continent's biggest problems.
