00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:32.134
The underlying issue
is that the way we see the world

00:02:32.158 --> 00:02:33.541
and the way the world works

00:02:33.565 --> 00:02:34.828
are fundamentally wrong.

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.001
In the span of two generations,

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:40.604
the world has changed more
than in the previous 20,000 years.

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:42.055
We can land on the moon,

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.765
we can wake up in Shanghai
and go to bed in New York.

00:02:45.154 --> 00:02:49.373
We have access to a huge amount
of information all the time, everywhere.

00:02:49.956 --> 00:02:53.226
But we still see the world
as our immediate vicinity.

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:57.172
But issues like COVID-19,
climate change, migration,

00:02:57.196 --> 00:02:59.410
fiscal justice or human rights

00:02:59.434 --> 00:03:03.328
mean that we need to think
and unite beyond national borders.
