00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.302
For years, I have been
working on a simple idea:

00:00:04.326 --> 00:00:07.321
for humanity to take its next leap ahead,

00:00:07.345 --> 00:00:11.436
we need to work together across borders
to solve global issues.

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:13.264
In the modern world,

00:00:13.288 --> 00:00:16.133
no wall or border
can protect us from crisis.

00:00:16.157 --> 00:00:19.263
We have no other choice but to unite,

00:00:19.287 --> 00:00:21.280
and we need to do it fast.

00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:24.444
In 2016, I was devastated
by the UK's decision

00:00:24.468 --> 00:00:26.103
to leave the European Union.

00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:30.966
I'm French, and for me, the EU is a symbol
of a more open and global society.
