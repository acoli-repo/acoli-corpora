00:02:59.434 --> 00:03:03.328
mean that we need to think
and unite beyond national borders.

00:03:03.352 --> 00:03:05.697
A global approach is needed to solve them.

00:03:05.721 --> 00:03:07.170
Countries need to collaborate,

00:03:07.194 --> 00:03:09.857
share resources, information
and solutions.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.335
It's not just the right thing to do

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.101
but it's also the smart one.

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.794
So in the weeks following
Damian's election,

00:03:16.818 --> 00:03:20.202
Andrea and I decided
that we would create a global movement

00:03:20.226 --> 00:03:21.995
to unite people beyond borders

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.426
and solve those issues
that concern us all.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.130
We called it NOW!
because we're not very creative,

00:03:27.154 --> 00:03:29.191
and because it needs to happen now.

00:03:29.215 --> 00:03:32.876
So I know that going beyond national
borders is not the easiest thing to do,
