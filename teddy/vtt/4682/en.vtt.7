00:03:29.215 --> 00:03:32.876
So I know that going beyond national
borders is not the easiest thing to do,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.722
so here's the framework
that has been guiding our work.

00:03:35.746 --> 00:03:39.234
I call it "think, unite and leap forward."

00:03:39.258 --> 00:03:41.982
First, we need to change the way
we think about the world.

00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:43.264
Whether we like it or not,

00:03:43.288 --> 00:03:45.122
we already live in a globalized world.

00:03:45.146 --> 00:03:47.650
We need to stop thinking
within national frameworks

00:03:47.674 --> 00:03:49.667
and start thinking globally.

00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:52.124
Take, for example,
how we think about taxation.

00:03:52.684 --> 00:03:55.684
Multinational companies
like Facebook or Amazon

00:03:55.708 --> 00:03:58.026
already operate across borders,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.685
but they pay very little taxes
in very few countries
