00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.685
but they pay very little taxes
in very few countries

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.467
because we think of them
within national frameworks.

00:04:04.491 --> 00:04:05.641
And as a result,

00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:07.872
we lack a global tax system.

00:04:07.896 --> 00:04:09.223
Due to this,

00:04:09.247 --> 00:04:13.213
countries are deprived of at least
500 billion dollars annually.

00:04:13.876 --> 00:04:16.088
Five hundred billion dollars.

00:04:16.112 --> 00:04:17.420
To put it in perspective:

00:04:17.444 --> 00:04:19.130
with half of that amount of money,

00:04:19.154 --> 00:04:21.991
we could put an end
to global hunger for one year.

00:04:22.015 --> 00:04:23.571
But we don't,

00:04:23.595 --> 00:04:25.797
because of the way
we think about the world.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.317
At NOW! we want to change this.

00:04:29.341 --> 00:04:31.959
We connect people
from all across the world
