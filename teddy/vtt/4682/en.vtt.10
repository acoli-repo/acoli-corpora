00:04:59.808 --> 00:05:03.236
like ensuring a fair distribution
of vaccines across the world.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.234
Second, after changing the way we think,

00:05:05.258 --> 00:05:07.413
we need to unite beyond borders.

00:05:07.915 --> 00:05:11.173
This way, we can make governments
act on global issues.

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.137
Take the example of the erosion
of democracy in Hong Kong.

00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:19.131
China has systematically cracked down
on rights, democracy and freedoms,

00:05:19.155 --> 00:05:22.271
but countries have barely responded
to protect Hong Kongers.

00:05:22.735 --> 00:05:25.016
And I don't mean weak
statements of condemnation

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.568
that won't lead to any actual change,

00:05:27.592 --> 00:05:30.455
but proper responses such as sanctions.
