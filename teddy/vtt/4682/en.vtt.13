Policy making, governance and politics
need to stretch further.

00:06:34.943 --> 00:06:38.180
Take the example of the response
to the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:06:38.792 --> 00:06:43.298
Countries have shown an incredibly
shortsighted approach to the pandemic.

00:06:43.322 --> 00:06:46.348
They haven't collaborated
when it comes to protective equipment,

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:48.596
vaccines or medicines.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.379
At NOW! we launched a campaign

00:06:50.403 --> 00:06:53.058
demanding that the World Health
Organization ensures

00:06:53.082 --> 00:06:56.622
that health workers across the world,
regardless of their nationalities,

00:06:56.646 --> 00:07:00.053
get priority access
to future COVID-19 vaccines.
