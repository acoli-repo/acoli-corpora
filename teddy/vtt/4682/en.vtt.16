00:07:58.571 --> 00:08:00.620
And that's also what
we're working towards,

00:08:00.644 --> 00:08:03.499
but I know that global governance
will not happen overnight.

00:08:03.523 --> 00:08:05.899
For this, we need people
to push their governments

00:08:05.923 --> 00:08:07.449
to act in a global manner,

00:08:07.473 --> 00:08:10.198
to show that collaboration
leads to better results.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:11.921
We need to prove the case

00:08:11.945 --> 00:08:14.352
before we can change
the way the world works.

00:08:14.376 --> 00:08:16.582
So this is my framework:

00:08:16.606 --> 00:08:18.731
think beyond national borders,

00:08:18.755 --> 00:08:20.459
unite across the world

00:08:20.483 --> 00:08:24.178
and leap forward to make sure
that the world actually works as one.

00:08:24.202 --> 00:08:26.131
And I know it is easier said than done,

00:08:26.155 --> 00:08:27.331
but it is doable.

00:08:27.786 --> 00:08:29.374
Take our case as an example.

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:33.352
