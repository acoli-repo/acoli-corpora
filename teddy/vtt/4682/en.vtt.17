WEBVTT

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:33.352
NOW! was only launched
on the first of January 2020

00:08:33.376 --> 00:08:37.467
but already counts thousands of members
in more than 100 countries.

00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:40.721
We are beginning to see that it
is possible to unite beyond borders,

00:08:40.745 --> 00:08:42.672
that it is within our reach.

00:08:42.696 --> 00:08:45.804
And we're not special,
nor am I in any way.

00:08:45.828 --> 00:08:47.267
I don't have any cool skills,

00:08:47.291 --> 00:08:49.746
and the thought of giving
this talk terrified me.

00:08:50.166 --> 00:08:54.079
But I am testing different ways
to effect change on a global scale

00:08:54.103 --> 00:08:57.068
because I know that national mindsets
and national frameworks

00:08:57.092 --> 00:08:59.543
have to leave room for something bigger,

00:08:59.567 --> 00:09:00.971
for something better.
