00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It is actually a reality today

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that you can download products from the Web --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
product data, I should say, from the Web --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
perhaps tweak it and personalize it

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to your own preference or your own taste,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and have that information sent

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to a desktop machine

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that will fabricate it for you on the spot.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We can actually build for you,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
very rapidly,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
a physical object.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And the reason we can do this
