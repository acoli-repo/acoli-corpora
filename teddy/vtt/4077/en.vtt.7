00:03:27.684 --> 00:03:30.944
So another way that you 
can make words in English

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:33.885
is by squishing two 
other English words together.

00:03:33.885 --> 00:03:35.572
This is called compounding.

00:03:35.572 --> 00:03:37.082
Words in English are like Lego:

00:03:37.082 --> 00:03:40.447
If you use enough force, 
you can put any two of them together.

00:03:40.447 --> 00:03:42.112
(Laughter)

00:03:42.832 --> 00:03:44.627
We do this all the time in English:

00:03:44.627 --> 00:03:50.105
Words like "heartbroken," "bookworm," 
"sandcastle" all are compounds.

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:53.606
So go ahead and make words like
"duckface," just don't make duckface.

00:03:53.606 --> 00:03:55.085
(Laughter)

00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:59.848
Another way that you can make words 
in English is kind of like compounding,

00:03:59.848 --> 00:04:04.899
but instead you use so much force
when you squish the words together
