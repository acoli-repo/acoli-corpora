And of course, "electrocute" is a
blend of "electric" and "execute."

00:04:32.197 --> 00:04:34.007
(Laughter)

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:37.328
You can also make words
by changing how they operate.

00:04:37.328 --> 00:04:38.941
This is called functional shift.

00:04:38.941 --> 00:04:41.242
You take a word that acts 
as one part of speech,

00:04:41.242 --> 00:04:43.522
and you change it into another 
part of speech.

00:04:43.522 --> 00:04:47.541
Okay, who here knew that "friend"
hasn't always been a verb?

00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:53.076
"Friend" used to be noun 
and then we verbed it.

00:04:53.076 --> 00:04:56.345
Almost any word in English can be verbed.

00:04:56.345 --> 00:04:58.978
You can also take adjectives 
and make them into nouns.

00:04:58.978 --> 00:05:02.705
"Commercial" used to be an adjective 
and now it's a noun.
