00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.677
they don't really have a good reason.

00:00:31.677 --> 00:00:34.488
So they say something like,
"Because grammar!"

00:00:34.488 --> 00:00:36.422
(Laughter)

00:00:36.862 --> 00:00:40.425
I don't actually really care about grammar
too much -- don't tell anybody.

00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:43.564
But the word "grammar," actually,
there are two kinds of grammar.

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:46.434
There's the kind of grammar
that lives inside your brain,

00:00:46.434 --> 00:00:48.543
and if you're a native 
speaker of a language

00:00:48.543 --> 00:00:50.132
or a good speaker of a language,

00:00:50.132 --> 00:00:53.531
it's the unconscious rules that you follow
when you speak that language.

00:00:53.531 --> 00:00:56.552
And this is what you learn when
you learn a language as a child.

00:00:56.552 --> 00:00:58.189
And here's an example:

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:59.714
This is a wug, right?

00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:01.775
It's a wug.
