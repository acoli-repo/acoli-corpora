00:03:59.848 --> 00:04:04.899
but instead you use so much force
when you squish the words together

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:06.534
that some parts fall off.

00:04:06.534 --> 00:04:08.215
So these are blend words, 


00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:12.064
like "brunch" is a blend 
of "breakfast" and "lunch."

00:04:12.064 --> 00:04:14.796
"Motel" is a blend of "motor" and "hotel."

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:17.737
Who here knew that "motel" 
was a blend word?

00:04:17.737 --> 00:04:19.581
Yeah, that word is so old in English

00:04:19.581 --> 00:04:22.692
that lots of people don't know that 
there are parts missing.

00:04:22.692 --> 00:04:26.987
"Edutainment" is a blend 
of "education" and "entertainment."

00:04:26.987 --> 00:04:32.197
And of course, "electrocute" is a
blend of "electric" and "execute."
