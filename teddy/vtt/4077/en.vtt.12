00:05:58.067 --> 00:06:00.256
Why should you make words?

00:06:00.256 --> 00:06:02.397
You should make words because every word

00:06:02.397 --> 00:06:06.918
is a chance to express your idea and get 
your meaning across.

00:06:06.918 --> 00:06:09.514
And new words grab people's attention.

00:06:09.514 --> 00:06:12.163
They get people to focus on what 
you're saying

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:15.427
and that gives you a better chance to get 
your meaning across.

00:06:15.427 --> 00:06:18.376
A lot of people 
on this stage today have said,

00:06:18.376 --> 00:06:19.938
"In the future, you can do this,

00:06:19.938 --> 00:06:23.471
you can help with this, you can 
help us explore, you can help us invent."

00:06:23.471 --> 00:06:25.100
You can make a new word right now.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.433
English has no age limit.

00:06:27.433 --> 00:06:29.859
Go ahead, start making words today,

00:06:29.859 --> 00:06:33.546
send them to me, and I will put them 
in my online dictionary, Wordnik.
