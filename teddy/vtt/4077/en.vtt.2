00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:01.775
It's a wug.

00:01:01.775 --> 00:01:03.471
Now there is another one.

00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:04.634
There are two of these.

00:01:04.634 --> 00:01:05.923
There are two ...

00:01:05.923 --> 00:01:07.107
Audience: Wugs.

00:01:07.107 --> 00:01:10.820
Erin McKean: Exactly! You know 
how to make the plural of wug.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.301
That rule lives in your brain.

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:15.250
You never had to be taught this rule, 
you just understand it.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.879
This is an experiment that was invented
by a professor at [Boston University]

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:22.024
named Jean Berko Gleason back in 1958.

00:01:22.024 --> 00:01:25.049
So we've been talking about this 
for a long time.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.563
Now, these kinds of natural rules 
that exist in your brain,

00:01:28.563 --> 00:01:32.785
they're not like traffic laws,
they're more like laws of nature.
