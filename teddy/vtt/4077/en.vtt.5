00:02:28.993 --> 00:02:34.233
"Be creative, make new music, do art, 
invent things, science and technology."

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:36.271
But when it comes to 
words, they're like,

00:02:36.271 --> 00:02:40.991
"Don't! No. Creativity stops right here,
whippersnappers. Give it a rest."

00:02:41.004 --> 00:02:42.421
(Laughter)

00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:44.142
But that makes no sense to me.

00:02:44.142 --> 00:02:46.474
Words are great.
We should have more of them.

00:02:46.474 --> 00:02:50.530
I want you to make
as many new words as possible.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.538
And I'm going to tell you six ways that
you can use to make new words in English.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.639
The first way is the simplest way.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.862
Basically, steal them from other 
languages.

00:02:59.862 --> 00:03:02.686
["Go rob other people"]
(Laughter)
