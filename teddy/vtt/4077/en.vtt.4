00:01:58.296 --> 00:02:01.163
nobody has to tell you, 
"Don't wear hats on your feet."

00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:04.507
What they have to tell you is, 
"Can you wear hats inside?


00:02:04.507 --> 00:02:06.264
Who gets to wear a hat?

00:02:06.264 --> 00:02:09.396
What are the kinds of hats
you get to wear?"

00:02:09.396 --> 00:02:11.818
Those are more of the second kind 
of grammar,


00:02:11.818 --> 00:02:16.121
which linguists often call usage, 
as opposed to grammar.

00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:20.255
Now, sometimes people use this kind of 
rules-based grammar

00:02:20.255 --> 00:02:23.043
to discourage people from making up words.

00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:25.727
And I think that is, well, stupid.

00:02:25.727 --> 00:02:28.993
So, for example, 
people are always telling you,

00:02:28.993 --> 00:02:34.233
"Be creative, make new music, do art, 
invent things, science and technology."
