00:02:59.862 --> 00:03:02.686
["Go rob other people"]
(Laughter)

00:03:03.936 --> 00:03:05.764
Linguists call this borrowing,

00:03:05.764 --> 00:03:08.824
but we never give the words back ,
so I'm just going to be honest

00:03:08.824 --> 00:03:10.784
and call it stealing.

00:03:10.784 --> 00:03:14.154
We usually take words for things 
that we like, like delicious food.

00:03:14.154 --> 00:03:17.944
We took "kumquat" from Chinese,
we took "caramel" from French.

00:03:17.944 --> 00:03:20.851
We also take words 
for cool things like "ninja," right?

00:03:20.851 --> 00:03:22.301
We took that from Japanese,

00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:25.570
which is kind of a cool trick because 
ninjas are hard to steal from.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.684
(Laughter)

00:03:27.684 --> 00:03:30.944
So another way that you 
can make words in English
