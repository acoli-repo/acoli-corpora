00:01:28.563 --> 00:01:32.785
they're not like traffic laws,
they're more like laws of nature.

00:01:32.785 --> 00:01:36.140
And nobody has to remind you to obey 
a law of nature, right?

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.093
When you leave the house in the morning, 
your mom doesn't say,

00:01:39.093 --> 00:01:41.972
"Hey, honey, I think
it's going to be cold, take a hoodie,

00:01:41.972 --> 00:01:44.439
don't forget to obey the law of gravity."

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.325
Nobody says this.

00:01:46.325 --> 00:01:53.182
Now, there are other rules that are more
about manners than they are about nature.

00:01:53.182 --> 00:01:56.046
So you can think of a word as like a hat.

00:01:56.046 --> 00:01:58.296
Once you know how hats work,

00:01:58.296 --> 00:02:01.163
nobody has to tell you, 
"Don't wear hats on your feet."
