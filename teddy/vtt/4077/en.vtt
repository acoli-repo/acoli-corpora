00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.928
I'm a lexicographer.

00:00:01.928 --> 00:00:03.682
I make dictionaries.

00:00:03.682 --> 00:00:05.121
And my job as a lexicographer

00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:08.841
is to try to put all the words possible 
into the dictionary.

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:14.924
My job is not to decide what a word is;
that is your job.

00:00:14.924 --> 00:00:17.821
Everybody who speaks English 
decides together

00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:20.153
what's a word and what's not a word.

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:25.305
Every language is just a group of people
who agree to understand each other.

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:29.909
Now, sometimes when people are trying 
to decide whether a word is good or bad,

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.677
they don't really have a good reason.
