00:01:57.948 --> 00:02:01.888
Half or more of those who undergo 
treatment experience an improvement

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:03.758
in their symptoms.


00:02:03.758 --> 00:02:09.368
Most patients treated with ECT have two or
three sessions per week for several weeks.

00:02:09.368 --> 00:02:13.908
Some begin to notice an improvement
in their symptoms after just one session,

00:02:13.908 --> 00:02:16.798
while others take longer to respond.


00:02:16.798 --> 00:02:21.178
Patients often continue less frequent
treatments for several months to a year,

00:02:21.178 --> 00:02:25.938
and some need occasional maintenance
sessions for the rest of their lives.

00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:28.568
Modern ECT is much safer than
it used to be,

00:02:28.568 --> 00:02:31.578
but patients can still 
experience side effects.
