00:00:56.038 --> 00:01:01.228
In its early years, doctors administered a
strong electrical current to the brain,

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:03.998
causing a whole-body seizure
during which

00:01:03.998 --> 00:01:08.278
patients might bite their tongues
or even break bones.


00:01:08.278 --> 00:01:11.328
Modern ECT is very different.

00:01:11.328 --> 00:01:14.338
While a patient is under 
general anesthesia,

00:01:14.338 --> 00:01:19.298
electrodes deliver a series
of mild electrical pulses to the brain.

00:01:19.298 --> 00:01:23.728
This causes huge numbers of neurons
to fire in unison:

00:01:23.728 --> 00:01:26.918
a brief, controlled seizure.

00:01:26.918 --> 00:01:31.138
A muscle relaxant keeps spasms
from spreading to the rest of his body.
