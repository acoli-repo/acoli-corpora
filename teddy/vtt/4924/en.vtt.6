Neurons in the brain communicate via
electrical signals,

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:06.668
which influence our brain chemistry, 
contributing to mood and behavior.

00:03:06.668 --> 00:03:12.418
The flood of electrical activity sparked
by ECT alters that chemistry.

00:03:12.418 --> 00:03:16.858
For example, ECT triggers the release
of certain neurotransmitters,


00:03:16.858 --> 00:03:21.168
molecules that help carry signals between
neurons and influence mental health.

00:03:21.178 --> 00:03:27.008
ECT also stimulates the flow of hormones
that may help reduce symptoms of depression.


00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:31.498
Interestingly, ECT maintenance works
better when paired with medication,
