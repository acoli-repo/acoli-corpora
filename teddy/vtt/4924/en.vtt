00:00:06.748 --> 00:00:13.248
In 1982, a young nurse was suffering
from severe, unrelenting depression.

00:00:13.248 --> 00:00:14.888
She couldnâ€™t work, socialize,

00:00:14.888 --> 00:00:19.188
or even concentrate well enough
to read the newspaper.

00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:21.878
One treatment changed everything.

00:00:21.878 --> 00:00:28.668
After two courses of electroconvulsive
therapy, or ECT, her symptoms lifted.

00:00:28.668 --> 00:00:33.508
She went back to work, then on to graduate
school, where she earned high grades.
