00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:31.498
Interestingly, ECT maintenance works
better when paired with medication,

00:03:31.498 --> 00:03:35.158
even in patients who were
resistant to medication before.

00:03:35.158 --> 00:03:38.008
As we come to a better 
understanding of the brain,

00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:43.388
we’ll likely be able to make 
ECT even more effective.

00:03:43.388 --> 00:03:48.128
In 1995, more than a decade after
her first course of ECT,


00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:52.008
the nurse decided to publish an
account of her experience.

00:03:52.008 --> 00:03:53.998
Because of the stigma surrounding
the treatment,

00:03:53.998 --> 00:03:56.518
she worried that doing so
might negatively impact

00:03:56.518 --> 00:03:58.878
her personal and professional life,

00:03:58.878 --> 00:04:04.388
but she knew ECT could make a difference
for patients when all else failed.
