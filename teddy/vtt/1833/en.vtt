I want to start my talk today with two observations

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
about the human species.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and that's that our species, Homo sapiens,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
is actually really, really smart --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
like, ridiculously smart --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
like you're all doing things

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that no other species on the planet does right now.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And this is, of course,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
not the first time you've probably recognized this.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Of course, in addition to being smart, we're also an extremely vain species.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You know, so I could turn to pretty much any sage
