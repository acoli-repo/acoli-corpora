00:11:27.135 --> 00:11:30.375
when you call your friends and say,
"I think I need to see somebody.

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:32.205
Do you have any recommendations?"

00:11:32.229 --> 00:11:34.278
Because about five
of my friends were like,

00:11:34.302 --> 00:11:36.446
"Wooo, I wouldn't want
to be your therapist."

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.208
(Laughter)

00:11:39.232 --> 00:11:41.209
I was like, "What does that mean?"

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:44.440
And they're like,
"I'm just saying, you know.

00:11:44.464 --> 00:11:46.441
Don't bring your measuring stick."

00:11:46.465 --> 00:11:49.201
(Laughter)

00:11:49.225 --> 00:11:50.425
I was like, "Okay."

00:11:51.285 --> 00:11:53.119
So I found a therapist.

00:11:53.143 --> 00:11:55.046
My first meeting with her, Diana --

00:11:56.849 --> 00:12:01.143
I brought in my list of the way
the whole-hearted live, and I sat down.
