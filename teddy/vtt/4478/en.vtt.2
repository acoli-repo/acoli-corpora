00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.879
I collect stories; that's what I do.

00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:04.301
And maybe stories
are just data with a soul.

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:06.706
And maybe I'm just a storyteller.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.389
And so I said, "You know what?

00:01:08.413 --> 00:01:11.054
Why don't you just say
I'm a researcher-storyteller."

00:01:11.078 --> 00:01:14.706
And she went, "Ha ha.
There's no such thing."

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.413
(Laughter)

00:01:16.437 --> 00:01:20.414
So I'm a researcher-storyteller,
and I'm going to talk to you today --

00:01:20.438 --> 00:01:22.487
we're talking about
expanding perception --

00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:24.893
and so I want to talk to you
and tell some stories

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:30.076
about a piece of my research
that fundamentally expanded my perception
