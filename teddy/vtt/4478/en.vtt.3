00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:30.076
about a piece of my research
that fundamentally expanded my perception

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.989
and really actually changed
the way that I live and love

00:01:33.013 --> 00:01:34.187
and work and parent.

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:36.965
And this is where my story starts.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.413
When I was a young researcher,
doctoral student,

00:01:40.437 --> 00:01:44.414
my first year, I had
a research professor who said to us,

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:48.384
"Here's the thing, if you cannot
measure it, it does not exist."

00:01:50.114 --> 00:01:52.706
And I thought he was just
sweet-talking me.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.516
I was like, "Really?"
and he was like, "Absolutely."

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.793
And so you have to understand

00:01:57.817 --> 00:02:00.397
that I have a bachelor's
and a master's in social work,
