00:05:28.545 --> 00:05:31.236
I'm going in, I'm going
to figure this stuff out,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.570
I'm going to spend a year,
I'm going to totally deconstruct shame,

00:05:34.594 --> 00:05:36.872
I'm going to understand
how vulnerability works,

00:05:36.896 --> 00:05:38.331
and I'm going to outsmart it.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.650
So I was ready, and I was really excited.

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.122
As you know,
it's not going to turn out well.

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:49.659
(Laughter)

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:51.277
You know this.

00:05:51.301 --> 00:05:53.190
So, I could tell you a lot about shame,

00:05:53.214 --> 00:05:55.311
but I'd have to borrow
everyone else's time.

00:05:55.335 --> 00:05:58.192
But here's what I can tell you
that it boils down to --

00:05:58.216 --> 00:06:01.598
and this may be one of the most important
things that I've ever learned
