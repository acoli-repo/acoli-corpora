These are whole-hearted people,
living from this deep sense of worthiness.

00:08:00.087 --> 00:08:02.943
So I wrote at the top
of the manila folder,

00:08:02.967 --> 00:08:04.896
and I started looking at the data.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:10.913
In fact, I did it first in a four-day,
very intensive data analysis,

00:08:10.937 --> 00:08:14.514
where I went back, pulled the interviews,
the stories, pulled the incidents.

00:08:14.538 --> 00:08:16.317

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.087

00:08:20.111 --> 00:08:23.088
because I always go into this
Jackson Pollock crazy thing,

00:08:23.112 --> 00:08:26.857
where I'm just writing
and in my researcher mode.

00:08:28.365 --> 00:08:29.912
And so here's what I found.
