00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.007
when we're waiting for the call.

00:14:31.031 --> 00:14:33.920
It was funny, I sent something out
on Twitter and on Facebook

00:14:33.944 --> 00:14:36.218
that says, "How would you
define vulnerability?

00:14:36.242 --> 00:14:37.790
What makes you feel vulnerable?"

00:14:37.814 --> 00:14:40.538
And within an hour and a half,
I had 150 responses.

00:14:40.562 --> 00:14:43.535
Because I wanted to know what's out there.

00:14:45.944 --> 00:14:50.967
Having to ask my husband for help
because I'm sick, and we're newly married;

00:14:50.991 --> 00:14:52.998
initiating sex with my husband;

00:14:53.022 --> 00:14:55.736
initiating sex with my wife;

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.738
being turned down; asking someone out;

00:14:58.762 --> 00:15:00.801
waiting for the doctor to call back;
