00:13:58.333 --> 00:14:01.420
I lost the fight,

00:14:01.444 --> 00:14:03.143
but probably won my life back.

00:14:03.467 --> 00:14:05.443
And so then I went back into the research

00:14:05.467 --> 00:14:07.143
and spent the next couple of years

00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:10.143
really trying to understand
what they, the whole-hearted,

00:14:10.167 --> 00:14:16.143
what choices they were making,
and what we are doing with vulnerability.

00:14:16.167 --> 00:14:18.507
Why do we struggle with it so much?

00:14:18.531 --> 00:14:20.692
Am I alone in struggling
with vulnerability?

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.143
No.

00:14:23.167 --> 00:14:24.628
So this is what I learned.

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.366
We numb vulnerability --

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.007
when we're waiting for the call.
