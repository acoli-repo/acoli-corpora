00:00:27.685 --> 00:00:30.163
And she said, "But the thing
I liked about your talk

00:00:30.187 --> 00:00:31.403
is you're a storyteller.

00:00:31.427 --> 00:00:34.141
So I think what I'll do
is just call you a storyteller."

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.706
And of course, the academic,
insecure part of me

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.040
was like, "You're going
to call me a what?"

00:00:40.064 --> 00:00:42.612
And she said, "I'm going
to call you a storyteller."

00:00:42.636 --> 00:00:45.485
And I was like, "Why not 'magic pixie'?"

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:47.988

00:00:48.388 --> 00:00:51.666
I was like, "Let me think
about this for a second."

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:54.570
I tried to call deep on my courage.

00:00:54.594 --> 00:00:57.706
And I thought, you know,
I am a storyteller.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.134
I'm a qualitative researcher.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.879
I collect stories; that's what I do.
