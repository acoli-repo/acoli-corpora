Courage, the original
definition of courage,

00:08:44.213 --> 00:08:46.566
it's from the Latin word "cor,"
meaning "heart" --

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.601

the story of who you are

00:08:49.625 --> 00:08:51.039

the courage to be imperfect.

00:08:58.372 --> 00:09:03.349
They had the compassion to be kind
to themselves first and then to others,
