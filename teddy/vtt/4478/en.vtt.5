00:02:28.452 --> 00:02:30.547
"Lean into the discomfort of the work."

00:02:31.277 --> 00:02:33.809
And I'm like, knock discomfort
upside the head

00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:36.111
and move it over and get all A's.

00:02:36.135 --> 00:02:38.047
That was my mantra.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.706
So I was very excited about this.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.706
And so I thought, you know what,
this is the career for me,

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.706
because I am interested
in some messy topics.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.101
But I want to be able
to make them not messy.

00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:51.447
I want to understand them.

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:55.048
I want to hack into these things
that I know are important

00:02:55.072 --> 00:02:57.048
and lay the code out for everyone to see.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.389
So where I started was with connection.
