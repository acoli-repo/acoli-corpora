00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.389
So where I started was with connection.

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:03.825
Because, by the time
you're a social worker for 10 years,

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.556
what you realize is that connection
is why we're here.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.960
It's what gives purpose
and meaning to our lives.

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:13.602
This is what it's all about.

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:15.723
It doesn't matter whether
you talk to people

00:03:15.747 --> 00:03:18.839
who work in social justice,
mental health and abuse and neglect,

00:03:18.863 --> 00:03:24.204
what we know is that connection,
the ability to feel connected, is --

00:03:24.688 --> 00:03:26.706
neurobiologically
that's how we're wired --

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.109
it's why we're here.

00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:31.146
So I thought, you know what,
I'm going to start with connection.
