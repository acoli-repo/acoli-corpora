00:01:57.817 --> 00:02:00.397
that I have a bachelor's
and a master's in social work,

00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:03.795
and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work,
so my entire academic career

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:09.436
was surrounded by people who kind of
believed in the "life's messy, love it."

00:02:10.214 --> 00:02:15.642
And I'm more of the, "life's messy,
clean it up, organize it

00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:17.443
and put it into a bento box."

00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:19.443
(Laughter)

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.071
And so to think that I had found my way,
to found a career that takes me --

00:02:25.095 --> 00:02:28.428
really, one of the big sayings
in social work is,

00:02:28.452 --> 00:02:30.547
"Lean into the discomfort of the work."
