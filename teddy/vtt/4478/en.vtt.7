So I thought, you know what,
I'm going to start with connection.

00:03:31.807 --> 00:03:33.704
Well, you know that situation

00:03:33.728 --> 00:03:36.236
where you get an evaluation
from your boss,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.046
and she tells you 37 things
that you do really awesome,

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.444
and one "opportunity for growth?"

00:03:41.468 --> 00:03:43.277
(Laughter)

00:03:43.936 --> 00:03:47.404
And all you can think about
is that opportunity for growth, right?

00:03:47.428 --> 00:03:50.126
Well, apparently this is the way
my work went as well,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.127
because, when you ask people about love,
they tell you about heartbreak.

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.785
When you ask people about belonging,

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:01.761
they'll tell you their most excruciating
experiences of being excluded.
