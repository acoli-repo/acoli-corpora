00:15:58.676 --> 00:16:01.143
I hack into your lives for a living.

00:16:01.167 --> 00:16:03.143
God.

00:16:03.167 --> 00:16:05.714
(Laughter)

00:16:05.738 --> 00:16:08.496
You can't numb those hard feelings

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.154
without numbing
the other affects, our emotions.

00:16:11.178 --> 00:16:12.630
You cannot selectively numb.

00:16:12.654 --> 00:16:15.261
So when we numb those,

00:16:15.285 --> 00:16:17.808
we numb joy,

00:16:17.832 --> 00:16:19.143
we numb gratitude,

00:16:19.167 --> 00:16:20.467
we numb happiness.

00:16:21.888 --> 00:16:25.011
And then, we are miserable,

00:16:25.035 --> 00:16:27.044
and we are looking
for purpose and meaning,

00:16:27.068 --> 00:16:28.500
and then we feel vulnerable,

00:16:28.524 --> 00:16:31.332
so then we have a couple of beers
and a banana nut muffin.
