in the shame interviewing.

00:10:00.082 --> 00:10:02.312
They just talked about it being necessary.

00:10:03.373 --> 00:10:07.349
They talked about the willingness
to say, "I love you" first ...

00:10:09.118 --> 00:10:14.491
the willingness to do something
where there are no guarantees ...

00:10:16.023 --> 00:10:20.358
the willingness to breathe
through waiting for the doctor to call

00:10:20.382 --> 00:10:21.665
after your mammogram.

00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:26.636
They're willing to invest
in a relationship

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.110
that may or may not work out.

00:10:29.205 --> 00:10:31.075
They thought this was fundamental.
