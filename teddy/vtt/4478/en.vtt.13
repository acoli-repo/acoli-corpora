00:06:38.643 --> 00:06:45.215
and divided them into people who really
have a sense of worthiness --

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:48.001
that's what this comes down to,
a sense of worthiness --

00:06:48.025 --> 00:06:51.247

of love and belonging --

00:06:51.271 --> 00:06:52.922

00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:01.073
the people who have a strong sense
of love and belonging
