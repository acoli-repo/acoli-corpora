The other thing that they had
in common was this:

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.730
They fully embraced vulnerability.

00:09:40.419 --> 00:09:47.070
They believed that what made them
vulnerable made them beautiful.

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:54.706
They didn't talk about vulnerability
being comfortable,

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.556
nor did they really talk
about it being excruciating --

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.058
as I had heard it earlier
in the shame interviewing.
