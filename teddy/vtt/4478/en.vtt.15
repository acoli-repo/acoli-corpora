00:07:29.547 --> 00:07:34.524
So what I did is I took
all of the interviews

00:07:34.548 --> 00:07:37.366
where I saw worthiness,
where I saw people living that way,

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.278
and just looked at those.

00:07:40.054 --> 00:07:42.102
What do these people have in common?

00:07:42.126 --> 00:07:46.769
I have a slight office supply addiction,
but that's another talk.

00:07:46.793 --> 00:07:50.270
So I had a manila folder,
and I had a Sharpie,

00:07:50.294 --> 00:07:52.914
and I was like, what am I going
to call this research?

00:07:52.938 --> 00:07:55.928
And the first words that came
to my mind were "whole-hearted."

00:07:56.547 --> 00:08:00.063
These are whole-hearted people,
living from this deep sense of worthiness.
