or progress to AIDS faster.

00:02:32.763 --> 00:02:37.485
We discovered that the explosion
of HIV cases in the Philippines

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:41.741
is due to a shift
from the Western subtype B

00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:46.396
to a more aggressive
Southeast Asian subtype AE.

00:02:46.794 --> 00:02:49.525
We are seeing younger and sicker patients

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.529
with high rates of drug resistance.

00:02:52.195 --> 00:02:55.068
Initial encroachment of this subtype

00:02:55.092 --> 00:02:57.803
is already occurring
in developed countries,

00:02:57.827 --> 00:03:01.567
including Australia,
Canada and the United States.
