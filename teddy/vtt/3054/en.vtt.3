Within a person infected with HIV,

00:01:32.865 --> 00:01:36.261
the genetic difference
between an infecting mother virus

00:01:36.285 --> 00:01:38.610
and subsequent daughter viruses

00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:41.021
has been shown to be
as much as five percent.

00:01:41.376 --> 00:01:46.019
This is the equivalent of a gorilla
giving birth to a chimpanzee,

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:47.871
then to an orangutan,

00:01:47.895 --> 00:01:49.454
then to a baboon,

00:01:49.478 --> 00:01:52.351
then to any random great ape
within its lifetime.

00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:56.316
There are nearly 100 subtypes of HIV,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.809
with new subtypes
being discovered regularly.

00:01:59.448 --> 00:02:04.760
HIV in the developed world
is almost all of one subtype:
