HIV in the developed world
is almost all of one subtype:

00:02:04.784 --> 00:02:05.937
subtype B.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.700
Mostly everything we know
and do to treat HIV

00:02:10.724 --> 00:02:14.281
is based on studies on subtype B,

00:02:14.305 --> 00:02:16.943
even though it only
accounts for 12 percent

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:20.451
of the total number
of cases of HIV in the world.

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:23.793
But because of the profound
genetic difference

00:02:23.817 --> 00:02:26.167
among different subtypes,

00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:29.628
some subtypes are more likely
to become drug-resistant
