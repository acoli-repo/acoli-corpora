00:03:29.562 --> 00:03:31.250
We need to think of HIV

00:03:31.274 --> 00:03:34.971
not as a single virus
that we think we've figured out,

00:03:34.995 --> 00:03:41.189
but as a collection of rapidly evolving
and highly unique viruses,

00:03:41.213 --> 00:03:43.993
each of which can set off
the next deadly epidemic.

00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:48.010
We are incorporating
more powerful and new tools

00:03:48.034 --> 00:03:51.169
to help us detect
the next deadly HIV strain,

00:03:51.193 --> 00:03:55.221
and this needs to go hand in hand
with urgent research

00:03:55.245 --> 00:03:59.717
on the behavior and proper treatment
of non-B subtypes.
