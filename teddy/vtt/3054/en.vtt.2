00:00:59.128 --> 00:01:00.801
every time it reproduces,

00:01:00.825 --> 00:01:02.573
let's make a genetic comparison.

00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:06.756
If we look at the DNA variation
among humans of different races

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.393
from different continents,

00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:11.913
the actual DNA difference
is only 0.1 percent.

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.563
If we look at the genetic difference

00:01:14.587 --> 00:01:18.721
between humans, great apes,
and rhesus macaques,

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:20.674
that number is seven percent.

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:25.459
In contrast, the genetic difference
between HIV subtypes

00:01:25.483 --> 00:01:27.058
from different patients

00:01:27.082 --> 00:01:29.555
may be as much as 35 percent.
