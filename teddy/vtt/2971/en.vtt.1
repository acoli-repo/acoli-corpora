00:00:41.284 --> 00:00:42.553
of our history.

00:00:43.434 --> 00:00:46.595
And our narrative has not just
survived the assaults

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:48.414
that history has thrown at it.

00:00:48.438 --> 00:00:52.160
We've left a body of material culture,

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:56.077
artistic magistery
and intellectual output.

00:00:56.101 --> 00:01:00.737
We've mapped and we've charted
and we've captured our histories
