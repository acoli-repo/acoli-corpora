Just as in the 19th century,

00:05:04.078 --> 00:05:08.047
enslaved peoples of African
descent in the Caribbean

00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:10.385
fought under threat of punishment,

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:14.560
fought to practice their religions,
to celebrate Carnival,

00:05:14.584 --> 00:05:17.319
to keep their history alive.

00:05:17.343 --> 00:05:21.223
Ordinary people were prepared
to make great sacrifices,

00:05:21.247 --> 00:05:24.473
some even the ultimate sacrifice,

00:05:24.497 --> 00:05:25.887
for their history.

00:05:26.965 --> 00:05:29.410
And it was through control of narrative

00:05:29.434 --> 00:05:33.770
that some of the most devastating
colonial campaigns were crystallized.
