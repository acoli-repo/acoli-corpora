We don't just have
to recolonize our history,

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:35.104
but we have to find ways to build back
the intellectual underpinning

00:10:35.128 --> 00:10:37.313
that Hegel denied was there at all.

00:10:37.866 --> 00:10:40.586
We have to rediscover African philosophy,

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:44.612
African perspectives, African history.

00:10:45.651 --> 00:10:49.161
The flowering of Great Zimbabwe --
it wasn't a freak moment.

00:10:49.185 --> 00:10:53.158
It was part of a burgeoning change
across the whole of the continent.

00:10:53.182 --> 00:10:57.508
Perhaps the great exemplification of that
was Sundiata Keita,

00:10:57.532 --> 00:10:59.725
the founder of the Mali Empire,

00:10:59.749 --> 00:11:03.689
probably the greatest empire
that West Africa has ever seen.
