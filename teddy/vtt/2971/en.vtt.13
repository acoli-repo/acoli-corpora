00:06:29.657 --> 00:06:35.315
In 1871, Karl Mauch, a German geologist
working in Southern Africa,

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:39.396
he stumbled across
an extraordinary complex,

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.146
a complex of abandoned stone buildings.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.486
And he never quite recovered
from what he saw:

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.743
a granite, drystone city,

00:06:48.767 --> 00:06:52.568
stranded on an outcrop
above an empty savannah:

00:06:52.592 --> 00:06:54.320
Great Zimbabwe.

00:06:55.073 --> 00:06:58.565
And Mauch had no idea who was responsible

00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:03.655
for what was obviously
an astonishing feat of architecture,
