00:00:56.101 --> 00:01:00.737
We've mapped and we've charted
and we've captured our histories

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:04.543
in ways that are the measure
of anywhere else on earth.

00:01:05.063 --> 00:01:09.619
Long before the meaningful
arrival of Europeans --

00:01:09.643 --> 00:01:13.183
indeed, whilst Europe was still
mired in its Dark Age --

00:01:13.207 --> 00:01:18.591
Africans were pioneering techniques
in recording, in nurturing history,

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:24.060
forging revolutionary methods
for keeping their story alive.

00:01:24.823 --> 00:01:27.785
And living history, dynamic heritage --

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:30.121
it remains important to us.
