This was a deeply considered waging of war

00:02:31.491 --> 00:02:34.174
in the most powerful way
that could be envisaged:

00:02:34.198 --> 00:02:37.560
in destroying narrative,
in destroying stories.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.573
The attempted destruction of nine shrines,

00:02:41.597 --> 00:02:43.091
the central mosque

00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:46.608
and perhaps as many as 4,000 manuscripts

00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:48.975
was a considered act.

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:55.081
They understood the power of narrative
to hold communities together,

00:02:55.105 --> 00:02:59.323
and they conversely understood
that in destroying stories,

00:02:59.347 --> 00:03:02.262
they hoped they would destroy a people.
