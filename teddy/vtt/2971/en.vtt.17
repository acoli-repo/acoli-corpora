and control of the continent.

00:08:40.773 --> 00:08:45.513
It involved an attempt
to bend narrative to Europe's ends.

00:08:45.955 --> 00:08:50.148
And if Mauch had really wanted
to find an answer to his question,

00:08:50.172 --> 00:08:54.826

or that great stone building come from?"

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.050
he would have needed to begin his quest

00:08:57.074 --> 00:08:59.763
a thousand miles away from Great Zimbabwe,

00:08:59.787 --> 00:09:03.606
at the eastern edge of the continent,
where Africa meets the Indian Ocean.
