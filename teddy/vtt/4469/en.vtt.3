00:01:30.832 --> 00:01:32.327
With that in mind,

00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:34.298
I encouraged people in my research group

00:01:34.322 --> 00:01:37.830
to partner with some
clever material scientists,

00:01:37.854 --> 00:01:40.261
and all of us came together
and brainstormed.

00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:42.345
And after a long process,

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.763
we came up with a vision, an idea,

00:01:44.787 --> 00:01:48.565
of a wearable system that perhaps
you could wear like a piece of jewelry

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:51.045
or you could apply
to yourself like a Band-Aid.

00:01:51.463 --> 00:01:55.646
And after many trials and tribulations
and years of endeavors,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.397
we were able to come up
with this flexible electronic patch

00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:01.816
that was manufactured
using the same processes
