00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.003
that our electronics worked
with typical medical adhesives

00:04:00.027 --> 00:04:01.484
that are used in a hospital.

00:04:02.217 --> 00:04:04.431
We had an epiphany and said,
"Wait a minute.

00:04:04.998 --> 00:04:07.669
Rather than just making
them work with adhesives,

00:04:07.693 --> 00:04:10.721
let's integrate them into adhesives,

00:04:11.194 --> 00:04:13.697
and that could solve
our manufacturing problem."

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.260
This picture that you see here

00:04:16.284 --> 00:04:20.779
is our ability to embed these censors
inside of a piece of Scotch tape

00:04:20.803 --> 00:04:23.519
by simply peeling it off of a wafer.

00:04:24.255 --> 00:04:27.624
Ongoing work in our research group
allows us to, in addition,

00:04:27.648 --> 00:04:31.357
embed integrated circuits
into the flexible adhesives
