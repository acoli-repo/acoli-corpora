and then spend the rest
of her life paying for the bill;

00:01:02.946 --> 00:01:07.554
or head home after her 10-day stay
and hope for the best.

00:01:08.198 --> 00:01:11.293
Neither of these two options
seems appealing.

00:01:12.132 --> 00:01:14.243
As I began to think
about stories like this

00:01:14.267 --> 00:01:16.053
and hear about stories like this,

00:01:16.077 --> 00:01:18.170
I began to ask myself and imagine:

00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:19.736
Is there an alternative?

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.496
Is there a way we could have
the benefits of high-fidelity monitoring

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.319
that we get with our trusted
partners in the hospital

00:01:27.343 --> 00:01:29.702
while someone is at home
living their daily life?
