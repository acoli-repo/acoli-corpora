00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:31.123
rather than have those algorithms
that do data interpretation

00:06:31.147 --> 00:06:32.360
run in the cloud,

00:06:32.904 --> 00:06:36.315
what if we have those algorithms run
on those small integrated circuits

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:38.419
embedded into those adhesives?

00:06:38.995 --> 00:06:42.089
And so when we integrate
these things together,

00:06:42.113 --> 00:06:45.617
what this means is that now
we can think about the future

00:06:45.641 --> 00:06:49.706
where someone like Jane can still
go about living her normal daily life,

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.202
she can be monitored,

00:06:51.226 --> 00:06:54.726
it can be done in a way where
she doesn't have to get another job

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.215
to pay her data plan,

00:06:56.239 --> 00:06:59.934
and we can also address
some of her concerns about privacy.
