Here is a picture of a pregnant woman
in labor at our university hospital

00:03:03.535 --> 00:03:08.466
being monitored for her uterine
contractions with the conventional belt.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.090
In addition,

00:03:10.114 --> 00:03:12.706
our flexible electronic patches are there.

00:03:13.268 --> 00:03:17.544
This picture demonstrates waveforms
pertaining to the fetal heart rate,

00:03:17.568 --> 00:03:20.485
where the red corresponds
to what was acquired

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:22.088
with the conventional belts,

00:03:22.112 --> 00:03:24.770
and the blue corresponds to our estimates

00:03:24.794 --> 00:03:28.482
using our flexible electronic systems
and our algorithms.
