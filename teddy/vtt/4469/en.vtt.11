00:05:27.895 --> 00:05:31.514
for her to be sending out
a continuous stream of data.

00:05:32.383 --> 00:05:33.662
There's another challenge

00:05:33.686 --> 00:05:37.384
that not everyone in the medical
profession is comfortable talking about.

00:05:37.408 --> 00:05:40.236
And that is, that Jane
does not have the most trust

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.745
in the medical establishment.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.599
She, people like her, her ancestors,
have not had the best experiences

00:05:47.623 --> 00:05:50.619
at the hands of doctors and the hospital

00:05:51.163 --> 00:05:52.551
or insurance companies.

00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:56.807
That means that we have to be mindful
of questions of privacy.

00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:58.452
Jane might not feel that happy

00:05:58.476 --> 00:06:01.755
about all that data
being processed into the cloud.
