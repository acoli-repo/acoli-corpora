00:07:27.223 --> 00:07:30.737
that there are increasing
and widening health disparities,

00:07:30.761 --> 00:07:34.065
and there's inequity in terms
of proper care management.

00:07:34.616 --> 00:07:37.110
And so what that means
is that this simple picture

00:07:37.134 --> 00:07:38.779
of Jane and her data --

00:07:38.803 --> 00:07:42.730
even with her being comfortable
being wirelessly transmitted to the cloud,

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:45.069
letting a doctor intervene if necessary --

00:07:45.093 --> 00:07:46.559
is not the whole story.

So what we're beginning to do

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:53.336
is to think about ways to have
trusted parties serve as intermediaries

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.778
between people like Jane
and her health care providers.

00:07:56.802 --> 00:07:59.813
For example, we've begun
to partner with churches

00:07:59.837 --> 00:08:02.694
and to think about nurses
that are church members,
