00:02:29.403 --> 00:02:31.377
We can also engineer these systems,

00:02:31.883 --> 00:02:34.291
so they can integrate energy sources,

00:02:34.877 --> 00:02:37.842
and can have wireless
transmission capabilities.

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:42.529
So as we began to build
these types of systems,

00:02:42.553 --> 00:02:46.891
we began to test them on ourselves
in our research group.

00:02:46.915 --> 00:02:50.279
But in addition, we began to reach out
to some of our clinical partners

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:51.458
in San Diego,

00:02:51.482 --> 00:02:55.182
and test these on different patients
in different clinical conditions,

00:02:55.206 --> 00:02:57.903
including moms-to-be like Jane.
