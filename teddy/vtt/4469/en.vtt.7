00:03:28.932 --> 00:03:30.380
At this moment,

00:03:30.404 --> 00:03:33.022
we gave ourselves a big mental high five.

00:03:33.508 --> 00:03:36.915
Some of the things we had imagined
were beginning to come to fruition,

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.616
and we were actually seeing this
in a clinical context.

00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:41.523
But there was still a problem.

00:03:41.974 --> 00:03:45.335
The problem was, the way
we manufactured these systems

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.816
was very inefficient,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.997
had low yield

00:03:48.021 --> 00:03:49.365
and was very error-prone.

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:51.256
In addition,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.752
as we talked to some
of the nurses in the hospital,

00:03:53.776 --> 00:03:55.966
they encouraged us to make sure

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.003
that our electronics worked
with typical medical adhesives
