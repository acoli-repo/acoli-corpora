00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:01.816
that was manufactured
using the same processes

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.521
that they use to build computer chips,

00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:08.977
except the electronics are transferred
from a semiconductor wafer

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:13.269
onto a flexible material
that can interface with the human body.

00:02:13.775 --> 00:02:16.823
These systems are about
the thickness of a human hair.

00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:21.259
They can measure the types
of information that we want,

00:02:21.948 --> 00:02:23.127
things such as:

00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:24.324
bodily movement,

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.074
bodily temperature,

00:02:26.098 --> 00:02:27.903
electrical rhythms of the body

00:02:27.927 --> 00:02:29.085
and so forth.

00:02:29.403 --> 00:02:31.377
We can also engineer these systems,
