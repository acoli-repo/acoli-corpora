00:04:27.648 --> 00:04:31.357
embed integrated circuits
into the flexible adhesives

00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:35.071
to do things like amplifying signals
and digitizing them,

00:04:35.095 --> 00:04:36.273
processing them

00:04:36.297 --> 00:04:38.560
and encoding for wireless transmission.

00:04:39.113 --> 00:04:43.015
All of this integrated
into the same medical adhesives

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.849
that are used in the hospital.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.302
So when we reached this point,

00:04:47.326 --> 00:04:49.750
we had some other challenges,

00:04:49.774 --> 00:04:53.089
from both an engineering
as well as a usability perspective,

00:04:53.113 --> 00:04:55.936
to make sure that we could
make it used practically.

00:04:57.207 --> 00:04:59.694
In many digital health discussions,

00:04:59.718 --> 00:05:04.665
people believe in and embrace the idea
that we can simply digitize the data,
