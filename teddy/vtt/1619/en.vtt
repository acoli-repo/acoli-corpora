00:00:00.508 --> 00:00:01.540
In the ocean,

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.380
what is the common point

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.148
between oil, plastic and radioactivity?

00:00:09.148 --> 00:00:14.365
On the top line, this is the BP oil spill:

00:00:14.365 --> 00:00:16.388
billions of barrels of oil gushing

00:00:16.388 --> 00:00:17.757
in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:00:17.757 --> 00:00:19.932
The middle line is millions of tons of

00:00:19.932 --> 00:00:22.336
plastic debris accumulating in our ocean,

00:00:22.336 --> 00:00:25.056
and the third line is radioactive material

00:00:25.056 --> 00:00:27.352
leaking from Fukushima nuclear power plant

00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:28.690
in the Pacific Ocean.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.273
Well, the three big problems have in common
