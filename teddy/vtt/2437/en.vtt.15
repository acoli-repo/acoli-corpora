00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.059
Because they can't profile humans.

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:34.434
Data traces are not
the mirror of who we are.

00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:36.559
Humans think one thing
and say the opposite,

00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:39.018
feel one way and act differently.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:41.518
Algorithmic predictions
or our digital practices

00:07:41.542 --> 00:07:46.708
cannot account for the unpredictability
and complexity of human experience.

00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:49.976
But on top of that,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.684
these technologies are always --

00:07:52.708 --> 00:07:53.976
always --

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.917
in one way or another, biased.

00:07:57.125 --> 00:08:02.184
You see, algorithms are by definition
sets of rules or steps
