00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:02.351
can we trust these technologies
when it comes to profiling our children?

00:07:02.375 --> 00:07:03.625
Can we?

00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:06.958
My answer is no.

00:07:07.792 --> 00:07:09.059
As an anthropologist,

00:07:09.083 --> 00:07:12.851
I believe that artificial intelligence
and predictive analytics can be great

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:14.893
to predict the course of a disease

00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:16.750
or to fight climate change.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.643
But we need to abandon the belief

00:07:19.667 --> 00:07:23.351
that these technologies
can objectively profile humans

00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:26.559
and that we can rely on them
to make data-driven decisions

00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:28.476
about individual lives.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.059
Because they can't profile humans.
