00:08:58.542 --> 00:09:02.601
Because these technologies
are being trained with dirty data,

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.059
they're not objective,

00:09:04.083 --> 00:09:08.601
and their outcomes are only
amplifying and perpetrating

00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:10.250
police bias and error.

00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:16.309
So I think we are faced
with a fundamental problem

00:09:16.333 --> 00:09:17.976
in our society.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.792
We are starting to trust technologies
when it comes to profiling human beings.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.268
We know that in profiling humans,

00:09:26.292 --> 00:09:29.101
these technologies
are always going to be biased

00:09:29.125 --> 00:09:31.851
and are never really going to be accurate.
