00:07:57.125 --> 00:08:02.184
You see, algorithms are by definition
sets of rules or steps

00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:05.917
that have been designed to achieve
a specific result, OK?

00:08:06.833 --> 00:08:09.559
But these sets of rules or steps
cannot be objective,

00:08:09.583 --> 00:08:11.726
because they've been designed
by human beings

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.476
within a specific cultural context

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.000
and are shaped
by specific cultural values.

00:08:16.667 --> 00:08:18.393
So when machines learn,

00:08:18.417 --> 00:08:20.667
they learn from biased algorithms,

00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:24.833
and they often learn
from biased databases as well.

00:08:25.833 --> 00:08:29.559
At the moment, we're seeing
the first examples of algorithmic bias.

00:08:29.583 --> 00:08:33.083
And some of these examples
are frankly terrifying.
