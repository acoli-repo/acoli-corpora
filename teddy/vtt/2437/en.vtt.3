00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:31.268
they go online to look
for "ways to get pregnant,"

00:01:31.292 --> 00:01:34.042
or they download ovulation-tracking apps.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.851
When they do get pregnant,

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:41.018
they post ultrasounds
of their babies on social media,

00:01:41.042 --> 00:01:43.059
they download pregnancy apps

00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:46.809
or they consult Dr. Google
for all sorts of things,

00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:48.351
like, you know --

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.934
for "miscarriage risk when flying"

00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.726
or "abdominal cramps in early pregnancy."

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.559
I know because I've done it --

00:01:55.583 --> 00:01:57.208
and many times.

00:01:58.458 --> 00:02:01.268
And then, when the baby is born,
they track every nap,
