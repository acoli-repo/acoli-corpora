00:01:58.458 --> 00:02:01.268
And then, when the baby is born,
they track every nap,

00:02:01.292 --> 00:02:02.559
every feed,

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:05.167
every life event
on different technologies.

00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:07.559
And all of these technologies

00:02:07.583 --> 00:02:13.726
transform the baby's most intimate
behavioral and health data into profit

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.542
by sharing it with others.

00:02:16.583 --> 00:02:18.726
So to give you an idea of how this works,

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.934
in 2019, the British Medical Journal
published research that showed

00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.601
that out of 24 mobile health apps,

00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:31.083
19 shared information with third parties.
