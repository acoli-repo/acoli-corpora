00:02:56.208 --> 00:03:00.333
and there was also
a consumer credit reporting agency.

00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:02.559
So you get it right:

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:07.708
ad companies and credit agencies may
already have data points on little babies.

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:11.893
But mobile apps,
web searches and social media

00:03:11.917 --> 00:03:15.018
are really just the tip of the iceberg,

00:03:15.042 --> 00:03:17.893
because children are being tracked
by multiple technologies

00:03:17.917 --> 00:03:19.643
in their everyday lives.

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:23.809
They're tracked by home technologies
and virtual assistants in their homes.

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:25.809
They're tracked by educational platforms

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:28.018
and educational technologies
in their schools.

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:29.643
They're tracked by online records

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:32.684
and online portals
at their doctor's office.
