Sharks! They're at the top of the food chain.

00:05:01.987 --> 00:05:04.424
Sharks have multiple rows of teeth

00:05:04.424 --> 00:05:05.669
that grow in their jaw

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.067
and they move forward like a conveyor belt.

00:05:09.067 --> 00:05:12.760
Some sharks can lose 30,000 teeth in their lifetime.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.357
Does awesome inspire fear?

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:19.103
Oh, hell yeah, sharks are awesome!

00:05:19.103 --> 00:05:21.930
The Internet was born in 1982

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.695
and it instantly took over global communication,

00:05:25.695 --> 00:05:27.798
and later tonight, when all these PowerPoints

00:05:27.798 --> 00:05:29.756
are uplifted to the Internet

00:05:29.756 --> 00:05:32.580
so that a guy in Siberia can get drunk
