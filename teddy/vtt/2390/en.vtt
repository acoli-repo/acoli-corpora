00:00:01.315 --> 00:00:04.362
How many times have you used
the word "awesome" today?

00:00:04.362 --> 00:00:08.497
Once? Twice? Seventeen times?

00:00:08.497 --> 00:00:09.863
Do you remember what you were describing

00:00:09.863 --> 00:00:11.213
when you used the word?

00:00:11.213 --> 00:00:14.453
No, I didn't think so, because
it's come down to this, people:

00:00:14.453 --> 00:00:16.355
You're using the word incorrectly,

00:00:16.355 --> 00:00:18.424
and tonight I hope to show you

00:00:18.424 --> 00:00:21.506
how to put the "awe" back in "awesome."

00:00:21.506 --> 00:00:24.330
Recently, I was dining at an outdoor cafe,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.243
and the server came up to our table,

00:00:26.243 --> 00:00:27.790
and asked us if we had dined there before,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.739
and I said, "Yes, yes, we have."

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.519
And she said, "Awesome."
