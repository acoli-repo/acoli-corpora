Sadly, the frequent overuse of the word "awesome"

00:01:02.956 --> 00:01:07.123
has now replaced words like "great" and "thank you."

00:01:07.123 --> 00:01:11.495
So Webster's dictionary defines the word "awesome"

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:15.623
as fear mingled with admiration or reverence,

00:01:15.623 --> 00:01:19.019
a feeling produced by something majestic.

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:20.943
Now, with that in mind,

00:01:20.943 --> 00:01:24.240
was your Quiznos sandwich awesome?

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.510
How about that parking space? Was that awesome?

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.056
Or that game the other day? Was that awesome?

00:01:29.056 --> 00:01:31.440
The answer is no, no and no.
