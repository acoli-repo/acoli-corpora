00:03:58.337 --> 00:04:00.682
But it's not like a flower can just get up

00:04:00.682 --> 00:04:03.154
and have sex with another flower,

00:04:03.154 --> 00:04:05.485
although that would be awesome.

00:04:05.485 --> 00:04:08.304

00:04:08.304 --> 00:04:11.242
Bees are awesome. Are you kidding me?

00:04:11.242 --> 00:04:15.198
Landing on the moon! Come on!

00:04:15.198 --> 00:04:18.171
Apollo 11. Are you kidding me?

Neil Armstrong was 240,000 miles away.

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:28.959
That's like from here to the moon.

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:31.195
(Laughter)
