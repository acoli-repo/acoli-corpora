00:02:59.427 --> 00:03:00.780
Were the Great Pyramids awesome?

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.030
Yes, the pyramids were awesome.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.176
The Grand Canyon. Come on.

00:03:05.176 --> 00:03:08.404
It's almost 80 million years old.

00:03:08.404 --> 00:03:10.171
Is the Grand Canyon awesome?

00:03:10.171 --> 00:03:11.712
Yes, the Grand Canyon is.

00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:16.470
Louis Daguerre invented photography in 1829,

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.989
and earlier today,

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.954
when you whipped out your smartphone

00:03:19.954 --> 00:03:22.566
and you took a shot of your awesome sandwich,

00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:24.311
and you know who you are —

00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:26.527
(Laughter) —

00:03:26.527 --> 00:03:28.867
wasn't that easier than exposing the image

00:03:28.867 --> 00:03:31.443
to copper plates coated with iodized silver?
