00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:01.433
Um, no, it is not,

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:07.831
and we need to raise the bar for this poor schmuck.
(Laughter)

00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:11.401
So in other words, if you have
everything, you value nothing.

00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:13.771
It's a lot like drinking from a firehose

00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:17.719
like this jackass right here.

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.138
There's no dynamic, there's no highs or lows,

00:02:20.138 --> 00:02:22.000
if everything is awesome.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.165
Ladies and gentlemen, here are 10 things

00:02:24.165 --> 00:02:26.083
that are truly awesome.

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:28.766
Imagine, if you will, having to schlep

00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:30.227
everything on your back.
