00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:30.227
everything on your back.

00:02:30.227 --> 00:02:32.220
Wouldn't this be easier for me

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.188
if I could roll this home?

00:02:34.188 --> 00:02:36.517
Yes, so I think I'll invent the wheel.

00:02:36.517 --> 00:02:39.389
The wheel, ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.186
Is the wheel awesome? Say it with me.

00:02:42.186 --> 00:02:45.809
Yes, the wheel is awesome!

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:47.870
The Great Pyramids were the tallest

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.488
man-made structure in the world

00:02:49.488 --> 00:02:51.872
for 4,000 years.

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:55.411
Pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks

00:02:55.411 --> 00:02:59.427
just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone.

00:02:59.427 --> 00:03:00.780
Were the Great Pyramids awesome?
