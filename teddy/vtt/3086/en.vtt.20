00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.480
on what can we do
to actually treat this disease?

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.656
We still can't diagnose
CTE in living people,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.736
we have no treatments
that are going to be coming

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.496
out of the pharmaceutical industry
in the next five years.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.576
This is a long, long fight.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.296
But our Concussion Legacy Foundation
is here to not only facilitate this work,

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.536
and that's the long game,

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.799
but the short game is,
hey, we can prevent this.

00:10:21.823 --> 00:10:23.136
We can prevent this disease

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.736
if we just stopped hitting people
in the head so much.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.616
And frankly, we need to stop
hitting children in the head.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.816
Turns out, it's not a great idea
to hit a five-year-old in the head
