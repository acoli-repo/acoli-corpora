00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.816
Turns out, it's not a great idea
to hit a five-year-old in the head

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.056
500 times each year.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.816
And it does actually
open up the door to this disease.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.600
And so, we've got
a lot of work ahead of us.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.120
But I have great hope that we're
on our way to curing this disease.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.976
But I hope you understand
my story a little more now.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.096
And now that we've gotten
to know each other a little bit better,

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.376
this is the time where I ask you,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.016
"Can I have your brain?"

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.416
Thank you very much.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.376
