I'm Chris Nowinski, and odds are
if you've met me in the last five years

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.216
I've asked you, after a few minutes,
a bit of an odd question:

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.440
Can I have your brain?

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.776
Now, it only seems like a strange question
if you don't know my story

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.480
so please let me share it with you.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.496
I grew up outside of Chicago,
and I was an athlete

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.160
and I was very lucky to get recruited
to play football at Harvard University.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.536
So that's me.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.176
And then after graduating,
like most Harvard graduates,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.536
I decided I wanted to join the WWE.
