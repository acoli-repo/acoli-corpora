He was known for leading with his head,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.056
so I thought I'm just going to look up

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.256
did he ever talk
about the concussions he had.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.576
And I found a quote from 1994
where Andre Waters said,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.056
"I stopped counting my concussions at 15.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.776
I wouldn't say anything, I'd just sniff
smelling salts and go back out there."

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.416
And I thought, I wonder
if he might have CTE, too.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.336
If that might have contributed to whatever
made him choose to end his life.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.896
So I ended up calling the doctor
who did the first two studies, and I said,

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.336
"Hey, I think you should
study Andre Waters."

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.176
And he said, "I'd be happy to.
