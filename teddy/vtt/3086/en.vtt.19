What we've seen though
is very frightening.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.976
So some of you might have seen
the headline in July

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.856
in the "New York Times."

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.456
And a recent study we published,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.616
that of the first 111
NFL players we looked at

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.080
110 were positive for this disease.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.216
Of the first 53 college
football players we looked at,

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.160
48 had this disease.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.656
That's something
that's a very big concern to me.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.736
And so now, I'm very much focused

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.480
on what can we do
to actually treat this disease?
