00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.656
And it led to what became
permanent postconcussion symptoms:

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.336
constant headaches, inability to sleep,
depression, feeling in a fog.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.616
And in that first year,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.096
I tried to figure out
how could I make this pain go away.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.736
And I wasn't getting
the answers I needed from doctors,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.416
and so I started digging
into the medical literature.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.016
And I found there's
this whole story about concussions

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.696
that we weren't really being told.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.576
So I decided to write a book about it,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.936
called "Head Games:
Football's Concussion Crisis"

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.176
that came out in 2006.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.496
But in that process, I learned
it's not really just about concussions.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.736
I learned about a disease called
chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE.
