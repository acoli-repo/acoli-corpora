00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.736
I learned about a disease called
chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.896
What we used to call punch-drunk,
because we only knew about it from boxers.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.536
We knew that getting hit in the head
too many times with boxers

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.656
would cause their brain to essentially
start to rot, to degenerate.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.896
And they'd have symptoms

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.336
like memory problems
and problems with cognition,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.640
depression, impulse
control issues, aggression.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.640
So basically, I got ...

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.336
I got injured at the right time,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.896
in which the first two NFL players
were studied for this disease.
