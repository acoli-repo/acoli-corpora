00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.776
and so my life has gotten a lot easier.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.776
This is just some of the headlines
that we've able to get over the years

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.480
from athletes pledging their brain.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.216
The problem has been what we learned.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.456
So when we started this,

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.776
only 45 cases existed
in the world of this disease

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.016
that had been studied in brain banks.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.296
Since then, we have acquired 500 brains

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.016
and found over 300 of them had CTE.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.336
To put that in perspective,

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:29.080
the rest of the world has not studied
100 brains since we started this.
