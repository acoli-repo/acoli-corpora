00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.176
And I started asking athletes

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.056
if they would publicly pledge
to donate their brain to science.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.656
And it started with, actually,
a hockey player in 2009.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.096
One of my first pledges
was a former Harvard hockey player,

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.776
Noah Welch, who was
in the NHL at the time.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.696
It was a slow start people understanding
what this was about.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.456
So when the news hit the front page,

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.496
"Noah Welch pledging
his brain to science,"

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.776
he said he went
to the locker room the next day,

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.016
one of his teammates
pulled him aside and said,

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.536
"Hey, I heard you're donating
your brain to science."

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.776
And he said, "Yep."
