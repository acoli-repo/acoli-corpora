00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.856
We've also been lucky
to have people like Brandi Chastain,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.135
the women's soccer icon,

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.535
NASCAR's Dale Earnhardt Jr.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:36.936
Just two weeks ago,
Hall-of-Famer Nick Buoniconti

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.176
who had been diagnosed with dementia,
signed up to pledge his brain.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.655
So it's been wonderful,
and the great thing about it

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:46.416
is that it has worked
in changing how we're able to get brains.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.416
So now, instead of me having to call,
more families call us.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.456
And our phones ring off the hook.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.576
And so I can now focus
on taking this information,

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.296
figuring out how do we work
towards a cure,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.176
how do we work towards prevention,

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.776
and so my life has gotten a lot easier.
