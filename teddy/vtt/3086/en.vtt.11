00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.296
And thank God that Andre Waters's family
was so gracious about the call and said,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.936
"You know what, we want to know
what happened to Andre.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.496
We want to know why he changed so much
in the last five years of his life."

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.976
And so we studied the brain,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.176
and it turned out that he did have CTE.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.016
He became the third NFL player
diagnosed with the disease.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.616
This is what it looks like.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.816
He was somewhere between mild and severe.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.976
OK, we have three
of three NFL players here.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.696
Maybe this needs to get
a little bit more serious.
