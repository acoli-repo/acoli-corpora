00:14:24.903 --> 00:14:30.251
I can live in duality,
and I can hold two things.

00:14:30.252 --> 00:14:33.189
And if I can hold two things
in that environment,

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:35.542
I can hold so many more things.

00:14:35.543 --> 00:14:39.295
As my girlfriend and my niece hold hands
and skip out the front of the door,

00:14:39.296 --> 00:14:42.039
I turn to my sister and say,
"Was it worth it?"

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.814
And she said, "Are you kidding me?

00:14:43.815 --> 00:14:47.702
Did you see the look on her face?
This was the greatest day of her life!"

00:14:47.703 --> 00:14:48.800
(Laughter)

00:14:48.801 --> 00:14:51.758
"It was worth the two
and a half hours in the heat,

00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:56.146
it was worth the overpriced coloring book
that we already had a copy of."

00:14:56.147 --> 00:14:57.854
(Laughter)

00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:01.509
"It was even worth you 
getting called Dad."
