But she was trying, and she asked.

00:10:01.789 --> 00:10:03.572
She could have called her my friend,

00:10:03.573 --> 00:10:07.707
or my "friend," or my "special friend" --

00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:09.092
(Laughter) --

00:10:09.093 --> 00:10:12.058
or even worse, just not asked at all.

00:10:12.059 --> 00:10:15.689
Believe me, we would rather have you ask.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:20.931
I would rather have her say lover,
than say nothing at all.

00:10:20.932 --> 00:10:23.963
People often say to me,
"Well, Ash, I don't care.

00:10:23.964 --> 00:10:27.756
I don't see race
or religion or sexuality.

00:10:27.757 --> 00:10:30.600
It doesn't matter to me. I don't see it."
