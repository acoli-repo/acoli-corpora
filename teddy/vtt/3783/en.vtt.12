I know Catholics who are pro-choice,
and feminists who wear hijabs,

00:06:01.497 --> 00:06:03.201
and veterans who are antiwar,

00:06:03.202 --> 00:06:05.986
and NRA members who think
I should be able to get married.

00:06:05.987 --> 00:06:09.022
Those are the people I know,
those are my friends and family,

00:06:09.023 --> 00:06:11.999
that is the majority of our society,
that is you, that is me.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.657
(Applause)

00:06:20.717 --> 00:06:25.885
Duality is the ability
to hold both things.

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:30.007
But the question is:
Can we own our duality?
