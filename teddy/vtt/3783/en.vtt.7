00:03:27.794 --> 00:03:32.341
Would I take my niece off my shoulders
and turn to the clerk and explain to her

00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:35.479
that I was in fact
her aunt, not her father,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.848
and that she should be more careful

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.604
and not to jump to gender conclusions
based on haircuts and shoulder rides --

00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:43.740
(Laughter) --

00:03:43.741 --> 00:03:45.597
and while doing that,

00:03:45.598 --> 00:03:50.386
miss out on what was, to this point,
the greatest moment of my niece's life.

00:03:51.116 --> 00:03:53.205
Or would I be an aunt?

00:03:53.206 --> 00:03:56.343
Would I brush off that comment,
take a million pictures,

00:03:56.344 --> 00:04:01.321
and not be distracted for an instant
from the pure joy of that moment,
