It's amazing that in an unexpected instant
we are faced with the question,

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:04.997
who am I?

00:03:04.998 --> 00:03:08.465
Am I an aunt? Or am I an advocate?

00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:12.296
Millions of people have seen my video
about how to have a hard conversation,

00:03:12.297 --> 00:03:14.613
and there one was, right in front of me.

00:03:14.614 --> 00:03:15.685
At the same time,

00:03:15.686 --> 00:03:18.595
there's nothing more important
to me than the kids in my life,

00:03:18.596 --> 00:03:22.543
so I found myself in a situation
that we so often find ourselves in,

00:03:22.544 --> 00:03:25.766
torn between two things,
two impossible choices.

00:03:25.767 --> 00:03:27.793
Would I be an advocate?

00:03:27.794 --> 00:03:32.341
Would I take my niece off my shoulders
and turn to the clerk and explain to her
