00:03:56.344 --> 00:04:01.321
and not be distracted for an instant
from the pure joy of that moment,

00:04:01.322 --> 00:04:02.840
and by doing that,

00:04:02.841 --> 00:04:06.223
walk out with the shame that comes up
for not standing up for myself,

00:04:06.224 --> 00:04:08.606
especially in front of my niece.

00:04:08.607 --> 00:04:10.409
Who was I?

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.228
Which one was more important?
Which role was more worth it?

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.218
Was I an aunt? Or was I an advocate?

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:21.435
And I had a split second to decide.

00:04:22.235 --> 00:04:23.813
We are taught right now

00:04:23.814 --> 00:04:28.112
that we are living in a world
of constant and increasing polarity.

00:04:28.113 --> 00:04:32.684
It's so black and white,
so us and them, so right and wrong.
