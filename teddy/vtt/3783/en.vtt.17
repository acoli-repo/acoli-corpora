00:08:29.668 --> 00:08:31.383
She left, did the same thing --

00:08:31.384 --> 00:08:34.654
it was a 10-second conversation,
such a short interaction.

00:08:34.655 --> 00:08:37.191
And on paper, she had
so much more in common with him:

00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:42.289
language, culture, history, family,
her community was her lifeline here,

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:46.460
but her moral compass trumped all of that.

00:08:46.461 --> 00:08:50.123
And a little bit later, they were joking
around in the kitchen in Spanish,

00:08:50.124 --> 00:08:52.024
that had nothing to do with me,

00:08:52.025 --> 00:08:54.469
and that is duality.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.983
She didn't have to choose some P.C. stance
on gayness over her heritage.

00:08:58.983 --> 00:09:02.133
She didn't have to choose
her family over our friendship.
