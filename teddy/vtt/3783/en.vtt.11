00:05:29.297 --> 00:05:31.077
but it's not really where we exist --

00:05:31.077 --> 00:05:33.507
polarity is not our actual reality --

00:05:33.507 --> 00:05:34.887
where do we go from there?

00:05:34.887 --> 00:05:38.367
What's at the other end of that spectrum?

00:05:38.368 --> 00:05:42.407
I don't think it's an unattainable,
harmonious utopia,

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:45.841
I think the opposite
of polarity is duality.

00:05:45.842 --> 00:05:48.446
Duality is a state of having two parts,

00:05:48.446 --> 00:05:51.729
but not in diametrical opposition,

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.675
in simultaneous existence.

00:05:54.676 --> 00:05:56.662
Don't think it's possible?

00:05:56.663 --> 00:05:58.333
Here are the people I know:

00:05:58.334 --> 00:06:01.497
I know Catholics who are pro-choice,
and feminists who wear hijabs,
