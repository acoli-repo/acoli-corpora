to protect the people I love from it.

00:13:31.906 --> 00:13:34.440
But then I take my niece off my shoulders,

00:13:34.441 --> 00:13:36.615
and she runs to Elsa and Anna --

00:13:36.616 --> 00:13:39.182
the thing she's been
waiting so long for --

00:13:39.183 --> 00:13:41.270
and all that stuff goes away.


00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.980
All that matters is the smile on her face.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:50.637
And as the 30 seconds we waited
two and a half hours for comes to a close

00:13:50.638 --> 00:13:55.841
we gather up our things,
and I lock eyes with the clerk again;

00:13:55.842 --> 00:13:58.978
and she gives me
an apologetic smile and mouths,

00:13:58.979 --> 00:14:01.275
"I am so sorry!"
