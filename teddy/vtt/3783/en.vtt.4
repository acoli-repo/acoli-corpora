00:01:57.948 --> 00:02:02.333
There were cardboard
cut-out snowflakes covering the floor,

00:02:02.334 --> 00:02:07.252
glitter on every flat surface,
and icicles all over the walls.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.063
And as we stood in line

00:02:09.063 --> 00:02:11.596
in an attempt to give
my niece a better vantage point

00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:14.151
than the backside
of the mother of number 58,

00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:15.879
I put her up on my shoulders,

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.978
and she was instantly riveted
by the sight of the princesses.

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.519
And as we moved forward,
her excitement only grew,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.804
and as we finally got
to the front of the line,

00:02:24.804 --> 00:02:28.497
and number 58 unfurled her poster
to be signed by the princesses,

00:02:28.498 --> 00:02:32.097
I could literally feel the excitement
running through her body.
