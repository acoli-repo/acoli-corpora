But the things that bonded us
were when she asked about my girlfriend,

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:35.787
or she shared pictures that she had
from her family back home.

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:38.415
Those were the things
that brought us together.

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.002
So one day, we were in the back,

00:07:40.003 --> 00:07:43.682
scarfing down food as quickly as we could,
gathered around a small table,

00:07:43.683 --> 00:07:45.313
during a very rare lull,

00:07:45.313 --> 00:07:47.323
and a new guy

00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:51.787
and sat down with all

00:07:51.788 --> 00:07:53.949
that his 20-year-old body could hold.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.771
(Laughter)

00:07:55.772 --> 00:08:00.744
And he said to her,
[in Spanish] "Does Ash have a boyfriend?"
