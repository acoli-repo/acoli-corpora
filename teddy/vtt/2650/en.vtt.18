or an itch to solve a puzzle.

00:09:01.544 --> 00:09:04.713
They're more likely to feel intrigued
when they encounter something

00:09:04.737 --> 00:09:06.833
that contradicts their expectations.

00:09:07.206 --> 00:09:09.183
Scouts also have different values.

00:09:09.207 --> 00:09:12.279
They're more likely to say
they think it's virtuous

00:09:12.303 --> 00:09:13.792
to test your own beliefs,

00:09:13.816 --> 00:09:17.522
and they're less likely to say
that someone who changes his mind

00:09:17.546 --> 00:09:18.808
seems weak.

00:09:18.832 --> 00:09:20.717
And above all, scouts are grounded,

00:09:20.741 --> 00:09:24.646
which means their self-worth as a person

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:30.136
isn't tied to how right or wrong
they are about any particular topic.
