00:00:30.826 --> 00:00:34.363
So now, I'd like you to imagine
playing a very different role,

00:00:34.387 --> 00:00:35.988
that of the scout.

00:00:36.012 --> 00:00:39.401
The scout's job is not
to attack or defend.

00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:41.820
The scout's job is to understand.

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:44.294
The scout is the one going out,

00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:48.381
mapping the terrain,
identifying potential obstacles.

00:00:48.405 --> 00:00:51.981
And the scout may hope to learn
that, say, there's a bridge

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:54.339
in a convenient location across a river.

00:00:54.363 --> 00:00:57.410
But above all, the scout
wants to know what's really there,

00:00:57.434 --> 00:00:59.027
as accurately as possible.
