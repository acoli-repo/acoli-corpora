A lot of people feel like Picquart
can't really be the hero of this story

00:07:32.515 --> 00:07:36.744
because he was an anti-Semite
and that's bad, which I agree with.

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:41.974
But personally, for me,
the fact that Picquart was anti-Semitic

00:07:41.998 --> 00:07:44.583
actually makes his actions more admirable,

00:07:44.607 --> 00:07:47.723
because he had the same prejudices,
the same reasons to be biased

00:07:47.747 --> 00:07:49.532
as his fellow officers,

00:07:49.556 --> 00:07:54.191
but his motivation to find the truth
and uphold it trumped all of that.

00:07:55.108 --> 00:07:56.297
So to me,

00:07:56.321 --> 00:08:00.127
Picquart is a poster child
for what I call "scout mindset."
