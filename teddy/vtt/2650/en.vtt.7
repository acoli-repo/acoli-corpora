And they sentenced him
to life imprisonment

00:03:31.401 --> 00:03:34.141
on the aptly named Devil's Island,

00:03:34.165 --> 00:03:36.989
which is this barren rock
off the coast of South America.

00:03:37.556 --> 00:03:41.306
So there he went,
and there he spent his days alone,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.834
writing letters and letters
to the French government

00:03:43.858 --> 00:03:47.166
begging them to reopen his case
so they could discover his innocence.

00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:50.547
But for the most part,
France considered the matter closed.

00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:55.594
One thing that's really interesting
to me about the Dreyfus Affair

00:03:55.618 --> 00:03:59.396
is this question of why the officers
were so convinced

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.141
that Dreyfus was guilty.
