00:06:57.718 --> 00:07:01.306
or came up with elaborate rationalizations
to explain his findings,

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.703
like, "Well, all you've really shown,
Picquart, is that there's another spy

00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:09.100
who learned how to mimic
Dreyfus's handwriting,

00:07:09.124 --> 00:07:12.664
and he picked up the torch of spying
after Dreyfus left.

00:07:13.148 --> 00:07:14.798
But Dreyfus is still guilty."

00:07:15.854 --> 00:07:18.879
Eventually, Picquart managed
to get Dreyfus exonerated.

00:07:18.903 --> 00:07:20.431
But it took him 10 years,

00:07:20.455 --> 00:07:22.986
and for part of that time,
he himself was in prison

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.308
for the crime of disloyalty to the army.

00:07:26.491 --> 00:07:32.491
A lot of people feel like Picquart
can't really be the hero of this story
