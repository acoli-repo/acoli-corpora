00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:30.136
isn't tied to how right or wrong
they are about any particular topic.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.414
So they can believe
that capital punishment works.

00:09:33.438 --> 00:09:36.251
If studies come out showing
that it doesn't, they can say,

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:40.184
"Huh. Looks like I might be wrong.
Doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid."

00:09:41.954 --> 00:09:46.280
This cluster of traits
is what researchers have found --

00:09:46.304 --> 00:09:48.010
and I've also found anecdotally --

00:09:48.034 --> 00:09:49.865
predicts good judgment.

00:09:50.386 --> 00:09:53.669
And the key takeaway I want
to leave you with about those traits

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:57.330
is that they're primarily
not about how smart you are

00:09:57.354 --> 00:09:59.352
or about how much you know.

00:09:59.376 --> 00:10:02.182
In fact, they don't correlate
very much with IQ at all.
