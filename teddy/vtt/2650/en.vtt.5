00:02:29.544 --> 00:02:31.584
They went and searched
Dreyfus's apartment,

00:02:31.608 --> 00:02:33.364
looking for any signs of espionage.

00:02:33.388 --> 00:02:36.348
They went through his files,
and they didn't find anything.

00:02:36.372 --> 00:02:39.506
This just convinced them more
that Dreyfus was not only guilty,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.823
but sneaky as well, because clearly
he had hidden all of the evidence

00:02:42.847 --> 00:02:44.696
before they had managed to get to it.

00:02:45.212 --> 00:02:47.904

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.664

foreign languages in school,

00:02:54.688 --> 00:02:58.741
which clearly showed a desire
to conspire with foreign governments

00:02:58.765 --> 00:02:59.948
later in life.

00:02:59.972 --> 00:03:05.983
His teachers also said that Dreyfus
was known for having a good memory,
