00:05:29.605 --> 00:05:32.121
and the study shows
that it's not effective,

00:05:32.145 --> 00:05:35.391
then you're highly motivated
to find all the reasons

00:05:35.415 --> 00:05:37.588
why the study was poorly designed.

00:05:37.612 --> 00:05:39.818
But if it shows
that capital punishment works,

00:05:39.842 --> 00:05:41.001
it's a good study.

00:05:41.025 --> 00:05:44.273
And vice versa: if you don't
support capital punishment, same thing.

00:05:44.297 --> 00:05:47.126
Our judgment is strongly
influenced, unconsciously,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.428
by which side we want to win.

00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:51.960
And this is ubiquitous.

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:55.022
This shapes how we think
about our health, our relationships,

00:05:55.046 --> 00:05:56.942
how we decide how to vote,

00:05:56.966 --> 00:05:59.334
what we consider fair or ethical.
