00:00:00.826 --> 00:00:03.469
So I'd like you to imagine for a moment

00:00:03.493 --> 00:00:05.873
that you're a soldier
in the heat of battle.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.261
Maybe you're a Roman foot soldier
or a medieval archer

00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:12.165
or maybe you're a Zulu warrior.

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:16.443
Regardless of your time and place,
there are some things that are constant.

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:18.361
Your adrenaline is elevated,

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:23.194
and your actions are stemming
from these deeply ingrained reflexes,

00:00:23.218 --> 00:00:27.574
reflexes rooted in a need
to protect yourself and your side

00:00:27.598 --> 00:00:29.287
and to defeat the enemy.
