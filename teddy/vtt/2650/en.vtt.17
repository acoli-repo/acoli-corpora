00:08:27.046 --> 00:08:30.834
able to cut through their own prejudices
and biases and motivations

00:08:30.858 --> 00:08:33.153
and just try to see the facts
and the evidence

00:08:33.177 --> 00:08:34.650
as objectively as they can?

00:08:35.602 --> 00:08:38.613
And the answer is emotional.

00:08:39.119 --> 00:08:42.886
So, just as soldier mindset
is rooted in emotions

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:45.898
like defensiveness or tribalism,

00:08:46.615 --> 00:08:47.981
scout mindset is, too.

00:08:48.005 --> 00:08:49.991
It's just rooted in different emotions.

00:08:50.015 --> 00:08:53.434
For example, scouts are curious.

00:08:53.458 --> 00:08:57.004
They're more likely to say
they feel pleasure

00:08:57.028 --> 00:08:58.688
when they learn new information

00:08:58.712 --> 00:09:01.023
or an itch to solve a puzzle.
