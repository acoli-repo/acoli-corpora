It's this phenomenon in which
our unconscious motivations,

00:04:31.598 --> 00:04:33.950
our desires and fears,

00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:36.320
shape the way we interpret information.

00:04:36.344 --> 00:04:39.754
Some information, some ideas,
feel like our allies.

00:04:39.778 --> 00:04:42.420
We want them to win.
We want to defend them.

00:04:42.444 --> 00:04:44.975
And other information
or ideas are the enemy,

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:46.567
and we want to shoot them down.

00:04:47.408 --> 00:04:51.115
So this is why I call
motivated reasoning, "soldier mindset."

00:04:51.988 --> 00:04:54.993

00:04:55.017 --> 00:04:57.298
a French-Jewish officer for high treason,

00:04:57.322 --> 00:04:58.795
I assume,

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:03.678
but maybe you've followed sports
or politics, so you might have noticed
