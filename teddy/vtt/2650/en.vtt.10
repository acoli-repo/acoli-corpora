00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:03.678
but maybe you've followed sports
or politics, so you might have noticed

00:05:03.702 --> 00:05:07.824
that when the referee judges
that your team committed a foul,

00:05:07.848 --> 00:05:09.010
for example,

00:05:09.034 --> 00:05:12.127
you're highly motivated
to find reasons why he's wrong.

00:05:12.482 --> 00:05:15.594
But if he judges that the other team
committed a foul -- awesome!

00:05:15.618 --> 00:05:18.180
That's a good call,
let's not examine it too closely.

00:05:18.792 --> 00:05:20.909
Or, maybe you've read
an article or a study

00:05:20.933 --> 00:05:23.639
that examined some controversial policy,

00:05:23.663 --> 00:05:24.879
like capital punishment.

00:05:25.735 --> 00:05:27.852
And, as researchers have demonstrated,

00:05:27.876 --> 00:05:29.581
if you support capital punishment

00:05:29.605 --> 00:05:32.121
and the study shows
that it's not effective,
