Picquart is a poster child
for what I call "scout mindset."

00:08:00.598 --> 00:08:04.674
It's the drive not to make
one idea win or another lose,

00:08:04.698 --> 00:08:06.622
but just to see what's really there

00:08:06.646 --> 00:08:09.121
as honestly and accurately as you can,

00:08:09.145 --> 00:08:12.425
even if it's not pretty
or convenient or pleasant.

00:08:13.444 --> 00:08:16.690
This mindset is what
I'm personally passionate about.

00:08:16.714 --> 00:08:21.843
And I've spent the last few years
examining and trying to figure out

00:08:21.867 --> 00:08:23.850
what causes scout mindset.

00:08:23.874 --> 00:08:27.022
Why are some people, sometimes at least,

00:08:27.046 --> 00:08:30.834
able to cut through their own prejudices
and biases and motivations
