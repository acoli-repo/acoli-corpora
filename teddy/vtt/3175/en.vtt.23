00:11:29.708 --> 00:11:32.029
This allows the cell
to operate more efficiently.

00:11:32.627 --> 00:11:35.595
We're probing these kinds
of opportunities further.

00:11:35.619 --> 00:11:38.864
We're asking whether
we can use the cold of space

00:11:38.888 --> 00:11:40.967
to help us with water conservation.

00:11:41.316 --> 00:11:43.665
Or perhaps with off-grid scenarios.

00:11:43.689 --> 00:11:47.856
Perhaps we could even directly
generate power with this cold.

00:11:48.522 --> 00:11:51.475
There's a large temperature difference
between us here on earth

00:11:51.499 --> 00:11:53.189
and the cold of space.

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.341
That difference, at least conceptually,

00:11:55.365 --> 00:11:57.959
could be used to drive
something called a heat engine

00:11:57.983 --> 00:11:59.173
to generate electricity.

00:11:59.967 --> 00:12:03.570
Could we then make a nighttime
power-generation device
