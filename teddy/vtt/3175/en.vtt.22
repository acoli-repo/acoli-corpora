00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.895
We can use the cold darkness of space

00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:04.569
to improve the efficiency

00:11:04.593 --> 00:11:07.847
of every energy-related
process here on earth.

00:11:09.204 --> 00:11:12.521
One such process
I'd like to highlight are solar cells.

00:11:12.934 --> 00:11:14.379
They heat up under the sun

00:11:14.403 --> 00:11:16.887
and become less efficient
the hotter they are.

00:11:17.276 --> 00:11:21.153
In 2015, we showed that
with deliberate kinds of microstructures

00:11:21.177 --> 00:11:22.724
on top of a solar cell,

00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:25.592
we could take better advantage
of this cooling effect

00:11:25.616 --> 00:11:29.315
to maintain a solar cell passively
at a lower temperature.

00:11:29.708 --> 00:11:32.029
This allows the cell
to operate more efficiently.
