WEBVTT

00:09:29.974 --> 00:09:32.041
using our specialized material.

00:09:32.815 --> 00:09:35.275
These panels can then
be integrated with a component

00:09:35.299 --> 00:09:37.867
almost every cooling system has,
called a condenser,

00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:41.024
to improve the system's
underlying efficiency.

00:09:41.367 --> 00:09:43.263
Our start-up, SkyCool Systems,

00:09:43.287 --> 00:09:47.161
has recently completed a field trial
in Davis, California, shown right here.

00:09:47.649 --> 00:09:48.831
In that demonstration,

00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:51.903
we showed that we could actually
improve the efficiency

00:09:51.927 --> 00:09:54.851
of that cooling system
as much as 12 percent in the field.

00:09:55.474 --> 00:09:56.728
Over the next year or two,

00:09:56.752 --> 00:10:00.656
I'm super excited to see this go
to its first commercial-scale pilots
