The people who operated
this ice house many centuries ago,

00:03:33.442 --> 00:03:35.926
would pour water
in the pool you see on the left

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.022
in the early evening hours,
as the sun set.

00:03:39.046 --> 00:03:40.855
And then something amazing happened.

00:03:41.442 --> 00:03:44.204
Even though the air temperature
might be above freezing,

00:03:44.228 --> 00:03:47.926
say five degrees Celsius
or 41 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.484
the water would freeze.

00:03:50.724 --> 00:03:54.859
The ice generated would then be collected
in the early morning hours

00:03:54.883 --> 00:03:57.518
and stored for use in the building
you see on the right,

00:03:57.542 --> 00:03:59.478
all the way through the summer months.
