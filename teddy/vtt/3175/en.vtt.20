00:09:56.752 --> 00:10:00.656
I'm super excited to see this go
to its first commercial-scale pilots

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.823
in both the air conditioning
and refrigeration space.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.847
In the future, we might be able
to integrate these kinds of panels

00:10:07.871 --> 00:10:11.180
with higher efficiency
building cooling systems

00:10:11.204 --> 00:10:14.006
to reduce their energy
usage by two-thirds.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.688
And eventually, we might actually
be able to build a cooling system

00:10:17.712 --> 00:10:20.275
that requires no electricity input at all.

00:10:20.966 --> 00:10:22.482
As a first step towards that,

00:10:22.506 --> 00:10:24.363
my colleagues at Stanford and I

00:10:24.387 --> 00:10:26.413
have shown that you could
actually maintain

00:10:26.437 --> 00:10:31.006
something more than 42 degrees Celsius
below the air temperature
