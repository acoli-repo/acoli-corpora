00:04:29.254 --> 00:04:31.158
Namely, the air that surrounds it.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.490
As implausible as it may sound,

00:04:34.514 --> 00:04:39.890
for that pool of water, its heat
is actually flowing to the cold of space.

00:04:42.085 --> 00:04:43.807
How is this possible?

00:04:44.434 --> 00:04:48.006
Well, that pool of water,
like most natural materials,

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.180
sends out its heat as light.

00:04:50.506 --> 00:04:53.323
This is a concept
known as thermal radiation.

00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:58.260
In fact, we're all sending out our heat
as infrared light right now,

00:04:58.284 --> 00:05:00.212
to each other and our surroundings.
