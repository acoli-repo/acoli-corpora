I actually wound up
working on this problem

00:03:02.007 --> 00:03:06.013
because of an intellectual puzzle
that I came across about six years ago.

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:12.766
How were ancient peoples
able to make ice in desert climates?

00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:16.830
This is a picture of an ice house,

00:03:16.854 --> 00:03:20.481
also called a Yakhchal,
located in the southwest of Iran.

00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:24.760
There are ruins of dozens
of such structures throughout Iran,

00:03:24.784 --> 00:03:28.474
with evidence of similar such buildings
throughout the rest of the Middle East

00:03:28.498 --> 00:03:29.712
and all the way to China.
