00:10:26.437 --> 00:10:31.006
something more than 42 degrees Celsius
below the air temperature

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.418
with better engineering.

00:10:33.165 --> 00:10:34.315
Thank you.

00:10:34.339 --> 00:10:38.394
(Applause)

00:10:39.196 --> 00:10:40.347
So just imagine that --

00:10:40.371 --> 00:10:43.774
something that is below freezing
on a hot summer's day.

00:10:45.927 --> 00:10:50.410
So, while I'm very excited
about all we can do for cooling,

00:10:50.434 --> 00:10:53.688
and I think there's a lot yet to be done,

00:10:53.712 --> 00:10:57.180
as a scientist, I'm also drawn
to a more profound opportunity

00:10:57.204 --> 00:10:59.220
that I believe this work highlights.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.895
We can use the cold darkness of space
