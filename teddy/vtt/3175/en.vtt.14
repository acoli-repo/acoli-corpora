00:06:58.157 --> 00:07:00.617
So, for the surface
that's doing the cooling,

00:07:00.641 --> 00:07:02.815
it needs to be able to face the sky.

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:04.467
And during the middle of the day,

00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:07.641
when we might want
something cold the most,

00:07:07.665 --> 00:07:10.561
unfortunately, that means
you're going to look up to the sun.

00:07:10.585 --> 00:07:12.441
And the sun heats most materials up

00:07:12.465 --> 00:07:15.222
enough to completely counteract
this cooling effect.

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:18.417
My colleagues and I
spend a lot of our time

00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:20.553
thinking about how
we can structure materials

00:07:20.577 --> 00:07:21.989
at very small length scales

00:07:22.013 --> 00:07:25.339
such that they can do
new and useful things with light --

00:07:25.363 --> 00:07:28.353
length scales smaller
than the wavelength of light itself.

00:07:28.377 --> 00:07:29.957
Using insights from this field,

00:07:29.981 --> 00:07:33.109
known as nanophotonics
or metamaterials research,
