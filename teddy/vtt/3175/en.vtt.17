Just to emphasize how weird
and counterintuitive this is:

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.600
this material and others like it

00:08:32.624 --> 00:08:35.529
will get colder when we take them
out of the shade,

00:08:35.553 --> 00:08:37.913
even though the sun is shining on it.

00:08:37.937 --> 00:08:40.620
I'm showing you data here
from our very first experiment,

00:08:40.644 --> 00:08:43.383
where that material stayed
more than five degrees Celsius,

00:08:43.407 --> 00:08:46.683
or nine degrees Fahrenheit, colder
than the air temperature,

00:08:46.707 --> 00:08:49.521
even though the sun
was shining directly on it.

00:08:50.855 --> 00:08:53.990
The manufacturing method we used
to actually make this material

00:08:54.014 --> 00:08:56.548
already exists at large volume scales.

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:58.060
So I was really excited,

00:08:58.084 --> 00:09:01.125
because not only
do we make something cool,
