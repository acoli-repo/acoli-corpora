00:11:59.967 --> 00:12:03.570
Could we then make a nighttime
power-generation device

00:12:03.594 --> 00:12:05.991
that generates useful
amounts of electricity

00:12:06.015 --> 00:12:07.919
when solar cells don't work?

00:12:07.943 --> 00:12:10.477
Could we generate light from darkness?

00:12:11.872 --> 00:12:16.261
Central to this ability
is being able to manage

00:12:16.285 --> 00:12:19.396
the thermal radiation
that's all around us.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.220
We're constantly bathed in infrared light;

00:12:22.666 --> 00:12:25.118
if we could bend it to our will,

00:12:25.142 --> 00:12:27.872
we could profoundly change
the flows of heat and energy

00:12:27.896 --> 00:12:30.629
that permeate around us every single day.
