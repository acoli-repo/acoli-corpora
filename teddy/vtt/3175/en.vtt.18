00:08:58.084 --> 00:09:01.125
because not only
do we make something cool,

00:09:01.149 --> 00:09:06.202
but we might actually have the opportunity
to do something real and make it useful.

00:09:07.204 --> 00:09:09.117
That brings me to the next big question.

00:09:09.141 --> 00:09:11.728
How do you actually
save energy with this idea?

00:09:11.752 --> 00:09:15.410
Well, we believe the most direct way
to save energy with this technology

00:09:15.434 --> 00:09:17.093
is as an efficiency boost

00:09:17.117 --> 00:09:20.180
for today's air-conditioning
and refrigeration systems.

00:09:20.561 --> 00:09:22.720
To do this, we've built
fluid cooling panels,

00:09:22.744 --> 00:09:24.315
like the ones shown right here.

00:09:24.339 --> 00:09:27.006
These panels have a similar shape
to solar water heaters,

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.950
except they do the opposite --
they cool the water, passively,

00:09:29.974 --> 00:09:32.041
using our specialized material.
