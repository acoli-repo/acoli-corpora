When I came across all of this,

00:06:30.395 --> 00:06:33.037
it was towards the end
of my PhD at Stanford.

00:06:33.061 --> 00:06:37.490
And I was amazed by its apparent
simplicity as a cooling method,

00:06:37.514 --> 00:06:38.780
yet really puzzled.

00:06:39.284 --> 00:06:41.484
Why aren't we making use of this?

00:06:42.744 --> 00:06:45.625
Now, scientists and engineers
had investigated this idea

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:46.887
in previous decades.

00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:50.199
But there turned out to be
at least one big problem.

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:53.751
It was called night-sky
cooling for a reason.

00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:55.283
Why?

00:06:55.307 --> 00:06:57.676
Well, it's a little thing called the sun.

00:06:58.157 --> 00:07:00.617
So, for the surface
that's doing the cooling,
