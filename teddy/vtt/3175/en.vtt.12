00:05:57.323 --> 00:06:01.133
which can be as cold
as minus 270 degrees Celsius,

00:06:01.157 --> 00:06:03.877
or minus 454 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:06:05.242 --> 00:06:08.606
So that pool of water is able
to send out more heat to the sky

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.401
than the sky sends back to it.

00:06:10.425 --> 00:06:11.575
And because of that,

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:14.615
the pool will cool down
below its surroundings' temperature.

00:06:16.035 --> 00:06:19.551
This is an effect
known as night-sky cooling

00:06:19.575 --> 00:06:20.975
or radiative cooling.

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:24.823
And it's always been understood
by climate scientists and meteorologists

00:06:24.847 --> 00:06:27.447
as a very important natural phenomenon.

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:30.371
When I came across all of this,
