00:07:29.981 --> 00:07:33.109
known as nanophotonics
or metamaterials research,

00:07:33.133 --> 00:07:36.633
we realized that there might be a way
to make this possible during the day

00:07:36.657 --> 00:07:37.830
for the first time.

00:07:37.854 --> 00:07:40.910
To do this, I designed
a multilayer optical material

00:07:40.934 --> 00:07:42.791
shown here in a microscope image.

00:07:42.815 --> 00:07:46.196
It's more than 40 times thinner
than a typical human hair.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.738
And it's able to do
two things simultaneously.

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:50.994
First, it sends its heat out

00:07:51.018 --> 00:07:54.820
precisely where our atmosphere
lets that heat out the best.

00:07:54.844 --> 00:07:56.977
We targeted the window to space.

00:07:57.519 --> 00:08:00.950
The second thing it does
is it avoids getting heated up by the sun.
