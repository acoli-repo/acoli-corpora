00:04:58.284 --> 00:05:00.212
to each other and our surroundings.

00:05:00.608 --> 00:05:03.077
We can actually visualize this
with thermal cameras

00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:06.347
and the images they produce,
like the ones I'm showing you right now.

00:05:06.744 --> 00:05:09.006
So that pool of water
is sending out its heat

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.712
upward towards the atmosphere.

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:13.474
The atmosphere and the molecules in it

00:05:13.498 --> 00:05:16.053
absorb some of that heat and send it back.

00:05:16.077 --> 00:05:19.899
That's actually the greenhouse effect
that's responsible for climate change.

00:05:20.435 --> 00:05:22.958
But here's the critical thing
to understand.

00:05:22.982 --> 00:05:26.182
Our atmosphere doesn't absorb
all of that heat.

00:05:26.577 --> 00:05:29.511
If it did, we'd be
on a much warmer planet.

00:05:29.982 --> 00:05:31.490
At certain wavelengths,
