00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:30.013
A 10 or 20 percent improvement
in the efficiency of every cooling system

00:02:30.037 --> 00:02:33.521
could actually have an enormous impact
on our greenhouse gas emissions,

00:02:33.545 --> 00:02:36.010
both today and later this century.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.629
And it could help us avert
that worst-case feedback loop.

00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:46.608
I'm a scientist who thinks a lot
about light and heat.

00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:50.228
In particular, how new materials
allow us to alter the flow

00:02:50.252 --> 00:02:52.268
of these basic elements of nature

00:02:52.292 --> 00:02:54.934
in ways we might have
once thought impossible.

00:02:55.315 --> 00:02:57.728
So, while I always understood
the value of cooling

00:02:57.752 --> 00:02:59.696
during my summer vacations,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.983
I actually wound up
working on this problem
