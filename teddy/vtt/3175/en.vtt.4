00:01:57.236 --> 00:02:00.569
This then has the potential
to cause a feedback loop,

00:02:00.593 --> 00:02:02.051
where cooling systems alone

00:02:02.075 --> 00:02:05.062
could become one of our biggest sources
of greenhouse gases

00:02:05.086 --> 00:02:06.428
later this century.

00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:07.913
In the worst case,

00:02:07.937 --> 00:02:11.557
we might need more than 10 trillion
kilowatt-hours of electricity every year,

00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:14.269
just for cooling, by the year 2100.

00:02:14.846 --> 00:02:17.711
That's half our electricity supply today.

00:02:18.198 --> 00:02:19.348
Just for cooling.

00:02:20.862 --> 00:02:24.777
But this also point us
to an amazing opportunity.

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:30.013
A 10 or 20 percent improvement
in the efficiency of every cooling system
