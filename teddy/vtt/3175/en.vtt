Every summer when I was growing up,

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.992
I would fly from my home in Canada
to visit my grandparents,

00:00:07.016 --> 00:00:08.816
who lived in Mumbai, India.

00:00:09.157 --> 00:00:12.291
Now, Canadian summers
are pretty mild at best --

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:16.022
about 22 degrees Celsius
or 72 degrees Fahrenheit

00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:18.666
is a typical summer's day,
and not too hot.

00:00:19.276 --> 00:00:22.315
Mumbai, on the other hand,
is a hot and humid place

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.557
well into the 30s Celsius
or 90s Fahrenheit.

00:00:26.364 --> 00:00:27.950
As soon as I'd reach it, I'd ask,

00:00:27.974 --> 00:00:32.384
"How could anyone live, work
or sleep in such weather?"
