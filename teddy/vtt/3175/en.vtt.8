00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:02.852
You've actually likely seen
something very similar at play

00:04:02.876 --> 00:04:06.328
if you've ever noticed frost form
on the ground on a clear night,

00:04:06.352 --> 00:04:09.097
even when the air temperature
is well above freezing.

00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:10.281
But wait.

00:04:10.305 --> 00:04:14.036
How did the water freeze
if the air temperature is above freezing?

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:16.413
Evaporation could have played an effect,

00:04:16.437 --> 00:04:19.752
but that's not enough to actually
cause the water to become ice.

00:04:20.064 --> 00:04:22.150
Something else must have cooled it down.

00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:25.309
Think about a pie
cooling on a window sill.

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:29.230
For it to be able to cool down,
its heat needs to flow somewhere cooler.

00:04:29.254 --> 00:04:31.158
Namely, the air that surrounds it.
