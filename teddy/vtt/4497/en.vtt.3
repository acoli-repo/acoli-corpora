00:01:27.912 --> 00:01:30.984
who allegedly said
that these six words here:

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.860
"For sale: baby shoes, never worn,"

00:01:33.884 --> 00:01:36.217
were the best novel he had ever written.

00:01:36.622 --> 00:01:39.248
And I also encountered a project
called Six-Word Memoirs

00:01:39.272 --> 00:01:41.392
where people were asked,
take your whole life

00:01:41.416 --> 00:01:44.152
and please sum this up
into six words, such as these here:

00:01:44.176 --> 00:01:46.187
"Found true love, married someone else."

00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:48.586
Or "Living in existential
vacuum; it sucks."

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.976
I actually like that one.

00:01:50.692 --> 00:01:53.088
So if a novel can be put into six words

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:56.590
and a whole memoir can be put
into six words,

00:01:56.718 --> 00:01:59.639
you don't need more than six
words for a TED Talk.

00:01:59.663 --> 00:02:02.881
We could have been done by lunch here.
