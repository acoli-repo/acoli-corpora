Or happiness: "Striving toward happiness =
moving toward unhappiness."

00:05:01.395 --> 00:05:02.548
So here I was.

00:05:02.572 --> 00:05:04.582
I had started out
with a thousand TED Talks

00:05:04.606 --> 00:05:07.331
and I had 600 six-word
summaries for those.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.033
Actually, it sounded nice
in the beginning,

00:05:10.057 --> 00:05:13.455
but when you look at 600 summaries,
it's quite a lot, it's a huge list.

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.494
(Laughter)

00:05:14.518 --> 00:05:17.576
So I thought, I probably have
to take this one step further here

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.228
and create summaries of the summaries,
and this is exactly what I did.

00:05:21.252 --> 00:05:24.522
So I took the 600 summaries that I had,
put them into nine groups

00:05:24.546 --> 00:05:28.434
according to the ratings that the talks
had originally received on TED.com

00:05:28.458 --> 00:05:31.343
and asked people to do summaries of those.
