00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:30.316
and ask me if I'd been too much
on Google lately.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.499
(Laughter)

00:04:31.523 --> 00:04:34.616
And finally also, I never understood this,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.774
some people really came up
with their own version of the truth.

00:04:37.798 --> 00:04:40.607
I don't know any TED Talk
that contains this.

00:04:40.631 --> 00:04:42.181
But, oh well.

00:04:42.205 --> 00:04:44.541
In the end, however,
and this is really amazing,

00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:47.405
for each of those 10 TED Talk
clusters that I submitted,

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:49.391
I actually received meaningful summaries.

00:04:49.415 --> 00:04:50.858
Here are some of my favorites.

00:04:50.882 --> 00:04:53.162
For example, for the TED Talks about food,

00:04:53.186 --> 00:04:56.645
someone summed this up into: "Food shaping
body, brains and environment,"

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.057
which I think is pretty good.

00:04:58.081 --> 00:05:01.371
Or happiness: "Striving toward happiness =
moving toward unhappiness."
