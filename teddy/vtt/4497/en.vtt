There's currently over a thousand
TED Talks on the TED website.

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:09.390
And I guess many of you here
think that this is quite fantastic,

00:00:09.414 --> 00:00:11.288
except for me, I don't agree with this.

00:00:11.312 --> 00:00:12.897
I think we have a situation here.

00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:16.288
Because if you think about it,
1,000 TED Talks,

00:00:16.396 --> 00:00:19.829
that's over 1,000 ideas worth spreading.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:23.442
How on earth are you going
to spread a thousand ideas?

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:26.334
Even if you just try
to get all of those ideas into your head

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:28.379
by watching all those thousand TED videos,

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:32.142
it would actually currently take you
over 250 hours to do so.
