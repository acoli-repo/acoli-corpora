Or some even included references
to the speakers,

00:02:31.807 --> 00:02:35.011
such as Nathan Myhrvold's speaking style,
or the one of Tim Ferriss,

00:02:35.035 --> 00:02:37.444
which might be considered
a bit strenuous at times.

00:02:37.468 --> 00:02:40.189
The challenge here is,
if I try to systematically do this,

00:02:40.213 --> 00:02:42.538
I would probably end up
with a lot of summaries,

00:02:42.562 --> 00:02:44.334
but not with many friends in the end.

00:02:44.358 --> 00:02:47.853
So I had to find a different method,
preferably involving total strangers.

00:02:47.877 --> 00:02:51.213
And luckily, there's a website for that,
called Mechanical Turk,

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:53.405
which is a website
where you can post tasks

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:55.119
that you don't want to do yourself,

00:02:55.143 --> 00:02:58.148
such as "Please summarize this text
for me in six words."

00:02:58.172 --> 00:03:01.007
And I didn't allow any low-cost
countries to work on this,
