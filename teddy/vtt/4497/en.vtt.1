it would actually currently take you
over 250 hours to do so.

00:00:32.563 --> 00:00:35.127
And I did a little calculation of this.

00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:39.313
The damage to the economy for each one
who does this is around $15,000.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.213
So having seen this danger to the economy,

00:00:43.237 --> 00:00:46.340
I thought, we need to find
a solution to this problem.

00:00:46.364 --> 00:00:48.122
Here's my approach to it all.

00:00:48.146 --> 00:00:51.352
If you look at the current situation,
you have a thousand TED Talks.

00:00:51.376 --> 00:00:56.251
Each of those TED Talks has
an average length of about 2,300 words.

00:00:56.275 --> 00:01:00.975
Now take this together, and you end up
with 2.3 million words of TED Talks,
