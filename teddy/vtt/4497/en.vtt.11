00:05:28.458 --> 00:05:31.343
and asked people to do summaries of those.

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:33.751
Again, there were some misunderstandings.

00:05:33.775 --> 00:05:36.740
For example, when I had a cluster
of all the "Beautiful" talks,

00:05:36.764 --> 00:05:39.983
someone thought I was just trying
to find the ultimate pick-up line.

00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:42.184
But in the end, amazingly,

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:43.789
again, people were able to do it.

00:05:43.813 --> 00:05:45.867
For example, all the courageous TED Talks:

00:05:45.891 --> 00:05:48.330
"People dying" or "People
suffering" was also one,

00:05:48.354 --> 00:05:49.751
"with easy solutions around."

00:05:49.775 --> 00:05:52.260
Or the recipe for the ultimate
jaw-dropping TED Talk:

00:05:52.284 --> 00:05:54.815
"Flickr photos of intergalactic
classical composer."

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:57.197
I mean that's the essence of it all.

00:05:57.712 --> 00:06:02.684
Now I had my nine groups, but, I mean,
it's already quite a reduction.
