00:02:58.172 --> 00:03:01.007
And I didn't allow any low-cost
countries to work on this,

00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:04.731
but I found out I could get
a six-word summary for just 10 cents,

00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:07.001
which I think is a pretty good price.

00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:08.725
Even then, unfortunately,

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.594
it's not possible to summarize
each TED Talk individually.

00:03:11.618 --> 00:03:14.372
Because if you do the math,
you have a thousand TED Talks,

00:03:14.396 --> 00:03:15.562
you pay 10 cents each;

00:03:15.586 --> 00:03:18.531
you have to do more than one summary
for each of those talks,

00:03:18.555 --> 00:03:21.342
because some of them will probably
be, or are, really bad.

00:03:21.366 --> 00:03:24.176
So I would end up paying
hundreds of dollars.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.976
So I thought of a different way,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.374
by thinking, well, the talks
revolve around certain themes.

00:03:29.398 --> 00:03:34.059
So what if I don't let people summarize
individual TED Talks to six words,
