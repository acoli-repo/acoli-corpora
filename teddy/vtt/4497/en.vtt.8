I guess many of you have seen
one or more of his talks.

00:04:02.452 --> 00:04:03.788
He's got eight talks online,

00:04:03.812 --> 00:04:06.528
and those can basically be summed up
into just four words,

00:04:06.552 --> 00:04:10.795
because that's all he's basically
showing us, our intuition is really bad.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.546
He always proves us wrong.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.133
So people on the Internet,
some didn't do so well.

00:04:15.157 --> 00:04:18.550
And when I asked them to summarize
the 10 TED Talks at the same time,

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:20.054
some took the easy route out.

00:04:20.078 --> 00:04:22.399
They just had some general comment.

00:04:22.513 --> 00:04:25.549
There were others --
and I found this quite cheeky --

00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:27.983
They used their six words
to talk back to me

00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:30.316
and ask me if I'd been too much
on Google lately.
