00:01:59.663 --> 00:02:02.881
We could have been done by lunch here.

00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:04.388
(Laughter)

00:02:04.412 --> 00:02:06.622
And if you did this
for all thousand TED Talks,

00:02:06.646 --> 00:02:09.974
you would get from 2.3 million
words down to 6,000.

00:02:09.998 --> 00:02:11.871
So I thought this was quite worthwhile.

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:13.653
So I started asking all my friends,

00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:16.675
please take your favorite TED Talk
and put that into six words.

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:18.943
So here are some of the results
that I received.

00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:20.315
I think they're quite nice.

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:23.439
For example, Dan Pink's talk
on motivation, which was pretty good,

00:02:23.463 --> 00:02:26.569
if you haven't seen it:
"Drop carrot. Drop stick. Bring meaning."

00:02:26.593 --> 00:02:29.465
It's what he's basically talking about
in those 18,5 minutes.

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.783
Or some even included references
to the speakers,
