00:06:29.887 --> 00:06:33.315
And unfortunately,
when I first received the answers --

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:36.557
and here, you'll see six of the answers --
I was a bit disappointed.

00:06:36.581 --> 00:06:39.805
Because I think you'll agree,
they all summarize some aspect of TED,

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:41.753
but to me, they felt a bit bland,

00:06:41.777 --> 00:06:45.046
or they just had
a certain aspect of TED in them.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.834
So I was almost ready to give up

00:06:46.858 --> 00:06:49.957
when one night, I played around
with these sentences

00:06:49.981 --> 00:06:53.904
and found out that there's actually
a beautiful solution in here.

00:06:53.928 --> 00:06:56.292
So here it is,

00:06:56.316 --> 00:07:00.298
a crowd-sourced, six-word
summary of a thousand TED Talks
