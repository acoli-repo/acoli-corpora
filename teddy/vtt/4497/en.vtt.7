00:03:29.398 --> 00:03:34.059
So what if I don't let people summarize
individual TED Talks to six words,

00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:36.099
but give them 10 TED Talks
at the same time

00:03:36.123 --> 00:03:38.744
and say, "Please do a six-word
summary for that one."

00:03:38.768 --> 00:03:40.931
I would cut my costs by 90 percent.

00:03:40.955 --> 00:03:43.485
So for $60,

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:47.500
I could summarize a thousand TED Talks
into just 600 summaries,

00:03:47.524 --> 00:03:49.522
which would actually be quite nice.

00:03:49.546 --> 00:03:51.839
Some of you might actually
right now be thinking,

00:03:51.863 --> 00:03:55.361
it's downright crazy to have 10 TED Talks
summarized into just six words.

00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:56.665
But it's actually not,

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.818
because there's an example
by statistics professor Hans Rosling.

00:03:59.842 --> 00:04:02.428
I guess many of you have seen
one or more of his talks.
