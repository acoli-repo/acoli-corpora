00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
involving more than 1,000 schools in China,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
working on issues

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
such as education, poverty,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
health care and the environment.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
There is so much organic social action

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000

And this idea, again,

came from the grassroots,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and volunteered themselves for the job.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And I found it fascinating

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
that the social responsibility team
