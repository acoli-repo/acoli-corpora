WEBVTT

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is that compassion is the happiest state ever.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Reading about Matthieu

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
was one of the pivotal moments of my life.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
My dream

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
is to create the conditions

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
for world peace in my lifetime --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and to do that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
by creating the conditions

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
for inner peace

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and compassion

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
on a global scale.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And learning about Matthieu

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
gave me a new angle to look at my work.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Matthieu's brain scan shows

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that compassion is not a chore.
