which we jokingly call "Searching Inside Yourself."

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
It's less naughty than it sounds.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
So I'm an engineer by training,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
which I find kind of funny,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
So "Search Inside Yourself" -- how does it work?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
The first step

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
is attention training.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Attention is the basis
