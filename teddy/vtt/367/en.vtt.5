00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
That would create the conditions

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
for world peace.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So, I started paying attention

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
to what compassion looks like in a business setting.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Fortunately, I didn't have to look very far.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes --

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
in Google, my company.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I know there are other compassionate companies in the world,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
but Google is the place I'm familiar with

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
because I've been there for 10 years,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
so I'll use Google as the case study.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Google is a company

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
born of idealism.
