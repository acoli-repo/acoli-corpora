00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So what are they?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The first benefit of compassion

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
is that it creates highly effective business leaders.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
What does that mean?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
There are three components of compassion.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
There is the affective component,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
which is, "I feel for you."

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
There is the cognitive component,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
which is, "I understand you."

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And there is a motivational component,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
which is, "I want to help you."

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So what has this got to do with business leadership?
