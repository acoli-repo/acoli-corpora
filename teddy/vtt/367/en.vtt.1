00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
versus the right prefrontal cortex.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And Matthieu's happiness measure

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is off the charts.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
He's by far the happiest man

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
ever measured by science.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Which leads us to a question:

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What was he thinking when he was being measured?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Perhaps something very naughty.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
(Laughter)

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Actually, he was meditating

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
on compassion.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Matthieu's own experience

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is that compassion is the happiest state ever.
