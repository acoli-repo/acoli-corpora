00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
they just go ahead and do it,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And sometimes it gets big enough

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
to become official.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So in other words,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
it almost always starts from the bottom up.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And let me give you some examples.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The first example is the largest annual community event --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
where Googlers from around the world

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
donate their labor to their local communities --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
was initiated and organized

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
by three employees

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
before it became official,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
because it just became too big.
