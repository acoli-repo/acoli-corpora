00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
of passionate concern

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
for the greater good.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
So always think:

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
how is your company and your job

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
serving the greater good?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Or, how can you further serve

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
the greater good?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
This awareness of serving the greater good

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
is very self-inspiring

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and it creates fertile ground

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
for compassion to grow in.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
That's one.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
The second ingredient

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
is autonomy.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So in Google, there's a lot of autonomy.
