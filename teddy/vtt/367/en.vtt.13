00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So what has this got to do with business leadership?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
According to a very comprehensive study

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
led by Jim Collins,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and documented in the book "Good to Great,"

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
it takes a very special kind of leader

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
to bring a company

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
from goodness to greatness.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And he calls them "Level 5 leaders."

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
These are leaders

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
who, in addition to being highly capable,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
possess two important qualities,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and they are

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
humility and ambition.
