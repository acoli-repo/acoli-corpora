00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Matthieu's brain scan shows

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that compassion is not a chore.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Compassion is something that creates happiness.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Compassion is fun.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And that mind-blowing insight

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
changes the entire game.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Because if compassion was a chore,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
nobody's going to do it,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
except maybe the Dalai Lama or something.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But if compassion was fun,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
everybody's going to do it.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Therefore,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
to create the conditions for global compassion,
