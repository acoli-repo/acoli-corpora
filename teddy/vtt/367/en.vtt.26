00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Someday, we hope to open-source

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
"Search Inside Yourself"

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
so that everybody in the corporate world

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
will at least be able to use it as a reference.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And in closing,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I want to end the same place I started,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
with happiness.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I want to quote this guy -- the guy in robes, not the other guy --

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
the Dalai Lama,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
who said, "If you want others to be happy,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
practice compassion.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
If you want to be happy,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
practice compassion."

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
I found this to be true,
