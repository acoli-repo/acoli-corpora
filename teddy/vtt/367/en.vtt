00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So what does the happiest man in the world look like?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
He certainly doesn't look like me.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
He looks like this.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
His name is Matthieu Ricard.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Well it turns out

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
there is a way to measure happiness in the brain.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And you do that by measuring the relative activation

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
versus the right prefrontal cortex.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And Matthieu's happiness measure
