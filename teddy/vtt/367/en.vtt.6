Google is a company

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
born of idealism.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
It's a company that thrives on idealism.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And maybe because of that,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
compassion is organic

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
taking the initiative to do something.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And they don't usually ask for permission;

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
they just go ahead and do it,
