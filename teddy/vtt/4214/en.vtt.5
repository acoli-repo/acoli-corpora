And then there's the Black Power movement.

00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:34.365
Most movements need their icons, right?

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.707
You have the fist, you have the 'fro.

00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:39.415
These things coincide with
the Black Panther aesthetic,

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.045
where you could kind of
spot your tribe from afar,

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.118
because you're not just keeping
a pick in, like, your beauty kit.

00:02:45.142 --> 00:02:46.672
It's in your back pocket,

00:02:46.696 --> 00:02:49.067
purposely with the first
outside of it,

00:02:49.091 --> 00:02:51.465
and in your hair,
you'll rock it in your 'fro.

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.400
If I think about iconic Afros,

00:02:53.424 --> 00:02:55.686
I definitely think about Angela Davis.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.764
Her 'fro personifies elegance, style,

00:02:58.788 --> 00:03:00.547
freedom, rebellion.
