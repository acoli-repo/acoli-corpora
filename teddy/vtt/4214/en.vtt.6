00:02:58.788 --> 00:03:00.547
freedom, rebellion.

00:03:00.571 --> 00:03:02.427
You feel all of these feelings at once

00:03:02.451 --> 00:03:05.707
when you see Angela Davis
fighting for her life in federal court.

00:03:05.731 --> 00:03:09.289
By the 80s, the Afro style
became less radical.

00:03:09.313 --> 00:03:11.784
The Afro picks are still
produced to this day

00:03:11.808 --> 00:03:12.959
with the clenched fist,

00:03:12.983 --> 00:03:14.924
so it's the remnants of the movement

00:03:14.948 --> 00:03:16.745
in the everyday object.

00:03:17.193 --> 00:03:19.927
When I was young, it was
just, like, another object.

00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:21.144
It was a comb.

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:23.384
But as I became more enlightened

00:03:23.408 --> 00:03:25.864
to really understand
the roots and the origin

00:03:25.888 --> 00:03:28.456
and the intentionality of the design

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.233
and why the fist
and all of these things ...
