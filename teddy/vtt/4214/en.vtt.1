00:00:29.741 --> 00:00:32.478
that felt like you were running
fingers through your hair.

00:00:32.502 --> 00:00:35.808
The shape, even the depth
that it goes in -- it's like a hand.

00:00:35.832 --> 00:00:39.194
You have plastic or nylon teeth,

00:00:39.218 --> 00:00:42.434
and then you have the stainless
steel or the nickel teeth.

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:44.681
I always prefer the metal tooth

00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:46.409
just 'cause I like the sound

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:49.897
and the ones I know have
the black power fist on the handle.

00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:52.097
When I think of black hair in America,

00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:54.547
I think of something that's been policed.

00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:57.177
Back in the days, it was
expected for black people

00:00:57.201 --> 00:00:58.865
to chemically treat their hair.

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:03.058
Whether that's healthy for them
is a secondary thing to blending in.
