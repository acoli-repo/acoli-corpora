You don't really look
at a toothbrush and say,

00:00:02.562 --> 00:00:03.713
"I'm great!"

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:06.574
But when you look at an Afro pick,
which is a grooming tool,

00:00:06.598 --> 00:00:08.849
it can remind you in your
subconscious to, like,

00:00:08.873 --> 00:00:11.683
really be proud and, like, "All right."

00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:13.240
[Small thing.]

00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:15.414
[Big idea.]

00:00:17.492 --> 00:00:20.889
An Afro pick is a utilitarian tool

00:00:20.913 --> 00:00:24.763
used to maintain the Afro hairstyle.

00:00:24.787 --> 00:00:27.254
I think the Afro pick was designed

00:00:27.278 --> 00:00:29.717
for the ergonomics of creating something

00:00:29.741 --> 00:00:32.478
that felt like you were running
fingers through your hair.
