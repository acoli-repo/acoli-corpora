and my grandmother had a small 'fro,

00:02:01.143 --> 00:02:02.797
and that was in the 60s.

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:06.847
African hair combs date back to 3500 BCE.

00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:11.682
The oldest African combs are found
in ancient Egypt and Sudan,

00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:14.374
so they were making pyramids and combs.

00:02:14.398 --> 00:02:17.435
The way the ancient African
combs were embellished

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.899
represented status or tribal affiliation.

00:02:20.923 --> 00:02:25.381
It's no coincidence that the fist
on the modern Afro pick

00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:27.928
also sets the tone for affiliation

00:02:27.952 --> 00:02:29.991
and what set you claim.
