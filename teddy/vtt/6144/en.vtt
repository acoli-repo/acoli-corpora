00:00:00.738 --> 00:00:02.952
I have a tendency to assume the worst,

00:00:03.757 --> 00:00:06.620
and once in a while,
this habit plays tricks on me.

00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:09.925
For example, if I feel
unexpected pain in my body

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:13.456
that I have not experienced before
and that I cannot attribute,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.000
then all of a sudden, my mind
might turn a tense back into heart disease

00:00:18.024 --> 00:00:20.920
or calf muscle pain
into deep vein thrombosis.

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.217
But so far, I haven't been diagnosed
with any deadly or incurable disease.

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:27.653
Sometimes things just hurt
for no clear reason.

00:00:29.098 --> 00:00:31.318
But not everyone is as lucky as me.
