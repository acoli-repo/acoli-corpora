00:06:57.829 --> 00:07:01.976
whether this is also true
in a different, independent tradition.

00:07:02.962 --> 00:07:06.138
So we just ran this same analysis
on the Judeo-Christian tradition,

00:07:06.162 --> 00:07:08.883
and we got virtually the same pattern.

00:07:09.548 --> 00:07:14.183
Again, you see a small increase
for the oldest books in the Old Testament,

00:07:14.207 --> 00:07:16.121
and then it increases much more rapidly

00:07:16.145 --> 00:07:17.984
in the new books of the New Testament.

00:07:18.008 --> 00:07:20.040
And then we get the peak of introspection

00:07:20.064 --> 00:07:22.191
in "The Confessions of Saint Augustine,"

00:07:22.215 --> 00:07:24.072
about four centuries after Christ.

00:07:24.897 --> 00:07:26.841
And this was very important,

00:07:26.865 --> 00:07:30.238
because Saint Augustine
had been recognized by scholars,
