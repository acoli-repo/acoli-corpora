We have historical records that allow us
to know how the ancient Greeks dressed,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.434
how they lived,

00:00:07.458 --> 00:00:08.980
how they fought ...

00:00:09.004 --> 00:00:10.528
but how did they think?

00:00:11.432 --> 00:00:15.872
One natural idea is that the deepest
aspects of human thought --

00:00:15.896 --> 00:00:17.768
our ability to imagine,

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:19.189
to be conscious,

00:00:19.213 --> 00:00:20.444
to dream --

00:00:20.468 --> 00:00:22.087
have always been the same.

00:00:22.872 --> 00:00:24.371
Another possibility

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:28.118
is that the social transformations
that have shaped our culture

00:00:28.142 --> 00:00:31.927
may have also changed
the structural columns of human thought.
