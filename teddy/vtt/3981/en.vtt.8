00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:01.743
that this is a very complex
and high-dimensional space,

00:04:01.767 --> 00:04:03.432
turns out to be quite effective.

00:04:04.155 --> 00:04:06.957
And just to give you a flavor
of how well this works,

00:04:06.981 --> 00:04:10.893
this is the result we get when
we analyze this for some familiar words.

00:04:11.607 --> 00:04:12.792
And you can see first

00:04:12.816 --> 00:04:16.094
that words automatically organize
into semantic neighborhoods.

00:04:16.118 --> 00:04:18.335
So you get the fruits, the body parts,

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.784
the computer parts,
the scientific terms and so on.

00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:25.341
The algorithm also identifies
that we organize concepts in a hierarchy.

00:04:25.852 --> 00:04:27.003
So for instance,

00:04:27.027 --> 00:04:30.624
you can see that the scientific terms
break down into two subcategories
