00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.666
the question of the history
of introspection,

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.023
or of the history of any concept

00:05:34.047 --> 00:05:38.826
which before could seem abstract
and somehow vague,

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.454
becomes concrete --

00:05:40.478 --> 00:05:43.216
becomes amenable to quantitative science.

00:05:44.216 --> 00:05:46.978
All that we have to do is take the books,

00:05:47.002 --> 00:05:48.383
we digitize them,

00:05:48.407 --> 00:05:51.216
and we take this stream
of words as a trajectory

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.209
and project them into the space,

00:05:53.233 --> 00:05:56.987
and then we ask whether this trajectory
spends significant time

00:05:57.011 --> 00:06:00.003
circling closely to the concept
of introspection.
