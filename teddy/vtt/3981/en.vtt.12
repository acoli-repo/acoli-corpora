00:05:57.011 --> 00:06:00.003
circling closely to the concept
of introspection.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.956
And with this,

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.092
we could analyze
the history of introspection

00:06:04.116 --> 00:06:06.037
in the ancient Greek tradition,

00:06:06.061 --> 00:06:08.663
for which we have the best
available written record.

00:06:09.631 --> 00:06:11.886
So what we did is we took all the books --

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.194
we just ordered them by time --

00:06:14.218 --> 00:06:15.970
for each book we take the words

00:06:15.994 --> 00:06:17.955
and we project them to the space,

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.011
and then we ask for each word
how close it is to introspection,

00:06:21.035 --> 00:06:22.265
and we just average that.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.788
And then we ask whether,
as time goes on and on,

00:06:25.812 --> 00:06:29.064
these books get closer,
and closer and closer

00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:30.842
to the concept of introspection.
