00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:02.864
walking in this space
is like walking in the mind.

00:05:04.027 --> 00:05:05.644
And the last thing

00:05:05.668 --> 00:05:09.708
is that this algorithm also identifies
what are our intuitions,

00:05:09.732 --> 00:05:13.628
of which words should lead
in the neighborhood of introspection.

00:05:13.652 --> 00:05:14.875
So for instance,

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:18.878
words such as "self," "guilt,"
"reason," "emotion,"

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.791
are very close to "introspection,"

00:05:20.815 --> 00:05:21.966
but other words,

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.157
such as "red," "football,"
"candle," "banana,"

00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:25.633
are just very far away.

00:05:26.054 --> 00:05:28.816
And so once we've built the space,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.666
the question of the history
of introspection,
