00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:30.842
to the concept of introspection.

00:06:30.866 --> 00:06:34.667
And this is exactly what happens
in the ancient Greek tradition.

00:06:35.698 --> 00:06:38.825
So you can see that for the oldest books
in the Homeric tradition,

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:42.261
there is a small increase with books
getting closer to introspection.

00:06:42.285 --> 00:06:44.491
But about four centuries before Christ,

00:06:44.515 --> 00:06:49.223
this starts ramping up very rapidly
to an almost five-fold increase

00:06:49.247 --> 00:06:51.747
of books getting closer,
and closer and closer

00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:53.453
to the concept of introspection.

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:56.583
And one of the nice things about this

00:06:56.607 --> 00:06:57.805
is that now we can ask

00:06:57.829 --> 00:07:01.976
whether this is also true
in a different, independent tradition.
