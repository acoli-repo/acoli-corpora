00:09:58.923 --> 00:10:01.750
it was not in which semantic
neighborhoods the words were,

00:10:01.774 --> 00:10:04.374
but how far and fast they jumped

00:10:04.398 --> 00:10:06.699
from one semantic neighborhood
to the other one.

00:10:07.247 --> 00:10:08.978
And so we came up with this measure,

00:10:09.002 --> 00:10:11.391
which we termed semantic coherence,

00:10:11.415 --> 00:10:16.219
which essentially measures the persistence
of speech within one semantic topic,

00:10:16.243 --> 00:10:17.772
within one semantic category.

00:10:19.294 --> 00:10:23.341
And it turned out to be
that for this group of 34 people,

00:10:23.365 --> 00:10:27.024
the algorithm based on semantic
coherence could predict,

00:10:27.048 --> 00:10:29.548
with 100 percent accuracy,

00:10:29.572 --> 00:10:32.079
who developed psychosis and who will not.
