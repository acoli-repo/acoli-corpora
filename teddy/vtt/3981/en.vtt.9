00:04:27.027 --> 00:04:30.624
you can see that the scientific terms
break down into two subcategories

00:04:30.648 --> 00:04:32.748
of the astronomic and the physics terms.

00:04:33.338 --> 00:04:35.584
And then there are very fine things.

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:37.513
For instance, the word astronomy,

00:04:37.537 --> 00:04:39.352
which seems a bit bizarre where it is,

00:04:39.376 --> 00:04:41.424
is actually exactly where it should be,

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:43.043
between what it is,

00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:44.337
an actual science,

00:04:44.361 --> 00:04:45.897
and between what it describes,

00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:47.413
the astronomical terms.

00:04:48.182 --> 00:04:50.073
And we could go on and on with this.

00:04:50.097 --> 00:04:52.157
Actually, if you stare
at this for a while,

00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:54.039
and you just build random trajectories,

00:04:54.063 --> 00:04:57.229
you will see that it actually feels
a bit like doing poetry.

00:04:58.018 --> 00:04:59.900
And this is because, in a way,

00:04:59.924 --> 00:05:02.864
walking in this space
is like walking in the mind.
