00:07:59.992 --> 00:08:03.468
which is that now this idea
can be translated

00:08:03.492 --> 00:08:06.063
and generalized to a whole lot
of different domains.

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:11.536
So in the same way that we asked
about the past of human consciousness,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.966
maybe the most challenging question
we can pose to ourselves

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.127
is whether this can tell us something
about the future of our own consciousness.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.020
To put it more precisely,

00:08:21.044 --> 00:08:23.460
whether the words we say today

00:08:23.484 --> 00:08:28.681
can tell us something
of where our minds will be in a few days,

00:08:28.705 --> 00:08:29.856
in a few months

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.062
or a few years from now.
