00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:03.182
So Jaynes's theory is that consciousness,

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:06.372
at least in the way we perceive it today,

00:02:06.396 --> 00:02:09.936
where we feel that we are the pilots
of our own existence --

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.697
is a quite recent cultural development.

00:02:13.456 --> 00:02:15.242
And this theory is quite spectacular,

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:16.699
but it has an obvious problem

00:02:16.723 --> 00:02:20.715
which is that it's built on just a few
and very specific examples.

00:02:21.085 --> 00:02:22.848
So the question is whether the theory

00:02:22.872 --> 00:02:27.623
that introspection built up in human
history only about 3,000 years ago

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:30.631
can be examined in a quantitative
and objective manner.
