00:09:29.793 --> 00:09:33.675
There was just not enough
information in semantics

00:09:33.699 --> 00:09:36.492
to predict the future
organization of the mind.

00:09:36.516 --> 00:09:38.325
It was good enough

00:09:38.349 --> 00:09:42.524
to distinguish between a group
of schizophrenics and a control group,

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:45.260
a bit like we had done
for the ancient texts,

00:09:45.284 --> 00:09:48.278
but not to predict the future
onset of psychosis.

00:09:49.164 --> 00:09:50.870

that maybe the most important thing
was not so much what they were saying,

00:09:55.006 --> 00:09:56.679
but how they were saying it.

00:09:57.679 --> 00:09:58.899
More specifically,

00:09:58.923 --> 00:10:01.750
it was not in which semantic
neighborhoods the words were,
