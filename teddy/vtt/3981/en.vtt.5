00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:30.631
can be examined in a quantitative
and objective manner.

00:02:31.543 --> 00:02:35.106
And the problem of how
to go about this is quite obvious.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.590
It's not like Plato woke up one day
and then he wrote,

00:02:38.614 --> 00:02:40.273
"Hello, I'm Plato,

00:02:40.297 --> 00:02:43.186
and as of today, I have
a fully introspective consciousness."

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.503
(Laughter)

00:02:45.527 --> 00:02:48.860
And this tells us actually
what is the essence of the problem.

00:02:49.467 --> 00:02:53.522
We need to find the emergence
of a concept that's never said.

00:02:54.434 --> 00:02:58.744
The word introspection
does not appear a single time

00:02:58.768 --> 00:03:00.687
in the books we want to analyze.
