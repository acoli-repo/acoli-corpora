00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.225
we took on this task.

00:09:02.228 --> 00:09:07.760
And we did so by analyzing
the recorded speech of 34 young people

00:09:07.784 --> 00:09:10.585
who were at a high risk
of developing schizophrenia.

00:09:11.434 --> 00:09:14.315
And so what we did is,
we measured speech at day one,

00:09:14.339 --> 00:09:17.581
and then we asked whether the properties
of the speech could predict,

00:09:17.605 --> 00:09:20.101
within a window of almost three years,

00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:22.160
the future development of psychosis.

00:09:23.427 --> 00:09:25.793
But despite our hopes,

00:09:25.817 --> 00:09:28.934
we got failure after failure.

00:09:29.793 --> 00:09:33.675
There was just not enough
information in semantics
