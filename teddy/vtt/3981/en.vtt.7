00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:32.967
And there are different ways
that we can construct the space of words.

00:03:32.991 --> 00:03:34.634
One is just asking the experts,

00:03:34.658 --> 00:03:36.554
a bit like we do with dictionaries.

00:03:36.896 --> 00:03:38.324
Another possibility

00:03:38.348 --> 00:03:42.063
is following the simple assumption
that when two words are related,

00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:44.436
they tend to appear in the same sentences,

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.913
in the same paragraphs,

00:03:45.937 --> 00:03:47.707
in the same documents,

00:03:47.731 --> 00:03:50.913
more often than would be expected
just by pure chance.

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:54.281
And this simple hypothesis,

00:03:54.305 --> 00:03:55.611
this simple method,

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:57.242
with some computational tricks

00:03:57.266 --> 00:03:58.655
that have to do with the fact

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:01.743
that this is a very complex
and high-dimensional space,
