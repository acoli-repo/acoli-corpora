or a few years from now.

00:08:31.597 --> 00:08:34.617
And in the same way many of us
are now wearing sensors

00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:36.427
that detect our heart rate,

00:08:36.451 --> 00:08:37.720
our respiration,

00:08:37.744 --> 00:08:39.411
our genes,

00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:43.086
on the hopes that this may
help us prevent diseases,

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:46.631
we can ask whether monitoring
and analyzing the words we speak,

00:08:46.655 --> 00:08:49.338
we tweet, we email, we write,

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:54.170
can tell us ahead of time whether
something may go wrong with our minds.

00:08:55.087 --> 00:08:56.621
And with Guillermo Cecchi,

00:08:56.645 --> 00:08:59.646
who has been my brother in this adventure,

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.225
we took on this task.
