00:07:26.865 --> 00:07:30.238
because Saint Augustine
had been recognized by scholars,

00:07:30.262 --> 00:07:32.434
philologists, historians,

00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:34.536
as one of the founders of introspection.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.357
Actually, some believe him to be
the father of modern psychology.

00:07:39.012 --> 00:07:40.851
So our algorithm,

00:07:40.875 --> 00:07:43.717
which has the virtue
of being quantitative,

00:07:43.741 --> 00:07:45.004
of being objective,

00:07:45.028 --> 00:07:47.044
and of course of being extremely fast --

00:07:47.068 --> 00:07:49.465
it just runs in a fraction of a second --

00:07:49.489 --> 00:07:52.992
can capture some of the most
important conclusions

00:07:53.016 --> 00:07:55.238
of this long tradition of investigation.

00:07:56.317 --> 00:07:59.968
And this is in a way
one of the beauties of science,

00:07:59.992 --> 00:08:03.468
which is that now this idea
can be translated
