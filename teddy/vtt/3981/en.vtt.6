00:02:58.768 --> 00:03:00.687
in the books we want to analyze.

00:03:01.728 --> 00:03:05.815
So our way to solve this
is to build the space of words.

00:03:06.571 --> 00:03:09.858
This is a huge space
that contains all words

00:03:09.882 --> 00:03:12.684
in such a way that the distance
between any two of them

00:03:12.708 --> 00:03:15.591
is indicative of how
closely related they are.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.611
So for instance,

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:20.532
you want the words "dog" and "cat"
to be very close together,

00:03:20.556 --> 00:03:24.387
but the words "grapefruit" and "logarithm"
to be very far away.

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:28.705
And this has to be true
for any two words within the space.

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:32.967
And there are different ways
that we can construct the space of words.
