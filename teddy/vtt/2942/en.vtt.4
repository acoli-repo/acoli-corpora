determined by ethnic origin,

00:02:01.217 --> 00:02:04.552
but most visibly and often most violently,

00:02:04.576 --> 00:02:05.885
class.

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:09.093
Before Nigeria became a country,

00:02:09.117 --> 00:02:13.028
fisherpeople from the inland creeks
started to come down the Lagos lagoon

00:02:13.052 --> 00:02:15.426
and establish villages along the coast.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.454
About 60 years later, my grandfather,
Oludotun Adekunle Kukoyi,

00:02:20.478 --> 00:02:22.000
also arrived in Lagos.

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:26.083
Like me, he was an alumnus
of the University of Ibadan,

00:02:26.107 --> 00:02:29.642
a young member of the educated elite
in the independence era.
