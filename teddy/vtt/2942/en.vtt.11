00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.365
because the first thing we are taught
to forget about poor people

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:31.812
is that they are people.

00:05:32.592 --> 00:05:35.975
We believe that a home is a thing
a person absolutely has a right to,

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:38.973
unless the person is poor
and the home is built a certain way

00:05:38.997 --> 00:05:40.346
in a certain neighborhood.

00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:44.329
But there is no single definition
of the word "home."

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.691
After all, what is a slum
besides an organic response

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:51.801
to acute housing deficits
and income inequality?

00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:55.994
And what is a shanty if not a person
making a home for themselves

00:05:56.018 --> 00:05:57.584
against all odds?

00:05:59.195 --> 00:06:01.707
Slums are an imperfect housing solution,
