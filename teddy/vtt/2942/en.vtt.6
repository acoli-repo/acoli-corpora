Many Lagosians, including
the descendants of those fisherpeople

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:06.485
who arrived generations
before my grandfather,

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:08.223
are now being pushed out

00:03:08.247 --> 00:03:09.950
to make room for an emergent city

00:03:09.974 --> 00:03:12.569
that has been described
as "the new Dubai."

00:03:13.501 --> 00:03:17.607
You see, Lagos inspires big dreams,
even in its leaders,

00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:20.315
and successive governments
have declared aspirations

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:23.142
towards a megacity
where poverty does not exist.

00:03:24.213 --> 00:03:27.766
Unfortunately, instead of focusing
on the eradication of poverty

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.293
as you would expect,

00:03:29.317 --> 00:03:32.850
the strategy of choice focuses
on eliminating the poor.
