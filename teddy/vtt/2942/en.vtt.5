Over time, he built an illustrious career
as a land surveyor,

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.945
mapping out now-bustling neighborhoods

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.211
when they were just waist-high wild grass.

00:02:39.353 --> 00:02:40.759
He died when I was nine.

00:02:40.783 --> 00:02:44.570
And by that time, my family,
like the families of those fisherpeople,

00:02:44.594 --> 00:02:46.140
knew Lagos as home.

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:50.364
Among the Yoruba, we have a saying,

00:02:50.388 --> 00:02:52.858
"Èkó gb’olè, ó gb’ọ̀lẹ,"

00:02:52.882 --> 00:02:56.597
which can be translated to mean
that Lagos will welcome anyone.

00:02:57.517 --> 00:02:59.956
But that saying is becoming
less and less true.
