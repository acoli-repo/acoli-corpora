00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:30.023
but our rights don't.

00:08:32.121 --> 00:08:33.794
The Lagos state government,

00:08:33.818 --> 00:08:35.741
like far too many on our continent,

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.438
pays lip service to ideas of inclusion,

00:08:38.462 --> 00:08:41.509
while acting as though
progress can only be achieved

00:08:41.533 --> 00:08:44.965
by the erasure, exploitation
and even elimination of groups

00:08:44.989 --> 00:08:46.748
it considers expendable.

00:08:47.898 --> 00:08:51.375
People living with disabilities
who hawk or beg on Lagos streets

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:53.594
are rounded up, extorted

00:08:53.618 --> 00:08:54.831
and detained.

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:57.573
Women in low-income
neighborhoods are picked up

00:08:57.597 --> 00:08:59.092
and charged with prostitution,

00:08:59.116 --> 00:09:02.000
regardless of what they actually
do for a living.
