When our governments
frame slums as threats

00:08:00.032 --> 00:08:02.922
in order to justify violent land grabs
or forced evictions,

00:08:02.946 --> 00:08:05.911
they're counting on those of us
who live in formal housing

00:08:05.935 --> 00:08:09.733
to tacitly and ignorantly agree with them.

00:08:10.635 --> 00:08:12.653
Rather, we must remind them

00:08:12.677 --> 00:08:15.298
that governments exist to serve
not only those who build

00:08:15.322 --> 00:08:16.825
and live in luxury homes,

00:08:16.849 --> 00:08:19.226
but also those who clean and guard them.

00:08:20.223 --> 00:08:21.382
Our --

00:08:21.406 --> 00:08:24.768
(Applause)

00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:28.017
our realities may differ,

00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:30.023
but our rights don't.
