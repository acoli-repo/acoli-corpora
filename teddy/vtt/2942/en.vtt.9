00:04:27.632 --> 00:04:31.141
Standing outside her shelter,
I saw the two white-sand football fields

00:04:31.165 --> 00:04:32.655
where Basil used to play.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.289
Spread all around us were the ruins
of schools, churches,

00:04:37.313 --> 00:04:39.433
a primary health center, shops,

00:04:39.457 --> 00:04:40.999
thousands of homes.

00:04:41.892 --> 00:04:45.381
Young children enthusiastically helped
to put up shelters,

00:04:45.405 --> 00:04:48.460
and about 5,000 of the residents,
with nowhere else to go,

00:04:48.484 --> 00:04:49.907
simply stayed put.

00:04:50.838 --> 00:04:52.256
And then in April,

00:04:52.953 --> 00:04:55.066
state security personnel came back.

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.710
This time, they cleared
the community out completely,

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:02.555
with beatings, bullets and fire.
