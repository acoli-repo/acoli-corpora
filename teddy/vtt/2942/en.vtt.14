In Lagos, where public goods
are rarely publicly available,

00:07:02.242 --> 00:07:05.844
slum dwellers are often at the forefront
of innovating solutions.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.102
After being disconnected
from the grid for months

00:07:09.126 --> 00:07:12.391
because the power company
couldn't figure out how to collect bills,

00:07:12.415 --> 00:07:15.876
one settlement designed a system
that collectivized remittances

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.529
and got everyone cheaper rates
into the bargain.

00:07:19.668 --> 00:07:21.814
Another settlement created
a reform program

00:07:21.838 --> 00:07:24.592
that hires local bad boys as security.

00:07:24.616 --> 00:07:26.742
They know every trick and every hideout,

00:07:26.766 --> 00:07:30.196
so now troublemakers are more likely
to get caught and reported to police
