Slums are an imperfect housing solution,

00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:05.424
but they are also prime examples
of the innovation, adaptability

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:08.174
and resilience at the foundation --

00:06:08.198 --> 00:06:09.585

00:06:09.609 --> 00:06:11.274
of every functional city.

00:06:12.483 --> 00:06:14.834
You don't need to be the new Dubai

00:06:14.858 --> 00:06:16.428
when you're already Lagos.

00:06:17.549 --> 00:06:23.538

00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:28.721
our own rhythm,

00:06:28.745 --> 00:06:31.040
and as anyone who knows
