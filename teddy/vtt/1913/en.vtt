Jambo, bonjour, zdravstvujtye, dayo: these are a few of the languages

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that I've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
as I've been to 17 countries I think I'm up to, on this crazy tour I've been doing,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
checking out various aspects of the project that we're doing.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And visiting some pretty incredible places,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
places like Mongolia, Cambodia, New Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania twice --
