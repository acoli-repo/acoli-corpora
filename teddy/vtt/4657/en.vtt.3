00:01:27.388 --> 00:01:32.175
Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormones 
course through the bloodstream,

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.592
increasing heart rate and blood pressure,

00:01:34.592 --> 00:01:37.676
and jolting the body into hyperarousal.

00:01:37.676 --> 00:01:41.163
In this condition, the brain is hunting 
for potential threats,

00:01:41.163 --> 00:01:46.539
making it impossible to ignore
any slight discomfort or nighttime noise.

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.362
And when insomniacs 
finally do fall asleep,

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:52.228
the quality of their rest is compromised.

00:01:52.228 --> 00:01:55.861
Our brain’s primary source of energy 
is cerebral glucose,

00:01:55.861 --> 00:02:01.779
and in healthy sleep, our metabolism slows
to conserve this glucose for waking hours.
