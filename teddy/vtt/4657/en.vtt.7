This clock, or circadian rhythm,

00:03:31.572 --> 00:03:33.290
is also sensitive to light,

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.427
so avoid bright lights at night

00:03:35.427 --> 00:03:38.313

In addition to these practices,

00:03:39.997 --> 00:03:42.755
some doctors prescribe medication

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:46.621

that help in all cases.

can be highly addictive,

00:03:49.838 --> 00:03:52.467

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.239
make sure your sleeplessness 
is actually due to insomnia.

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.328
Approximately 8% of patients diagnosed 
with chronic insomnia
