00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.328
Approximately 8% of patients diagnosed 
with chronic insomnia

00:04:02.328 --> 00:04:05.719
are actually suffering from a less common
genetic problem

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:10.485
called delayed sleep phase disorder,
or DSPD.

00:04:10.485 --> 00:04:15.453
People with DSPD have a circadian rhythm 
significantly longer than 24 hours,

00:04:15.453 --> 00:04:19.732
putting their sleeping habits out 
of sync with traditional sleeping hours.

00:04:19.732 --> 00:04:22.954
So while they have difficulty 
falling asleep at a typical bedtime,

00:04:22.954 --> 00:04:25.371
it’s not due to increased stress.

00:04:25.371 --> 00:04:26.823
And given the opportunity,

00:04:26.823 --> 00:04:30.475
they can sleep comfortably 
on their own delayed schedule.
