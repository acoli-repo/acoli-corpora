00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:31.255
When these cycles of stress 
and restlessness last several months,

00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:34.082
they’re diagnosed as chronic insomnia.

00:02:34.082 --> 00:02:36.737
And while insomnia rarely leads to death,

00:02:36.737 --> 00:02:40.450
its chemical mechanisms are similar 
to anxiety attacks

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.306
found in those experiencing depression
and anxiety.

00:02:43.306 --> 00:02:46.063
So suffering from 
any one of these conditions

00:02:46.063 --> 00:02:49.715
increases your risk of
experiencing the other two.

00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:53.671
Fortunately, there are ways to break 
the cycle of sleeplessness.

00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:56.224
Managing the stress that leads 
to hyperarousal

00:02:56.224 --> 00:02:59.647
is one of our best-understood treatments 
for insomnia,

00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:04.036
and good sleep practices can help rebuild 
your relationship with bedtime.
