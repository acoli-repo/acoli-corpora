00:01:55.861 --> 00:02:01.779
and in healthy sleep, our metabolism slows
to conserve this glucose for waking hours.

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:06.173
But PET studies show the adrenaline 
that prevents sleep for insomniacs

00:02:06.173 --> 00:02:09.316
also speeds up their metabolisms.

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:12.481
While they sleep, their bodies 
are working overtime,

00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:16.063
burning through the brain’s supply 
of energy-giving glucose.

00:02:16.063 --> 00:02:19.320
This symptom of poor sleep leaves 
insomniacs

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.079
waking in a state of exhaustion,
confusion, and stress,

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.008
which starts the
process all over again.

00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:31.255
When these cycles of stress 
and restlessness last several months,
