that have never been charted, the genomic sequences of which we don't know.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Their fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
but we are ripe for zoonotic-borne, emerging communicable diseases.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Increasingly, I would say explosive growth of technology.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth. But it has a dark side

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
-- in bioweapons, and in technology that puts us on a collision course

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.000
to magnify any anger, hatred or feeling of marginalization.
