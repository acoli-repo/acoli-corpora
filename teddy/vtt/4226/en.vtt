00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm going to try to give you a view of the world as I see it,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the problems and the opportunities that we face,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And then I'll let you in on a secret, which is why I am an incurable optimist.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let me start off showing you an Al Gore movie that you may have seen before.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now, you've all seen "Inconvenient Truth." This is a little more inconvenient.
