00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
That's why they migrate to cities.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
That's why in June of this year, we passed, as a species, 51 percent of us living in cities,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and bustees, and slums, and shantytowns.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
The rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
The green revolution never reached Africa.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And with desertification, sandstorms, the Gobi Desert, the Ogaden,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
we are finding increasing difficulty of a hectare

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
to produce as many calories as it did even 15 years ago.
