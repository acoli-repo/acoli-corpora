00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:30.000
the dotted line shows that even if emissions of greenhouse gasses stopped today,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
the next decades will see rising sea levels.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000
A minimum of 20 to 30 inches of increase in sea levels is the best case

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
that we can hope for, and it could be 10 times that.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
What will that do to Bangladesh? Let's take a look.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So here's Bangladesh.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000
70 percent of Bangladesh is at less than five feet above sea level.
