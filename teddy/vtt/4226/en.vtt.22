Global warming is something that happens to all of us, all at once.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
As are these newly emerging communicable diseases,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
names that you hadn't heard 20 years ago: ebola, lhasa fever, monkey pox.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
With the erosion of the green belt separating animals from humans,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
we live in each other's viral environment.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Do you remember, 20 years ago, no one had ever heard of West Nile fever?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And then we watched, as one case arrived on the East Coast of the United States

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and it marched every year, westwardly.
