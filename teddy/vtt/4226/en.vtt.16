00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:04.000
As we look at these trends, do we become despondent, or will we become energized?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Let's look at one case, the case of Bangladesh.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
First, even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
global warming would continue.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And even with global warming -- if you can see these blue lines,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:30.000
the dotted line shows that even if emissions of greenhouse gasses stopped today,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
the next decades will see rising sea levels.
