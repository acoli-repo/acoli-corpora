00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:36.608
I experienced all the negative
effects of poverty,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.979
from homelessness,

00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:40.772
eating out of trash piles,

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:42.689
you name it.

00:00:44.603 --> 00:00:46.077
But my life changed

00:00:47.038 --> 00:00:50.851
when I got accepted into an orphanage.

00:00:51.808 --> 00:00:54.155
Through one of those
sponsor-an-orphan programs,

00:00:54.924 --> 00:00:58.631
I was sponsored and given an opportunity
to acquire an education.

00:00:59.963 --> 00:01:02.073
I started off in Uganda.
