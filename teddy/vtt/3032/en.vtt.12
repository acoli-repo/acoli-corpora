00:06:07.274 --> 00:06:09.904
I went on to acquire
two engineering degrees

00:06:09.928 --> 00:06:12.398
from one of the best
institutions in the world.

00:06:13.173 --> 00:06:14.438
I've got to tell you:

00:06:14.462 --> 00:06:16.279
talent is universal,

to the individuals
who embrace multiculturalism,

00:06:26.747 --> 00:06:28.556
love, empathy

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.535
and compassion for others.
