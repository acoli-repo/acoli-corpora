00:01:57.054 --> 00:02:00.418
I walked out of the embassy
with this piece of paper in my hand,

00:02:00.442 --> 00:02:02.157
a hop in my step,

00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:03.882
smile on my face,

00:02:03.906 --> 00:02:07.293
knowing that my life is about to change.

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:10.465
I went home that night,

00:02:11.168 --> 00:02:12.982
and I slept with my passport,

00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:15.313
because I was afraid
that someone might steal it.

00:02:15.337 --> 00:02:17.192
(Laughter)

00:02:17.216 --> 00:02:18.636
I couldn't fall asleep.

00:02:19.446 --> 00:02:20.764
I kept feeling it.

00:02:21.896 --> 00:02:23.725
I had a good idea for security.

00:02:24.324 --> 00:02:26.893
I was like, "OK, I'm going
to put it in a plastic bag,

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:30.424
and take it outside and dig a hole,
and put it in there."
