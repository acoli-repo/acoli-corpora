00:07:58.833 --> 00:08:01.768
The second thing we did
to help our kids manage their emotions

00:08:01.792 --> 00:08:03.476
was we used leverage.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.434
As a not-so-funded public school,

00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:08.018
we didn't have the support staff

00:08:08.042 --> 00:08:11.226
to address the chaos that our kids
might be facing at home,

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.143
and we certainly weren't trained
or funded to address it directly.

00:08:15.167 --> 00:08:17.643
So we started to reach out
to local groups,

00:08:17.667 --> 00:08:18.976
community agencies,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.292
and even the Ohio State University.

00:08:22.333 --> 00:08:24.518
Our partnership
with the Ohio State University

00:08:24.542 --> 00:08:26.184
afforded us college students

00:08:26.208 --> 00:08:28.101
not only studying education

00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:31.518
but also school psychology
and school social work.
