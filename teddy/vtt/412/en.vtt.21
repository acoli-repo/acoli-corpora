00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:30.184
created real barbed-wire
barriers to learning,

00:10:30.208 --> 00:10:32.250
and we had to figure out a way over it.

00:10:33.042 --> 00:10:36.601
So our teachers continued
to practice with lesson plans,

00:10:36.625 --> 00:10:39.351
doing shorter lesson plans
with a single focus,

00:10:39.375 --> 00:10:41.226
allowing kids to engage,

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.351
and continued to incorporate
these movement breaks,

00:10:44.375 --> 00:10:49.393
allowing kids to jump up and down in class
and dance for two minutes straight,

00:10:49.417 --> 00:10:54.559
because we learned that taking breaks
helps the learner retain new information.

00:10:54.583 --> 00:10:58.768
And might I add that the "Cha-Cha Slide"
provides a perfect short dance party.

00:10:58.792 --> 00:11:00.559
