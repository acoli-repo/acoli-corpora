00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.917
I know this because
I was the principal at this school.

00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:05.976
And what I quickly and collectively
learned with my staff

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.059
was that this situation was more extreme

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:12.792
than anything we had ever
been trained for.

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:15.768
Every time that D lashed out,

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:17.976
I kept thinking to myself:

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.083
what did I miss during
my principal prep coursework?

00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:25.000
What am I supposed to do
with a kid like D?

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.518
And how am I going to stop him
from impeding the learning

00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:31.125
of all the other students?
