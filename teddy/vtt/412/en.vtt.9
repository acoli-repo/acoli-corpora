00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:30.976
in our time-out room,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.184
which we had equipped with rocking chairs
and soft cushions and books,

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:38.226
and we allowed D to go
to this place in the morning,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.934
away from the other kids,

00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:44.434
allowing him time to transition
back into the school environment

00:04:44.458 --> 00:04:46.476
on his own terms.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.143
And as we began to learn more about D,

00:04:49.167 --> 00:04:52.226
we learned other strategies
that helped him calm down.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.184
For example, D loved to help
younger students,

00:04:55.208 --> 00:04:58.559
so we made him a kindergarten helper,

00:04:58.583 --> 00:05:00.809
and he went into
the kindergarten classroom
