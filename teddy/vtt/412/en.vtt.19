But by us taking the emotional development
of our kids seriously,

00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:36.018
we moved from a philosophy of exclusion --

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:37.684
you disrupt, get out --

00:09:37.708 --> 00:09:40.143
to one of trust and respect.

00:09:40.167 --> 00:09:41.559
It wasn't easy,

00:09:41.583 --> 00:09:42.934
but we felt at heart,

00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.768
it was a positive way to make change,

00:09:45.792 --> 00:09:48.583
and I'm in awe at the teachers
that took that leap with me.

00:09:49.458 --> 00:09:52.476
As part of our personal
professional development plan,

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.476
we studied the research of Dr. Bruce Perry

00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:00.351
and his research on the effects
of different childhood experiences
