(Laughter)

00:11:00.583 --> 00:11:03.226
I saw teachers say,
"What happened to you?"

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.976
instead of "What's wrong with you?"

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.958
or "How can I help you?"
instead of "Get out."

00:11:08.625 --> 00:11:13.893
And this investment in our kids
made huge differences,

00:11:13.917 --> 00:11:17.542
and we continue to see rises
in our academic scores.

00:11:18.917 --> 00:11:21.351

got to fourth grade,

00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:22.934
he rarely got into trouble.

00:11:22.958 --> 00:11:25.226
He became a leader in the school,

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.059
and this behavior became contagious
with other students.

00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:33.059
We saw and felt our school climate
continue to improve,
