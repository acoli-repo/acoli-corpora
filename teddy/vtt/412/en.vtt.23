00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:33.059
We saw and felt our school climate
continue to improve,

00:11:33.083 --> 00:11:37.184
making it a happy and safe place
not only for children

00:11:37.208 --> 00:11:38.518
but for adults,

00:11:38.542 --> 00:11:40.792
despite any outside influence.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.226
Fast-forward to today,

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.351
I now work with an alternative
education program

00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:47.726
with high school students

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.583
who struggle to function
in traditional high school setting.

00:11:51.542 --> 00:11:54.351
I recently reviewed
some of their histories.

00:11:54.375 --> 00:11:57.476
Many of them are 17 to 18 years old,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.184
experimenting with drugs,

00:11:59.208 --> 00:12:01.601
in and out of the juvenile
detention system
