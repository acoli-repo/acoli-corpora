00:06:59.583 --> 00:07:00.958
all kids do better.

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:04.476
And here's the magical thing:

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.083
it didn't cost us
a whole lot of extra money.

00:07:07.792 --> 00:07:10.792
We simply thought differently
about what we had.

00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:16.500
For example, every public school
has an instructional supply line.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.684
An instructional supply could be a book,

00:07:19.708 --> 00:07:21.059
it could be a whiteboard,

00:07:21.083 --> 00:07:22.851
it could be flexible seating,

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:24.393
it could be a fidget spinner,

00:07:24.417 --> 00:07:28.726
it could even be painting the walls
of a school a more calming color,

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.333
allowing students to thrive.
