I was wanting to dig a little bit deeper
to figure out how he had become so angry.

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:38.934
And what I learned was
his father had left the home

00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.851
and his mother was working long shifts
in order to support the family,

00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:45.976
which left no adult
for D to connect with --

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.726
and he was in charge of taking care
of his younger brother

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.809
when he got home from school.

00:03:50.833 --> 00:03:55.417
Might I remind you
that D was six years old?

00:03:56.417 --> 00:03:58.809
Can't say that I blame him
for having some trouble

00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:00.893
transitioning into the school environment.
