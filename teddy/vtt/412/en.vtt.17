but also school psychology
and school social work.

00:08:31.542 --> 00:08:34.143
These students were paired
with our teachers

00:08:34.167 --> 00:08:36.393
to help our most struggling students.

00:08:36.417 --> 00:08:38.143
And everyone benefitted

00:08:38.167 --> 00:08:42.268
because our teachers got access
to the latest college-level thinking,

00:08:42.292 --> 00:08:45.934
and those college students
got real-world, life experiences

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.208
in the classroom.

00:08:48.333 --> 00:08:51.601
Our partnership with our local
Nationwide Children's Hospital

00:08:51.625 --> 00:08:55.226
afforded us -- they're building us
a health clinic within our school,

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.333
providing health and mental health
resources for our students.

00:08:59.625 --> 00:09:02.351
And our kids benefitted from this, too.
