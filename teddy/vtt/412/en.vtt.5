00:02:28.417 --> 00:02:31.250
all the way up to a C
in just a matter of a few years.

00:02:32.083 --> 00:02:34.476
So it might sound obvious, right?

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.726
Of course teachers should be focused
on the emotional well-being of their kids.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.393
But in reality,

00:02:41.417 --> 00:02:43.851
when you're in a classroom
full of 30 students

00:02:43.875 --> 00:02:46.184
and one of them's throwing tables at you,

00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:48.434
it's far easier to exclude that child

00:02:48.458 --> 00:02:50.982
than to figure out what's going on
inside of his head.

00:02:52.167 --> 00:02:53.809
But what we learned about D,

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:55.434
and for kids like D,

00:02:55.458 --> 00:02:59.726
was that small changes
can make huge differences,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.542
and it's possible to start right now.
