00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.059
throw desks and chairs,

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:31.601
yell at teachers,

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:33.351
stand in windowsills,

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:35.393
run in and out of the classroom

00:00:35.417 --> 00:00:37.583
and even running out of the school.

00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:45.434
Sometimes these fits of anger would put
the entire school into lockdown mode

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:48.351
until D could get himself back together,

00:00:48.375 --> 00:00:51.667
which could sometimes take over an hour.

00:00:53.042 --> 00:00:56.083
No one in the school knew how to help D.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.917
I know this because
I was the principal at this school.
