00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:02.893
And though we didn't come up
with a fail-safe solution,

00:02:02.917 --> 00:02:04.792
we did come up with a simple idea:

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:09.518
that in order for kids like D
to not only survive in school

00:02:09.542 --> 00:02:11.268
but to thrive,

00:02:11.292 --> 00:02:13.643
we somehow had to figure out a way

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:15.976
to not only teach them
how to read and write

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.125
but also how to help them deal with
and manage their own emotions.

00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:24.059
And in doing that,
we were able to move our school

00:02:24.083 --> 00:02:27.059
from one of the lowest-performing schools
in the state of Ohio,

00:02:27.083 --> 00:02:28.393
with an F rating,

00:02:28.417 --> 00:02:31.250
all the way up to a C
in just a matter of a few years.
