In her own words, she was practically
giving her services away.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.336
And so she began her journey

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.536
to take responsibility
for communicating value to clients

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.760
and changing her message.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.056
One thing I shared with her

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.136
is that it's so important

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.656
to find your own voice,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.736
a voice that's authentic and true to you.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.456
Don't try to channel your sister-in-law
just because she's a great salesperson

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.600
or your neighbor who tells a great joke
if that's not who you are.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.136
Give up this notion
that it's tooting your own horn.
