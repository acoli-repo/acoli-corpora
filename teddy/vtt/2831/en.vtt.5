00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.776
What are my clients' needs
and how do I meet them?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.640
What is my unique skill set that makes me
better qualified to serve my clients?

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.360
What do I do that no one else does?

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.816
What problems do I solve for clients?

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.280
What value do I add?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.656
I answered these questions

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.296
and defined the value that my clients
get from working with me,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.176
calculated their return on investment,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.880
and what I saw was
that I needed to double my price,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.176
double it.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.640
Now, I confess to you, this terrified me.
