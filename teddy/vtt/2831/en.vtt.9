WEBVTT

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.816
When she first started her firm
and for several years thereafter,

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.800
she would say, "I have
a little web design company."

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.376
She'd actually use
those words with clients.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.200
"I have a little web design company."

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.176
In this and in many other small ways,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.096
she was diminishing her company
in the eyes of prospects and clients,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.360
and diminishing herself.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.080
It was really impacting her ability
to earn what she was worth.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.976
I believe her language and her style

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.256
communicated that she didn't believe

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.614
she had much value to offer.
