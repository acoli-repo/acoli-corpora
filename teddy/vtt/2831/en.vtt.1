clearly defining and communicating
your value are essential

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.040
to being paid well for your excellence.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.400
Anyone here want to be paid well?

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.656
OK, good,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.160
then this talk is for everyone.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.976
It's got universal applicability.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.496
It's true if you're a business owner,
if you're an employee,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.976
if you're a job seeker.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.800
It's true if you're a man or a woman.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.136
Now, I approach this today through
the lens of the woman business owner,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.560
because in my work I've observed
that women underprice more so than men.
