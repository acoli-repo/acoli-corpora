00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.800
No one will ever pay you
what you're worth.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.216
No one will ever pay you

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.440
what you're worth.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.776
They'll only ever pay you

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.181
what they think you're worth.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.000
And you control their thinking,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.800
not like this,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.856
although that would be cool.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.496
(Laughter)

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.800
That would be really cool.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.640
Instead, like this:

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.136
clearly defining and communicating
your value are essential
