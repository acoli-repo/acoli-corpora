that my clients were realizing
in working with me,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.040
and I realized that I needed
to reevaluate my pricing.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.000
I was really underpriced
relative to the value I was delivering.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.840
It's hard for me to admit to you,
because I'm a pricing consultant.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.056
(Laughter)

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.296
It's what I do.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.120
I help companies price for value.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.776
But nonetheless, it's what I saw,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.680
and so I sat down to evaluate my pricing,
evaluate my value,

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.320
and I did that
by asking key value questions.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.776
What are my clients' needs
and how do I meet them?
