00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.920
And if you're sitting
in the audience today

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.016
and you're not being paid
what you're worth,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.080
I'd like to welcome you
into this equation.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.976
Just imagine what life could be like,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.856
how much more we could do,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.976
how much more we could give back,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.536
how much more we could
plan for the future,

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.760
how validated and respected we would feel

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.456
if we could earn our full potential,

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.800
realize our full value.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.760
No one will ever pay you
what you're worth.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.936
They'll only ever pay you
what they think you're worth,
