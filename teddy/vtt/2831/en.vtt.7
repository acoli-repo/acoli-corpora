00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.256
I'm a single mom.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.880
What if my business fails?

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.560
What if I fail?

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.120
But I know how to take my own medicine,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.576
the medicine that I
prescribe to my clients.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.296
I had done the homework.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.760
I knew the value was there.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.200
So when prospects came,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.376
I prepared the proposals
with the new higher pricing

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.696
and sent them out

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.006
and communicated the value.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.680
How's the story end?

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.816
Clients continued to hire me

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.200
and refer me and recommend me,
and I'm still here.
