00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and here's an example of one.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And I don't know if you can see it that well, but that's a mailbox --

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
so an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
So you figure out how to program this,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and you put this in your mailbox.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And when someone opens your mailbox,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
you get a notification,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
an alert message goes to your iPhone.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Now that could be a dog door,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
like a little brother into a little sister's room.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
There's all kinds of different things

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that you can imagine for that.
