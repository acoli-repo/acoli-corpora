00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well I'm going to show you a group of makers

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
from Maker Faire and various places.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It doesn't come out particularly well,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but that's a particularly tall bicycle.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's a scraper bike; it's called --

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
from Oakland.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And this is a particularly small scooter

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
for a gentleman of this size.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But he's trying to power it, or motorize it,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
with a drill.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
(Laughter)

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And the question he had is,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
"Can I do it? Can it be done?"

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Apparently it can.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So makers are enthusiasts; they're amateurs;
