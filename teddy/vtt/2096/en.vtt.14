This is Jeff and Bilal and several others here

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
in a hackerspace.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And there's about three hackerspaces or more in Detroit.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And there's probably even some new ones since I've been here last.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
But these are like clubs --

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
they're sharing tools, sharing space,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
sharing expertise in what to make.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And so it's a very interesting phenomenon

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
that's going across the world.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But essentially these are people that are playing with technology.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Let me say that again: playing.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
They don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
They're playing
