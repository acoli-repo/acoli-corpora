00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm going to have a pretty simple idea

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
that I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and that is all of us are makers.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I really believe that.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
All of us are makers.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We're born makers.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We have this ability

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to make things,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to grasp things with our hands.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We use words like "grasp" metaphorically

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to also think about understanding things.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We don't just live, but we make.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We create things.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well I'm going to show you a group of makers
