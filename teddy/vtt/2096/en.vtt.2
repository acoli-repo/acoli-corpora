00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Apparently it can.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So makers are enthusiasts; they're amateurs;

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
they're people who love

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
doing what they do.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
They don't always even know why they're doing it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We have begun organizing makers

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
at our Maker Faire.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
There was one held in Detroit here last summer,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and it will be held again next summer, at the Henry Ford.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But we hold them in San Francisco --

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
(Applause)

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
-- and in New York.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And it's a fabulous event

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to just meet and talk to these people who make things
