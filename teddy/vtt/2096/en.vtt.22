and be able to use things like micro-controllers

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and build robots.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And we've got to get this into schools,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
or into communities in many, many ways --

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
the ability to tinker,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
to shape and reshape the world around us.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
There's a great opportunity today --

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and that's what I really care about the most.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
An the answer to the question: what will America make?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
It's more makers.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Thank you very much.
