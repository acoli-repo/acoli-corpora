WEBVTT

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
we gather, we form, and we fashion.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Makers and shapers

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and put-it-togetherers.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
DD: So it goes on to show you

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
people making things out of wood,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
a grandfather making a ship in a bottle,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
a woman making a pie --

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
somewhat standard fare of the day.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
But it was a sense of pride

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
that we made things,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
that the world around us was made by us.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
It didn't just exist.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
We made it, and we were connected to it that way.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And I think that's tremendously important.
