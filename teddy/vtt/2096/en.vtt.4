00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
but it's -- a controller at top cycles the water to fall

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So imagine a kid: "Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
No, I didn't get wet. Am I going to get wet? Am I going to get wet?"

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
That's the experience of a clever ride.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And of course, we have fashion.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
People are remaking things into fashion.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I don't know if this is called a basket-bra,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
but it ought to be something like that.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We have art students getting together,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
taking old radiator parts

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and doing an iron-pour to make something new out of it.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
They did that in the summer, and it was very warm.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Now this one takes a little bit of explaining.
