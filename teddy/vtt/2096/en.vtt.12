This is Andrew Archer.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I met Andrew at one of our community meetings

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
putting together Maker Faire.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Andrew had moved to Detroit

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
from Duluth, Minnesota.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And I talked to his mom,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and I ended up doing a story on him

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
for a magazine called Kidrobot.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
He's just a kid that grew up

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
playing with tools instead of toys.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
He liked to take things apart.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
His mother gave him a part of the garage,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and he collected things from yard sales, and he made stuff.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And then he didn't particularly like school that much,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
but he got involved in robotics competitions,
