00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And again, think about it.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
You're makers of food; you're makers of shelter;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
you're makers of lots of different things,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and partly what interests me today

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
is you're makers of your own world,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and particularly the role that technology has

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
in your life.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
You're really a driver or a passenger --

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
to use a Volkswagen phrase.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Makers are in control.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
That's what fascinates them. That's why they do what they do.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
They want to figure out how things work;

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
they want to get access to it;

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and they want to control it.
