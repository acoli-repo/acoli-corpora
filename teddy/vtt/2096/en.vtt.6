00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Choir: ♫ I'm hooked on a feelin' ♫

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
♫ I'm high on believin' ♫

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
♫ That you're in love with me ♫

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
DD: So Richard came up from Houston last year

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
to visit us in Detroit here

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So, are you a maker?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
How many people here would say you're a maker, if you raise your hand?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
That's a pretty good --

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
but there's some of you out there that won't admit that you're makers.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And again, think about it.
