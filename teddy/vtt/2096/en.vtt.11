00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
We made it, and we were connected to it that way.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And I think that's tremendously important.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Now I'm going to tell you one funny thing about this.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
This particular reel --

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
it's an industrial video --

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
but it was shown in drive-in theaters

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
in 1961 --

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
in the Detroit area, in fact --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho."

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
(Laughter)

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
So I like to think there was something going on there

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
of the new generation of makers

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
coming out of this, plus "Psycho."

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
This is Andrew Archer.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I met Andrew at one of our community meetings
