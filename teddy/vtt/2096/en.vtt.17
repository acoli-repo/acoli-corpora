00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that you can imagine for that.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Now here's something -- a 3D printer.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
That's another tool that's really taken off -- really, really interesting.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
This is Makerbot.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And there are industrial versions of this --

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
about 20,000 dollars.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
These guys came up with a kit version

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
for 750 dollars,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
can get a hold of this and begin playing with 3D printers.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Now they don't know what they want to do with it,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
but they're going to figure it out.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
They will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
One of the coolest things is, Makerbot sent out an upgrade,
