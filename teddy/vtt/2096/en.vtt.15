00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
They're playing

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
to discover what the technology can do,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and probably to discover what they can do themselves,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
what their own capabilities are.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Now the other thing that I think is taking off,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
another reason making is taking off today,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
is there's some great new tools out there.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And you can't see this very well on the screen,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
but Arduino -- Arduino is an open-source hardware platform.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
It's a micro-controller.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
If you don't know what those are, they're just the "brains."

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So they're the brains of maker projects,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and here's an example of one.
