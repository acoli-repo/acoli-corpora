00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Think how much money and how many years it took NASA

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
to get satellites into space.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
In fact, these guys actually work for NASA,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and they're trying to pioneer using off-the-shelf components,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
cheap things that aren't specialized

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
that they can combine

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and send up into space.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Makers are a source of innovation,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and I think it relates back to something

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
like the birth of the personal computer industry.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
This is Steve Wozniak. Where does he learn about computers?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
It's the Homebrew Computer Club -- just like a hackerspace.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And he says, "I could go there all day long

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and talk to people
