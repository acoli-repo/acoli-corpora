00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And he says, "I could go there all day long

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and talk to people

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and share ideas for free."

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Well he did a little bit better than free.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
But it's important to understand

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
that a lot of the origins of our industries --

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
even like Henry Ford --

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Well, if I haven't convinced you that you're a maker,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
I hope I could convince you

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
that our next generation should be makers,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
that kids are particularly interested in this,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
in this ability to control the physical world

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and be able to use things like micro-controllers
