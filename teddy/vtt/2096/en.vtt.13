And then he didn't particularly like school that much,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
but he got involved in robotics competitions,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and he realized he had a talent,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and, more importantly, he had a real passion for it.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And he began building robots.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And when I sat down next to him,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
he was telling me about a company he formed,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and he was building some robots for automobile factories

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
to move things around on the factory floor.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And that's why he moved to Michigan.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
But he also moved here

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
to meet other people doing what he's doing.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And this kind of gets to this important idea today.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
