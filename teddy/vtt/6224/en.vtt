Riitta Ikonen: Meet our friend Bob.

00:00:05.444 --> 00:00:07.728
We met on a wintery night

00:00:07.752 --> 00:00:12.973
in the company of the members
of the New York Indoor Gardening Society.

00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:17.157
And one of the regulars
was this charismatic gentleman

00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:20.066
studying the wonders
of carnivorous plants.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.251
We were there

00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:25.494
looking for collaborators
for an art project

00:00:25.518 --> 00:00:29.009
looking at modern humans'
belonging to nature.

00:00:29.772 --> 00:00:33.483
Karoline Hjorth: We couldn't resist
slipping a little note in Bob's pocket
