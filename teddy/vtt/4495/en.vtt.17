00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and I was met with a lot of encouragement.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
One of the lines of encouragement

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that I heard over and over was,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
"The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
who think you're going to come to this town and make movies."

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And then of course, there was the other adage.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
"The surest way to become a millionaire

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business."

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
(Laughter)

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Undeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productions

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
with the vision to be a global media company
