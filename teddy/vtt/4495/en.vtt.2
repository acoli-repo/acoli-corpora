00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Hollywood has its sex symbols, and the Valley has its sex symbols.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
(Laughter)

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Hollywood has its rivalries, and the Valley has its rivalries.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Hollywood gathers around power tables,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and the Valley gathers around power tables.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So it turned out there was a lot more in common

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
than I would have dreamed.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
But I'm actually here today to tell a story.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
he said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and they want to know what drives you a bit.
