00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And while I was there, I made friends with a fellow

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
named Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologize

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
for this. This is a photo from the old days.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And just after I'd graduated, Pierre came to me

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
with this idea to help people

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
buy and sell things online with each other.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And with the wisdom of my Stanford degree,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I said, "Pierre, what a stupid idea."

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
(Laughter)

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And needless to say, I was right.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
(Laughter)

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
But right after that, Pierre -- in '96, Pierre and I left our full-time jobs

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
to build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know.
