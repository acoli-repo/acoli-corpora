00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And it's also something that resides in each of us,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
to close what I think

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
are the two big calamities in the world today.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
One is the gap in opportunity --

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
this gap that President Clinton last night

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
called uneven, unfair and unsustainable --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and disease

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and all these evils that we see around us.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
But perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And someone, at some point, came up with this very bad idea

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world.
