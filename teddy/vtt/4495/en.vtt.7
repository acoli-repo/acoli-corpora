I didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
so I could write these stories as quickly as I could.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And my dad came home one day

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and announced that he had cancer, and it looked pretty bad.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And what he said was, he wasn't so much afraid that he might die,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And knock on wood, he's still alive today, many years later.
