00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
which is really a scourge in the developing world.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And so this is one way to bet

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
on good people doing good things.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
that I find really is powerful.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
It's what we call, "Invest, connect and celebrate."

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And invest: if you see good people doing good things,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
invest in them. Invest in their organizations,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
or in business. Invest in these folks.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Connecting them together through conferences --

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
like a TED -- brings so many powerful connections,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship
