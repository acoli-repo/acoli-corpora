00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
take the blessing of these resources and share it with the world.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And around that time, I met John Gardner,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
who is a remarkable man.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
He was the architect of the Great Society programs

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
under Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
or anyone could do, to make a difference

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
in the long-term issues facing humanity.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And John said, "Bet on good people doing good things.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Bet on good people doing good things."

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And that really resonated with me.
