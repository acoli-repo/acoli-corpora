00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
that my foundation does at Oxford every year.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And celebrate them: tell their stories,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
because not only are there good people doing good work,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
but their stories can help close these gaps of hope.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And it was this last part of the mission, the celebrate part,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that really got me back to thinking when I was a kid

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and wanted to tell stories to get people involved

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
in the issues that affect us all.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And a light bulb went off,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
which was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers.
