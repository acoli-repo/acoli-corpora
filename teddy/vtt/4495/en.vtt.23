00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
with Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and Davis Guggenheim,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
who was running documentaries for Participant at the time.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
because we felt that we could get the message out there

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
far more quickly than having Al go around the world,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And you know, there's another adage in Hollywood,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
that nobody knows nothing about anything.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And I really thought this was going to be

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
a straight-to-PBS charitable initiative.
