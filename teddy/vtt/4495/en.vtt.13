Folks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
because she felt girls' education was lagging.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And she started it about 10 years ago,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and today, she educates over a quarter million African girls.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
who started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
also known as black fever.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
which is really a scourge in the developing world.
