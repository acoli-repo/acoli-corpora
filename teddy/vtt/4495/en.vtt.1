00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And finally, I get a call last year,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
(Laughter)

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You've got a cruel sense of humor, TED.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
(Laughter)

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
When I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I had some misgivings.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
(Laughter)

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And, in fact, some advantages to owning your own media company.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.
