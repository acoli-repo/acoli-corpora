00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And knock on wood, he's still alive today, many years later.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But for a young man that made a real impression on me,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
that one never knows how much time one really has.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I started a couple of businesses

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
that I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
One of those businesses was a computer rental business

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
called Micros on the Move,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
which is very well named,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
because people kept stealing the computers.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
(Laughter)

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there.
