00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Undeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productions

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
with the vision to be a global media company

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
focused on the public interest.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And our mission is to produce entertainment

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
that creates and inspires social change.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And we don't just want people to see our movies

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and say, that was fun, and forget about it.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
We want them to actually get involved in the issues.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
In 2005, we launched our first slate of films,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
"Murder Ball," "North Country," "Syriana"

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and "Good Night and Good Luck."

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And much to my surprise, they were noticed.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films.
