00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
(Laughter)

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And for Participant, this is just the start.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And we have 10 films in production right now,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
and dozens others in development.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I'll quickly talk about a few coming up.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
One is "Charlie Wilson's War," with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, and

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
how he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And we're also doing a movie called "The Kite Runner,"

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
based on the book "The Kite Runner," also about Afghanistan.
