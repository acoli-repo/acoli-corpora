00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And I think that's just a horrible thing.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And so chapter one really begins today, with all of us,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
because within each of us is the power to

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And if the men and women of TED

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
can't make a difference in the world, I don't know who can.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And for me, a lot of this started when I was younger

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and my family used to go camping in upstate New York.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And there really wasn't much to do there for the summer,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
except get beaten up by my sister or read books.
