00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I've actually been waiting by the phone

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
for a call from TED for years.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And in fact, in 2000, I was ready to talk about eBay, but no call.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In 2003, I was ready to do a talk

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
In 2004, I started Participant Productions

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and we had a really good first year, and no call.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And finally, I get a call last year,
