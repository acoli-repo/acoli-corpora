like the National Organization of Women,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
the film was widely credited

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
with influencing the successful renewal of the act.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And that to me, spoke volumes, because it's --

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
the film started about a true-life story

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
about a woman who was harassed, sued her employer,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and the Violence Against Women Act and others.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And then the movie about this person doing these things,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
then led to this greater renewal.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And so again,
