Because one thing we hear a lot

00:07:01.438 --> 00:07:04.865
working to find their way
into leadership positions.

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:07.721
But what you're talking
about is even bigger than that.

00:07:07.745 --> 00:07:09.974
It's inclusive leadership.

00:07:09.998 --> 00:07:13.588

00:07:15.757 --> 00:07:20.309

But the Billie Jean King
Leadership Initiative

00:07:26.435 --> 00:07:29.499
is really about the workforce mostly,
and trying to change it,

00:07:29.523 --> 00:07:33.868
so people can actually go to work
and be their authentic selves.
