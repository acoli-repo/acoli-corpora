00:03:31.675 --> 00:03:33.029
and now I have a daughter.

00:03:35.193 --> 00:03:37.990
And I am so happy I saw that
as a young man."

00:03:38.588 --> 00:03:42.137
And one of those young men,
at 12 years old, was President Obama.

00:03:42.934 --> 00:03:45.654

00:03:45.678 --> 00:03:48.636

but I saw that match at 12.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.513
And now I have two daughters,

and it has made a difference
in how I raise them."
