00:07:57.032 --> 00:08:01.075
Or this poor man who kept his diploma --

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:02.815
he went to University of Michigan,

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:06.160
but he never would talk about
his poverty as a youngster, ever --

00:08:06.184 --> 00:08:07.503
just would not mention it.

00:08:07.527 --> 00:08:09.776
So he made sure they saw
he was well-educated.

00:08:10.338 --> 00:08:12.782
And then you see a gay guy
who has an NFL --

00:08:12.806 --> 00:08:15.447
which means American football
for all of you out there,

00:08:15.471 --> 00:08:17.422
it's a big deal, it's very macho --

00:08:17.447 --> 00:08:19.469
and he talked about football all the time,

00:08:19.493 --> 00:08:23.073
because he was gay
and he didn't want anybody to know.

00:08:23.097 --> 00:08:24.874
It just goes on and on.

00:08:24.898 --> 00:08:31.011
So my wish for everyone is to be able
to be their authentic self 24/7,
