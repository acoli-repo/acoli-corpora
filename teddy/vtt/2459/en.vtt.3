00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:32.918
So there were nine of us that signed
that one-dollar contract.

00:01:32.942 --> 00:01:37.911
And our dream was for any girl,
born any place in the world --

00:01:37.935 --> 00:01:39.493
if she was good enough --

00:01:39.517 --> 00:01:43.628
there would be a place for her to compete
and for us to make a living.

00:01:43.652 --> 00:01:47.412
Because before 1968,
we made 14 dollars a day,

00:01:47.436 --> 00:01:49.888
and we were under the control
of organizations.

00:01:49.912 --> 00:01:52.105
So we really wanted
to break away from that.

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:54.845
But we knew it wasn't really
about our generation so much;

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.919
we knew it was about
the future generations.

00:01:56.943 --> 00:02:00.948
We do stand on the shoulders of the people
that came before us, there is no question.
