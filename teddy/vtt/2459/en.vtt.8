00:03:58.276 --> 00:04:01.431
PM: And now there are generations --
at least one or two --

00:04:01.455 --> 00:04:04.155
who have experienced the equality

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:09.065
that Title IX and other fights
along the way made possible.

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:13.680
And for women, there are generations
who have also experienced teamwork.

00:04:13.704 --> 00:04:17.754
They got to play team sports
in a way they hadn't before.

00:04:18.146 --> 00:04:23.227
So you had a legacy already built
in terms of being an athlete,

00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:28.506
a legacy of the work you did
to lobby for equal pay for women athletes

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.804
and the Women's Sports Foundation.
