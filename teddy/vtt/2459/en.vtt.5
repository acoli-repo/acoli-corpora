(Applause)

00:02:30.274 --> 00:02:32.032
So you can have a law,

00:02:32.056 --> 00:02:34.971
but it's changing the hearts and minds
to match up with it.

00:02:34.995 --> 00:02:37.542
That's when it really rocks, totally.

00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:38.717
So that was on my mind.

00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:42.330
I wanted to start that change
in the hearts and minds.

00:02:42.354 --> 00:02:45.146
But two things came out of that match.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.326
For women: self-confidence, empowerment.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.892
They actually had enough nerve
to ask for a raise.

00:02:51.675 --> 00:02:55.516
Some women have waited
10, 15 years to ask.

00:02:55.838 --> 00:02:57.839
I said, "More importantly,
did you get it?"

00:02:57.863 --> 00:02:58.931
(Laughter)

00:02:58.955 --> 00:03:00.129
And they did!
