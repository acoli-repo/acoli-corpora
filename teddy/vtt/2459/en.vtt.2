00:00:56.962 --> 00:01:00.324
And I was really nervous
whenever we announced it,

00:01:00.348 --> 00:01:03.217
and I felt like the whole world
was on my shoulders.

00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:08.902
And I thought, "If I lose, it's going
to put women back 50 years, at least."

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:12.823
Title IX had just been passed
the year before -- June 23, 1972.

00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:16.466
And women's professional tennis --

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.763
there were nine of us who signed
a one-dollar contract in 1970 --

00:01:19.787 --> 00:01:21.886
now remember, the match is in '73.

00:01:22.454 --> 00:01:25.614
So we were only in our
third year of having a tour

00:01:25.638 --> 00:01:29.898
where we could actually play,
have a place to compete and make a living.

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:32.918
So there were nine of us that signed
that one-dollar contract.
