I sure wanted it, but making it
is a whole other discussion.

00:06:01.246 --> 00:06:05.449
I just remember I promised myself,
and I really try to keep my word.

00:06:06.174 --> 00:06:09.976
That's who I truly am,
just fighting for people.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.210
And, unfortunately, women have had less.

00:06:15.031 --> 00:06:17.300
And we are considered less.

00:06:17.324 --> 00:06:19.592
And so my attentions,
where did they have to go?

00:06:19.616 --> 00:06:21.801
It was just ... you have to.

00:06:21.825 --> 00:06:25.056
And learn to stick up for yourself,
hear your own voice.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.417
You hear the same words
keep coming out all the time,

00:06:28.441 --> 00:06:32.158
and I got really lucky
because I had an education.
