I'm just telling you --
so I think it's good for us to share.

00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:33.587
(Laughter)

00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:35.094
No, it is good for us to share,

00:12:35.118 --> 00:12:38.187
because we're our authentic selves
and what we're really feeling,

00:12:38.211 --> 00:12:40.484
so we've got to take it
both ways, you know?

00:12:40.508 --> 00:12:42.455
But I have great faith because --

00:12:42.479 --> 00:12:45.372
if you've been in sports like I have --

00:12:45.396 --> 00:12:47.029
every generation gets better.

00:12:47.053 --> 00:12:48.338
It's a fact.

00:12:48.362 --> 00:12:52.371
With the Women's Sports Foundation
being the advocates for Title IX still,

00:12:52.395 --> 00:12:54.648
because we're trying
to keep protecting the law,

00:12:54.672 --> 00:12:57.817
because it's in a tenuous position always,

00:12:57.841 --> 00:12:59.721
so we really are concerned,

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:01.436
and we do a lot of research.
