00:10:57.604 --> 00:11:00.599
But what you found out
in the research about millennials

00:11:00.623 --> 00:11:05.250
is not really the experience that a lot
of people have with millennials.

00:11:05.274 --> 00:11:09.038
BJK: No, well, if we want to talk --
OK, I've been doing my little mini-survey.

00:11:09.062 --> 00:11:13.945
I've been talking to the Boomers,
who are their bosses, and I go,

00:11:13.969 --> 00:11:16.015
"What do you think about the millennials?"

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:17.915
And I'm pretty excited, like it's good,

00:11:17.939 --> 00:11:19.395
and they get this face --

00:11:19.419 --> 00:11:21.735
(Laughter)

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:23.441
"Oh, you mean the 'Me' generation?"

00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:25.046
(Laughter)

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:26.558
I say, "Do you really think so?

00:11:26.582 --> 00:11:29.464
Because I do think they care
about the environment

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:30.783
and all these things."
