00:04:59.432 --> 00:05:02.801
So I was daydreaming
at the Los Angeles Tennis Club,

00:05:02.825 --> 00:05:07.589
and I started thinking about my sport
and how tiny it was,

00:05:07.613 --> 00:05:11.262
but also that everybody who played
wore white shoes, white clothes,

00:05:11.286 --> 00:05:14.180
played with white balls --
everybody who played was white.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.842
And I said to myself, at 12 years old,
"Where is everyone else?"

00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:25.373
And that just kept sticking in my brain.

00:05:25.397 --> 00:05:26.548
And that moment,

00:05:26.572 --> 00:05:29.526
I promised myself I'd fight
for equal rights and opportunities

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.298
for boys and girls, men and women,
the rest of my life.
