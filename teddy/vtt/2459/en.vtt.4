00:01:56.943 --> 00:02:00.948
We do stand on the shoulders of the people
that came before us, there is no question.

00:02:00.972 --> 00:02:03.505
But every generation
has the chance to make it better.

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:06.682
That was really on my mind.

00:02:06.706 --> 00:02:10.325
I really wanted to start matching
the hearts and minds to Title IX.

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.136
Title IX, in case anybody doesn't know,
which a lot of people probably don't,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.438
said that any federal funds given
to a high school, college or university,

00:02:18.462 --> 00:02:20.536
either public or private,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.462
had to -- finally --
give equal monies to boys and girls.

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.400
And that changed everything.

00:02:27.424 --> 00:02:30.250
