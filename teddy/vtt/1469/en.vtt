00:00:00.637 --> 00:00:04.140
Democracy is in trouble, no question about that,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.382
and it comes in part from a deep dilemma

00:00:07.398 --> 00:00:10.070
in which it is embedded.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.817
It's increasingly irrelevant to the kinds of decisions

00:00:13.817 --> 00:00:17.342
we face that have to do with global pandemics,

00:00:17.342 --> 00:00:19.451
a cross-border problem;

00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:22.874
with HIV, a transnational problem;

00:00:22.874 --> 00:00:24.949
with markets and immigration,

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.503
something that goes beyond national borders;

00:00:27.503 --> 00:00:29.776
with terrorism, with war,

00:00:29.776 --> 00:00:32.423
all now cross-border problems.
