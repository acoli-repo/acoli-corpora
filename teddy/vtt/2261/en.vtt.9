00:04:26.601 --> 00:04:30.069
where I realized that poverty
only changes affordability --

00:04:30.093 --> 00:04:32.160
it does not change aspirations.

00:04:33.268 --> 00:04:37.283
Now poor people have lived
in temporary structures all their life.

00:04:37.307 --> 00:04:38.839
They go from wall to wall,

00:04:38.863 --> 00:04:40.772
moving from bricks to tin.

00:04:41.307 --> 00:04:43.450
They move from building from bamboo,

00:04:43.474 --> 00:04:46.474
tarpaulin sheets, plastic,
to cardboard, to tin,

00:04:46.498 --> 00:04:47.649
to bricks and cement,

00:04:47.673 --> 00:04:49.273
just like the way we do.

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:53.633
So somewhere here, we were forcing
our choices on them.

00:04:53.657 --> 00:04:56.125
So should we force our choices on them,

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:58.656
or should we broaden their choices?

00:04:59.752 --> 00:05:03.219
Now what if the opportunity to choose
was given to people?
