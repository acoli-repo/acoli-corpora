00:00:01.032 --> 00:00:03.642
What is our imagery of cities?

00:00:04.016 --> 00:00:05.825
When we imagine cities,

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:08.825
we often imagine it
to be something like this.

00:00:09.587 --> 00:00:13.778
But what if what you're looking at
is just half a picture,

00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:16.428
but there is a city within the city.

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.834
This part of the city
is often seen as slums,

00:00:20.858 --> 00:00:22.879
squatters, informal,

00:00:22.903 --> 00:00:26.093
and people living here
are called illegal, informal,

00:00:26.117 --> 00:00:29.204
criminals, beneficiaries,
supplicants, etc.
