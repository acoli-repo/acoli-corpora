as laborers, babysitters, house helps

00:03:02.101 --> 00:03:03.752
and countless other jobs

00:03:03.776 --> 00:03:06.522
that we need for cities to function
without a glitch?

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:08.666
And where do they live?

00:03:09.165 --> 00:03:12.037
In most cities, they live in slums.

00:03:13.204 --> 00:03:14.728
So let us think again.

00:03:15.204 --> 00:03:18.137
Do we want poor people
to stop migrating in our cities?

00:03:19.278 --> 00:03:22.039
What if they had a choice of not to?

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.793
The second myth is my personal experience.

00:03:28.188 --> 00:03:31.922
It's this attitude that we
professionals know better.
