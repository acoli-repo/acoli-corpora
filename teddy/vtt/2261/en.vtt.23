00:11:29.157 --> 00:11:30.623
that's a lot of people.

00:11:31.823 --> 00:11:35.782
So instead of doing that,
we came up with a 12-meter-wide road,

00:11:35.806 --> 00:11:38.719
which had the structures intact
and brought the city bus

00:11:38.743 --> 00:11:41.060
without compromising
on much services.

00:11:42.203 --> 00:11:46.204
In another instance,
let's talk about community toilets.

00:11:46.228 --> 00:11:47.785
You know, in high-density areas,

00:11:47.809 --> 00:11:50.633
where there is no scope
for individual toilets,

00:11:50.657 --> 00:11:52.950
like the public toilets that we have here.

00:11:53.665 --> 00:11:56.982
So we would go for a male section
and a female section.

00:11:57.894 --> 00:11:59.694
But imagine this situation.
