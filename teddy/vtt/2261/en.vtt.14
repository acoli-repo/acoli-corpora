Dharavi, in Mumbai,

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:05.664
Khayelitsha in South Africa, just a few.

00:07:06.903 --> 00:07:10.473
Now initially, they were all
on waste and abandoned lands

00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:12.412
that cities were never interested in.

00:07:12.857 --> 00:07:14.110
As cities grew,

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:16.460
poor people started building
on these lands

00:07:16.484 --> 00:07:18.817
and brought value to this over time.

00:07:20.038 --> 00:07:23.393
And today, these lands have become
real estate hot spots

00:07:23.417 --> 00:07:25.550
that everybody wants a piece of.

00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:29.713
So how do cities and those in power
choose to deal with them?
