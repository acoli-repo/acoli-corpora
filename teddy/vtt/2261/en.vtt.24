In the morning rush hours to the toilet,

00:12:03.061 --> 00:12:06.291
when everybody is in intense
pressure to relieve themselves,

00:12:06.315 --> 00:12:08.901
and if you're standing
in a queue of 50 people,

00:12:08.925 --> 00:12:11.734
and there is a child
standing behind an adult,

00:12:11.758 --> 00:12:12.908
who wins?

00:12:14.203 --> 00:12:16.470
Children end up squatting outside.

00:12:17.004 --> 00:12:19.077
And that's why women decided

00:12:19.101 --> 00:12:21.974
to come up with a separate
squatting area for children.

00:12:21.998 --> 00:12:24.429
Now, who could have thought
of something like that?

00:12:25.427 --> 00:12:28.304
The idea here is
that when poor people choose,

00:12:28.328 --> 00:12:29.884
they choose better.

00:12:29.908 --> 00:12:32.041
They choose what works for them.
