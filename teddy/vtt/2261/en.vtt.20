Many come back from work to find out
that their houses do not exist,

00:10:02.744 --> 00:10:04.926
because they have either been bulldozed,

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.479
or they have been burned down.

00:10:08.695 --> 00:10:10.758
So, tired of this situation,

00:10:10.782 --> 00:10:13.659
a local slum dwellers' federation
called Muungano

00:10:13.683 --> 00:10:15.647
decided to do something about it.

00:10:16.227 --> 00:10:17.696

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:22.133
they organized 20,000 residents
to collect data,

00:10:22.157 --> 00:10:25.061
map structures and put it together.

00:10:26.379 --> 00:10:27.910
And the plan was very simple --

00:10:27.934 --> 00:10:29.720
they only needed four things.

00:10:29.744 --> 00:10:31.696
They wanted clean water,
