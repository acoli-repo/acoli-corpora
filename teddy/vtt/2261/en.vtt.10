Now what if the opportunity to choose
was given to people?

00:05:03.998 --> 00:05:08.512
These are women who lived on the pavements
of a neighborhood in Mumbai.

00:05:09.037 --> 00:05:12.849
Now they faced constant evictions,
and in response to it,

00:05:12.873 --> 00:05:16.339
they organized a women's network
called Mahila Milan.

00:05:17.055 --> 00:05:20.839
Not only did they fight against evictions
with those in power,

00:05:20.863 --> 00:05:23.141
saved money and bought land,

00:05:23.165 --> 00:05:26.696
but they also designed
and helped construct their own houses.

00:05:27.538 --> 00:05:30.837
Well, these were illiterate women,
so how did they do that?
