00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.982
So to give us a glimpse,

00:09:33.006 --> 00:09:35.206
this is the condition of housing.

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:38.978
And this is what it is in between them.

00:09:41.105 --> 00:09:44.465
So what is life in Mukuru like,
just talking briefly?

00:09:45.065 --> 00:09:49.339
Five hundred and fifty people
use one single water tap

00:09:49.363 --> 00:09:50.857
and pay nine times more

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:53.569
than what anybody else
in the city could pay,

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:55.831
simply because there is
no water infrastructure

00:09:55.855 --> 00:09:57.055
and water is sold.

00:09:58.546 --> 00:10:02.720
Many come back from work to find out
that their houses do not exist,
