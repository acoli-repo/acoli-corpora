00:07:58.726 --> 00:08:02.218
poor people are not involved
in the participation of design,

00:08:02.242 --> 00:08:04.649
and there is poor quality of construction.

00:08:04.673 --> 00:08:07.139
And on the other hand,

00:08:07.163 --> 00:08:09.465
they do not understand
how to do maintenance,

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:13.323
you know, keeping bills,
keeping records, forming societies --

00:08:13.347 --> 00:08:15.050
this is always difficult for them.

00:08:16.564 --> 00:08:21.056
And being forced to move
into this formal society,

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.833
they end up looking like this
in a few years.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.913
Because formalization is not a product,

00:08:26.937 --> 00:08:28.088
it's a process.

00:08:28.112 --> 00:08:31.569
Moving from informal to formal
for poor people is a journey.
