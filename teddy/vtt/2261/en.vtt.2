without clean water, toilets or housing.

00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:06.405
But these places are not unfamiliar to me,

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:10.730
because since the age of six,
I accompanied my father, a doctor,

00:01:10.754 --> 00:01:13.728
who treated patients
in the slums of Bombay.

00:01:13.752 --> 00:01:16.736
Growing up, I would help him
carry his bag of medicines

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.934
after school lessons --

00:01:17.958 --> 00:01:19.225
I loved doing that.

00:01:19.744 --> 00:01:22.276
Wanting to do something
about these habitats,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.997
I decided to become an architect.

00:01:25.577 --> 00:01:27.863
But quite early on, I realized

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:31.043
that the beauty of architecture
was only for the rich.
