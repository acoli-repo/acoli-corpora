It's this attitude that we
professionals know better.

00:03:32.688 --> 00:03:35.634
We professionals love
to make choices for others,

00:03:35.658 --> 00:03:37.523
especially for the poor.

00:03:37.547 --> 00:03:39.347
Let me share an experience.

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.650
In a workshop that looked at designing
250 new houses for poor families

00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:46.579
from a slum nearby,

00:03:46.603 --> 00:03:50.090
there were different building materials
that were presented,

00:03:50.114 --> 00:03:53.662
ranging from papier-mâché,
cardboard, honeycomb, etc.,

00:03:53.686 --> 00:03:55.649
simply because they were affordable.

00:03:56.646 --> 00:04:00.217
But there was this one idea
that was of shipping containers.
