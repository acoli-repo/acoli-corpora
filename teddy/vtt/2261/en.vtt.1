00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:31.575
But in reality,

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.662
these are poor people with no choices.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.766
Poverty is a vicious cycle.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.758
If born poor, it can take
three or more generations

00:00:40.782 --> 00:00:41.932
to escape one.

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:45.547
Many are forced in this cycle
without choices,

00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:48.490
to live on pavements,

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:50.545
along train tracks,

00:00:51.765 --> 00:00:53.550
in dumping grounds,

00:00:54.463 --> 00:00:56.662
along rivers,

00:00:56.686 --> 00:00:59.749
swamps and many such unlivable spaces,

00:00:59.773 --> 00:01:02.701
without clean water, toilets or housing.
