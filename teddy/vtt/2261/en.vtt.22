00:10:56.491 --> 00:11:00.291
People could decide to come up
with their own norms and standards,

00:11:00.315 --> 00:11:03.251
because the standards that work
for the formal citizens

00:11:03.275 --> 00:11:05.142
do not work in informal settings.

00:11:05.887 --> 00:11:08.648
So what does that mean,
to give us an instance?

00:11:09.736 --> 00:11:11.204
If these are roads in Mukuru,

00:11:11.228 --> 00:11:14.942
you can see that there are houses
along both sides of the road.

00:11:15.815 --> 00:11:18.712
Now in order to bring in a city bus,

00:11:18.736 --> 00:11:20.037
as per the standards,

00:11:20.061 --> 00:11:23.696
planners would have gone for
a luxurious 25-meter-wide road.

00:11:24.585 --> 00:11:29.133
Now that would mean displacing
[25] percent of the structures --

00:11:29.157 --> 00:11:30.623
that's a lot of people.
