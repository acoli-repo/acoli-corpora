Moving from informal to formal
for poor people is a journey.

00:08:31.903 --> 00:08:34.450
It takes time to accept and adapt.

00:08:36.187 --> 00:08:38.569
And when that choice is not given,

00:08:38.593 --> 00:08:39.821
it becomes like this,

00:08:39.845 --> 00:08:43.450
which I'm afraid, in future,
these would become the slums.

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:47.077
Now instead of doing this,

00:08:47.101 --> 00:08:49.482
what if we accommodated poor people

00:08:49.506 --> 00:08:52.053
and gave them a choice
to be a part of our cities

00:08:52.077 --> 00:08:54.180
and develop them where they are,

00:08:54.204 --> 00:08:56.894
giving them basic services,
like in this picture?

00:08:58.553 --> 00:09:02.093
Now what happens if cities
and governments could work together,
