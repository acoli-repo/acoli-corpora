00:05:27.538 --> 00:05:30.837
Well, these were illiterate women,
so how did they do that?

00:05:32.593 --> 00:05:36.923
They used floor mats and saris
to understand measurements.

00:05:37.423 --> 00:05:41.549
A sari is four meters in length
and 1.5 meters in width.

00:05:42.098 --> 00:05:46.700
They used these simple day-to-day items
to demonstrate house models.

00:05:47.115 --> 00:05:49.965
And even they made
three options to choose from

00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:53.040
and invited all their fellow residents
to come and have a look.

00:05:53.064 --> 00:05:54.750
(Laughter)

00:05:54.774 --> 00:05:59.135
And everybody loved this option
that had a loft in it,

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.119
simply because it did two things.
