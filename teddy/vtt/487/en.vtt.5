00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:30.586
is that you can change
the purpose of things

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.895
by inventing new technology
and then hacking into things

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.137
and changing them.

00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:39.335
So I've been thinking
what kind of technology I can invent

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.335
so that I can hack into things
you use every day

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.732
and make them interactive.

00:02:45.763 --> 00:02:48.526
So when I was working on this thing,
I invented this sensor

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.478
which injects structured
electric fields into objects

00:02:51.502 --> 00:02:53.422
and turns them into gesture interfaces.

00:02:53.446 --> 00:02:56.981
So this doorknob, unmodified,
can become a gesture sensor.

00:02:57.005 --> 00:03:00.339
It can know how you're touching it.
It can feel how you're touching it.
