00:08:27.894 --> 00:08:30.493
which makes me look great.

00:08:30.517 --> 00:08:32.538
(Laughter)

00:08:32.562 --> 00:08:37.101
(Applause)

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:39.601
And that's the most important thing.

00:08:39.625 --> 00:08:42.886
(Laughter)

00:08:43.425 --> 00:08:46.332
So OK, we proved we can turn
things into interfaces.

00:08:46.356 --> 00:08:50.355
We proved that these things
can be made by makers of things

00:08:50.379 --> 00:08:51.975
and not by technology companies.

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:54.038
I look awesome. Are we done?

00:08:54.062 --> 00:08:55.292
(Laughter)

00:08:55.316 --> 00:08:56.474
Not yet.

00:08:56.498 --> 00:08:58.031
The third challenge:

00:08:58.055 --> 00:09:00.225
How can we scale?
