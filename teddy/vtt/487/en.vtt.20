00:09:55.965 --> 00:10:00.083
every thing would have its own set
of actuators, displays and sensors

00:10:00.107 --> 00:10:02.190
specific for those things.

00:10:02.214 --> 00:10:05.073
A pair of running shoes
does not need to have a touch sensor.

00:10:05.097 --> 00:10:06.921
Why would it have one?

00:10:06.945 --> 00:10:08.278
If you have a sensor,

00:10:08.302 --> 00:10:10.357
it should measure your running performance

00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:11.532
or knee impact,

00:10:11.556 --> 00:10:13.645
while remaining a great pair of shoes.

00:10:14.309 --> 00:10:17.364
Makers of things
will have to start thinking

00:10:17.388 --> 00:10:22.143
what kind of digital functionality
they have to offer to their consumers.

00:10:23.002 --> 00:10:25.897
They will have to become
service providers,

00:10:26.755 --> 00:10:28.271
or they may become irrelevant.

00:10:29.262 --> 00:10:32.763
We will have to provide and create
a service ecosystem
