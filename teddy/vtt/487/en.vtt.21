00:10:29.262 --> 00:10:32.763
We will have to provide and create
a service ecosystem

00:10:32.787 --> 00:10:34.921
just like we've done for mobile phones,

00:10:34.945 --> 00:10:37.421
where you have apps and services
and everything else,

00:10:37.445 --> 00:10:39.762
and sometimes,
you're still making a phone call.

00:10:40.081 --> 00:10:44.437
Now to make this ecosystem possible,
we have to avoid fragmentation.

00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:48.319
We have to avoid different interfaces
for different people for different things.

00:10:48.343 --> 00:10:50.430
We have to create uniform user experience

00:10:50.454 --> 00:10:54.832
and, for that reason, we have to create
a single computing platform

00:10:54.856 --> 00:10:56.777
which powers all those things.

00:10:56.801 --> 00:10:58.681
What is the platform going to be?

00:10:58.705 --> 00:11:00.417
And I think the answer is obvious:
