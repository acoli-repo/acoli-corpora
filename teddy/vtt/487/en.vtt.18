00:08:58.055 --> 00:09:00.225
How can we scale?

00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:03.474
How can we go from one product
to many products?

00:09:03.498 --> 00:09:05.512
And that's what
we're working on right now.

00:09:05.536 --> 00:09:07.631
Let me tell you
how we're going to do this.

00:09:07.655 --> 00:09:09.718
First of all, I want
to make myself clear --

00:09:09.742 --> 00:09:12.399
I am not talking about
the Internet of Things.

00:09:12.423 --> 00:09:15.852
I'm not talking about
creating another gadget

00:09:15.876 --> 00:09:18.764
you get bored with and throw
in the back of your drawer

00:09:18.788 --> 00:09:19.939
and forget about.

00:09:19.963 --> 00:09:24.383
I am talking about the foundational,
important principle which guides my work:

00:09:24.693 --> 00:09:28.732
"Technology has to make
existing things better."

00:09:29.299 --> 00:09:34.089
It makes them better
by connecting them to your digital life
