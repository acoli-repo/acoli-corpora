00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:31.466
and an artist who knows
how to make things beautiful.

00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:37.042
Working with them, we created
one of the best yarns in the world,

00:06:37.066 --> 00:06:39.508
which consists of thin metallic alloys

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:42.764
wrapped around with polyester fibers
and cotton fibers.

00:06:42.788 --> 00:06:45.249
These yarns were made in the same machines

00:06:45.273 --> 00:06:48.605
which were making yarns
for kimonos for generations.

00:06:49.374 --> 00:06:51.953
We then took these yarns
and gave them to the factory,

00:06:51.977 --> 00:06:53.865
which is making textiles,

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:57.310
and we wove our smart textile
using regular machines

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:59.215
in a variety of colors and materials,

00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:02.345
and we gave those textiles to a tailor
