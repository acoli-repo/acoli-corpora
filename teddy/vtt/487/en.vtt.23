00:11:27.397 --> 00:11:31.549
which will be connected
to things we want to make smart

00:11:31.573 --> 00:11:33.007
and connected and interactive.

00:11:33.031 --> 00:11:34.182
How is it going to work?

00:11:34.206 --> 00:11:38.294
So on the back, you have a few electrodes.

00:11:38.318 --> 00:11:41.318
So when you plug them
into different things,

00:11:41.342 --> 00:11:42.995
like here,

00:11:43.019 --> 00:11:45.790
the device will recognize
where you're plugging them

00:11:45.814 --> 00:11:49.791
and then reconfigure itself
to enable specific functionality

00:11:49.815 --> 00:11:51.995
for this particular thing.

00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:54.575
We would like to give this device
to makers of things,

00:11:54.599 --> 00:11:56.926
the people who make
your clothing and furniture,

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.924
so they can use it just like they use
a button or a zipper.
