00:06:59.239 --> 00:07:02.345
and we gave those textiles to a tailor

00:07:02.369 --> 00:07:04.389
in Savile Row in London.

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:08.937
So tailors are traditionalists,
particularly in Savile Row.

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:10.310
They don't use computers.

00:07:11.093 --> 00:07:13.796
They don't use machines.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.559
They use hands and they cut.

00:07:15.583 --> 00:07:17.686
They fit their products on the human body,

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.272
not on 3-D avatars.

00:07:21.084 --> 00:07:23.267
Technology is not
a part of their vocabulary,

00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:25.164
but they are modern people.

00:07:25.188 --> 00:07:27.283
They know how to use technology.

00:07:27.307 --> 00:07:29.593
So if technology can be formed and shaped

00:07:29.617 --> 00:07:32.990
like a button, like a textile,
like something they can use,
