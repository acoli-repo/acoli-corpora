00:01:29.804 --> 00:01:32.717
So if we are using things all the time,

00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:34.836
and this is a big part of our lives,

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.463
can things become the way for us
to interact with our digital life?

00:01:40.795 --> 00:01:43.429
Can the world become your interface?

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:46.055
That was my idea.

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.748
I've been working for 20 years on it.

00:01:48.772 --> 00:01:51.757
My idea is that in order
to interact in digital life,

00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:56.533
you don't need to have
screens and keyboards and mouses.

00:01:56.557 --> 00:01:58.739
You can interact with your digital life

00:01:58.763 --> 00:02:01.501
just by using the things
you use every day.
