00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:31.446
Is that what the future looks like?

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.515
We're going to be stuck in the screens

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.664
with our faces not seeing
the world around us?

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.019
That's not the future I imagine,
or the future I'm attracted to.

00:00:41.043 --> 00:00:43.876
What I've been always
interested in is things,

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.034
physical things we use every day,
like things on this table

00:00:47.058 --> 00:00:49.534
that the family doesn't pay attention to.

00:00:49.558 --> 00:00:51.693
Things tell our story.
They tell who we are.

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:53.315
They tell a lot about us.

00:00:53.938 --> 00:00:55.740
Let me give you an example.

00:00:56.075 --> 00:01:01.083
These are photographs of things
a person touched during 24 hours.
