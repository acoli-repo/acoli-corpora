00:12:28.465 --> 00:12:30.108
and now it's taking shape,

00:12:30.132 --> 00:12:32.956
and as it's taking shape,
what we are realizing

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.901
is that I always thought
I was working on computer interfaces,

00:12:35.925 --> 00:12:38.449
I always thought of myself
as an interaction designer,

00:12:38.473 --> 00:12:42.211
but I'm realizing
that I'm not building interfaces.

00:12:42.235 --> 00:12:45.239
What I realized is that me and my team,

00:12:46.861 --> 00:12:49.160
we're building a new kind of computer,

00:12:49.184 --> 00:12:50.879
an ambient computer.

00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:52.054
Thank you.
