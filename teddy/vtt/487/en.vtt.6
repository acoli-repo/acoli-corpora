It can know how you're touching it.
It can feel how you're touching it.

00:03:00.363 --> 00:03:02.557
It makes a circle, or can I grasp.

00:03:03.377 --> 00:03:04.981
And this doorknob isn't modified.

00:03:05.005 --> 00:03:06.961
There's nothing special about doorknobs.

00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:08.659
Anything can become interactive.

00:03:08.683 --> 00:03:10.183
What about plants?

00:03:10.948 --> 00:03:13.177
So plants are interesting,
because with plants,

00:03:13.201 --> 00:03:14.917
they can know where you're touching.

00:03:14.941 --> 00:03:17.495
You can see the line moving
up and down on the image.

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.679
And that can turn
into a musical interface.

00:03:19.703 --> 00:03:23.431
(Musical tones)

00:03:24.515 --> 00:03:27.793
Now, we do have also
practical applications:

00:03:27.817 --> 00:03:32.350
a calendar plant for those
who are obsessed about practicality.
