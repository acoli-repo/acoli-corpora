00:03:58.857 --> 00:04:01.605
is more robust, it's a snake plant,

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.772
and it likes playing with you.
It engages you.

00:04:04.146 --> 00:04:05.969
So every thing can be different,

00:04:05.993 --> 00:04:09.437
and every thing can represent
what it feels.

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.892
So everything can be hacked,
all the things, including your body.

00:04:14.916 --> 00:04:17.171
In this example, we hacked your body

00:04:17.195 --> 00:04:19.874
so you can measure
how you're folding your hands

00:04:19.898 --> 00:04:22.751
and then using your hand gestures
to control something else,

00:04:22.775 --> 00:04:25.827
so if you don't want to listen
to some music thousands of times,

00:04:25.851 --> 00:04:28.624
you simply can cover your ears
to turn it off.

00:04:28.978 --> 00:04:31.915
So everything can be hacked,
and research is important,
