So everything can be hacked,
and research is important,

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:34.017
but the second challenge we have

00:04:34.041 --> 00:04:38.891
is how can we go from R and D,
and prototypes, to real products?

00:04:38.915 --> 00:04:42.860
How can we make real things
that are also interfaces?

00:04:44.138 --> 00:04:46.646
And you may ask yourself,
who would do this?

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:47.952
Silicon Valley?

00:04:47.976 --> 00:04:49.510
Is it through Shenzhen?

00:04:49.534 --> 00:04:53.253
Now the challenge there
is that the world of things is huge.

00:04:53.757 --> 00:04:57.811
Every year, the apparel industry
produces 150 billion garments.

00:04:58.597 --> 00:05:03.939
In comparison, the technology industry
only makes 1.4 billion phones.
