00:00:56.075 --> 00:01:01.083
These are photographs of things
a person touched during 24 hours.

00:01:01.107 --> 00:01:02.945
What can you tell about him?

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.265
He loves his motorcycle. Right?

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:07.374
The biggest thing in his picture.

What can you tell about this girl?

00:01:09.774 --> 00:01:11.552
She spends all her time on the beach.

00:01:11.576 --> 00:01:12.989
There's a surfboard.

00:01:13.013 --> 00:01:14.599

Look at all the ingredients
he touched during the day,

00:01:21.754 --> 00:01:23.343
while he was preparing the food,

00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:26.410
and the computer
is a tiny part of his life,

00:01:26.434 --> 00:01:28.542
this sad thing in the corner.

00:01:29.804 --> 00:01:32.717
So if we are using things all the time,
