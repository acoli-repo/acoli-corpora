00:10:58.705 --> 00:11:00.417
And I think the answer is obvious:

00:11:00.441 --> 00:11:03.318
it's a cloud, cloud computing.

00:11:03.342 --> 00:11:06.442
Now you cannot connect things
directly to the cloud, obviously.

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:11.896
So you have to develop a small device
which can be plugged into all the things

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.636
and make them connected to the cloud

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.299
to unlock their potential
and add new functionality.

00:11:17.323 --> 00:11:21.113
So let me show, for the first time,
the real device which we've built.

00:11:21.137 --> 00:11:23.692
We are showing this for the first time.

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:25.032
That's what it looks like,

00:11:26.223 --> 00:11:27.373
and it's a small device

00:11:27.397 --> 00:11:31.549
which will be connected
to things we want to make smart
