you use every day.

00:02:02.057 --> 00:02:05.231
And to realize this idea,
I need to solve three big challenges.

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:07.207
Let me tell you about them.

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.554
The first one, obviously:
Is it even possible?

00:02:12.578 --> 00:02:16.412
How can you take an everyday thing

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.588
Now I was inspired by the book "Hackers."

00:02:21.612 --> 00:02:23.269
I read it when I was a teenager,

00:02:23.293 --> 00:02:27.307
and one of the essential
ideas of this book

00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:30.586
is that you can change
the purpose of things
