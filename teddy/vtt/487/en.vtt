00:00:00.996 --> 00:00:03.714
Computers have become truly incredible.

00:00:04.523 --> 00:00:07.464
We are walking around
with supercomputers in our pocket.

00:00:07.488 --> 00:00:09.642
How amazing is that?

00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.651
So it is disappointing

00:00:11.675 --> 00:00:15.064
that the way we use computers,
the way we interact with them,

00:00:15.088 --> 00:00:18.124
hasn't really changed
in the last 50 years.

00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:22.305
We still use a mouse and keyboards.
We're clicking on screens and buttons.

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.502
Mobile phones are the same.

00:00:24.526 --> 00:00:27.370
We're just using fingers
instead of a mouse.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.617
So is that it?

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:31.446
Is that what the future looks like?
