00:07:29.617 --> 00:07:32.990
like a button, like a textile,
like something they can use,

00:07:33.014 --> 00:07:35.554
they absolutely can make a wearable,

00:07:35.578 --> 00:07:38.546
a garment which can place a phone call.

00:07:38.967 --> 00:07:40.514
(Phone rings)

00:07:41.489 --> 00:07:44.363
So now we've proven
that you can actually make a wearable,

00:07:44.387 --> 00:07:48.894
not by an electronic company,
but by a tailor.

00:07:48.918 --> 00:07:51.750
We worked and collaborated with Levi's,

00:07:51.774 --> 00:07:54.756
our partners and our neighbors,

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.453
to make a real product,

00:07:56.477 --> 00:07:59.283
and this product is this jacket
I'm wearing right now.
