Every single year,
up to 600 million people

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.184
will get sick eating contaminated food,

00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:37.268
highlighting the challenge that we have
of maintaining global food safety.

00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:39.351
And, maybe unsurprisingly,

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:41.018
the agricultural industry

00:01:41.042 --> 00:01:43.809
is the single largest
consumer of fresh water,

00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:46.708
accounting for 70 percent of global usage.

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:50.018
Now, you'll be relieved to know

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:52.351
that the agricultural industry

00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:57.601
and that the global movement
by universities, companies and NGOs

00:01:57.625 --> 00:01:59.643
is putting together comprehensive research

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:01.559
and developing novel technology
