00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.559
you have consistent quality
and you have predictable output.

00:05:02.583 --> 00:05:04.518
Some of the other major benefits

00:05:04.542 --> 00:05:08.059
include significant
resource use efficiencies,

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:09.792
particularly water.

00:05:10.667 --> 00:05:13.393
For every kilogram of vegetables
grown in this way,

00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:18.059
hundreds of liters of water is conserved
compared to conventional farming methods.

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:19.393
And with the water savings

00:05:19.417 --> 00:05:22.059
come similar savings
in the use of fertilizer.

00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:23.893
One of the highest-yielding farms

00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:29.375
grows over 350 times more food
per square meter than a conventional farm.
