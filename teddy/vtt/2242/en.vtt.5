00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:30.809
and many of these farms grow food
three-dimensionally in vertical racks,

00:02:30.833 --> 00:02:34.184
as opposed to the two dimensions
of conventional farms.

00:02:34.208 --> 00:02:37.143
And so this type of food production
is also referred to

00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:39.125
as indoor vertical farming.

00:02:40.167 --> 00:02:42.809
I've been involved
in the indoor vertical farming space

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:44.559
for the past five and a half years,

00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:47.351
developing technology
to make this type of food production

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:49.476
more efficient and affordable.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.059
This picture was taken outside
of a decommissioned shipping container

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:55.893
that we converted into an indoor farm

00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:59.333
and then launched into the heart
and the heat of Dubai.
