00:00:00.706 --> 00:00:03.184
So if you live on planet Earth

00:00:03.208 --> 00:00:06.768
and you're one of seven billion people
that eats food every day,

00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:08.184
I need you to pay attention,

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.351
because over the next three decades,

00:00:10.375 --> 00:00:11.809
we will need to address

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:15.809
one of the most critical
global challenges of our generation.

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:18.059
And I'm not talking about climate change.

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:20.458
I'm talking about food and agriculture.

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:26.726
In 2050, our global population
is projected to reach 9.8 billion,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.643
with 68 percent of us
living in urban city centers.
