00:05:30.542 --> 00:05:31.934
And weatherproofing

00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:35.809
means complete control
of incoming contaminants and pests,

00:05:35.833 --> 00:05:39.125
completely eliminating the need
for the use of chemical pesticides.

00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:41.809
And not to be mistaken,

00:05:41.833 --> 00:05:44.851
these farms can produce
enormous amounts of food,

00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:46.559
with one of the biggest facilities

00:05:46.583 --> 00:05:49.976
producing 30,000 heads
of vegetables a day.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.101
However, as with any
new technology or innovation,

00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:54.518
there are some drawbacks.

00:05:54.542 --> 00:05:55.809
As you would imagine,

00:05:55.833 --> 00:05:59.059
growing food in this way
can be incredibly energy-intensive.

00:05:59.083 --> 00:06:03.059
Also, these farms can only produce
a small variety of vegetables commercially
