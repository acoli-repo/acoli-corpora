00:03:59.458 --> 00:04:01.351
to grow vegetables vertically,

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:03.101
and some of the biggest facilities

00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:06.042
stack their production
14 to 16 floors high.

00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:10.809
Now most of these farms are hydroponic
or aeroponic systems,

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:12.768
which means that instead of using soil,

00:04:12.792 --> 00:04:16.351
they use a substitute material
like polyurethane sponges,

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:18.184
biodegradable peat moss

00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:21.750
and even use inorganic materials
like perlite and clay pellets.

00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:25.101
Another unique aspects about these farms

00:04:25.125 --> 00:04:27.601
is that they use
a precise nutrient formula

00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:30.893
that is circulated and recycled
throughout the facility,
