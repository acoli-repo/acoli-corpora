Complicating our current efforts
to address these major demographic shifts

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:09.667
are the challenges facing
the agricultural industry today.

00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:14.976
Globally, one third of all the food
that we produce is wasted,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.309
acquitting to 1.6 billion tons of food

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.684
that spoiled on the way to the market

00:01:20.708 --> 00:01:23.101
or expired in our refrigerators

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:25.851
or were simply thrown out
by supermarkets and restaurants

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:27.559
at the end of the day.

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:30.726
