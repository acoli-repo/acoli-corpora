Indoor vertical farming
is a relatively recent phenomena,

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:04.934
commercially speaking,

00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.268
and the reason for this is that consumers
care more about food safety

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:09.893
and where their food comes from,

00:03:09.917 --> 00:03:13.643
and also, the necessary technology
to make this possible

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:16.726
is more readily available and lower cost,

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.393
and the overall cost of food production
globally is actually increasing,

00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:23.934
making this type of food production
more competitive.

00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:27.018
So if you want to build
an indoor vertical farm,

00:03:27.042 --> 00:03:30.518
you will need to replace some of
the conventional elements of farming
