00:03:27.042 --> 00:03:30.518
you will need to replace some of
the conventional elements of farming

00:03:30.542 --> 00:03:32.309
with artificial substitutes,

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:34.083
starting with sunlight.

00:03:35.208 --> 00:03:36.851
In indoor vertical farms,

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:40.476
natural sunlight is replaced
with artificial lighting like LEDs.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.601
While there are many different types
of LEDs being used,

00:03:43.625 --> 00:03:45.643
the one that we decided to install here

00:03:45.667 --> 00:03:47.851
is called "full spectrum LEDs,"

00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:51.476
which was optimized for the type
of vegetables that we were growing.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.309
Also, in order to maximize
production for a given space,

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:59.434
indoor vertical farms also utilize
and install racking systems

00:03:59.458 --> 00:04:01.351
to grow vegetables vertically,
