00:07:32.792 --> 00:07:39.351

and unused urban infrastructure.

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:41.375
In fact, this is already happening today.

00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:46.809
Ride-sharing services have taken

and they have significantly reduced
the need for parking.

00:07:50.833 --> 00:07:53.351

00:07:53.375 --> 00:07:56.351

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:59.000
to grow vegetables for the nearby hotels.
