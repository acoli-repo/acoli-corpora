00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.643
with 68 percent of us
living in urban city centers.

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:33.518
In order to feed this massive population,

00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:35.934
we will need to increase
our agricultural output

00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:38.333
by 70 percent over current levels.

00:00:39.083 --> 00:00:41.101
Just to put this number into perspective,

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:44.518
we will need to grow more food
in the next 35 to 40 years

00:00:44.542 --> 00:00:48.309
than the previous 10,000 years combined.

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:52.309
Put simply, not only is our global
population becoming bigger,

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.226
but it's also getting denser,

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.851
and we will need to grow
significantly more food

00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:59.750
using significantly less
land and resources.
