00:05:59.083 --> 00:06:03.059
Also, these farms can only produce
a small variety of vegetables commercially

00:06:03.083 --> 00:06:07.101
and the overall cost of the production
still is quite high.

00:06:07.125 --> 00:06:09.268
And in order to address these issues,

00:06:09.292 --> 00:06:12.268
some of the biggest
and most sophisticated farms

00:06:12.292 --> 00:06:16.000
are making significant investments,
starting with energy efficiency.

00:06:17.458 --> 00:06:20.393
In order to reduce the high energy usage,

00:06:20.417 --> 00:06:23.601
there are efforts to develop
higher-efficiency LEDs,

00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:26.476
to develop lasers
optimized for plant growth

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.643
and using even
fiber-optic cables like these

00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:33.143
to channel sunlight directly
into an indoor vertical farm
