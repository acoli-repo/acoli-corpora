00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:30.893
that is circulated and recycled
throughout the facility,

00:04:30.917 --> 00:04:33.601
and this is pumped directly
to the vegetables' root zone

00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:34.875
to promote plant growth.

00:04:35.917 --> 00:04:37.893
And lastly, these farms use

00:04:37.917 --> 00:04:40.643
a sophisticated monitoring
and automation system

00:04:40.667 --> 00:04:43.101
to significantly increase productivity,

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:45.434
efficiency and consistency,

00:04:45.458 --> 00:04:47.934
and these tools also provide
the added benefit

00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:51.292
of producing food that is
more traceable and safe.

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:56.226
Some of the obvious benefits
of growing food in this way

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.976
is that you have year-round
vegetable production,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.559
you have consistent quality
and you have predictable output.
