00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:00.851
Underutilized infrastructure

00:08:00.875 --> 00:08:04.559
is not simply limited
to large-scale civil engineering projects,

00:08:04.583 --> 00:08:08.292
and they can also include smaller spaces
like idle restaurant corners.

00:08:09.167 --> 00:08:11.393
This is an example
of a farm that we installed

00:08:11.417 --> 00:08:14.601
directly into the partition
of a hotel entrance

00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:18.083
in order to grow fresh herbs
and microgreens on-site for the chefs.

00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:21.351
Honestly, if you look around,

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:24.143
you will find underutilized
space everywhere,

00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:27.917
under, around and inside
of urban developments.

00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:31.434
This is a farm that we installed
into an empty office corner
