to channel sunlight directly
into an indoor vertical farm

00:06:33.167 --> 00:06:35.958
during the day to reduce the need

more urban and also
more high-skilled labor force,

00:06:45.375 --> 00:06:49.292
robotics in automation is used extensively
in large-scale facilities.

00:06:50.583 --> 00:06:54.018
And you can never really be
too resource-efficient.

00:06:54.042 --> 00:06:58.226
Building indoor vertical farms
in and around urban city centers

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.101
can help to shorten
the agricultural supply chain
