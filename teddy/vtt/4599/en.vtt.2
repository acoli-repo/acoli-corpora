00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.181
reduces her momentum.

00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:02.177
So how does she keep turning?

00:01:02.177 --> 00:01:07.425
Between each turn, the dancer pauses
for a split second and faces the audience.

00:01:07.425 --> 00:01:08.966
Her supporting foot flattens,

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:12.375
and then twists as it rises 
back onto pointe,

00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:16.788
pushing against the floor to generate
a tiny amount of new torque.

00:01:16.788 --> 00:01:21.357
At the same time, her arms sweep open
to help her keep her balance.

00:01:21.357 --> 00:01:25.508
The turns are most effective if her center
of gravity stays constant,

00:01:25.508 --> 00:01:30.308
and a skilled dancer will be able to keep
her turning axis vertical.
