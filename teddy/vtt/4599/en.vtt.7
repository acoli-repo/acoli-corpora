00:03:29.988 --> 00:03:32.689
her angular velocity,
the speed of her turn,

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:33.975
has to increase,

00:03:33.975 --> 00:03:36.292
allowing the same amount 
of stored momentum

00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:39.294
to carry her through multiple turns.

00:03:39.294 --> 00:03:42.152
You've probably seen ice skaters
do the same thing,

00:03:42.152 --> 00:03:46.014
spinning faster and faster
by drawing in their arms and legs.

00:03:46.014 --> 00:03:49.813
In Tchaikovsky's ballet, the Black Swan
is a sorceress,

00:03:49.813 --> 00:03:55.036
and her 32 captivating fouettés do seem
almost supernatural.

00:03:55.036 --> 00:03:57.505
But it's not magic that 
makes them possible.

00:03:57.505 --> 00:03:58.723
It's physics.
