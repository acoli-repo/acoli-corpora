00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:02.265
that stored momentum gets transferred
back to the dancer's body,

00:02:02.265 --> 00:02:06.260
propelling her around as she rises
back onto pointe.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.638
As the ballerina extends and retracts
her leg with each turn,

00:02:09.638 --> 00:02:14.183
momentum travels back and forth
between leg and body,

00:02:14.183 --> 00:02:16.333
keeping her in motion.

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:20.517
A really good ballerina can get more
than one turn out of every leg extension

00:02:20.517 --> 00:02:22.258
in one of two ways.

00:02:22.258 --> 00:02:24.571
First, she can extend her leg sooner.

00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:28.306
The longer the leg is extended,
the more momentum it stores,

00:02:28.306 --> 00:02:32.555
and the more momentum it can return
to the body when it's pulled back in.
