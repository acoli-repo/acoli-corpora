00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.094
In the third act of "Swan Lake,"

00:00:09.094 --> 00:00:14.021
the Black Swan pulls off a seemingly
endless series of turns,

00:00:14.021 --> 00:00:16.885
bobbing up and down on one pointed foot

00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:22.872
and spinning around, and around,
and around 32 times.

00:00:22.872 --> 00:00:25.444
It's one of the toughest sequences
in ballet,

00:00:25.444 --> 00:00:27.217
and for those thirty seconds or so,

00:00:27.217 --> 00:00:31.142
she's like a human top 
in perpetual motion.
