00:01:25.508 --> 00:01:30.308
and a skilled dancer will be able to keep
her turning axis vertical.

00:01:30.308 --> 00:01:33.038
The extended arms 
and torque-generating foot

00:01:33.038 --> 00:01:35.359
both help drive the fouetté.

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.701
But the real secret and the reason
you hardly notice the pause

00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:41.921
is that her other leg never stops moving.

00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:43.727
During her momentary pause,

00:01:43.727 --> 00:01:48.263
the dancer's elevated leg straightens
and moves from the front to the side,

00:01:48.263 --> 00:01:50.848
before it folds back into her knee.

00:01:50.848 --> 00:01:56.282
By staying in motion, that leg is storing
some of the momentum of the turn.

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.602
When the leg comes back in 
towards the body,

00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:02.265
that stored momentum gets transferred
back to the dancer's body,
