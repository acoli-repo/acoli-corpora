00:00:27.217 --> 00:00:31.142
she's like a human top 
in perpetual motion.

00:00:31.142 --> 00:00:34.390
Those spectacular turns
are called fouettés,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.103
which means "whipped" in French,

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:40.348
describing the dancer's incredible
ability to whip around without stopping.

00:00:40.348 --> 00:00:44.437
But while we're marveling at the fouetté,
can we unravel its physics?

00:00:44.437 --> 00:00:48.881
The dancer starts the fouetté by pushing
off with her foot to generate torque.

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:52.164
But the hard part 
is maintaining the rotation.

00:00:52.164 --> 00:00:53.034
As she turns,

00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:55.541
friction between her pointe shoe 
and the floor,

00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:58.469
and somewhat between her body and the air,

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.181
reduces her momentum.
