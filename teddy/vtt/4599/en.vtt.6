00:02:58.662 --> 00:03:03.464
that angular momentum has to stay
constant while the dancer is on pointe.

00:03:03.464 --> 00:03:06.850
That's called conservation
of angular momentum.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.383
Now, rotational inertia can be thought of

00:03:09.383 --> 00:03:12.799
as a body's resistance 
to rotational motion.

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.788
It increases when more mass is distributed
further from the axis of rotation,

00:03:17.788 --> 00:03:22.548
and decreases when the mass is distributed
closer to the axis of rotation.

00:03:22.548 --> 00:03:25.029
So as she brings her arms closer
to her body,

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:28.088
her rotational inertia shrinks.

00:03:28.088 --> 00:03:29.988
In order to conserve angular momentum,


00:03:29.988 --> 00:03:32.689
her angular velocity,
the speed of her turn,
