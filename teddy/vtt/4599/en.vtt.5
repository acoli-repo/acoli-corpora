00:02:28.306 --> 00:02:32.555
and the more momentum it can return
to the body when it's pulled back in.

00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:35.229
More angular momentum means
she can make more turns

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:38.907
before needing to replenish
what was lost to friction.

00:02:38.907 --> 00:02:40.603
The other option is for the dancer

00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:44.054
to bring her arms 
or leg in closer to her body

00:02:44.054 --> 00:02:45.819
once she returns to pointe.

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.040
Why does this work?

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.719
Like every other turn in ballet,

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.427
the fouetté is governed 
by angular momentum,

00:02:51.427 --> 00:02:56.506
which is equal to the dancer's angular
velocity times her rotational inertia.

00:02:56.506 --> 00:02:58.662
And except for what's lost to friction,

00:02:58.662 --> 00:03:03.464
that angular momentum has to stay
constant while the dancer is on pointe.
