More than any other bit of technology,

00:09:31.475 --> 00:09:36.640
the computer is a mirror that reflects
any idea of the human we teach it.

00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:40.348
So I'm sure a lot of you have been hearing

00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:43.234
a lot about artificial
intelligence recently.

00:09:44.694 --> 00:09:47.524
And much of the conversation is,

00:09:48.292 --> 00:09:49.481
can we build it?

00:09:50.383 --> 00:09:53.518
Can we build an intelligent computer?

00:09:53.542 --> 00:09:56.305
Can we build a creative computer?

00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:58.442
What we seem to be asking over and over

00:09:58.466 --> 00:10:01.190
is can we build a human-like computer?
