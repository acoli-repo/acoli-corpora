00:02:59.925 --> 00:03:02.781
then the computer can be said
to have intelligence.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.565
So in 2013, my friend
Benjamin Laird and I,

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:09.577
we created a Turing test
for poetry online.

00:03:09.601 --> 00:03:10.878
It's called bot or not,

00:03:10.902 --> 00:03:12.946
and you can go and play it for yourselves.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.221
But basically, it's the game
we just played.

00:03:15.245 --> 00:03:16.773
You're presented with a poem,

00:03:16.797 --> 00:03:19.825
you don't know whether it was written
by a human or a computer

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.015
and you have to guess.

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:24.230
So thousands and thousands
of people have taken this test online,

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:25.703
so we have results.

00:03:25.727 --> 00:03:27.155
And what are the results?

00:03:27.704 --> 00:03:30.583
Well, Turing said that if a computer
could fool a human
