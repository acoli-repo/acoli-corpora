00:09:58.466 --> 00:10:01.190
is can we build a human-like computer?

00:10:01.961 --> 00:10:03.517
But what we've seen just now

00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:06.629
is that the human
is not a scientific fact,

00:10:06.653 --> 00:10:10.183
that it's an ever-shifting,
concatenating idea

00:10:10.207 --> 00:10:12.738
and one that changes over time.

00:10:12.762 --> 00:10:15.914
So that when we begin
to grapple with the ideas

00:10:15.938 --> 00:10:18.324
of artificial intelligence in the future,

00:10:18.348 --> 00:10:20.253
we shouldn't only be asking ourselves,

00:10:20.277 --> 00:10:21.645
"Can we build it?"

00:10:21.669 --> 00:10:23.563
But we should also be asking ourselves,

00:10:23.587 --> 00:10:27.300
"What idea of the human
do we want to have reflected back to us?"

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.513
This is an essentially philosophical idea,
