00:00:59.513 --> 00:01:03.609
Hands up if you think Poem 1
was written by a human.

00:01:05.547 --> 00:01:07.037
OK, most of you.

00:01:07.061 --> 00:01:10.084
Hands up if you think Poem 2
was written by a human.

00:01:11.172 --> 00:01:12.362
Very brave of you,

00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:17.140
because the first one was written
by the human poet William Blake.

00:01:17.784 --> 00:01:20.733
The second one was written by an algorithm

00:01:20.757 --> 00:01:24.449
that took all the language
from my Facebook feed on one day

00:01:24.473 --> 00:01:27.236
and then regenerated it algorithmically,

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.850
according to methods that I'll describe
a little bit later on.
