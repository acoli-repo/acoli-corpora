00:00:28.188 --> 00:00:30.633
So we're going to have to try
a different approach.

00:00:30.657 --> 00:00:32.800
So up here, we have two poems.

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:36.115
One of them is written by a human,

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:38.241
and the other one's written by a computer.

00:00:38.754 --> 00:00:41.164
I'm going to ask you to tell me
which one's which.

00:00:41.858 --> 00:00:43.014
Have a go:

00:00:43.038 --> 00:00:47.094
Poem 1: Little Fly / Thy summer's play, /
My thoughtless hand / Has brush'd away.

00:00:47.118 --> 00:00:50.512
Am I not / A fly like thee? /
Or art not thou / A man like me?

00:00:50.536 --> 00:00:53.835
Poem 2: We can feel / Activist
through your life's / morning /

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.106
Pauses to see, pope I hate the / Non
all the night to start a / great otherwise (...)

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.489
Alright, time's up.

00:00:59.513 --> 00:01:03.609
Hands up if you think Poem 1
was written by a human.
