00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.767
who happens to be
one of my favorite human poets.

00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:35.689
(Laughter)

00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:39.274
So what we've just done now
is a Turing test for poetry.

00:02:40.018 --> 00:02:44.565
The Turing test was first proposed
by this guy, Alan Turing, in 1950,

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:46.153
in order to answer the question,

00:02:46.177 --> 00:02:47.814
can computers think?

00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:51.015
Alan Turing believed that if
a computer was able

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:54.117
to have a to have a text-based
conversation with a human,

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:56.911
with such proficiency
such that the human couldn't tell

00:02:56.935 --> 00:02:59.901
whether they are talking
to a computer or a human,

00:02:59.925 --> 00:03:02.781
then the computer can be said
to have intelligence.
