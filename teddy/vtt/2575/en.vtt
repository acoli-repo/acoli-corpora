00:00:00.881 --> 00:00:02.111
I have a question.

00:00:03.422 --> 00:00:05.365
Can a computer write poetry?

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:09.036
This is a provocative question.

00:00:09.715 --> 00:00:11.433
You think about it for a minute,

00:00:11.457 --> 00:00:14.047
and you suddenly have a bunch
of other questions like:

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.150
What is a computer?

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.285
What is poetry?

00:00:18.707 --> 00:00:20.396
What is creativity?

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.822
But these are questions

00:00:22.846 --> 00:00:25.916
that people spend their entire
lifetime trying to answer,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.164
not in a single TED Talk.

00:00:28.188 --> 00:00:30.633
So we're going to have to try
a different approach.
