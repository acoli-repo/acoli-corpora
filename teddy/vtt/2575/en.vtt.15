So that when we ask,
"Can a computer write poetry?"

00:07:31.936 --> 00:07:33.129
we're also asking,

00:07:33.153 --> 00:07:34.951
"What does it mean to be human

00:07:34.975 --> 00:07:38.147
and how do we put boundaries
around this category?

00:07:38.171 --> 00:07:41.829
How do we say who or what
can be part of this category?"

00:07:42.376 --> 00:07:45.727
This is an essentially
philosophical question, I believe,

00:07:45.751 --> 00:07:47.980
and it can't be answered
with a yes or no test,

00:07:48.004 --> 00:07:49.331
like the Turing test.

00:07:49.805 --> 00:07:52.850
I also believe that Alan Turing
understood this,

00:07:52.874 --> 00:07:56.179
and that when he devised
his test back in 1950,

00:07:56.203 --> 00:07:59.005
he was doing it
as a philosophical provocation.
