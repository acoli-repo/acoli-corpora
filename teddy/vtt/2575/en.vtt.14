Do we take that William Blake
is somehow more of a human

00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:04.041
than Gertrude Stein?

00:07:04.065 --> 00:07:07.111
Or that Gertrude Stein is more
of a computer than William Blake?

00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:08.687
(Laughter)

00:07:08.711 --> 00:07:11.034
These are questions
I've been asking myself

00:07:11.058 --> 00:07:12.523
for around two years now,

00:07:12.547 --> 00:07:14.856
and I don't have any answers.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.210
But what I do have are a bunch of insights

00:07:17.234 --> 00:07:19.768
about our relationship with technology.

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:24.608
So my first insight is that,
for some reason,

00:07:24.632 --> 00:07:27.743
we associate poetry with being human.

00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:31.912
So that when we ask,
"Can a computer write poetry?"
