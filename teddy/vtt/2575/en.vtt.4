Alright, time's up.

00:02:00.204 --> 00:02:03.341
So if you think the first poem
was written by a human,

00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:04.580
put your hand up.

00:02:05.687 --> 00:02:06.841
OK.

00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:09.540
And if you think the second poem
was written by a human,

00:02:09.564 --> 00:02:10.719
put your hand up.

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:15.589
We have, more or less, a 50/50 split here.

00:02:16.157 --> 00:02:17.593
It was much harder.

00:02:17.617 --> 00:02:19.329
The answer is,

00:02:19.353 --> 00:02:22.836
the first poem was generated
by an algorithm called Racter,

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.862
that was created back in the 1970s,

00:02:25.886 --> 00:02:29.075
and the second poem was written
by a guy called Frank O'Hara,

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.767
who happens to be
one of my favorite human poets.
