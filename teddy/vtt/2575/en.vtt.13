00:06:27.176 --> 00:06:31.317
Therefore, according to the logic
of the reverse Turing test,

00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:33.257
Gertrude Stein is a computer.

00:06:33.281 --> 00:06:34.743
(Laughter)

00:06:35.358 --> 00:06:36.652
Feeling confused?

00:06:37.193 --> 00:06:38.708
I think that's fair enough.

00:06:39.546 --> 00:06:43.662
So far we've had humans
that write like humans,

00:06:43.686 --> 00:06:46.797
we have computers that write
like computers,

00:06:46.821 --> 00:06:49.876
we have computers that write like humans,

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.532
but we also have,
perhaps most confusingly,

00:06:53.556 --> 00:06:55.931
humans that write like computers.

00:06:56.938 --> 00:06:58.704
So what do we take from all of this?

00:06:59.611 --> 00:07:02.768
Do we take that William Blake
is somehow more of a human
