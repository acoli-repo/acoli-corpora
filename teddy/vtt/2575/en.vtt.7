Well, Turing said that if a computer
could fool a human

00:03:30.607 --> 00:03:33.626
30 percent of the time
that it was a human,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.047
then it passes the Turing test
for intelligence.

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:39.063
We have poems on the bot or not database

00:03:39.087 --> 00:03:42.066
that have fooled 65 percent
of human readers into thinking

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.485
it was written by a human.

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.776
So, I think we have an answer
to our question.

00:03:47.546 --> 00:03:49.894
According to the logic of the Turing test,

00:03:49.918 --> 00:03:51.846
can a computer write poetry?

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.221
Well, yes, absolutely it can.

00:03:55.782 --> 00:03:58.128
But if you're feeling
a little bit uncomfortable

00:03:58.152 --> 00:04:00.079
with this answer, that's OK.
