00:05:59.046 --> 00:06:00.698
It's just raw material.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.077
And nevertheless, it's able
to create a poem

00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:07.428
that seems more human
than Gertrude Stein's poem,

00:06:07.452 --> 00:06:09.605
and Gertrude Stein is a human.

00:06:10.846 --> 00:06:14.918
So what we've done here is,
more or less, a reverse Turing test.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.119
So Gertrude Stein, who's a human,
is able to write a poem

00:06:21.143 --> 00:06:24.881
that fools a majority
of human judges into thinking

00:06:24.905 --> 00:06:26.731
that it was written by a computer.

00:06:27.176 --> 00:06:31.317
Therefore, according to the logic
of the reverse Turing test,
