00:06:57.489 --> 00:07:00.036
that have been coming to the USA
from Southeast Asia:

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:04.254
the Hmong, who started coming
in the mid-1970s

00:07:04.278 --> 00:07:09.778
as refugees from the Vietnam War
and the US secret war in Laos;

00:07:09.802 --> 00:07:14.714
and the Karen, who have been coming
more recently as refugees from Myanmar.

00:07:14.738 --> 00:07:16.516
So we've been working for a few years

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.081
with these local
communities and clinicians

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:24.522
to study what happens
to the Hmong and Karen microbiomes

00:07:24.546 --> 00:07:31.542
when people move from refugee camps
and villages in Thailand to the USA.
