00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:30.031
The top left are these
highly endangered monkeys

00:04:30.055 --> 00:04:33.028
called the red-shanked douc in Vietnam.

00:04:33.052 --> 00:04:36.683
And at the bottom left
are monkeys from Costa Rica.

00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:40.925
So you can see that they have
totally different microbiomes in the wild.

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:46.346
And then the same two species
of monkey in the zoo are converging,

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.252
so their microbiomes change

00:04:48.276 --> 00:04:51.496
and they become
much more similar to each other,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.193
even though these are zoos
on different continents,

00:04:54.217 --> 00:04:57.559
different geographical regions,
and they're eating different diets.

00:04:57.583 --> 00:05:00.744
Now, we did study
some other species of primate.
