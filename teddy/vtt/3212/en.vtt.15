00:07:24.546 --> 00:07:31.542
when people move from refugee camps
and villages in Thailand to the USA.

00:07:32.314 --> 00:07:33.878
And what we found

00:07:33.902 --> 00:07:39.613
is that when people
come to the USA from these groups,

00:07:39.637 --> 00:07:43.033
they lose a large fraction
of their microbiome,

00:07:44.343 --> 00:07:46.120
somewhere around 20 percent,

00:07:46.144 --> 00:07:50.413
and those who come to the USA
and become obese

00:07:50.437 --> 00:07:52.390
lose about a third of their microbes.

00:07:54.905 --> 00:07:56.857
So we know that moving to the USA

00:07:56.881 --> 00:08:00.874
is sufficient to cause
a dramatic change in your microbiome,
