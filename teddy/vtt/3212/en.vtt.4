Do they lose some?
Does it get better or worse?

00:02:01.527 --> 00:02:05.041
We tracked two different
species in the jungle,

00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:08.675
one in Vietnam, one in Costa Rica,

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.580
and then we sequenced
the DNA from their stool.

00:02:11.604 --> 00:02:15.145
This is how we study the microbiome
in my research lab.

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:19.281
And what we found in the DNA
is that in the wild,

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:23.266
these two species had
totally different sets of microbes.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.902
It was like a fingerprint for the species.

00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:31.091
But in the zoo, they had lost
most of that diversity
