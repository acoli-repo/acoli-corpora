00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:31.223
Those are the two that dominate
the modern human gut.

00:00:31.247 --> 00:00:36.096
There are about a hundred trillion
microbes living inside you.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.361
We call this your microbiome,

00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:42.629

living inside you --

00:00:42.653 --> 00:00:44.527
actually more like a universe.

00:00:44.896 --> 00:00:48.350
A hundred trillion means
if you took a blade of grass

00:00:48.374 --> 00:00:51.499
and planted it for every microbe
living in your gut,

00:00:51.523 --> 00:00:53.877
that could fill a million football fields.

00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:55.647
So it's incredibly complex.

00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:57.487
But interestingly,

00:00:57.511 --> 00:01:01.944
as our bodies have been adapting
to life in modern society,
