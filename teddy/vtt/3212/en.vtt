If I asked you to name a microbe
that's living in your gut,

00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:09.676
many of you would probably say E. coli.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.465
A lot of people say this.
It's the best-known of the gut microbes.

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:17.994
But it turns out that E. coli
is outnumbered in your gut

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.111
about a thousand to one

00:00:20.135 --> 00:00:23.126
by other species, many of which
you probably haven't heard of.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.731
These are Bacteroides;
Prevotella is another example.

00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:31.223
Those are the two that dominate
the modern human gut.
