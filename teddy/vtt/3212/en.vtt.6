That's more like the microbiome
in a captive primate.

00:03:03.955 --> 00:03:05.192
Now, in the meantime,

00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:07.843
many of the animals in the zoo
are not doing so well.

00:03:07.867 --> 00:03:10.773
They have issues with obesity,

00:03:10.797 --> 00:03:12.133
wasting,

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:15.206
gastroenteritis, diarrhea, bloating,

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.039
and some of them were barely
holding onto their lives.

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:22.661
Now, of course, we were
very interested to find out

00:03:22.685 --> 00:03:27.039
what are these so-called invasive species
that are taking over in the zoo.

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:30.788
So we went back to the DNA,
and what the DNA told us
