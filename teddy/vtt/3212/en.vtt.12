00:05:57.393 --> 00:06:02.321
when I got the news
that four of the red-shanked doucs

00:06:02.345 --> 00:06:05.449
had died in the zoo of gut-related issues.

00:06:05.473 --> 00:06:07.441
So for some of these animals,

00:06:07.465 --> 00:06:10.163
having the right microbes
living inside them

00:06:10.187 --> 00:06:12.157
may be a matter of survival.

00:06:12.181 --> 00:06:15.688
Now this brings us
to the human part of the story.

00:06:15.712 --> 00:06:18.927
Obviously, the microbiomes in the USA

00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:24.452
aren't causing premature death
as frequently as in the zoo,

00:06:24.476 --> 00:06:28.850
but we have major risk
of obesity, diabetes,

00:06:28.874 --> 00:06:30.771
a number of these other diseases.
