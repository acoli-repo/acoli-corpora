00:03:58.367 --> 00:04:02.437
And what you're seeing here
is a distance plot

00:04:02.461 --> 00:04:07.366
where every point
is a different animal's microbiome.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.183
So every point represents
a whole zoo of microbes.

00:04:11.207 --> 00:04:15.063
And the microbiomes
that have a lot of microbes in common

00:04:15.087 --> 00:04:16.500
are close to each other.

00:04:16.524 --> 00:04:18.972
The ones that are very different
are farther apart.

00:04:18.996 --> 00:04:20.513
So this is showing you

00:04:20.537 --> 00:04:26.235
that the two groups of wild monkeys
are over on the left.

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:30.031
The top left are these
highly endangered monkeys
