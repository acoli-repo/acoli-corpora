00:01:29.853 --> 00:01:34.100
and many others related to metabolism
and autoimmunity

00:01:34.124 --> 00:01:39.243
are linked to a loss
of healthy diversity in the gut.

00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:42.272
My lab got our first indication of this

00:01:42.296 --> 00:01:46.066
when actually we were studying
non-human primates.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.221
We wanted to find out what happens
to a monkey's microbiome

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:55.284
when they move from the jungle to a zoo.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:58.738
Does their microbiome change?
Do they pick up new bugs?

00:01:58.762 --> 00:02:01.503
Do they lose some?
Does it get better or worse?
