WEBVTT

00:08:57.763 --> 00:09:02.351
is collecting and preserving microbes
from healthy people around the world

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:07.930
so that they can be kept
as cultural assets for those groups

00:09:07.954 --> 00:09:12.795
to potentially protect them
as they adapt to modern society,

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:15.273
and to protect future generations

00:09:15.297 --> 00:09:19.496
who are currently growing up
to have increased risk of these diseases

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.008
with every generation.

00:09:21.714 --> 00:09:24.316
I'm looking forward to a future

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:31.062
where we have the tools that we need
to restore and replenish our microbiomes,
