00:07:56.881 --> 00:08:00.874
is sufficient to cause
a dramatic change in your microbiome,

00:08:00.898 --> 00:08:02.667
probably not for the better.

00:08:03.571 --> 00:08:08.429
Are these microbes
actually causing the obesity,

00:08:08.453 --> 00:08:11.913
or is the obesity causing
a change in the microbes?

00:08:11.937 --> 00:08:14.080
This is something
that we're following up on,

00:08:14.104 --> 00:08:17.746
and the evidence we have now in my lab

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.880
combined with evidence
from a number of labs around the world

00:08:20.904 --> 00:08:23.976
tells us that certain changes
in the microbiome

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.509
do lead to obesity,

00:08:26.533 --> 00:08:29.984
and a number of other modern,
kind of Westernized diseases.
