The good news is that
your microbiome can actually change.

00:08:36.686 --> 00:08:39.209
Unlike your own genome,

00:08:39.233 --> 00:08:41.582
it's a living, breathing thing,

00:08:41.606 --> 00:08:45.137
and there's a broad front
of research happening right now

00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:48.955
to better understand
how we can restore our microbiomes

00:08:48.979 --> 00:08:50.582
when something goes wrong,

00:08:50.606 --> 00:08:52.233
using diet,

00:08:52.257 --> 00:08:54.915
using live microbes.

00:08:54.939 --> 00:08:57.739
And in fact, one of the next steps for us

00:08:57.763 --> 00:09:02.351
is collecting and preserving microbes
from healthy people around the world
