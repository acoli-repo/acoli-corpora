00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:31.091
But in the zoo, they had lost
most of that diversity

00:02:31.115 --> 00:02:33.646
and had acquired
some other set of microbes.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.727
So this was very curious.

00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:39.760
We've got these two different microbiomes.

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:43.942
In the wild, picture a lush
tropical rainforest

00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:46.435
living the guts of these monkeys.

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.999
That's the kind of diversity
that we're talking about.

00:02:49.023 --> 00:02:51.649
Then in the zoo, they've lost diversity.

00:02:52.298 --> 00:02:55.870
Picture a rainforest
that's been burned to the ground

00:02:55.894 --> 00:02:58.234
and taken over by a few invasive species.

00:02:59.105 --> 00:03:02.906
That's more like the microbiome
in a captive primate.
