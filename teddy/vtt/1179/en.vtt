00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:03.230
I'd like to do pretty much
what I did the first time,

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:06.374
which is to choose a lighthearted theme.

00:00:06.398 --> 00:00:08.728
Last time, I talked about death and dying.

00:00:08.752 --> 00:00:09.754
(Laughter)

00:00:09.778 --> 00:00:12.201
This time, I'm going to talk
about mental illness.

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:13.829
(Laughter)

00:00:13.853 --> 00:00:15.563
But it has to be technological,

00:00:15.587 --> 00:00:17.969
so I'll talk about electroshock therapy.

00:00:17.993 --> 00:00:20.132
(Laughter)

00:00:20.156 --> 00:00:23.792
You know, ever since man had any notion

00:00:23.816 --> 00:00:27.864
that some of his other people,
his colleagues,

00:00:27.888 --> 00:00:31.419
could be different, could be strange,
could be severely depressed
