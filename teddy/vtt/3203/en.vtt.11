00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.816
I'm not going to go into the reasons
for these tragedies,

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.176
but they are part of the reason

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.576
why technological change
happens quite slowly.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.960
Nobody wants this to happen.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.240
Clients don't want this to happen
on their projects, obviously.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.096
And yet of course they want innovation.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.056
Innovation is vital.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.056
As an engineer, it's part of my DNA.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.896
It's in my blood.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.656
I couldn't be a very good engineer
if I wasn't wanting to innovate,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.616
but we have to do so from a position
of knowledge and strength

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.880
and understanding.
