00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.536
Right now if we use the high-strength
steel wire available to us,

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.016
we can span, practically speaking,
around about five or six kilometers

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.280
if we really push it.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.536
But if we could use
carbon fiber in those cables,

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.440
we could go more than 10 kilometers.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.800
That's pretty spectacular.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.896
But of course superspans is not
necessarily the way to go everywhere.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.136
They're very expensive

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.303
and they've got all sorts
of other challenges associated with them,

00:09:27.327 --> 00:09:28.776
and we tend to build multispan

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.280
when we're crossing
a wide estuary or a sea crossing.
