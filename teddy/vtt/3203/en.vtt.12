00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.936
It's no good taking a leap in the dark,

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.416
and civilization has learned from mistakes
since the beginning of time --

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.880
no one more so than engineers.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.176
Some of you may have seen
this film before --

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.776
this is the very famous
Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.720
in Tacoma, Washington state,

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.400
1940.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.336
The bridge became known
as "Galloping Gertie"

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.616
because she -- she?

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.416
Is a bridge female? I don't know.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.736
She was wobbling like this
for quite a long time,

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.720
and notice this twisting motion.
