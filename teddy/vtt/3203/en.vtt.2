education, medical care,
access to markets ...

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.136
which is why wonderful organizations
like Bridges to Prosperity

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.216
build bridges in this kind of place --
this is in Rwanda.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.616
And they make such a difference,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.776
not only to those lives
immediately around the bridge,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.766
but the impact of these bridges is huge,

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.256
and it spreads over the whole community,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.520
far, far away.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.216
Of course bridges have been around
for an awfully long time.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.176
The oldest ones are stone
because it's a very durable material.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.456
I don't know about you --
