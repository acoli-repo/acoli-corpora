00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.110
and you can get this fantastic
sculptural quality.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.880
Who said concrete bridges are dull?

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.816
We could talk about all sorts
of other new technologies and things

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.056
which are going on,

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.296
robots and 3-D printing
and AI and all of that,

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.654
but I want to take you back to something
which I alluded to earlier on.

00:11:47.518 --> 00:11:49.376
Our bridges need to be functional, yes.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.096
They need to be safe -- absolutely.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.040
They need to be serviceable and durable.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.296
But I passionately believe
they need to be elegant;

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.559
they need to be beautiful.
