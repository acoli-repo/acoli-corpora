00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.576
Think of the stunning Millau Viaduct
in the South of France.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.136
French engineer Michel Virlogeux
and British architect Lord Foster

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.216
collaborated together to produce something

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.936
which is a really spectacular
synergy of architecture and engineering.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.456
Or Robert Maillart's Salginatobel Bridge
in the mountains in Switzerland --

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.760
absolutely sublime.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.096
Or more recently,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.176
Laurent Ney's beautiful
and rather delicate bridge

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.040
for Tintagel Castle in the UK.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.736
These are spectacular
and beautiful designs

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.320
and we need to see more of this.
