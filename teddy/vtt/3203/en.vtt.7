Bridges can be considered
in three convenient categories,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.296
depending on the nature
of the structural system

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.216
that they adopt
as their principal support.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.376
So, bending, of course,
is the way a beam will behave --

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.120
so, beams and bending.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.000
Or compression is the principal
way of operating for an arch.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.376
Or for the really long spans
you need to go lightweight,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.736
as we'll see in a minute,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.416
and you'll use tension, cables --

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.896
suspension bridges.
