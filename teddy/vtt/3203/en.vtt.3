00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.456
I don't know about you --

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.696
I love to look at
the development of technology

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.056
to learn about what people did
with the materials

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.360
and tools available to them at the time.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.016
So the Pont Du Gard in the center
is a wonderful example --

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.376
Roman aqueduct in the South of France --

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.976
fantastic piece of technology
built using massive stones put together,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.376
dry -- there's no mortar in those joints.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.336
They're just dry stone joints --

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.576
fantastic

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.160
and almost as good as new today.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.976
Or sometimes up in the mountains,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.856
people would build
these suspension bridges,
