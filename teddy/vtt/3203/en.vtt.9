00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.240
the changes seem positively glacial.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.600
And the reason for this
can be summarized in one word:

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.240
risk.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.696
Structural engineers like me manage risk.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.696
We are responsible for structural safety.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.936
That's what we do.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.816
And when we design bridges like these,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.736
I have to balance the probability
that loads will be excessive on one side

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.896
or the strength will be
too low on the other side.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.696
Both of which, incidentally,
are full of uncertainty usually,

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.466
and so it's a probabilistic problem,

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.696
and we have to make sure
