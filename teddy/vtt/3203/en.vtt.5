In Mostar the bridge was synonymous
with the name of the place,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.936
and to such an extent
that in the war in 1993

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.416
when the bridge was destroyed,

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.760
the town all but lost its identity
until the bridge was reconstructed.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.576
And bridges are enormous
features in our landscape --

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.976
not just enormous,
sometimes there's small ones --

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.696
and they are really significant features,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.600
and I believe we have a duty
to make our bridges beautiful.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.656
Thankfully, many people do.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.576
Think of the stunning Millau Viaduct
in the South of France.
