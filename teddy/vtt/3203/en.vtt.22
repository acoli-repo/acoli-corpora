Now, what about concrete?

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.480
Concrete gets a pretty bad name sometimes,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.696
but in the hands of people
like Rudy Ricciotti here,

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.120
look what you can do with it.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.856
This is what we call ultra-high
performance fiber-reinforced concrete.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.120
It's a bit of a mouthful.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.576
Us engineers love those kinds of words.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.856
(Laughter)

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.256
But what you do with this --

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.736
this is really superstrong,
and it's really durable,

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.110
and you can get this fantastic
sculptural quality.
