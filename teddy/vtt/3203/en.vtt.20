00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.816
This is a multispan suspension bridge
across very deep water in Norway,

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.760
and we're working on this at the moment.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.216
The deep water means that foundations
are prohibitively expensive.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.480
So this bridge floats.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.496
This is a floating,
multispan suspension bridge.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.200
We've had floating bridges before,
but nothing like this.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.616
It stands on floating pontoons

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.976
which are tethered to the seabed
and held down --

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.096
so, pulled down
against those buoyancy forces,

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.696
and in order to make it stable,

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.416
the tops of the towers
have to be tied together,

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.216
otherwise the whole thing
would just wobble around
