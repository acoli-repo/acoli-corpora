00:06:59.417 --> 00:07:02.737
this sort of oversafe response
to what had happened.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.280
But when it did occur in the mid-60s,

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.936
there was indeed a step change --

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.816
an innovation,
a technological step change.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.560
This is the Severn Bridge in the UK.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.616
Notice the aerodynamically
streamlined cross section

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:18.856
in the center there.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.616
It's also a box which makes it
very torsionally stiff --

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.496
that twisting motion which we saw
at Tacoma would not happen here.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.136
And it's also really lightweight,

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.576
and as we'll see in a moment,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.416
lightweight is really
important for long spans,
