00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.856
people would build
these suspension bridges,

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.656
often across some dizzy canyon,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.896
using a vine.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.456
In this case, this is in Peru.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.816
This is using grass which grows locally

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.056
and is woven into ropes
to build these bridges.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.240
And do you know
they rebuild this every year?

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.600
Because of course grass
is not a durable material.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.720
So this bridge is unchanged
since Inca times.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.240
And bridges can be
symbols of their location.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.856
Of course, Golden Gate
and Sydney are well familiar.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.416
In Mostar the bridge was synonymous
with the name of the place,
