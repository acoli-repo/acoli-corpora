00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.416
lightweight is really
important for long spans,

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.016
and everybody seems
to want us to build longer spans.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.896
The longest at the moment is in Japan.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.816
It's just under 2,000 meters -- one span.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.096
Just under two kilometers.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.456
The Akashi Kaikyō Bridge.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.446
We're currently working on one in Turkey
which is a bit longer,

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.656
and we've designed
the Messina Bridge in Italy,

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.656
which is just waiting to get started
with construction one day,

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.896
who knows when.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.096
(Laughter)

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.776
I'm going to come back
to Messina in a moment.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.896
But the other kind of long-span bridge
which uses that tension principle
