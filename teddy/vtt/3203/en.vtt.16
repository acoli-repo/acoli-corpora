00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.896
But the other kind of long-span bridge
which uses that tension principle

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.256
is the cable-stayed bridge,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.856
and we see a lot of these.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.536
In fact, in China they're building
a whole load of these right now.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.456
The longest of these is the Russky Bridge
in Vladivostok, Russia --

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.256
just over 1,100 meters.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.776
But let me take you back to this question
about long-span and lightweight.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.856
This is using Messina Bridge
as an example.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.336
The pie chart in the center represents
the capacity of the main cables --

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.016
that's what holds the bridge up --

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.600
the capacity of the main cables.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.296
And notice that 78 percent
of that capacity
