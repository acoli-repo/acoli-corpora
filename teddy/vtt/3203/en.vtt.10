00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.696
and we have to make sure

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.056
that there's an adequate margin
for safety between the two, of course.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.136
There's no such thing, I have to tell you,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.416
as absolute safety.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.816
Contrary to popular belief,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.360
zero risk doesn't exist.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.776
Engineers have to do their calculations
and get their sums right

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.856
to make sure that those margins are there,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.536
and society expects them to do so,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.800
which is why it's all the more alarming
when things like this happen.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.816
I'm not going to go into the reasons
for these tragedies,
