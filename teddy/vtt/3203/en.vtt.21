00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.216
otherwise the whole thing
would just wobble around

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.936
and nobody will want to go on that.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.576
But I'm really excited about this

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.176
because if you think
about the places around the world

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.456
where the water is so deep

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.736
that nobody has given a second thought
to the possibility of a bridge

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.056
or any kind of crossing,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.920
this now opens up that possibility.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.640
So this one's being done
by the Norwegian Roads Administration,

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.056
but I'm really excited to know

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.576
where else will this technology
enable development --

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.616
that growing together,

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.960
that building of community.
