00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The fragrance that you will smell, you will never be able to smell this way again.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It’s a fragrance called Beyond Paradise,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which you can find in any store in the nation.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Except here it’s been split up in parts by Estée Lauder

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and by the perfumer who did it, Calice Becker,


00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I'm most grateful to them for this.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And it’s been split up in successive bits and a chord.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So what you’re smelling now is the top note.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And then will come what they call the heart, the lush heart note.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I will show it to you.
