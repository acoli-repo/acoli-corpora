00:08:28.031 --> 00:08:30.105
Working with the Oakland Police Department

00:08:30.129 --> 00:08:31.546
in California,

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:35.426
I and a number of my colleagues
were able to help the department

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.121
to reduce the number of stops they made

00:08:38.145 --> 00:08:41.745
of people who were not
committing any serious crimes.

00:08:41.769 --> 00:08:44.134
And we did this by pushing officers

00:08:44.158 --> 00:08:48.601
to ask themselves a question
before each and every stop they made:

00:08:49.451 --> 00:08:52.466
"Is this stop intelligence-led,

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.941
yes or no?"

00:08:55.353 --> 00:08:56.749
In other words,

00:08:57.621 --> 00:09:02.105
do I have prior information
to tie this particular person
