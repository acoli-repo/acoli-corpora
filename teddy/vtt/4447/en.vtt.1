00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.949
nothing at all.

00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:33.797
And so then I start
looking around on the plane,

00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:39.706
and I notice this man was
the only black guy on the plane.

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.286
And I thought,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.504
"Alright.

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:46.894
I'm going to have to have
a little talk with my son

00:00:46.918 --> 00:00:49.847
about how not all
black people look alike."

00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:54.248
My son, he lifts his head up,
and he says to me,

00:00:56.246 --> 00:00:58.617
"I hope he doesn't rob the plane."

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.874
And I said, "What? What did you say?"
