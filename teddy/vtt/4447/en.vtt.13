00:06:27.117 --> 00:06:31.062
But what we don't want to do
is create an easy-to-use system

00:06:31.086 --> 00:06:35.249
that can amplify bias
and deepen racial disparities,

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.395
rather than dismantling them.

00:06:38.863 --> 00:06:42.292
So the cofounder of Nextdoor
reached out to me and to others

00:06:42.316 --> 00:06:44.447
to try to figure out what to do.

00:06:44.471 --> 00:06:48.417
And they realized that
to curb racial profiling on the platform,

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:50.363
they were going to have to add friction;

00:06:50.387 --> 00:06:53.045
that is, they were going
to have to slow people down.

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:55.264
So Nextdoor had a choice to make,

00:06:55.288 --> 00:06:57.766
and against every impulse,

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.906
they decided to add friction.
