and arresting

00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:07.610
leads their eyes to settle
on black faces, too.

00:03:07.634 --> 00:03:12.700
Bias can infect every aspect
of our criminal justice system.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.031
In a large data set
of death-eligible defendants,

00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:20.412
we found that looking more black
more than doubled their chances

00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:22.493
of receiving a death sentence --

00:03:23.494 --> 00:03:25.921
at least when their victims were white.

00:03:25.945 --> 00:03:27.383
This effect is significant,

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:30.708
even though we controlled
for the severity of the crime
