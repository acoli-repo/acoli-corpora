00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:00.970
than a white student

00:04:00.994 --> 00:04:03.570
for the same repeated infractions.

00:04:03.594 --> 00:04:04.888
In a recent study,

00:04:04.912 --> 00:04:09.270
we're finding that teachers
treat black students as a group

00:04:09.294 --> 00:04:11.725
but white students as individuals.

00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:15.725
If, for example,
one black student misbehaves

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:20.534
and then a different black student
misbehaves a few days later,

00:04:20.558 --> 00:04:23.786
the teacher responds
to that second black student

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.435
as if he had misbehaved twice.

00:04:26.952 --> 00:04:29.763
It's as though the sins of one child

00:04:29.787 --> 00:04:31.963
get piled onto the other.
