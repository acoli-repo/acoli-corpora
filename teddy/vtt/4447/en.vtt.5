When my research team
brought people into our lab

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:33.312
and exposed them to faces,

00:02:33.336 --> 00:02:40.336
we found that exposure to black faces
led them to see blurry images of guns

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.616
with greater clarity and speed.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.994
Bias cannot only control what we see,

00:02:47.018 --> 00:02:48.666
but where we look.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.134
We found that prompting people
to think of violent crime

00:02:52.158 --> 00:02:56.454
can lead them to direct their eyes
onto a black face

00:02:56.478 --> 00:02:58.608
and away from a white face.

00:02:58.632 --> 00:03:02.474
Prompting police officers
to think of capturing and shooting
