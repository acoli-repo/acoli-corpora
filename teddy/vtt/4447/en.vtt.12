00:06:08.423 --> 00:06:12.472
and see a black man
in their otherwise white neighborhood

00:06:12.496 --> 00:06:17.211
and make the snap judgment
that he was up to no good,

00:06:17.235 --> 00:06:20.586
even when there was no evidence
of criminal wrongdoing.

00:06:23.568 --> 00:06:26.682
is a reflection of how

00:06:27.117 --> 00:06:31.062
But what we don't want to do
is create an easy-to-use system
