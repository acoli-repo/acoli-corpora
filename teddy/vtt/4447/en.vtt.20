Another can come from improving
the quality of the stops

officers do make.

00:10:02.512 --> 00:10:05.108
And technology can help us here.

00:10:05.132 --> 00:10:07.547
We all know about George Floyd's death,

00:10:08.499 --> 00:10:13.271
because those who tried to come to his aid
held cell phone cameras

00:10:13.295 --> 00:10:18.726
to record that horrific, fatal
encounter with the police.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.781
But we have all sorts of technology
that we're not putting to good use.

00:10:23.805 --> 00:10:26.308
Police departments across the country

00:10:26.332 --> 00:10:29.885
are now required to wear body-worn cameras

00:10:29.909 --> 00:10:35.839
so we have recordings of not only
the most extreme and horrific encounters
