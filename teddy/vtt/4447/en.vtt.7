00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:30.708
even though we controlled
for the severity of the crime

00:03:30.732 --> 00:03:33.013
and the defendant's attractiveness.

00:03:33.037 --> 00:03:35.686
And no matter what we controlled for,

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.055
we found that black
people were punished

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.404
in proportion to the blackness
of their physical features:

00:03:43.428 --> 00:03:45.309
the more black,

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:47.086
the more death-worthy.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.319
Bias can also influence
how teachers discipline students.

00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:56.188
My colleagues and I have found
that teachers express a desire

00:03:56.212 --> 00:03:59.778
to discipline a black
middle school student more harshly

00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:00.970
than a white student
