00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:31.740
In that next year,
with the addition of this question,

00:09:31.764 --> 00:09:34.208
that fell to 19,000 stops.

00:09:34.232 --> 00:09:39.193
African-American stops alone
fell by 43 percent.

00:09:39.905 --> 00:09:44.343
And stopping fewer black people
did not make the city any more dangerous.

00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:47.101
In fact, the crime rate continued to fall,

00:09:47.125 --> 00:09:50.462
and the city became safer for everybody.

00:09:50.486 --> 00:09:55.841
So one solution can come from reducing
the number of unnecessary stops.

00:09:56.285 --> 00:10:00.555
Another can come from improving
the quality of the stops
