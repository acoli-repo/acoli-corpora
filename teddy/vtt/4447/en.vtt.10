00:04:58.083 --> 00:05:04.026
Yet, just as the categories we create
allow us to make quick decisions,

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.552
they also reinforce bias.

00:05:06.576 --> 00:05:09.968
So the very things that help us
to see the world

00:05:11.104 --> 00:05:13.084
also can blind us to it.

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.287
They render our choices effortless,

00:05:16.311 --> 00:05:17.680
friction-free.

00:05:18.956 --> 00:05:21.401
Yet they exact a heavy toll.

00:05:22.158 --> 00:05:23.569
So what can we do?

00:05:24.507 --> 00:05:26.998
We are all vulnerable to bias,

00:05:27.022 --> 00:05:29.702
but we don't act on bias all the time.

00:05:29.726 --> 00:05:33.370
There are certain conditions
that can bring bias alive
