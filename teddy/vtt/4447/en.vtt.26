and that put his own life at risk.

00:13:02.619 --> 00:13:06.402
We know that the brain is wired for bias,

00:13:06.426 --> 00:13:10.891
and one way to interrupt that bias
is to pause and to reflect

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:13.220
on the evidence of our assumptions.

00:13:13.244 --> 00:13:14.999
So we need to ask ourselves:

00:13:15.023 --> 00:13:19.688
What assumptions do we bring
when we step onto an elevator?

00:13:21.776 --> 00:13:23.087
Or an airplane?

00:13:23.532 --> 00:13:28.131
How do we make ourselves aware
of our own unconscious bias?

00:13:28.155 --> 00:13:30.506
Who do those assumptions keep safe?
