00:10:29.909 --> 00:10:35.839
so we have recordings of not only
the most extreme and horrific encounters

00:10:35.863 --> 00:10:38.617
but of everyday interactions.

00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:41.418
With an interdisciplinary
team at Stanford,

00:10:41.442 --> 00:10:44.129
we've begun to use
machine learning techniques

00:10:44.153 --> 00:10:47.520
to analyze large numbers of encounters.

00:10:47.544 --> 00:10:52.155
This is to better understand
what happens in routine traffic stops.

00:10:52.179 --> 00:10:54.334
What we found was that

00:10:54.358 --> 00:10:58.020
even when police officers
are behaving professionally,

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.322
they speak to black drivers
less respectfully than white drivers.
