00:00:00.182 --> 00:00:05.762
We've been told to go out on a limb
and say something surprising.

00:00:05.786 --> 00:00:06.976
So I'll try and do that,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.496
but I want to start with two things
that everyone already knows.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.781
And the first one, in fact,
is something that has been known

00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:20.058
for most of recorded history,

00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:24.859
and that is, that the planet Earth,
or the solar system,

00:00:24.883 --> 00:00:27.805
or our environment or whatever,

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:34.247
is uniquely suited
to sustain our evolution --
