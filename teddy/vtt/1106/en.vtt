00:00:00.746 --> 00:00:02.907
I've been intrigued by this question

00:00:02.931 --> 00:00:07.358
of whether we could evolve
or develop a sixth sense --

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:10.976
a sense that would give us seamless access

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.976
and easy access to meta-information
or information that may exist somewhere

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.976
that may be relevant to help us
make the right decision

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.840
about whatever it is
that we're coming across.

00:00:23.864 --> 00:00:25.976
And some of you may argue,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.262
"Well, don't today's cell phones
do that already?"

00:00:29.286 --> 00:00:30.976
But I would say no.
