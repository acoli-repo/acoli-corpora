This holiday season,

00:00:07.793 --> 00:00:10.722
people around the world will give
and receive presents.

00:00:10.722 --> 00:00:13.425
You might even get 
a knitted sweater from an aunt.

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:17.095
But what if instead of saying "thanks"
before consigning it to the closet,

00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:19.130
the polite response expected from you

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.663
was to show up to her house 
in a week with a better gift?

00:00:22.663 --> 00:00:25.690
Or to vote for her in the town election?

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.462
Or let her adopt your firstborn child?

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:30.922
All of these things might not 
sound so strange
