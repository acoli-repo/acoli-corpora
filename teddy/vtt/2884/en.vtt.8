00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.656
And while I was mulling this all over

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.880
over the drawing board,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.800
the phone rang.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.720
It was my friend Kate.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.256
She was like, "Hey,
have you heard about the farmers

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.560
who are composting whole cows?"

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.495
And I was like, "Mmmm."

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.279
(Laughter)

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.576
Turns out that farmers
in agricultural institutions

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.016
have been practicing something
called livestock mortality composting

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.576
for decades.
