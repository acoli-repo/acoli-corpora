By the way,

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.896
composting creates a great deal of heat,

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.280
especially this particular
type of composting.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:18.656
One week after we began
composting our fifth donor body,

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.816
the temperature inside
that mound of wood chips

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.920

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.136

to create energy

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.600
or comfort the grieving on a cold day.
