in a concrete-lined grave

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.400
in a cemetery.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.776
All told, in US cemeteries,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.560
we bury enough metal
to build a Golden Gate Bridge,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.016
enough wood to build
1,800 single family homes,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.816
and enough formaldehyde-laden
embalming fluid

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.880
to fill eight Olympic-size swimming pools.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.160
In addition, cemeteries
all over the world are reaching capacity.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.536
Turns out, it doesn't really
make good business sense
