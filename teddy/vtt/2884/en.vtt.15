00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.080
Imagine it,

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.816
part public park,

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.576
part funeral home,

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.296
part memorial to the people we love,

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.416
a place where we can reconnect
with the cycles of nature

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.240
and treat bodies
with gentleness and respect.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.576
The infrastructure is simple.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.216
Inside a vertical core,

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.336
bodies and wood chips undergo
accelerated natural decomposition,

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.656
or composting,

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.400
and are transformed into soil.
