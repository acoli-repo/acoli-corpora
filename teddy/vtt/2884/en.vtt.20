00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.816
that will contain technical specifications

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.560
and regulatory best practices.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.576
We want to help individuals,
organizations,

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.816
and down the road, municipalities

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.800
design and build facilities
in their own cities.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.016
The idea is that every one of these places
should look and feel completely different

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.936
with the same system inside.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.016
They're really meant to be designed
for the neighborhood in which they reside

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.960
and the community which they serve.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.696
The other idea is
for supportive staff to be on hand

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.280
to help families with the care
and preparation of loved ones' bodies.
