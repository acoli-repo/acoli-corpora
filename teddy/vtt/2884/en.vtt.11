00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.256
(Laughter)

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.720
So basically, all we humans need to do

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.440
is create the right environment
for nature to do its job.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.536
It's like the opposite
of antibacterial soap.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.816
Instead of fighting them,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.160
we welcome microbes and bacteria
in with open arms.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.576
These tiny, amazing creatures

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.616
break down molecules
into smaller molecules and atoms,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.960
which are then incorporated
into new molecules.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.520
In other words, that cow is transformed.
