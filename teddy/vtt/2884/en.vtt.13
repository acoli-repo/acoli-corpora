00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.736
Fast-forward five years

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.976
and the project has grown in ways
I truly never could have imagined.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.456
We've created a scalable,
replicable non-profit urban model

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.976
based on the science
of livestock mortality composting

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.480
that turns human beings into soil.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.936
We've partnered and collaborated
with experts in soil science,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.496
decomposition, alternative death care,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.920
law and architecture.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.061
We've raised funds
from foundations and individuals
