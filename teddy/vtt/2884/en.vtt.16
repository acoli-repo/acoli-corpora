00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.600
When someone dies, their body
is taken to a human composting facility.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.256
After wrapping the deceased
in a simple shroud,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.320
friends and family carry the body
to the top of the core,

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.040
which contains the natural
decomposition system.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.536
During a laying in ceremony,

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.936
they gently place the body into the core

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.341
and cover it with wood chips.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.320
This begins the gentle transformation
from human to soil.
