Who's thinking about
lemon meringue pie right now?

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.576
(Laughter)

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.800
A lemon drop?

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.920
Something stronger?

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.536
So in addition to housing the core,

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.256
these buildings will function
to support the grieving

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.880
by providing space for memorial services
and end-of-life planning.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.096
The potential for repurposing is huge.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.736
Old churches and industrial warehouses
can be converted into places

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.400
where we create soil and honor life.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.976
We want to bring back the aspect of ritual

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.776
that's been diluted
over the past hundred years
