All told, cremations in the US

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.416
emit a staggering 600 million
pounds of carbon dioxide

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.120
into the atmosphere annually.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.416
The truly awful truth

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.320
is that the very last thing
that most of us will do on this earth

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.240
is poison it.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.816
It's like we've created, accepted
and death-denied our way into a status quo

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.456
that puts as much distance
between ourselves and nature
