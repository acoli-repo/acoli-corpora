for decades.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.576
Mortality composting is where
you take an animal high in nitrogen

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.760
and cover it with co-composting materials
that are high in carbon.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.416
It's an aerobic process,
so it requires oxygen,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.760
and it requires
plenty of moisture as well.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.176
In the most basic setup, a cow
is covered with a few feet of wood chips,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.536
which are high in carbon,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.856
and left outside for nature,
for breezes to provide oxygen

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.640
and rain to provide moisture.
