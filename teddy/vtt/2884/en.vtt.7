In nature, death creates life.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.480
Back in architecture school,
I was thinking about all this,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.240
and I set out on a plan
to redesign death care.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.056
Could I create a system

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.936
that was beneficial to the earth

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.520
and that used nature as a guide
rather than something to be feared?

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.800
Something that was gentle to the planet?

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.096
That planet, after all,
supports our living bodies

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.840
our whole lives.
