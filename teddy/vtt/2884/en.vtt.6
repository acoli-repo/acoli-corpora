00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.456
that puts as much distance
between ourselves and nature

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.120
as is humanly possible.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.456
Our modern funerary practices
are designed to stave off

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.160
the natural processes
that happen to a body after death.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.920
In other words, they're meant
to prevent us from decomposing.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.136
But the truth

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.760
is that nature is really,
really good at death.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.816
We've all seen it.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.576
When organic material dies in nature,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.336
microbes and bacteria
break it down into nutrient-rich soil,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.920
completing the life cycle.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.160
In nature, death creates life.
