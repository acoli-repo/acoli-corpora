(Laughter)

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.760
Turns out, it's true.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.376
Since 2014, we've been
running a pilot project

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.256
in the hills of North Carolina

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.200
with the Forensic Anthropology Department
at Western Carolina University.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.576
Six donor bodies
have been covered in wood chips,

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.896
oxygen provided by breezes,

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.200
microbes and bacteria doing their jobs.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.936
This pilot program has allowed us
to demonstrate that it's possible

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.656
to harness the incredible power
of natural decomposition
