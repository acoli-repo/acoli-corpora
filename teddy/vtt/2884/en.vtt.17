Over the next few weeks,
the body decomposes naturally.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.736
Microbes and bacteria
break down carbon, then protein,

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.856
to create a new substance,

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.280
a rich, earthy soil.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.160
This soil can then be used
to grow new life.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.480
Eventually, you could be a lemon tree.

00:08:49.586 --> 00:08:50.736
(Applause)

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.976
Yeah, thank you.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.360
(Applause)

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.416
Who's thinking about
lemon meringue pie right now?
