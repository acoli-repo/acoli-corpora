00:00:00.738 --> 00:00:03.343
I'm going to give you
four specific examples,

00:00:03.367 --> 00:00:05.233
I'm going to cover at the end

00:00:05.257 --> 00:00:07.908
about how a company called Silk
tripled their sales;

00:00:07.932 --> 00:00:10.976
how an artist named Jeff Koons
went from being a nobody

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.976
to making a whole bunch of money
and having a lot of impact;

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to how Frank Gehry redefined
what it meant to be an architect.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.095
And one of my biggest failures
as a marketer in the last few years --

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.793
a record label I started
that had a CD called "Sauce."

00:00:25.126 --> 00:00:28.054
Before I can do that
I've got to tell you about sliced bread,

00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:29.777
and a guy named Otto Rohwedder.

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:33.060
Now, before sliced bread
was invented in the 1910s
