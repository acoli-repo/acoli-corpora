00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There are two groups of women

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
when it comes to screening mammography --

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
women in whom mammography works very well

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and has saved thousands of lives

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and women in whom it doesn't work well at all.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Do you know which group you're in?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If you don't, you're not alone.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Because the breast has become

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a very political organ.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The truth has become lost

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in all the rhetoric

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
coming from the press, politicians,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
radiologists
