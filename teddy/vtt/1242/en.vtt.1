00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
coming from the press, politicians,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
radiologists

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and medical imaging companies.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I will do my best this morning

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to tell you what I think is the truth.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But first, my disclosures.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I am not a breast cancer survivor.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm not a radiologist.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I don't have any patents,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and I've never received any money from a medical imaging company,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and I am not seeking your vote.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
(Laughter)

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
What I am

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is a doctor of internal medicine

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
who became passionately interested in this topic
