and what I've found are Indigenous
technologies from living cultures

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:36.143
that are still in use.

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:39.934
And some of these cultures
you may have never heard of.

00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:43.059
They live in the most
remote places on earth,

00:00:43.083 --> 00:00:48.351
facing environmental extremes
like desert drought and frequent flooding

00:00:48.375 --> 00:00:50.518
for generations.

00:00:50.542 --> 00:00:53.184
A couple of years ago,
I traveled to northern India

00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:56.059
to a place overlooking
the plains of Bangladesh

00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:58.226
where the Khasi people live

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.268
in a forest that receives more rainfall
than anywhere else on earth.
