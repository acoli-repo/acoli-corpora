When you imagine the architectural
wonders of the world,

00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:05.684
what do you see?

00:00:05.708 --> 00:00:07.726
The greatness of the Pyramids of Giza

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.643
or maybe the amazing
aqueducts of Ancient Rome?

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:15.976
Both of these are amazing
feats of human innovation.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.559
As an architect,

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:21.434
I've often wondered why do we
monumentalize the ancient wonders

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:25.601
of civilizations that collapsed
such a long time ago?

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:29.559
I've traveled the world
studying ancient innovation,

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:34.143
and what I've found are Indigenous
technologies from living cultures
