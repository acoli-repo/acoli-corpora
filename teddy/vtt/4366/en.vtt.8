cleans its water while producing its food.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.643
And through a combination
of sunshine and sewage

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:08.518
and a symbiosis
between algae and bacteria,

00:04:08.542 --> 00:04:10.893
the wastewater is broken down.

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.684
Fish ponds continue
this cleaning of the water

00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:16.417
in a process that takes around 30 days.

00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:18.643
And this innovation,

00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:24.333
it's not just a model for chemical
and coal-power-free purification.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.226
Since Calcutta's core
has no formal treatment,

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.434
it's the city's only way
of cleaning the water downstream
