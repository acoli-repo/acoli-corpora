00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:34.434

00:03:34.458 --> 00:03:38.226
In other parts of the world,
where rivers are contaminated with sewage,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.643
a city of 15 million people cleans
its waste water with its flood plains.

00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:46.851
On the edges of Calcutta,

00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:50.643
flanked by a smoking
escarpment of the city's trash

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:53.518
and ribboned by its highways,

00:03:53.542 --> 00:03:57.018

00:03:57.042 --> 00:04:00.726
cleans its water while producing its food.
