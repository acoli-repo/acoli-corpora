00:06:26.708 --> 00:06:30.143
which were the worst
we'd ever seen on record,

00:06:30.167 --> 00:06:32.018
something unexpected happened,

00:06:32.042 --> 00:06:34.268
but incredibly amazing.

00:06:34.292 --> 00:06:35.976
The ancestral lands in Australia,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.726
where Indigenous fire-stick
farming was practiced,

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.059
were saved as these fires
raged around them.

00:06:42.083 --> 00:06:43.434
And these ancient forests --

00:06:43.458 --> 00:06:47.059
they survived because of seasonal,
generational burning,

00:06:47.083 --> 00:06:52.726
which is an Aboriginal practice
of lighting small, slow and cool fires.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.143
So though wildfires
are a natural disaster,

00:06:56.167 --> 00:06:58.601
as a consequence of climate change,

00:06:58.625 --> 00:07:00.851
they're also man-made.
