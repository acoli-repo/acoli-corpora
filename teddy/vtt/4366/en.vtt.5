00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:32.268
And the Qasab reed
is integral to every aspect of life.

00:02:32.292 --> 00:02:35.018
It is food for water buffalo,

00:02:35.042 --> 00:02:36.809
flour for humans

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:41.518
and building material
for these biodegradable, buoyant islands

00:02:41.542 --> 00:02:43.476
and their cathedral-like houses

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.875
that they construct
in as little as three days.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:49.518
And this dried Qasab reed,

00:02:49.542 --> 00:02:51.643
it can be bundled into columns,

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:56.101
it can be woven into floors
or roofs or walls,

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:59.184
and it can also be twisted into a rope

00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:03.976
that's used to bind these buildings
without the use of any nails.
