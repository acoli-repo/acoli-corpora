00:01:57.542 --> 00:02:02.559
I've seen cultures who have been
living with floods for thousands of years

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:07.434
by evolving these ancient technologies
that allow them to work with the water.

00:02:07.458 --> 00:02:09.643
In the southern wetlands of Iraq,

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:14.101
which are formed by the confluence
of the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers,

00:02:14.125 --> 00:02:17.559
a unique, water-based civilization lives.

00:02:17.583 --> 00:02:20.976
For 6,000 years,
the Maʿdān have floated villages

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.018
on man-made islands that are constructed
from a single species of reed

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:27.643
that grows around them.

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:32.268
And the Qasab reed
is integral to every aspect of life.
