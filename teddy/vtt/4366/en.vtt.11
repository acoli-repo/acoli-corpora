00:05:27.042 --> 00:05:32.601
This chemical-free artificial reef
covers almost half of the lagoon

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:36.476
and feeds one million people
that are living around it.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.851
What amazes me

00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:42.934
is that while an individual acadja
is pretty insignificant,

00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.976
when it's multiplied by 12,000,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.101
it creates an Indigenous technology
the scale of industrial aquaculture,

00:05:51.125 --> 00:05:55.309
which is the greatest threat
to our mangrove ecosystems ...

00:05:55.333 --> 00:05:56.809
but this technology --

00:05:56.833 --> 00:06:00.059
it builds more biodiversity than before.
