00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:31.059
Multiple generations of the Khasi men
and the women and the children,

00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:32.684
they'll take care of these roots

00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:34.976
as they grow to the other
side of that bank,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.309
where they're then planted
to make a structure

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.851
that will get stronger with age.

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:44.893
This 1,500-year-old tradition
of growing living root bridges

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:48.934
has produced 75
of these incredible structures.

00:01:48.958 --> 00:01:52.226
And while they take 50 years to grow,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.375
in this landscape
they actually last for centuries.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.518
All across the globe,

00:01:57.542 --> 00:02:02.559
I've seen cultures who have been
living with floods for thousands of years
