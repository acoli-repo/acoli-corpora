00:07:59.505 --> 00:08:02.001
And the theory was, well,
if you have your money up,

00:08:02.025 --> 00:08:04.601
you're going to come back to court
each and every time,

00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:07.073
because at the end of a case,
your money comes back.

00:08:07.097 --> 00:08:09.737
If you don't come back to court,
you'll lose your money.

00:08:09.761 --> 00:08:12.626
So for a very long time,
everybody believed, myself included,

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.712
that it was the putting up of cash bail
that made the difference.

00:08:15.736 --> 00:08:17.761
That's what made people
come back to court.

00:08:17.785 --> 00:08:20.851
And so bail was supposed to be set
at an amount people could pay,

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.676
giving them some skin in the game.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.359
CA: But when judges set bail, in practice,

00:08:26.383 --> 00:08:27.930
they just have a number in mind.

00:08:27.954 --> 00:08:29.751
They don't make any investigation

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:32.972
into what a defendant's actual
financial position is.
