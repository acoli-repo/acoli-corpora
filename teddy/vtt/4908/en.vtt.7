CA: So effectively,

00:03:31.105 --> 00:03:33.797
you couldn't effectively defend
them as a public defender

00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:36.418
without paying attention
to some of these other issues.

00:03:36.442 --> 00:03:38.018
What did that actually look like?

00:03:38.042 --> 00:03:40.674
Did that mean that you would
sort of go from legal work

00:03:40.698 --> 00:03:43.642
into social assistance of some kind?

00:03:43.666 --> 00:03:45.061
How did you actually do that?

00:03:45.085 --> 00:03:48.119
RS: So, I think really dedicated
public defenders in any office,

00:03:48.143 --> 00:03:50.102
whether they're holistic or not holistic,

00:03:50.126 --> 00:03:52.851
try to do the extra work
beyond the criminal case.

00:03:52.875 --> 00:03:56.084
So, of course, it meant focusing
on the burden of proof

00:03:56.108 --> 00:03:58.734
and the evidence against the client
on the criminal case

00:03:58.758 --> 00:04:01.342
and working out either
a disposition or going to trial,
