00:13:59.988 --> 00:14:02.012
that come through
our criminal legal system

00:14:02.036 --> 00:14:04.048
wind up taking
a plea bargain of some sort,

00:14:04.072 --> 00:14:05.853
usually because they need to go home.

00:14:05.877 --> 00:14:08.869
So our ability to test whether
or not the arrest was valid

00:14:08.893 --> 00:14:10.631
or the evidence is there

00:14:10.655 --> 00:14:12.371
has disappeared,

00:14:12.395 --> 00:14:15.003
because we don't test
and challenge anything anymore

00:14:15.027 --> 00:14:16.426
in the criminal legal system.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.693
We just process human beings
through the system.

00:14:18.717 --> 00:14:21.454
CA: But certainly, that step,
from, "I can't afford bail,

00:14:21.478 --> 00:14:24.000
therefore I have to plead guilty.

00:14:24.024 --> 00:14:27.024
I get to go home, but by the way,
my life just got ruined."

00:14:27.048 --> 00:14:30.179
I mean -- that sequence is horrifying.
