00:03:58.758 --> 00:04:01.342
and working out either
a disposition or going to trial,

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.624
but it also meant sometimes
picking up the phone

00:04:03.648 --> 00:04:05.284
and calling the housing authority;

00:04:05.308 --> 00:04:08.011
picking up the phone and calling
the child welfare worker

00:04:08.035 --> 00:04:11.553
that was knocking on my client's door,
trying to take their kids from them

00:04:11.577 --> 00:04:12.735
because of their arrest;

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:15.198
intervening in advocacy ways
that are nontraditional

00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:18.469
and not in the lane of criminal defense
in the way we think about it,

00:04:18.493 --> 00:04:21.690
but that are 100 percent
connected to the criminal case.

00:04:21.714 --> 00:04:23.547
These systems all talk to each other,

00:04:23.571 --> 00:04:27.424
and if we as public defenders weren't
actually providing advocacy and counsel

00:04:27.448 --> 00:04:28.616
in those other areas,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.020
the system was going to win.
