00:14:27.048 --> 00:14:30.179
I mean -- that sequence is horrifying.

00:14:30.203 --> 00:14:32.064
RS: You know, when people plead guilty,

00:14:32.088 --> 00:14:33.240
I think also, they --

00:14:33.264 --> 00:14:36.487
you don't always know
what the consequences will be long term.

00:14:36.511 --> 00:14:40.052
So you may plead guilty at the moment
and think that's the best strategy,

00:14:40.076 --> 00:14:43.669
and then in five years, you apply
for a job, and you find yourself rejected,

00:14:43.693 --> 00:14:46.186
because you have a criminal
conviction on your record

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.995
that never occurred to you
was going to impact your future.

00:14:49.019 --> 00:14:51.981
CA: The key to getting 96 percent
of people to show up in court

00:14:52.005 --> 00:14:53.629
having paid their bail for them --

00:14:53.653 --> 00:14:55.949
you don't just pay the bail
and then forget them,

00:14:55.973 --> 00:14:58.563
you stay in touch with them,
you understand their case,

00:14:58.587 --> 00:15:00.781
you remind them
of the court case and so forth.
