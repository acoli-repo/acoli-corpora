00:06:57.829 --> 00:07:00.027
and that was what you saw
so clearly early on.

00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:02.843
RS: Absolutely, and I can tell you
that the faces of people

00:07:02.867 --> 00:07:06.454
and their shock and terror as they got
led back in through the door

00:07:06.478 --> 00:07:08.747
that was going to take them
out to Rikers Island

00:07:08.771 --> 00:07:10.726
will be forever ingrained in my brain.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.025
CA: So talk about how
this system is set up,

00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:16.635
because the logic behind it,
from one point of view,

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:17.923
makes a lot of sense:

00:07:17.947 --> 00:07:20.731
if you've arrested someone,
you think they may be guilty --

00:07:20.755 --> 00:07:23.006
you think they are guilty --
of doing something,

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.326
you want to be very sure
they will come to court,

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.777
so you need to give them
an incentive to come.

00:07:28.801 --> 00:07:31.495
So the bail system makes sense
from that point of view.
