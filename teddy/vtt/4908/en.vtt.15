00:07:28.801 --> 00:07:31.495
So the bail system makes sense
from that point of view.

00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:33.293
When was it initiated,

00:07:33.317 --> 00:07:34.923
and how did it start to go wrong?

00:07:34.947 --> 00:07:38.979
RS: So, the bail system
and the setting of cash bail

00:07:39.003 --> 00:07:40.394
has a very long history.

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:44.288
Its purpose, actually, was to ensure
that people came back to court.

00:07:44.312 --> 00:07:48.441

00:07:51.716 --> 00:07:52.947
That was its purpose.

00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:55.718
What that meant was, the judge
was supposed to set bail

00:07:55.742 --> 00:07:59.481
in an amount that was just enough
that somebody could afford to pay.

00:07:59.505 --> 00:08:02.001
And the theory was, well,
if you have your money up,
