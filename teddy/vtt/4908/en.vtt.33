00:16:29.122 --> 00:16:31.592
This is dangerous. You are not helping.

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:34.017
You are potentially empowering criminals."

00:16:34.041 --> 00:16:36.555
RS: So, there's no evidence
that mass incarceration

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:39.018
is what led to a reduction
in crime in this country.

00:16:39.042 --> 00:16:41.006
In fact, the evidence is to the contrary.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.079
The evidence is,
if you spend time in jail,

00:16:43.103 --> 00:16:46.797
you are far more likely to commit a crime
when you eventually get out of jail

00:16:46.821 --> 00:16:48.879
than if you had never been in jail at all.

00:16:48.903 --> 00:16:50.211
That's what the data shows.

00:16:50.235 --> 00:16:52.479
Why crime goes up and down is a question

00:16:52.503 --> 00:16:56.216
that social scientists have been debating
and arguing about for decades,

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.907
and I suspect will always debate.

00:16:58.931 --> 00:17:01.587
But it is certainly not the result
of mass incarceration
