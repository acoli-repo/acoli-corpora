"Well, of course you
can pay that bail money."

00:10:31.762 --> 00:10:33.483
But the truth is, our clients can't.

00:10:33.507 --> 00:10:36.775
And so we were sitting and having dinner,

really exploring: What would a potential
bail fund look like?

00:10:56.619 --> 00:11:00.516
And we came up with the revolving bail
fund model that we started in the Bronx,
