00:02:59.622 --> 00:03:01.829
and I would be focusing
on their criminal case,

00:03:01.853 --> 00:03:04.949
and they would continually ask me
questions about their housing

00:03:04.973 --> 00:03:06.539
or about their kids

00:03:06.563 --> 00:03:09.632
or about something else
that was on their mind,

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:12.734
I realized that an arrest
was never just an arrest,

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:15.960
and that there were these other issues
that were both driving people

00:03:15.984 --> 00:03:17.476

00:03:21.064 --> 00:03:23.832
and that people were oftentimes
concerned more about that

00:03:23.856 --> 00:03:25.953
than the actual
criminal case in front of us.

00:03:25.977 --> 00:03:28.908
So I began to think there has to be

00:03:29.862 --> 00:03:31.081
