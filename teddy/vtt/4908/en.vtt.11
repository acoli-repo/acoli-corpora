00:05:28.434 --> 00:05:31.188
If the only choice is
going to Rikers Island

00:05:31.212 --> 00:05:34.569
and sitting in those horrific conditions,
terrifying conditions,

00:05:34.593 --> 00:05:36.834
or pleading guilty to something
and going home,

00:05:36.858 --> 00:05:38.014
people plead guilty.

00:05:38.038 --> 00:05:40.106
So you, as the public
defender, stood there,

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.564
almost as a cog in the system,

00:05:41.588 --> 00:05:44.038
watching as people pled guilty,
one after the other,

00:05:44.062 --> 00:05:46.698
because they recognized
they couldn't pay the cash bail,

00:05:46.722 --> 00:05:50.159
and they were going to be sitting
in a jail cell for months if not years,

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.094
before their case actually got to trial.

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:54.524
CA: So help us a bit more
with the time line here.

00:05:54.548 --> 00:05:56.320
Someone gets arrested for an offense.

00:05:56.344 --> 00:05:59.870
How long is between that moment
and the arraignment?

00:05:59.894 --> 00:06:02.038
That's a short period of time,
usually, right?
