00:09:55.862 --> 00:10:00.161
CA: OK, so you saw this happening,
it was horrifying to you,

00:10:00.185 --> 00:10:04.540
and one night, you and your husband
had an idea to do something about it.

00:10:04.564 --> 00:10:05.791
Talk about that.

00:10:05.815 --> 00:10:07.805
RS: We were venting, as we do often,

00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:11.327
about something that had just happened
in court and how angry it made us,

00:10:11.351 --> 00:10:14.450
and almost always, that revolves
around the client who pled guilty

00:10:14.474 --> 00:10:16.198
who you didn't want to plead guilty,

00:10:16.222 --> 00:10:18.856
because you could've actually
taken their case to trial,

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.096
and they should have won,
but they pled guilty,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.932
because they didn't have enough money,

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:24.251
and how unfair that seemed,

00:10:24.275 --> 00:10:26.473
and the amounts of money,
that for most people,

00:10:26.497 --> 00:10:29.548
500 dollars or 1,000 dollars
to a lot of people sounds like,

00:10:29.572 --> 00:10:31.738
"Well, of course you
can pay that bail money."
