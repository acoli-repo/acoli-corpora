They felt like they didn't have
advocates that cared.

00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:04.823
They had very low opinions
of their public defenders,

00:02:04.847 --> 00:02:08.435
which got me interested in what was
going on in the criminal justice system.

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.891
So my third year in law school,
I enrolled in a criminal defense clinic,

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:14.745
and I began to represent people
in Manhattan criminal court,

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:15.920
and quite frankly,

00:02:15.944 --> 00:02:18.725
I think I stepped foot
in that courtroom my very first day,

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:19.966
and I never looked back.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.128
CA: Talk about holistic public defense.
What does that mean?

00:02:23.152 --> 00:02:27.304
RS: I started my public defender career
in a traditional public defender office

00:02:27.328 --> 00:02:29.434
in the Legal Aid Society of Nassau County,

00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:33.133
and then later, I transferred into
the Legal Aid Society in New York City.
