00:10:56.619 --> 00:11:00.516
And we came up with the revolving bail
fund model that we started in the Bronx,

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.133
called the Bronx Freedom Fund.

00:11:02.157 --> 00:11:05.942
There had been bail funds
before that, historically,

00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:09.205
that were political actions
by various organizations.

00:11:09.229 --> 00:11:13.445
So during the civil rights movement,
there would be a bail fund established

00:11:13.469 --> 00:11:16.127
to bail people out who were
arrested at a demonstration,

00:11:16.151 --> 00:11:19.982
or there might be, actually even
before that in the McCarthy era,

00:11:20.006 --> 00:11:23.882
there was actually a bail fund
that was started to bail people out

00:11:23.906 --> 00:11:28.318
who were being questioned
in terms of their loyalty to America

00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:32.714
and being arrested for treason
and all sorts of other charges.
