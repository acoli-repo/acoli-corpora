00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:01.697
and obviously, disproportionately,
people of color in a city like New York,

00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:02.932
they can't make the bail.

00:05:02.956 --> 00:05:05.052
And so you're standing
in front of the judge

00:05:05.076 --> 00:05:06.942
with a client who has just said to you,

00:05:06.966 --> 00:05:10.275
"I can't pay that 500 dollars"
or "I can't pay that thousand dollars,"

00:05:10.299 --> 00:05:12.331
and you, as the lawyer,
are sort of saying,

00:05:12.355 --> 00:05:14.704
"Well, you're going to have
to stay in jail, then,

00:05:14.728 --> 00:05:16.066
until we work this case out,

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.117
either go to trial or have a disposition."

00:05:18.141 --> 00:05:20.107
Inevitably, the judge would turn and say,

00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:22.347
"Well, if the client wants
to plead guilty now,

00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:23.673
I'll give her time served."

00:05:23.697 --> 00:05:26.993
And of course, anybody
will plead guilty to anything

00:05:27.017 --> 00:05:28.410
if it means going home.

00:05:28.434 --> 00:05:31.188
If the only choice is
going to Rikers Island
