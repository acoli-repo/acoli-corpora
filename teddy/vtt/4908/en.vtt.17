00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:32.972
into what a defendant's actual
financial position is.

00:08:32.996 --> 00:08:34.664
RS: That's a hundred percent right.

00:08:34.688 --> 00:08:37.566
There is almost nowhere where
there are individual findings

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.100
of individual abilities to pay
in a financial sense.

00:08:41.124 --> 00:08:43.385
In fact, you could argue, as I would,

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.943
that if you're being represented
by a public defender,

00:08:45.967 --> 00:08:49.596
the screening of that indigency has
already happened by the public defender,

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.741
and a judge ought
to recognize at that moment

00:08:51.765 --> 00:08:53.902
that this person is low-income.

00:08:53.926 --> 00:08:56.302
CA: So a judge says,
"OK, 500 dollars bail,"

00:08:56.326 --> 00:08:57.550
the person can't pay it,

00:08:57.574 --> 00:09:00.800
they go to jail, then.
