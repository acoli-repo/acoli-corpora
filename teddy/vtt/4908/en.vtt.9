00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.020
the system was going to win.

00:04:30.044 --> 00:04:33.969
CA: And so one issue
of particular concern to you

00:04:33.993 --> 00:04:35.753

a judge sets bail, and inevitably,

00:04:54.915 --> 00:04:58.142
because the majority of your clients
are from low-income communities

00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:01.697
and obviously, disproportionately,
people of color in a city like New York,
