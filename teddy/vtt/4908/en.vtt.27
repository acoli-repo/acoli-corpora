00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.895
CA: I mean, what's your sense
of what percentage of people

00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:34.028
take the guilty plea
when given that choice?

00:13:34.052 --> 00:13:37.116
RS: Oh, we know this in the data --
90 percent will plead guilty.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.930
CA: And it's possible that half of those,
or a percentage of those, are guilty.

00:13:40.954 --> 00:13:42.134
Do you have any --?

00:13:42.158 --> 00:13:44.456
RS: I have no idea what
the percentages would be,

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.882
and here's why we don't know:

00:13:45.906 --> 00:13:50.202
our system has turned from
those beautiful marble courthouses

00:13:50.226 --> 00:13:53.246
that we built to try cases
and test governmental evidence

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.682
and determine whether
somebody's guilty or innocent

00:13:55.706 --> 00:13:57.558
into plea bargaining factories.

00:13:57.582 --> 00:13:59.964
And what I mean by that
is that far too many people

00:13:59.988 --> 00:14:02.012
that come through
our criminal legal system
