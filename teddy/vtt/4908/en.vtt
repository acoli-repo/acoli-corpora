Chris Anderson: Welcome
to the TED Interview.

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:08.223
I'm Chris Anderson.

00:00:08.247 --> 00:00:11.408
This is the podcast series
where I sit down with a TED speaker,

00:00:11.432 --> 00:00:14.155
and we get to dive
much deeper into their ideas

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.625
than was possible during their TED Talk.

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:21.231
Today, it's an absolute delight
to have with me Robin Steinberg.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:23.219
Robin's a public defense lawyer

00:00:23.243 --> 00:00:27.088
who is working to disrupt
America's system of cash bail.

00:00:27.112 --> 00:00:29.811
And she is a force of nature.

00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:33.050
(Recording) Robin Steinberg: Look,
we all know the shocking numbers.
