(Recording) Robin Steinberg: Look,
we all know the shocking numbers.

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:35.684
The United States incarcerates
more people per capita

00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:38.481
than almost any nation on the planet.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:40.223
But what you may not know

00:00:40.247 --> 00:00:42.692
is that on any given night in America,

00:00:42.716 --> 00:00:46.941
almost half a million people
go to sleep in those concrete jail cells,

00:00:46.965 --> 00:00:50.619
who have not been convicted of anything.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:55.072
These mothers and fathers
and sons and daughters

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:58.802
are there for one reason
and one reason only:

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:02.274
they cannot afford to pay
the price of their freedom.
