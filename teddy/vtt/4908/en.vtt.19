00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:32.799
your physical health.

00:09:32.823 --> 00:09:36.543

00:09:38.312 --> 00:09:40.359
You may lose your home and get evicted.

00:09:40.383 --> 00:09:42.928

get removed from your care,

00:09:42.952 --> 00:09:44.969

00:09:55.862 --> 00:10:00.161
CA: OK, so you saw this happening,
it was horrifying to you,
