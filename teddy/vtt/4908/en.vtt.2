00:01:02.845 --> 00:01:05.422
CA: Robin is out to change this.

00:01:05.446 --> 00:01:08.218

called the "Audacious Project,"

00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:14.235
which offers significant funding
for truly bold ideas.

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.263
Her idea is as bold as they get,

00:01:16.287 --> 00:01:20.197
and we're going to be talking about
all of this in the next hour.

00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:24.458

00:01:24.482 --> 00:01:25.712
Robin, welcome.

00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:27.456
RS: Thank you. It's nice to be here.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.777
CA: Robin, I'd love to start
with your own story.

00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:31.822
How did you become
a public defender, even?
