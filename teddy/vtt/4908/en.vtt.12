00:05:59.894 --> 00:06:02.038
That's a short period of time,
usually, right?

00:06:02.062 --> 00:06:03.730
RS: It depends on the jurisdiction.

00:06:03.754 --> 00:06:05.577
In New York City, if you get arrested,

00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:09.129
you will see a judge and be assigned
a public defender and bail will be set

00:06:09.153 --> 00:06:10.308
within 24 hours.

00:06:10.332 --> 00:06:11.637
In Oklahoma, where we work,

00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:15.478
you don't see a judge or a public defender
for eight to 10 days after the arrest,

00:06:15.502 --> 00:06:18.899
where the sheriff has set bail, cash bail,
according to a bail schedule.

00:06:18.923 --> 00:06:20.511
So it varies from place to place.

00:06:20.535 --> 00:06:21.695
CA: I see.

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.658
But in New York, for now,
that 24 hours is spent not in jail,

00:06:24.682 --> 00:06:26.277
it's spent in a police cell.

00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:28.297
RS: Yeah. You go to central booking,

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:31.150
which is literally
the bowels of the courthouse.
