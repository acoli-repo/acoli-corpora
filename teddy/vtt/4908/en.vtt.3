How did you become
a public defender, even?

00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:34.739
RS: So, I went to law school
many, many years ago,

00:01:34.763 --> 00:01:37.207
thinking I wanted to be
a women's rights litigator.

00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:38.697
I was committed to that idea.

00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:42.042
I got to law school, and I began
to work in a women's prison

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:46.470
and was so struck
by the conditions of jail,

00:01:46.494 --> 00:01:48.033
why people were in jail,

00:01:48.057 --> 00:01:50.064
who was in jail --

00:01:50.088 --> 00:01:53.461
all black and brown women from
low-income communities here in New York.

00:01:53.485 --> 00:01:57.748
I'd listen to their stories,
which have stuck with me my whole career.

00:01:57.772 --> 00:01:59.752
They felt railroaded by the system.

00:01:59.776 --> 00:02:02.282
They felt like they didn't have
advocates that cared.
