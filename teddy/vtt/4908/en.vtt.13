00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:31.150
which is literally
the bowels of the courthouse.

00:06:31.174 --> 00:06:33.215
You are sitting in a single cell

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:36.817
with probably eight to 12 people
in that same cell with you,

00:06:36.841 --> 00:06:38.335
with one toilet in the middle.

00:06:38.359 --> 00:06:41.758
And you are waiting for 24 hours
for somebody to call your name.

00:06:41.782 --> 00:06:43.626
CA: Still, the difference between that

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.539
and the prospects of actually going
to, say, Rikers Island --

00:06:46.563 --> 00:06:48.117
that's a terrifying prospect.

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:51.099
And that moment
when a judge says, "Bail is x,"

00:06:51.123 --> 00:06:53.203
and you know you can't afford to pay it --

00:06:53.227 --> 00:06:56.024
that turns out to be
just this horrifying moment

00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:57.805
that can determine someone's future,

00:06:57.829 --> 00:07:00.027
and that was what you saw
so clearly early on.
