00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:32.714
and being arrested for treason
and all sorts of other charges.

00:11:32.738 --> 00:11:35.370
But those were political actions
that bailed people out,

00:11:35.394 --> 00:11:37.448
and it wasn't a sustainable,
revolving fund,

00:11:37.472 --> 00:11:39.302
and then inevitably, they would close.

00:11:39.326 --> 00:11:41.819
They would stop after
that political action was over.

00:11:41.843 --> 00:11:45.630
This was the first time we had thought
about doing something that was revolving,

00:11:45.654 --> 00:11:46.810
that was sustainable.

00:11:46.834 --> 00:11:49.242
Because bail money comes back
at the end of a case,

00:11:49.266 --> 00:11:52.992
it is a political act, of course,
to bail somebody out of jail,

00:11:53.016 --> 00:11:55.785
but it isn't around
a particular political action.

00:11:55.809 --> 00:11:59.915
It is simply a model that can be
sustained almost forever,

00:11:59.939 --> 00:12:02.866
as long as people come back to court
and the money comes back.
