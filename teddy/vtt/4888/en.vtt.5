00:02:29.873 --> 00:02:32.154
So there’s no margin for waste.

00:02:32.154 --> 00:02:36.182
If there’s any way to do this,
it’ll probably be highly symmetrical.

00:02:36.182 --> 00:02:38.182
Maybe you can use that to help you.

00:02:38.182 --> 00:02:40.036
You look at the center cube.

00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:42.889
You’d better paint it half green 
and half purple,

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.063
so you can use it as a corner 
for each of those cubes,

00:02:46.063 --> 00:02:48.423
and not waste a single face.

00:02:48.423 --> 00:02:52.429
There’ll need to be center cubes
with no green and no purple too.

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:55.153
So you take 2 corner cubes 
from the red cube

00:02:55.153 --> 00:02:58.625
and paint the 3 blank faces of 1 purple,

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:01.921
and the 3 blank faces of the other green.
