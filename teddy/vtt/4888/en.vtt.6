00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:01.921
and the 3 blank faces of the other green.

00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:06.264
Now you’ve got the 6 face cubes 
that each have 1 face painted red.

00:03:06.264 --> 00:03:09.325
That leaves 5 empty faces on each.

00:03:09.325 --> 00:03:11.043
You can split them in half.

00:03:11.043 --> 00:03:13.616
In the first group, 
you paint 3 faces green

00:03:13.616 --> 00:03:15.284
and 2 faces purple;

00:03:15.284 --> 00:03:19.113
In the second group, 
paint 3 faces purple and 2 green.

00:03:19.113 --> 00:03:20.362
Counting on symmetry,

00:03:20.362 --> 00:03:24.274
you replicate these piles again
with the colors rearranged.

00:03:24.274 --> 00:03:26.604
That gives you 6 with 1 green face,

00:03:26.604 --> 00:03:28.151
6 with 1 red face,

00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:30.623
and 6 with 1 purple face.
