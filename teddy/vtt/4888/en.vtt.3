00:01:28.483 --> 00:01:32.350
How can you apply the colored coatings 
to the 27 cubes

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.723
so the probe will be able 
to make the trip?

00:01:35.723 --> 00:01:45.458
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out yourself.

00:01:45.458 --> 00:01:49.331
You can start by painting the outside 
of the complete cube red,

00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:51.341
since you’ll need that regardless.

00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:55.767
Then you can break it into 27 pieces, 
and look at what you have.

00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:59.645
There are 8 corner cubes, 
which each have three red faces,

00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:02.775
12 edge cubes, 
which have two red faces,
