00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:30.921
capable of running all the scientific 
tests necessary to analyze the monolith.

00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:35.994
The modules can self-assemble 
into a large 3x3x3 cube,

00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:39.965
with each individual module
placed anywhere in the cube,

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:41.841
and at any orientation.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:47.600
It can also break itself apart 
and reassemble into any other orientation.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.092
Now comes your job.

00:00:49.092 --> 00:00:51.431
The probe will need a special 
protective coating

00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:54.612
for each of the extreme
environments it passes through.

00:00:54.612 --> 00:00:57.993
The red coating will seal it against 
the cold of deep space,

00:00:57.993 --> 00:01:00.741
the purple coating will protect it 
from the intense heat
