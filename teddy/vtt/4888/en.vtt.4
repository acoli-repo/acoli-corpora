00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:02.775
12 edge cubes, 
which have two red faces,

00:02:02.775 --> 00:02:05.741
6 face cubes, which have 1 red face,

00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:09.632
and a single center cube, 
which has no red faces.

00:02:09.632 --> 00:02:13.199
You’ve painted a total of 54 faces red 
at this point,

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.830
so you’ll need the same number of faces 
for the green and purple cubes, too.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.578
When you’re done, 
you’ll have painted 54 faces red,

00:02:20.578 --> 00:02:22.166
54 faces green,

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:24.348
and 54 faces purple.

00:02:24.348 --> 00:02:29.873
That’s 162 faces, which is precisely 
how many the cubes have in total.

00:02:29.873 --> 00:02:32.154
So there’s no margin for waste.
