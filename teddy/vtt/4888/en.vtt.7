00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:30.623
and 6 with 1 purple face.

00:03:30.623 --> 00:03:32.559
Counting up 
what you’ve completely painted,

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.495
you see 8 corner cubes in each color,

00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:37.356
6 edge cubes in each color,

00:03:37.356 --> 00:03:39.385
6 face cubes in each color,

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:41.420
and 1 center cube.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.663
That means you just need 6 more edge cubes
in green and purple.

00:03:45.663 --> 00:03:50.602
And there are exactly 6 cubes left,
each with 4 empty faces.

00:03:50.602 --> 00:03:54.591
You paint 2 faces of each green 
and 2 faces of each purple.

00:03:54.591 --> 00:03:58.942
And now you have a cube that’s perfectly 
painted to make an incredible trip.

00:03:58.942 --> 00:04:01.747
It rearranges itself 
to be red in deep space,
