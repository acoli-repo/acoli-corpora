00:00:57.993 --> 00:01:00.741
the purple coating will protect it 
from the intense heat

00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:03.948
as it enters the atmosphere of RH-1729,

00:01:03.948 --> 00:01:09.388
and the green coating will shield it 
from the alien planet’s electric storms.

00:01:09.388 --> 00:01:14.249
You can apply the coatings to each of
the faces of all 27 of the cubic modules

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:15.863
in any way you like,

00:01:15.863 --> 00:01:19.349
but each face can only 
take a single color coating.

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:22.035
You need to figure out how you 
can apply the colors

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:26.159
so the cubes can re-assemble themselves
to show only red,

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.162
then purple,

00:01:27.162 --> 00:01:28.483
then green.

00:01:28.483 --> 00:01:32.350
How can you apply the colored coatings 
to the 27 cubes
