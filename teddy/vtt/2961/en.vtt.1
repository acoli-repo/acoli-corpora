00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:30.174
I wanted to make my own impact
for those who live under injustice;

00:00:30.198 --> 00:00:33.579
it's the reason that I became
a documentary journalist,

00:00:33.603 --> 00:00:35.166
the reason I became

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:39.141
a prisoner in North Korea for 140 days.

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:42.857
It was March 17, 2009.

00:00:43.406 --> 00:00:46.422
It is St. Patrick's Day for all of you,

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:51.000
but it was the day
that turned my life upside down.

00:00:51.526 --> 00:00:56.127
My team and I were making a documentary
about North Korean refugees

00:00:56.151 --> 00:00:59.621
living below human life in China.
