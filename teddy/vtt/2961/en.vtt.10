00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:01.553
And I think at some point,
I dehumanized them,

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.399
and the people of North Korea
became equated

00:05:07.423 --> 00:05:09.835
with the North Korean government.

00:05:11.401 --> 00:05:13.944
Now, back to my detention.

00:05:13.968 --> 00:05:16.121
It was the second day

00:05:16.145 --> 00:05:17.521
of being in a cell.

00:05:18.195 --> 00:05:21.435
I had not slept
since I was out at the border.

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:25.710
This young guard came to my cell

00:05:25.734 --> 00:05:29.250
and offered me this small boiled egg

00:05:29.274 --> 00:05:32.829
and said, "This will give you
strength to keep going."
