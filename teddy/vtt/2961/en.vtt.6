00:02:58.573 --> 00:03:00.715
but I saw that he was hesitating.

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.514
His eyes were shaking,

00:03:02.538 --> 00:03:05.676
and his rifle was still up in the air.

00:03:06.217 --> 00:03:08.479
So I shouted at him,

00:03:08.503 --> 00:03:10.809
"OK, OK, I'll walk with you."

00:03:11.415 --> 00:03:12.731
And I got up.

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.083
When we arrived at their army base,

00:03:17.995 --> 00:03:21.891
my head was spinning
with these worst-case scenarios,

00:03:21.915 --> 00:03:24.880
and my colleague's
statement wasn't helping.

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:27.026
She said, "We are the enemy."

00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:30.637
She was right: we were the enemy.
