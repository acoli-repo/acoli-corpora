00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:03.262
We were at the border.

00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:06.144
It was our last day of filming.

00:01:07.597 --> 00:01:10.224
There was no wire fence

00:01:10.248 --> 00:01:11.518
or bars

00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:13.838
or sign to show that it is the border,

00:01:13.862 --> 00:01:17.613
but this is a place that a lot
of North Korean defectors use

00:01:17.637 --> 00:01:19.099
as an escape route.

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:22.669
It was still winter,

00:01:22.693 --> 00:01:25.186
and the river was frozen.

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:29.361
When we were in the middle
of the frozen river,

00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:32.297
we were filming about
the condition of the cold weather
