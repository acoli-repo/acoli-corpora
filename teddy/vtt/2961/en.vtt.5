They were not much bigger than us,

00:02:31.054 --> 00:02:34.753
but they were determined
to take us to their army base.

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:38.980
I begged and yelled for any kind of help,

00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:42.156
hoping that someone
would show up from China.

00:02:43.377 --> 00:02:45.298
Here I was, being stubborn

00:02:45.964 --> 00:02:48.476
towards a trained soldier with a gun.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.157
I looked at his eyes.

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:54.066
He was just a boy.

00:02:55.034 --> 00:02:58.549
At that moment,
he raised his rifle to hit me,

00:02:58.573 --> 00:03:00.715
but I saw that he was hesitating.
