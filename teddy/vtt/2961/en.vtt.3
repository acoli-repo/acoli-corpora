00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:32.297
we were filming about
the condition of the cold weather

00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:33.519
and the environment

00:01:33.543 --> 00:01:36.269
that North Koreans had to deal with

00:01:36.293 --> 00:01:38.120
when they seek their freedom.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.294
And suddenly, one
of my team members shouted,

00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:43.471
"Soldiers!"

00:01:43.932 --> 00:01:45.634
So I looked back,

00:01:45.658 --> 00:01:51.306
and there were two small soldiers
in green uniforms with rifles,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.722
chasing after us.

00:01:53.288 --> 00:01:55.926
We all ran as fast as we could.

00:01:56.773 --> 00:01:59.762
I prayed that, please
don't let them shoot my head.
