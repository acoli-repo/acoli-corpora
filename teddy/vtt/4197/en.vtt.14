Shah Rukh Khan: Thank you so much Jagdish.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.576
I have a question for you.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.696
At your age, my age,
our children are very sharp

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.616
so how do we actually
keep a check on them?

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.930
What do we say? How do we say it so
they themselves understand the point?

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.026
JM: That’s a very valid point.

00:07:22.026 --> 00:07:24.176
What I think is that
like we do in real life,

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.566
if we walk the talk with them,
what we do, they will follow.

00:07:28.566 --> 00:07:32.060
If they see how secure we are,
they will start doing it.
