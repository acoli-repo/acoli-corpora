But I can tell you that in the internet
world we are all doing this, all the time.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.230
Would you believe me?

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.936
That, too, in a world in which we spend
approximately half our day.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.816
We prepare our children for life,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.760
but for the world of the internet,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.760
where they probably spend
more time than we do,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.020
are we able to prepare them?

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.116
At McAfee, we did a survey to listen
in to what the children said.

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.736
44 percent of them said

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.736
that they had met or were going to meet
strangers who they first met online.
