Shah Rukh Khan: Today,
I, Shah Rukh Khan,

00:00:07.093 --> 00:00:10.073
am speaking to a live audience
in a studio in Mumbai ...

00:00:10.073 --> 00:00:12.305
but millions of people
can access this forever

00:00:12.305 --> 00:00:14.645
on their telephone, tablet,
personal computer

00:00:14.645 --> 00:00:17.976
and many more devices via the internet.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.176
So without ever meeting me,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.656
you can see me, talk to me
and interact with me, in the virtual world.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.856
But while the virtual world
has endless virtues,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.456
it also has some vices which probably
haveÂ the maximum effect on our children.
