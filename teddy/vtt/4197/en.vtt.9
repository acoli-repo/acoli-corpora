How many of us know,
and even if we do know,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.920
are we doing it?

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.486
These days I think we use free apps

00:04:37.486 --> 00:04:40.166
for everything from eating to sleeping.

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:43.169
Have you ever thought
how these apps got free?

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.776
Actually, you are
the one being sold there.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.736
Our online identity gets
sold on the internet,

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.570
and in return, attempts are made
to sell something to us.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.256
On the internet, nothing is a coincidence.
Every step, every moment is being tracked.
