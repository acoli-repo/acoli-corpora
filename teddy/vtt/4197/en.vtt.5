I am talking about the '80s,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.120
people who didn’t know me still knew me

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.280
because they knew of
my grandfather or an uncle.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.930
Or they knew a neighbor
so they recognzed me.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.570
I used to think at that point
that even in such a crowd,

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.520
people knew each other,
and everyone was trusted.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.456
Times have changed now;

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.320
we don’t even probably
know our neighbours.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.256
So if in real life, trust
is such a diminishing thing

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.456
we are talking about the internet.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.096
Now just imagine, for a moment,
if a stranger came up to you
