On the internet, nothing is a coincidence.
Every step, every moment is being tracked.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.976
Just imagine that all these
websites and apps

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.736
are chasing you with cameras
'round the clock.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.136
The moment you click "like,"
two more eyes join in.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.536
But the reason to be afraid is that

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.576
these cameras are also
chasing our children.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.743
Think about it, how would you feel
if this happened in real life?

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.696
If at this moment, you
are watching me on a Smart TV,

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.016
it’s possible that the Smart TV
is watching you

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.850
and sending your video someplace else.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.600
I am not talking about the future;
this is happening now.
