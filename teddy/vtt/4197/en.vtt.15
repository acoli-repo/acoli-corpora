If they see how secure we are,
they will start doing it.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.106
At some level we should
build a friendship,

00:07:34.106 --> 00:07:36.136
which is the new narrative for parenting.

00:07:36.136 --> 00:07:39.856
While in real life we work around this
narrative, online we don’t do it.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.216
So I think if we get friendly
and spend some time with them,

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.016
the job will get easier.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.606
SRK: I think that’s wonderful.
To whoever is listening,

00:07:47.606 --> 00:07:51.056
keep the friendship going
with your children.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.696
We tend to get irritated
but remember this:

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.360
If you are watching the Smart TV,
the Smart TV is also watching you.
