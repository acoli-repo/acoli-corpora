Now just imagine, for a moment,
if a stranger came up to you

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.096
and gave you a free chocolate

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.696
and in return asked for your home address.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.720
If possible he would also like your date
of birth and details of your children, too.

00:03:10.744 --> 00:03:12.096
Would you tell him?

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.310
So for free Wi-Fi,

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.600
why do we easily keep all of these
details available on the internet?

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.256
In India, this year, every ten minutes
there is a cyber crime being committed.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.736
So now those scenes of robbery at gun
point or by flashing a knife are gone.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.680
This is easier and more profitable.
