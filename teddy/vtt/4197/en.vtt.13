I think that figuring out relationships
and trust issues only in the real world

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.730
is not where our responsibility
as parents ends.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.296
All this is needed
in the virtual world as well.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.256
In fact, a lot more.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.936
If we get to know this and understand it

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.800
we can gain a lot from this amazing
internet while staying safe.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.097
Always remember,

00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:52.528
it’s not just you looking at the internet,

00:06:52.528 --> 00:06:55.828
the internet is also looking at you,
all the time.

00:06:56.372 --> 00:06:57.682
Thank you

00:06:57.684 --> 00:07:04.800
