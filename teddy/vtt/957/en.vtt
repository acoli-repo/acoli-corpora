00:00:00.618 --> 00:00:03.715
Suppose that two American friends
are traveling together in Italy.

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:05.664
They go to see Michelangelo's "David,"

00:00:05.688 --> 00:00:08.318
and when they finally come
face-to-face with the statue,

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:10.170
they both freeze dead in their tracks.

00:00:10.194 --> 00:00:12.061
The first guy -- we'll call him Adam --

00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:14.805
is transfixed by the beauty
of the perfect human form.

00:00:15.455 --> 00:00:17.380
The second guy -- we'll call him Bill --

00:00:17.404 --> 00:00:21.858
is transfixed by embarrassment, at staring
at the thing there in the center.

00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:24.571
So here's my question for you:

00:00:24.595 --> 00:00:28.212
Which one of these two guys was more
likely to have voted for George Bush,

00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:29.976
which for Al Gore?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.384
I don't need a show of hands,
