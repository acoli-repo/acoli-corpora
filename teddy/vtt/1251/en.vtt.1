00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:32.845
and when I got here,
I was told various things,

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:35.916
like, "Americans don't get irony."

00:00:36.628 --> 00:00:38.768
(Laughter)

00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:41.014
Have you come across this idea?

00:00:41.038 --> 00:00:42.197
It's not true.

00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:44.983
I've traveled the whole length
and breadth of this country.

00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:47.633
I have found no evidence
that Americans don't get irony.

00:00:47.657 --> 00:00:50.234
It's one of those cultural myths,

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:52.146
like, "The British are reserved."

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.369
(Laughter)

00:00:54.393 --> 00:00:56.099
I don't know why people think this.

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:58.942
We've invaded every country
we've encountered.

00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.250
(Laughter)
