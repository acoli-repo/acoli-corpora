WEBVTT

00:00:00.792 --> 00:00:04.485
We're seen as the organization that is
the bucket for failed social policy.

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:07.767
I can't define who comes to us or how long they stay.

00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:09.903
We get the people for whom
nothing else has worked,

00:00:09.903 --> 00:00:11.341
people who have fallen through all

00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:13.254
of the other social safety nets.

00:00:13.254 --> 00:00:15.587
They can't contain them, so we must.

00:00:15.587 --> 00:00:17.030
That's our job:

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.137
contain them, control them.

00:00:20.137 --> 00:00:22.594
Over the years, as a prison system,

00:00:22.594 --> 00:00:24.415
as a nation, and as a society,

00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:25.890
we've become very good at that,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.010
but that shouldn't make you happy.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.710
Today we incarcerate more people per capita

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.847
than any other country in the world.
