I shared these finding with Tuhin
and we wondered:

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.576
What if we could create something

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.176
that would help girls understand
about menstruation on their own --

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.416
something that would help
parents and teachers

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.360
talk about periods
comfortably to young girls?

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.456
During my research,

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.456
I was collecting a lot of stories.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.160
These were stories of experiences
of girls during their periods.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.056
These stories would make girls
curious and interested
