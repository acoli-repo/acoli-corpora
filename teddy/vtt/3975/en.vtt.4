00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.816
I grew up in a small town
called Garhwa, in Jharkhand,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.960
where even buying a sanitary napkin
is considered shameful.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.895
So when I started getting my periods,

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.680
I began with using rags.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.216
After every use
I would wash and reuse them.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.496
But to store them,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.136
I would hide and keep it
in a dark, damp place

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.760
so that nobody finds out
that I'm menstruating.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.136
Due to repeated washing
the rags would become coarse,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.160
and I would often get rashes
and infections using them.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.160
I wore these already for five years
until I moved out of that town.
