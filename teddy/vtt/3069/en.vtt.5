I was worried this team in Kenya
couldn't use the technology

00:02:30.386 --> 00:02:31.987
I was learning about space.

00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:36.449
But thankfully, I still learned
that I was wrong.

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:39.816
I came back and interned at NASA again,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.998
and this time,

00:02:41.022 --> 00:02:42.847
a mentor taught me

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:49.046
that countries like Kenya had been using
space technology for decades

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.631
to improve the lives
in their own countries.

00:02:51.655 --> 00:02:55.185
And then I knew that I could have
a career in space

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.783
and in development.

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:59.217
This idea is not new.

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:04.025
In fact, in 1967, the nations
of the world came together
