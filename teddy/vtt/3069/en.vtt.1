00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:31.725
was the launch
of the Columbia Space Shuttle

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:34.902
carrying the Chandra X-Ray Observatory,

00:00:35.486 --> 00:00:41.818
a telescope that would allow scientists
to peer into the edge of black holes.

00:00:42.712 --> 00:00:45.717
The entire sky filled with light.

00:00:46.998 --> 00:00:50.270
And it was as if it was daytime
in the middle of the night.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.994
Soon, we could feel the rumble
of the engines vibrating in our chests.

00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:57.584
And it wasn't a miracle;

00:00:58.316 --> 00:01:02.333
it was the combined effort
of a team of thousands of people
