In fact, in 1967, the nations
of the world came together

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.792
to write the Outer Space Treaty.

00:03:07.607 --> 00:03:10.269
This treaty made a bold statement,

00:03:10.293 --> 00:03:14.355
saying, "The exploration
and use of outer space

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.955
should be carried on
for the benefit of all peoples,

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:23.467
irrespective of their level
of economic or scientific development."

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:27.446
We have not truly lived up to this ideal,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.689
although people have worked
for decades to make this a reality.
