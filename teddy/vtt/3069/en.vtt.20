00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:04.409
This is what motivates my work
as a professor at MIT's Media Lab.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.995
I've recently founded a new research group
called Space Enabled.

00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:15.168
We are working to tear down these barriers
that limit the benefits of space.

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:18.347
And we're also going to develop
the future applications

00:10:18.371 --> 00:10:21.651
that will continue to contribute
to sustainable development.

00:10:22.533 --> 00:10:24.141
We'll keep on this work

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:28.341
until we can truly say that space
is for the benefit of all peoples,

00:10:28.834 --> 00:10:31.972
and we are all space enabled.
