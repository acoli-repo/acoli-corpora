00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:30.063
Scientists can use this technology
to track endangered wildlife.

00:05:30.727 --> 00:05:33.237
This turtle has been fitted with a system

00:05:33.261 --> 00:05:37.826
that allows it to receive location
information from positioning satellites,

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.423
and they send the location
information to scientists

00:05:40.447 --> 00:05:42.021
via communication satellites.

00:05:43.112 --> 00:05:46.263
Scientists can use this knowledge
to then make better policies

00:05:46.287 --> 00:05:48.697
and help determine
how to keep these animals alive.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.561
Earth observation satellites.

00:05:52.928 --> 00:05:55.522
They tell us what's going on
in our environment.

00:05:55.546 --> 00:05:59.044
Right now, there are about 150 satellites

00:05:59.068 --> 00:06:01.850
operated by over 60 government agencies,
