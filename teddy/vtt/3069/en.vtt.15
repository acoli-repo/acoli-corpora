00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:32.481
And because of this,
we call it "microgravity."

00:07:33.412 --> 00:07:35.875
When astronauts are
in the microgravity environment,

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:39.411
their bodies react
as if they're aging rapidly.

00:07:39.888 --> 00:07:42.304
Their bones and muscles weaken,

00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:45.882
and their cardiovascular system
and their immune system change.

00:07:47.052 --> 00:07:50.300
As scientists study how to keep
astronauts healthy in space,

00:07:50.324 --> 00:07:53.632
we can take the exercises and techniques
we use for astronauts

00:07:53.656 --> 00:07:55.608
and transfer them to people on Earth

00:07:55.632 --> 00:07:57.029
to improve our health here.

00:07:57.465 --> 00:08:00.936
Often, as we develop technology
for astronauts and exploration
