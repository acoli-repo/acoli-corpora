00:07:00.065 --> 00:07:04.427
Now, scientists can take this information
about the rainfall and the vegetation

00:07:04.451 --> 00:07:05.841
and use it to understand

00:07:05.865 --> 00:07:09.630
what areas on Earth are in danger
of a famine or a drought

00:07:09.654 --> 00:07:12.296
and provide that information
to aid organizations

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.137
so they can be prepared with food aid
before the hunger becomes severe.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.742
In space, we have an orbiting laboratory
on the International Space Station.

00:07:22.653 --> 00:07:25.681
The vehicle and everything inside
are in a form of free fall

00:07:25.705 --> 00:07:26.856
around the Earth,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.210
and they don't experience
the effect of gravity.
