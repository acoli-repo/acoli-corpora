00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.049
Our road map for this mission comes
from the 17 Sustainable Development Goals

00:04:04.073 --> 00:04:05.438
of the United Nations.

00:04:05.808 --> 00:04:08.507
All the member states
of the United Nations have agreed

00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:11.837
that these are priorities
between now and 2030.

00:04:12.526 --> 00:04:17.700
These goals give us our key moments
and opportunities of our time --

00:04:18.323 --> 00:04:21.294
opportunities to end extreme poverty,

00:04:21.318 --> 00:04:25.865
to insure that everyone has access
to food and clean water.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.996
We must pursue these goals
as a global community.
