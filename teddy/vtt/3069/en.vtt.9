We must pursue these goals

00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:36.331
And technology from space
supports sustainable development.

00:04:36.891 --> 00:04:39.910
In fact, there are six space services

00:04:39.934 --> 00:04:43.727
that can help us pursue
the Sustainable Development Goals.

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:47.962
Over the next few minutes,
let's explore these six services,

00:04:47.986 --> 00:04:51.505
and see examples of just a few
of the goals they help support.

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:52.714
You ready?

00:04:53.104 --> 00:04:54.262
OK.

00:04:54.286 --> 00:04:58.479
Communication satellites provide access
to phone and internet service

00:04:58.503 --> 00:05:00.241
to almost any location on Earth.
