00:09:29.093 --> 00:09:31.367
These stories that I've shared with you

00:09:31.391 --> 00:09:35.504
all illustrate that space truly is useful
for sustainable development

00:09:35.528 --> 00:09:37.302
for the benefit of all peoples.

00:09:38.016 --> 00:09:39.759
But we have more work to do,

00:09:40.487 --> 00:09:44.217
because there are still barriers
that exclude people from space

00:09:44.241 --> 00:09:46.384
and limit the impact of this technology.

00:09:47.402 --> 00:09:50.997
For many people,
Earth observation data is complex.

00:09:51.576 --> 00:09:54.288
And satellite communication
services are too expensive.

00:09:54.966 --> 00:09:58.441
And microgravity research
just appears to be inaccessible.

00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:04.409
This is what motivates my work
as a professor at MIT's Media Lab.
