00:04:58.503 --> 00:05:00.241
to almost any location on Earth.

00:05:00.622 --> 00:05:04.138
This is particularly important
during times of disaster recovery.

00:05:04.523 --> 00:05:08.041
When Typhoon Haiyan
struck the Philippines,

00:05:08.065 --> 00:05:10.839
the local communication networks
needed to be repaired,

00:05:10.863 --> 00:05:14.171
and teams brought in inflatable
communication antennas

00:05:14.195 --> 00:05:16.185
that could link to satellites.

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:18.786
This was useful during the time
of repair and recovery.

00:05:19.453 --> 00:05:22.783
Positioning satellites
tell us where we are

00:05:22.807 --> 00:05:24.663
by telling us where they are.

00:05:25.835 --> 00:05:30.063
Scientists can use this technology
to track endangered wildlife.
