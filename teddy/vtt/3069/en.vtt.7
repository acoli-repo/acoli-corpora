00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.689
although people have worked
for decades to make this a reality.

00:03:31.826 --> 00:03:35.332
Forces such as colonialism and racism

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.617
and gender inequality

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.785
have actually excluded many people
from the benefits of space

00:03:42.751 --> 00:03:46.292
and caused us to believe
that space is for the few

00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:48.542
or the rich or elite.

00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:52.185
But we cannot afford this attitude,

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.340
because the world is engaged
in a vital mission

00:03:55.364 --> 00:03:57.368
to improve life for everyone.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.049
Our road map for this mission comes
from the 17 Sustainable Development Goals
