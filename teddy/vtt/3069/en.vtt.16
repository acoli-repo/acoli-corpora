Often, as we develop technology
for astronauts and exploration

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.230
or for spacecraft,

00:08:02.254 --> 00:08:05.813
we can also transfer those inventions
to improve life on Earth.

00:08:05.837 --> 00:08:07.171
Here's one of my favorites.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:08.951
It's a water filtration system,

00:08:08.975 --> 00:08:11.998
and a key component of it
is based on the technology

00:08:12.022 --> 00:08:14.085
to filter wastewater on the space station.

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:16.220
It's now being used around the world.

00:08:16.795 --> 00:08:20.213
Space is also an infinite source
of inspiration,

00:08:20.237 --> 00:08:21.418
through education,

00:08:21.442 --> 00:08:23.076
through research and astronomy

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.232
and that age-old experience of stargazing.

00:08:26.818 --> 00:08:30.097
Now, countries around the world
are engaging in advancing
