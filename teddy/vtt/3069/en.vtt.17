by increasing their local knowledge
of engineering and science and space.

00:08:35.644 --> 00:08:39.511
Let's meet some of the world's
newest satellite engineers.

00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:43.300
This is Elyka Abello, from Venezuela.

00:08:44.264 --> 00:08:47.322
Elyka is training as a satellite engineer

00:08:47.346 --> 00:08:50.162
as part of her national
satellite program in Venezuela.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.572
She has designed a software tool

00:08:52.596 --> 00:08:56.347
that allows her team to better design
the power systems for engineering.

00:08:58.036 --> 00:09:00.851
This is Adel Castillo-Duran,
