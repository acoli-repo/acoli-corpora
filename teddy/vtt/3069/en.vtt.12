00:05:59.068 --> 00:06:01.850
operated by over 60 government agencies,

00:06:01.874 --> 00:06:04.093
and these are just
those observing the Earth.

00:06:04.117 --> 00:06:06.512
And meanwhile, companies
are adding to this list.

00:06:07.157 --> 00:06:10.994
Most of the governments provide the data
from the satellites for free online.

00:06:11.018 --> 00:06:14.196
Some of these satellites
provide images like this,

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.632
that show what you would see
from a camera.

00:06:16.656 --> 00:06:19.597
This is an image showing
agricultural land in Kansas.

00:06:20.742 --> 00:06:23.627
However, the majority
of the Earth observation satellites

00:06:23.651 --> 00:06:25.874
don't take pictures at all.

00:06:25.898 --> 00:06:27.425
They take measurements.

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.550
And they combine these measurements
with complex computer models
