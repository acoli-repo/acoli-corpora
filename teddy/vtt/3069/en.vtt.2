00:00:58.316 --> 00:01:02.333
it was the combined effort
of a team of thousands of people

00:01:02.357 --> 00:01:03.648
who worked together

00:01:03.672 --> 00:01:06.956
to make was seemed impossible a reality.

00:01:07.991 --> 00:01:11.720
And I wanted to join that team.

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:17.167
So I decided to apply to a university
where I could study aerospace engineering.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:18.984
And the following year,

00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:21.572
I started at MIT
in my engineering training

00:01:21.596 --> 00:01:24.338
and joined a student project
building space robots.

00:01:25.146 --> 00:01:27.025
And everything was going as I planned,

00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:32.479
except I was confused
about something important.
