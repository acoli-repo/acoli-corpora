00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.550
And they combine these measurements
with complex computer models

00:06:30.574 --> 00:06:33.853
and make beautiful,
global visualizations such as this one,

00:06:33.877 --> 00:06:35.783
showing the ocean currents

00:06:35.807 --> 00:06:37.831
and the temperature
of the ocean, globally.

00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:45.167
Or we can look at the salt and smoke
and dust in the atmosphere,

00:06:47.561 --> 00:06:50.236
or the rainfall and snowfall, globally,

00:06:53.085 --> 00:06:58.086
as well as the annual cycle of vegetation
on land and in the ocean.
