Those of you who may remember me from TEDGlobal

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
remember me asking a few questions

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which still preoccupy me.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
One of them was: Why is it necessary to spend

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
six billion pounds

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
speeding up the Eurostar train

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
when, for about 10 percent of that money,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
you could have top supermodels, male and female,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
serving free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
for the entire duration of the journey?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You'd still have five billion left in change,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now, you may remember me asking the question as well,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
a very interesting observation,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that actually those strange little signs
