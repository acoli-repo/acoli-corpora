00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well after many years working in trade and economics,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
four years ago,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I found myself working on the front lines

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of human vulnerability.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I found myself in the places

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
where people are fighting every day to survive

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and can't even obtain a meal.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This red cup comes from Rwanda

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
from a child named Fabian.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And I carry this around

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
as a symbol, really, of the challenge

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and also the hope.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Because one cup of food a day
