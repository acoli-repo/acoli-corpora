00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.176
So we see a delivery driver
deliver the medicine

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.400
to the patient's home.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.936
A nurse joins him
and actually administers the drug

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.159
at the patient's home.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:40.376
It's that simple.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.015
Remember my buddy, Art?

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.816
He can now get the IV antibiotics
in the comfort of his home:

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.576
no hospital pajamas, no crappy food

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.456
and no risk of these
antibiotic-resistant superbugs

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.856
that only bite you in these hospitals.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.136
And it goes further.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.656
So now the elderly people
can get the treatment that they need
