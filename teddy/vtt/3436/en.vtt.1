00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.040
Well, it's all of that, and it's more.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.656
Patients often have
to travel long distances

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.280
to get to their nearest hospital,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.256
and access to hospital care
is becoming more and more an issue

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.936
in rural areas,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.256
in the US,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.080
but also in sparsely populated
countries like Sweden.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.120
And even when hospitals are more abundant,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.056
typically the poor and the elderly

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.136
have trouble getting care
because they lack transportation

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.600
that is convenient and affordable to them.
