00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.240
can move to the patient's home.

And that's mainly for those patients
who suffer from chronic diseases.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.536
With that, hospitals can and should

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.496
reduce to smaller,
agile and mobile care centers

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.800
