00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.080
Medical errors are reported to be
the third cause of death in the US,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.536
just behind cancer and heart disease,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.040
the third cause of death.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.776
I'm in health care for over 20 years now,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.480
and I witness every day how broken
and how obsolete our hospital system is.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.176
Let me give you two examples.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.456
Four in 10 Japanese medical doctors

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.296
and five in 10 American medical doctors

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.520
are burnt out.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.976
In my home country, the Netherlands,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.176
only 17 million people live there.
