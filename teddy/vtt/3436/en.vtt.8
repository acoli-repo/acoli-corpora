00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.936
So things like neonatology,
intensive care, surgery and imaging

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.016
will still remain at the hospitals,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.800
at least I believe
for the foreseeable future.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.576
A few weeks ago, I met a colleague

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.856
whose mom was diagnosed
with incurable cancer,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.696
and she said, "Niels, it's hard.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.480
It's so hard when we know
that she's got only months to live.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.616
Instead of playing with the grandchildren,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.136
she now has to travel three times a week

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.136
two hours up and down to Amsterdam

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.080
just to get her treatment and tests."
