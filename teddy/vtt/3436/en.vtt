Probably not a surprise to you,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.336
but I don't like to be in a hospital

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.016
or go to a hospital.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.816
Do you?

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.296
I'm sure many of you
feel the same way, right?

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.335
But why? Why is it
that we hate hospitals so much?

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.720
Or is it just a fact of life
we have to live with?

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.440
Is it the crappy food?

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.536
Is it the expensive parking?

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.336
Is it the intense smell?

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.240
Or is it the fear of the unknown?

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.040
Well, it's all of that, and it's more.
