00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.136
have been improvements
in reduction in stress,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.720
anxiety disorders and depression.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.576
Home health care also helped them
to get back a sense of normality

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.936
and freedom in their lives,

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.000
and they've actually helped them
to forget about their disease.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.216
But home health care, Niels --

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.136
what if I don't even have a home,
when I'm homeless,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.536
or when I do have a home
but there's no one to take care of me

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.240
or even open up the door?
