00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.416
Well, in comes our sharing economy,

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.336
or, as I like to call it,
the Airbnb for home care.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.696
In the Netherlands,
we see churches and care organizations

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.576
match people in need of care and company

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.736
with people who actually
have a home for them

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.720
and can provide care and company to them.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.416
Home health care is cheaper,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.056
it's easier to facilitate,
and it's quick to set up --

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.656
in these rural areas we talked about,
but also in humanitarian crisis situations

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:34.360
where it's often safer, quicker
and cheaper to set things up at home.
