00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.296
We figured out how to make insulin.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.096
We invented pacemakers and X-ray,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.720
and we even came into this wonderful
new era of cell and gene therapies.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.296
But the biggest change
to fix our hospital system altogether

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.336
is still ahead of us.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.216
And I believe it's time now,
we have the opportunity,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.296
to revolutionize the system altogether

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.096
and forget about
our current hospital system.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.336
I believe it's time to create a new system

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.920
that revolves around health care at home.
