00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.016
So here we see
that over the last 50 years,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.056
health care expense has grown
from about five percent in Germany

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.920
to about 11 percent now.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.960
In the US, we've seen growth
from six percent to over 17 percent now.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.136
And a large portion of these costs
are driven by investments

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.920
in large, shiny hospital buildings.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.536
And these buildings are not flexible,

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.696
and they maintain a system
where hospital beds need to be filled

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.360
for a hospital to run efficiently.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.680
There's no incentive
for a hospital to run with less beds.
