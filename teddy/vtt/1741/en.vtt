00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.898
I have a friend in Portugal

00:00:02.898 --> 00:00:05.322
whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:08.474
and a washing machine so he could transport his family.

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:11.018
He did it because he couldn't afford a car,

00:00:11.018 --> 00:00:13.922
but also because he knew how to build one.

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:17.058
There was a time when we understood how things worked

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:20.890
and how they were made, so we could build and repair them,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.017
or at the very least

00:00:22.017 --> 00:00:25.497
make informed decisions about what to buy.

00:00:25.497 --> 00:00:27.889
Many of these do-it-yourself practices

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:31.098
were lost in the second half of the 20th century.
