00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:30.980
I heard footsteps behind me

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:33.167
that seemed to have
approached out of nowhere

00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:34.591
and were picking up pace.

00:00:35.778 --> 00:00:38.305
Before I had time to process
what was happening,

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.460
a hand was clapped around my mouth
so that I could not breathe,

00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:44.184
and the young man behind me
dragged me to the ground,

00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:46.334
beat my head repeatedly
against the pavement

00:00:46.358 --> 00:00:48.340
until my face began to bleed,

00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:50.572
kicking me in the back and neck

00:00:50.596 --> 00:00:52.248
while he began to assault me,

00:00:52.272 --> 00:00:54.734
ripping off my clothes
and telling me to "shut up,"

00:00:54.758 --> 00:00:56.417
as I struggled to cry for help.

00:00:57.423 --> 00:00:59.819
With each smack of my head
to the concrete ground,

00:00:59.843 --> 00:01:02.773
a question echoed through my mind
that still haunts me today:
