00:03:32.717 --> 00:03:34.437
At the time of writing this letter,

00:03:34.461 --> 00:03:36.316
I was studying for my exams in Oxford,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.724
and I was working
on the local student paper there.

00:03:38.748 --> 00:03:42.048
Despite being lucky enough to have
friends and family supporting me,

00:03:42.072 --> 00:03:43.280
it was an isolating time.

00:03:43.304 --> 00:03:45.791
I didn't know anyone
who'd been through this before;

00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:47.259
at least I didn't think I did.

00:03:47.283 --> 00:03:50.777
I'd read news reports, statistics,
and knew how common sexual assault was,

00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:52.858
yet I couldn't actually name
a single person

00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:55.965
that I'd heard speak out
about an experience of this kind before.

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.926
So in a somewhat spontaneous decision,

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.946
I decided that I would publish
my letter in the student paper,
