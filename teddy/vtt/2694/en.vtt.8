00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.946
I decided that I would publish
my letter in the student paper,

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.878
hoping to reach out to others in Oxford

00:04:02.902 --> 00:04:06.273
that might have had a similar experience
and be feeling the same way.

00:04:06.297 --> 00:04:07.523
At the end of the letter,

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:09.913
I asked others to write in
with their experiences

00:04:09.937 --> 00:04:11.629
under the hashtag, "#NotGuilty,"

00:04:11.653 --> 00:04:14.679
to emphasize that survivors of assault
could express themselves

00:04:14.703 --> 00:04:17.609
without feeling shame or guilt
about what happened to them --

00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:20.209
to show that we could all
stand up to sexual assault.

00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:23.065
What I never anticipated
is that almost overnight,

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:25.007
this published letter would go viral.

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:28.145
Soon, we were receiving
hundreds of stories

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.952
from men and women across the world,

00:04:29.976 --> 00:04:32.648
which we began to publish
on a website I set up.
