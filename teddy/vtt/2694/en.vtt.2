00:00:59.843 --> 00:01:02.773
a question echoed through my mind
that still haunts me today:

00:01:03.118 --> 00:01:05.327
"Is this going to be how it all ends?"

00:01:06.828 --> 00:01:09.740
Little could I have realized,
I'd been followed the whole way

00:01:09.764 --> 00:01:11.715
from the moment I left the station.

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:12.942
And hours later,

00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:16.510
I was standing topless and barelegged
in front of the police,

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:19.306
having the cuts and bruises
on my naked body photographed

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.852
for forensic evidence.

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:25.195
Now, there are few words to describe
the all-consuming feelings

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.424
of vulnerability, shame, upset
and injustice that I was ridden with

00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:30.504
in that moment and for the weeks to come.
