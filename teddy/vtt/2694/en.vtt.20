00:09:59.737 --> 00:10:01.651
but we need to break out of these cycles

00:10:01.675 --> 00:10:04.783
if we are to hope to transform
negative events of injustice

00:10:04.807 --> 00:10:06.510
into positive social change.

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:08.079
To do otherwise

00:10:08.103 --> 00:10:11.382
continues to let the enemy
determine the grounds for battle,

00:10:11.406 --> 00:10:12.592
creates a binary,

00:10:12.616 --> 00:10:15.120
where we who have suffered
become the affected,

00:10:15.144 --> 00:10:17.524
pitted against them, the perpetrators.

00:10:18.143 --> 00:10:20.013
And just like we got back on our tubes,

00:10:20.037 --> 00:10:23.073
we can't let our platforms
for interconnectivity and community

00:10:23.097 --> 00:10:25.169
be the places that we settle for defeat.

00:10:27.072 --> 00:10:30.588
But I don't want to discourage
a social media response,
