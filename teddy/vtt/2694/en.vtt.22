00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.272
yet it's still a problem we don't give
the same airtime to as other issues.

00:11:02.296 --> 00:11:04.816
It's still an issue many people
blame victims for.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.122
Next, ask yourself: How,
in recognizing these reasons,

00:11:08.146 --> 00:11:09.822
could I go about reversing them?

00:11:10.183 --> 00:11:13.771
With us, this was holding my attacker
to account -- and many others.

00:11:13.795 --> 00:11:16.401
It was calling them out
on the effect they had caused.

00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:19.159
It was giving airtime
to the issue of sexual assault,

00:11:19.183 --> 00:11:22.544
opening up discussions amongst friends,
amongst families, in the media

00:11:22.568 --> 00:11:24.209
that had been closed for too long,

00:11:24.233 --> 00:11:26.590
and stressing that victims
shouldn't feel to blame

00:11:26.614 --> 00:11:27.885
for what happened to them.

00:11:27.909 --> 00:11:31.227
We might still have a long way to go
in solving this problem entirely.
