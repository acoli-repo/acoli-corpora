WEBVTT

00:04:29.976 --> 00:04:32.648
which we began to publish
on a website I set up.

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:34.730
And the hashtag became a campaign.

00:04:35.652 --> 00:04:39.342
There was an Australian mother in her 40s
who described how on an evening out,

00:04:39.366 --> 00:04:40.922
she was followed to the bathroom

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:43.272
by a man who went
to repeatedly grab her crotch.

00:04:43.296 --> 00:04:44.918
There was a man in the Netherlands

00:04:44.942 --> 00:04:47.634
who described how he was date-raped
on a visit to London

00:04:47.658 --> 00:04:50.540
and wasn't taken seriously
by anyone he reported his case to.

00:04:50.564 --> 00:04:53.998
I had personal Facebook messages
from people in India and South America,

00:04:54.022 --> 00:04:57.133
saying, how can we bring
the message of the campaign there?

00:04:57.173 --> 00:04:59.971
One of the first contributions we had
was from a woman called Nikki,

00:04:59.995 --> 00:05:02.812
who described growing up,
being molested my her own father.
