00:05:29.748 --> 00:05:32.738
and I feel hopeful that if so many
women can move forward,

00:05:32.762 --> 00:05:33.944
then I can, too.

00:05:33.968 --> 00:05:35.275
I've been inspired by many,

and I hope I can be as strong
as them someday.

00:05:37.516 --> 00:05:38.670
I'm sure I will."

00:05:39.082 --> 00:05:41.808
People around the world began
tweeting under this hashtag,

00:05:41.832 --> 00:05:44.909
and the letter was republished
and covered by the national press,

00:05:44.933 --> 00:05:48.229

other languages worldwide.

00:05:48.642 --> 00:05:51.016

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.651
that this letter was attracting.

00:05:52.675 --> 00:05:54.753
For something to be front-page news,

00:05:54.777 --> 00:05:57.744
given the word "news" itself,

00:05:57.768 --> 00:06:01.148
we can assume it must be something new
or something surprising.
