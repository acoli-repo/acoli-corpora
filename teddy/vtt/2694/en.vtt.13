00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:33.056
The voices of those directly affected
were at the forefront of the story --

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.306
not the voices of journalists
or commentators on social media.

00:06:36.733 --> 00:06:39.116
And that's why the story was news.

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:42.346
We live in an incredibly
interconnected world

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.270
with the proliferation of social media,

00:06:44.294 --> 00:06:47.927
which is of course a fantastic resource
for igniting social change.

00:06:47.951 --> 00:06:50.678
But it's also made us
increasingly reactive,

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:54.089
from the smallest annoyances
of, "Oh, my train's been delayed,"

00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:58.484
to the greatest injustices of war,
genocides, terrorist attacks.

00:06:58.508 --> 00:07:02.006
Our default response has become
to leap to react to any kind of grievance
