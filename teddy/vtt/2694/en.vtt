00:00:01.097 --> 00:00:03.134
It was April, last year.

00:00:03.714 --> 00:00:05.461
I was on an evening out with friends

00:00:05.485 --> 00:00:07.238
to celebrate one of their birthdays.

00:00:07.677 --> 00:00:10.070
We hadn't been all together
for a couple of weeks;

00:00:10.094 --> 00:00:12.490
it was a perfect evening,
as we were all reunited.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.473
At the end of the evening,

00:00:14.497 --> 00:00:18.182
I caught the last underground train
back to the other side of London.

00:00:18.663 --> 00:00:20.455
The journey was smooth.

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:21.987
I got back to my local station

00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:24.038
and I began the 10-minute walk home.

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:27.523
As I turned the corner onto my street,

00:00:27.547 --> 00:00:29.063
my house in sight up ahead,

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:30.980
I heard footsteps behind me
