00:10:27.072 --> 00:10:30.588
But I don't want to discourage
a social media response,

00:10:30.612 --> 00:10:33.279
because I owe the development
of the #NotGuilty campaign

00:10:33.303 --> 00:10:34.847
almost entirely to social media.

00:10:34.871 --> 00:10:37.396
But I do want to encourage
a more considered approach

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.543
to the way we use it
to respond to injustice.

00:10:39.567 --> 00:10:42.018
The start, I think,
is to ask ourselves two things.

00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:44.574
Firstly: Why do I feel this injustice?

00:10:44.598 --> 00:10:46.904
In my case, there were
several answers to this.

00:10:46.928 --> 00:10:49.161
Someone had hurt me and those who I loved,

00:10:49.185 --> 00:10:52.085
under the assumption they
wouldn't have to be held to account

00:10:52.109 --> 00:10:54.022
or recognize the damage they had caused.

00:10:54.046 --> 00:10:56.954
Not only that, but thousands
of men and women suffer every day

00:10:56.978 --> 00:10:58.696
from sexual abuse, often in silence,

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.272
yet it's still a problem we don't give
the same airtime to as other issues.
