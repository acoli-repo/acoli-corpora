00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.250
"Did you ever think
of the people in your life?

00:02:01.841 --> 00:02:04.178
I don't know who the people
in your life are.

00:02:04.202 --> 00:02:06.159
I don't know anything about you.

00:02:06.183 --> 00:02:07.815
But I do know this:

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:09.920
you did not just attack me that night.

00:02:10.323 --> 00:02:11.836
I'm a daughter, I'm a friend,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.545
I'm a sister, I'm a pupil,

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.871
I'm a cousin, I'm a niece,

00:02:14.895 --> 00:02:16.062
I'm a neighbor;

00:02:16.086 --> 00:02:18.135
I'm the employee
who served everyone coffee

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:19.712
in the café under the railway.

00:02:20.362 --> 00:02:22.848
And all the people who form
these relations to me

00:02:22.872 --> 00:02:24.525
make up my community.

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.684
And you assaulted
every single one of them.

00:02:27.418 --> 00:02:30.254
You violated the truth that I
will never cease to fight for,
