00:06:58.508 --> 00:07:02.006
Our default response has become
to leap to react to any kind of grievance

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.178
by tweeting, Facebooking, hastagging --

00:07:04.202 --> 00:07:06.854
anything to show others
that we, too, have reacted.

00:07:07.798 --> 00:07:10.111
The problem with reacting
in this manner en masse

00:07:10.135 --> 00:07:13.056
is it can sometimes mean
that we don't actually react at all,

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.529
not in the sense of actually
doing anything, anyway.

00:07:15.553 --> 00:07:17.291
It might make ourselves feel better,

00:07:17.315 --> 00:07:19.866
like we've contributed
to a group mourning or outrage,

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.852
but it doesn't actually change anything.

00:07:21.876 --> 00:07:23.040
And what's more,

00:07:23.064 --> 00:07:24.868
it can sometimes drown out the voices

00:07:24.892 --> 00:07:26.990
of those directly
affected by the injustice,

00:07:27.014 --> 00:07:28.593
whose needs must be heard.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.633
Worrying, too, is the tendency
for some reactions to injustice
