00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:30.504
in that moment and for the weeks to come.

00:01:31.868 --> 00:01:34.492
But wanting to find a way
to condense these feelings

00:01:34.516 --> 00:01:36.838
into something ordered
that I could work through,

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:38.997
I decided to do what
felt most natural to me:

00:01:39.322 --> 00:01:40.557
I wrote about it.

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.582
It started out as a cathartic exercise.

00:01:43.606 --> 00:01:46.664
I wrote a letter to my assaulter,

00:01:46.688 --> 00:01:48.783
humanizing him as "you,"

00:01:48.807 --> 00:01:51.684
to identify him as part
of the very community

00:01:51.708 --> 00:01:53.856
that he had so violently
abused that night.

00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:57.265
Stressing the tidal-wave
effect of his actions,

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.505
I wrote:

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.250
"Did you ever think
of the people in your life?
