00:11:27.909 --> 00:11:31.227
We might still have a long way to go
in solving this problem entirely.

00:11:31.251 --> 00:11:32.402
But in this way,

00:11:32.426 --> 00:11:35.737
we can begin to use social media
as an active tool for social justice,

00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:37.859
as a tool to educate,
to stimulate dialogues,

00:11:37.883 --> 00:11:40.568
to make those in positions
of authority aware of an issue

00:11:40.592 --> 00:11:43.113
by listening to those
directly affected by it.

00:11:44.112 --> 00:11:48.582
Because sometimes these questions
don't have easy answers.

00:11:48.606 --> 00:11:50.272
In fact, they rarely do.

00:11:50.715 --> 00:11:53.979
But this doesn't mean we still
can't give them a considered response.

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.574
In situations where
you can't go about thinking

00:11:56.598 --> 00:11:58.693
how you'd reverse
this feeling of injustice,

00:11:58.717 --> 00:12:01.371
you can still think,
maybe not what you can do,
