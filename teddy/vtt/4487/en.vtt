00:00:00.996 --> 00:00:02.836
I am the daughter of a forger,

00:00:04.436 --> 00:00:05.876
not just any forger ...

00:00:05.876 --> 00:00:09.156
When you hear the word “forger,”
you often think “mercenary.”

00:00:09.156 --> 00:00:12.316
You think “forged currency,”
“forged pictures.”

00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:14.476
My father is no such man.

00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:15.916
For 30 years of his life,

00:00:16.476 --> 00:00:18.236
he forged papers --

00:00:18.236 --> 00:00:20.436
never for himself,
always for other people,

00:00:20.436 --> 00:00:23.236
and to helpf the persecuted
and the oppressed.

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:26.116
Let me introduce him.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:28.956
Here is my father at age 19.

00:00:29.036 --> 00:00:32.956
It all began for him during World War II,
