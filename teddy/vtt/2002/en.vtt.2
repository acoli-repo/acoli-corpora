There's simply no economic model that that would be possible.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And if I told you it was all coming for free,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
you would say, this is simply -- you're dreaming.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You're a Californian utopian. You're a wild-eyed optimist.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And yet it's here.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
as I looked at what even Wired was talking about,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
we thought it was going to be TV, but better.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
That was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
was going to be coming.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And it turns out that that's not what it was.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
First of all, it was impossible, and it's not what it was.
