00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
I would link to my particular flight, my particular seat.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And so, giving an example of this thing,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I live in Pacifica, rather than -- right now Pacifica

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
The Web doesn't know that that is actually a town,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
and that it's a specific town that I live in,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
but that's what we're going to be talking about.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
It's going to link directly to --

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
it will know, the Web will be able to read itself

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and know that that actually is a place,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and that whenever it sees that word, "Pacifica,"

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
it knows that it actually has a place,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
latitude, longitude, a certain population.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
So here are some of the technical terms, all three-letter things,
