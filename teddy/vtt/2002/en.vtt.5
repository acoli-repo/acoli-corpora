00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
but that we're basically constructing a single, global machine.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And so I began to think about that.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And it turned out that this machine happens to be

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
the most reliable machine that we've ever made.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It has not crashed; it's running uninterrupted.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And there's almost no other machine that we've ever made

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that runs the number of hours, the number of days.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
5,000 days without interruption -- that's just unbelievable.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And of course, the Internet is longer than just 5,000 days;

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
the Web is only 5,000 days.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So, I was trying to basically make measurements.
