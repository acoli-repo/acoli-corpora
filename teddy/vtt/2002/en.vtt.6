00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So, I was trying to basically make measurements.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
What are the dimensions of this machine?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
all around the globe on all the computers.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And there is a 100 billion clicks per day.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And there's 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan, the photographer,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
talking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless?
