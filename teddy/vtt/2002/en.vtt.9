00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So I did something else. I figured out 100 billion clicks per day,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
55 trillion links is almost the same

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
as the number of synapses in your brain.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
A quadrillion transistors is almost the same

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
as the number of neurons in your brain.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So to a first approximation, we have these things --

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
twenty petahertz synapse firings.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Of course, the memory is really huge.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
But to a first approximation, the size of this machine is the size --

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and its complexity, kind of -- to your brain.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Because in fact, that's how your brain works -- in kind of the same way that the Web works.
