00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and you're kind of touching the cloud with this.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And so in some ways, all you really need is a cloudbook.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It's wireless. It's always connected.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
There's many things about it. It becomes very simple,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
you're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So the machine is computing.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And in some ways, it's sort of back

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
to the kind of old idea of centralized computing.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
But everything, all the cameras, and the microphones,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and the sensors in cars
