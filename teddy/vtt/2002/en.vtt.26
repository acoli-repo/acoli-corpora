00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
that it's not just virtual, it's actually going out to things.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
So something will resolve down to the information

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
about a particular person, so every person will have a unique ID.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Every person, every item will have a something

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
that will be very specific, and will link

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
to a specific representation of that idea or item.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
So now, in this new one, when I link to it,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
I would link to my particular flight, my particular seat.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And so, giving an example of this thing,
