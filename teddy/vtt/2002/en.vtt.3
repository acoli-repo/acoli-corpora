00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
First of all, it was impossible, and it's not what it was.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And so one of the things that I think we're learning --

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
if you think about, like, Wikipedia,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
it's something that was simply impossible.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It's impossible in theory, but possible in practice.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And if you take all these things that are impossible,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I think one of the things that we're learning from this era,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
from this last decade, is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
because we're unprepared for it.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So, I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
But if that's happened in the last 5,000 days,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days?
