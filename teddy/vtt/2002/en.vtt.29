All this data about you should just be conveyed,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and you should do it once and that's all that should happen.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And you should have all the networks

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
of all the relationships between those pieces of data.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
That's what we're moving into -- where it sort of knows these things down to that level.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
A semantic Web, Web 3.0, giant global graph --

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
we're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
But what's it's doing is sharing data.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
So you have to be open to having your data shared, which is a much bigger step

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
than just sharing your Web page, or your computer.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And all these things that are going to be on this
