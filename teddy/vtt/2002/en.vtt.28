00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
So here are some of the technical terms, all three-letter things,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
that you'll see a lot more of.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
All these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So I'll give you one kind of an example.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
There's like a billion social sites on the Web.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Each time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and all your friends are.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Why should you be doing that? You should just do that once,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and it should know who all your friends are.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So that's what you want, is all your friends are identified,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
and you should just carry these relationships around.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
All this data about you should just be conveyed,
