00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
But here she became an evangelist, recruiting others

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
to get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Those are the effects that we're going to see.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Attention is the currency.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And the other thing about this embodiment

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
is that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
McLuhan was saying, "Machines are the extensions of the human senses."

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And I'm saying, "Humans are now going to be

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
the extended senses of the machine," in a certain sense.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So we have a trillion eyes, and ears, and touches,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
through all our digital photographs and cameras.
