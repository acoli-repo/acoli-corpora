00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The Internet, the Web as we know it,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the kind of Web -- the things we're all talking about --

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is already less than 5,000 days old.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
which we couldn't even imagine happening before,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
all these things rolling into our lives,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
just this abundance of things that are right before us,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This kind of cornucopia of stuff
