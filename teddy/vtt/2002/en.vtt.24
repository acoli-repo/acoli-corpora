00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And if I want to go in to book a flight,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I go into the airline's flight page, the website of the airline,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and I'm linking to that page.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And what we're sharing were links, so you had to be kind of open with links.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
You couldn't deny -- if someone wanted to link to you,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
you couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
So that's what we were doing.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
We're now entering to the third stage, which is what I'm talking about,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and that is where we link the data.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
So, I don't know what the name of this thing is.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data.
