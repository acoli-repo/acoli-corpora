00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
you had to share packets of information.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
So you were forwarding on. You didn't have control.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
It wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line:

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
you had to share packets.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
The second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So in the old one, if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I went from my computer, to an FTP site, to another airline computer.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Now we have pages -- the unit has been resolved into pages,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
so one page links to another page.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And if I want to go in to book a flight,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I go into the airline's flight page, the website of the airline,
