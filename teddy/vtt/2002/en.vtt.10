00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Because in fact, that's how your brain works -- in kind of the same way that the Web works.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
However, your brain isn't doubling every two years.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So if we say this machine right now that we've made

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
is about one HB, one human brain,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
if we look at the rate that this is increasing,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
30 years from now, there'll be six billion HBs.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So by the year 2040, the total processing of this machine

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
will exceed a total processing power of humanity,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
in raw bits and stuff. And this is, I think, where
