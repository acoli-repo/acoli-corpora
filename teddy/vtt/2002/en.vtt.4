00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So, I have a kind of a simple story,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
this thing that has happened in 5,000 days --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that's all these computers, all these handhelds,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
all these cell phones, all these laptops, all these servers --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
basically what we're getting out of all these connections

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
is we're getting one machine.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
If there is only one machine, and our little handhelds and devices

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
are actually just little windows into those machines,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
but that we're basically constructing a single, global machine.
