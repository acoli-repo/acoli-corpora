00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan, the photographer,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
talking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Well, here's a list of them. They're hard to tell,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
but there's one billion PC chips on the Internet,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
if you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
There's two million emails per second.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So it's a very big number.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It's just a huge machine,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So here's the specifications,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it:

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
emails running at two megahertz itself,
