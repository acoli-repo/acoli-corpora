00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
in the next 5,000 days -- we're going to give this machine a body.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And the second thing is, we're going to restructure its architecture.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And thirdly, we're going to become completely codependent upon it.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So let me go through those three things.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
First of all, we have all these things in our hands.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
We think they're all separate devices,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
but in fact, every screen in the world

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
is looking into the one machine.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
These are all basically portals into that one machine.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
The second thing is that -- some people call this the cloud,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and you're kind of touching the cloud with this.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And so in some ways, all you really need is a cloudbook.
