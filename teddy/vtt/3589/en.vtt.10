00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.226
These are the very smart, revolutionary bits about the iPhone,

00:05:07.226 --> 00:05:11.627
and they're all government-funded.

00:05:11.627 --> 00:05:14.216
And the point is that the Internet

00:05:14.216 --> 00:05:16.460
was funded by DARPA, U.S. Department of Defense.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.355
GPS was funded by the military's Navstar program.

The touchscreen display was funded

00:05:25.052 --> 00:05:29.847
by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF

00:05:29.847 --> 00:05:34.302
to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware.
