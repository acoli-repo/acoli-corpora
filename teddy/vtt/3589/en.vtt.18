00:08:58.433 --> 00:09:01.006
It's actually been the one thinking out of the box.

00:09:01.006 --> 00:09:03.717
But also, I'm sure you all have had experience

00:09:03.717 --> 00:09:05.777
with local, regional, national governments,

00:09:05.777 --> 00:09:08.924
and you're kind of like, "You know what, that Kafka-ian bureaucrat, I've met him."

00:09:08.924 --> 00:09:12.368
That whole juxtaposition thing, it's kind of there.

00:09:12.368 --> 00:09:14.182
Well, there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:09:14.182 --> 00:09:16.348
By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant,

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:18.675
boring, it's sometimes

00:09:18.675 --> 00:09:20.887
that we actually create those organizations in that way.

00:09:20.887 --> 00:09:23.088
So what we have to actually do is build

00:09:23.088 --> 00:09:25.264
these entrepreneurial state organizations.

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:27.753
DARPA, that funded the Internet and Siri,

00:09:27.753 --> 00:09:29.338
actually thought really hard about this,

00:09:29.338 --> 00:09:32.031
how to welcome failure, because you will fail.
