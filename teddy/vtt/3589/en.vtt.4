00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.319
think out of the box.

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.572
They are more dynamic.

00:02:03.572 --> 00:02:06.326
Think of Steve Jobs' really inspirational speech

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:09.464
to the 2005 graduating class at Stanford,

00:02:09.464 --> 00:02:11.556
where he said to be innovative,

00:02:11.556 --> 00:02:14.326
you've got to stay hungry, stay foolish.

00:02:14.326 --> 00:02:15.861
Right? So these guys are kind of the hungry

00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:18.012
and foolish and colorful guys, right?

00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:19.965
And in places like Europe,

00:02:19.965 --> 00:02:21.550
it might be more equitable,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.112
we might even be a bit better dressed

00:02:23.112 --> 00:02:25.378
and eat better than the U.S.,

00:02:25.378 --> 00:02:29.410
but the problem is this damn public sector.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.403
It's a bit too big, and it hasn't actually allowed
