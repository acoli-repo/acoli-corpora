00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.927
commercialization policies which actually allow these companies

00:01:30.927 --> 00:01:33.182
to bring these great inventions, their products,

00:01:33.182 --> 00:01:35.205
to the market and actually get over this

00:01:35.205 --> 00:01:37.456
really scary Death Valley period

00:01:37.456 --> 00:01:40.022
in which many companies instead fail.

00:01:40.022 --> 00:01:42.798
But what really interests me, especially nowadays

00:01:42.798 --> 00:01:45.759
and because of what's happening politically around the world,

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.012
is the language that's used, the narrative,

00:01:49.012 --> 00:01:52.171
the discourse, the images, the actual words.

00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:54.476
So we often are presented

00:01:54.476 --> 00:01:57.449
with the kind of words like that the private sector

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:59.719
is also much more innovative because it's able to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.319
think out of the box.
