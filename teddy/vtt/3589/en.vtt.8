00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.308
It has huge implications, even with this whole notion

00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:04.508
that we have on where, when and why

00:04:04.508 --> 00:04:07.581
we should actually be cutting back on public spending

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:09.626
and different types of public services which,

00:04:09.626 --> 00:04:11.383
of course, as we know, are increasingly being

00:04:11.383 --> 00:04:13.445
outsourced because of this juxtaposition.

00:04:13.445 --> 00:04:16.908
Right? I mean, the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools

00:04:16.908 --> 00:04:20.770
is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.521
by this heavy hand of the state curriculum, or something.

00:04:23.521 --> 00:04:25.504
So these kind of words are constantly,

00:04:25.504 --> 00:04:27.368
these juxtapositions come up everywhere,

00:04:27.368 --> 00:04:30.216
not just with innovation policy.
