00:09:58.487 --> 00:10:00.481
what happened to the reward?

00:10:00.481 --> 00:10:02.855
We all know, if you've ever taken a finance course,

00:10:02.855 --> 00:10:06.261
the first thing you're taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship,

00:10:06.261 --> 00:10:07.881
and so some people are foolish enough

00:10:07.881 --> 00:10:10.343
or probably smart enough if they have time to wait,

00:10:10.343 --> 00:10:12.825
to actually invest in stocks, because they're higher risk

00:10:12.825 --> 00:10:15.345
which over time will make a greater reward than bonds,

00:10:15.345 --> 00:10:16.924
that whole risk-reward thing.

00:10:16.924 --> 00:10:18.897
Well, where's the reward for the state

00:10:18.897 --> 00:10:21.353
of having taken on these massive risks

00:10:21.353 --> 00:10:23.812
and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet?

00:10:23.812 --> 00:10:25.764
The Internet was crazy.

00:10:25.764 --> 00:10:28.916
It really was. I mean, the probability of failure was massive.

00:10:28.916 --> 00:10:31.526
You had to be completely nuts to do it,
