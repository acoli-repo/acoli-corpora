Sitra funded Nokia, kept equity, made a lot of money,

00:12:02.386 --> 00:12:05.046
it's a public funding agency in Finland,

00:12:05.046 --> 00:12:07.872
which then funded the next round of Nokias.

00:12:07.872 --> 00:12:09.881
The Brazilian Development Bank,

00:12:09.881 --> 00:12:12.676
which is providing huge amounts of funds today

00:12:12.676 --> 00:12:14.473
to clean technology, they just announced

00:12:14.473 --> 00:12:18.722
a $56 billion program for the future on this,

00:12:18.722 --> 00:12:22.261

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:28.556
and maybe just brought back

00:12:28.556 --> 00:12:30.981
just something called an innovation fund,
