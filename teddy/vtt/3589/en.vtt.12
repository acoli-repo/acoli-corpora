00:05:57.836 --> 00:06:01.807
divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental.

00:06:01.807 --> 00:06:04.580
So the new molecular entities with priority rating

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.855
are the revolutionary new drugs,

00:06:06.855 --> 00:06:09.756
whereas the slight variations of existing drugs --

00:06:09.756 --> 00:06:11.747
Viagra, different color, different dosage --

00:06:11.747 --> 00:06:14.040
are the less revolutionary ones.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.897
And it turns out that a full 75 percent

00:06:16.897 --> 00:06:19.674
of the new molecular entities with priority rating

00:06:19.674 --> 00:06:24.785
are actually funded in boring, Kafka-ian public sector labs.

00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:27.468
This doesn't mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation.

00:06:27.468 --> 00:06:29.519
They do. They spend on the marketing part.

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:31.667
They spend on the D part of R&amp;D.
