Have you ever asked yourselves why it is that

00:00:03.117 --> 00:00:05.197
companies, the really cool companies,

00:00:05.197 --> 00:00:06.709
the innovative ones, the creative,

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:08.511
new economy-type companies --

00:00:08.511 --> 00:00:11.885
Apple, Google, Facebook --

00:00:11.885 --> 00:00:14.573
are coming out of one particular country,

00:00:14.573 --> 00:00:16.304
the United States of America?

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:18.262
Usually when I say this, someone says, "Spotify!

00:00:18.262 --> 00:00:19.740
That's Europe." But, yeah.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.424
It has not had the impact that these other companies have had.

00:00:23.424 --> 00:00:25.392
Now what I do is I'm an economist,

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:26.880
and I actually study the relationship

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.925
between innovation and economic growth

00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:31.824
at the level of the company, the industry and the nation,
