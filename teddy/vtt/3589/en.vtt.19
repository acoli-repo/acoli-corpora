00:09:29.338 --> 00:09:32.031
how to welcome failure, because you will fail.

00:09:32.031 --> 00:09:33.956
You will fail when you innovative.

00:09:33.956 --> 00:09:37.828
One out of 10 experiments has any success.

00:09:37.828 --> 00:09:39.566
And the V.C. guys know this,

00:09:39.566 --> 00:09:41.438
and they're able to actually fund the other losses

00:09:41.438 --> 00:09:43.292
from that one success.

00:09:43.292 --> 00:09:44.785
And this brings me, actually, probably,

00:09:44.785 --> 00:09:47.380
to the biggest implication,

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.047
and this has huge implications beyond innovation.

00:09:50.047 --> 00:09:53.707
If the state is more than just a market fixer,

00:09:53.707 --> 00:09:55.519
if it actually is a market shaper,

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:58.487
and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk,

00:09:58.487 --> 00:10:00.481
what happened to the reward?
