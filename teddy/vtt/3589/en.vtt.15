00:07:28.736 --> 00:07:30.525
They want their returns in three to five years.

00:07:30.525 --> 00:07:33.054
Innovation takes a much longer time than that,

00:07:33.054 --> 00:07:34.881
15 to 20 years.

00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:37.268
And so this whole notion -- I mean, this is the point, right?

00:07:37.268 --> 00:07:39.595
Who's actually funding the hard stuff?

00:07:39.595 --> 00:07:41.320
Of course, it's not just the state.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.550
The private sector does a lot.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.749
But the narrative that we've always been told

00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:47.632
is the state is important for the basics,

00:07:47.632 --> 00:07:49.912
but not really providing that sort of high-risk,

00:07:49.912 --> 00:07:52.212
revolutionary thinking out of the box.

00:07:52.212 --> 00:07:54.544
In all these sectors, from funding the Internet

00:07:54.544 --> 00:07:57.449
to doing the spending, but also the envisioning,

00:07:57.449 --> 00:07:59.740
the strategic vision, for these investments,

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.328
it was actually coming within the state.
