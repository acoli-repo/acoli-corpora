00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:31.824
at the level of the company, the industry and the nation,

00:00:31.824 --> 00:00:33.939
and I work with policymakers worldwide,

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:35.410
especially in the European Commission,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.721
but recently also in interesting places like China,

00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:40.596
and I can tell you that that question

00:00:40.596 --> 00:00:43.196
is on the tip of all of their tongues:

00:00:43.196 --> 00:00:45.415
Where are the European Googles?

00:00:45.415 --> 00:00:49.160
What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.168
which they understand is different

00:00:51.168 --> 00:00:54.049
from this old economy growth model?

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:56.728
And what is interesting is that often,

00:00:56.728 --> 00:00:58.307
even if we're in the 21st century,

00:00:58.307 --> 00:01:00.690
we kind of come down in the end to these ideas
