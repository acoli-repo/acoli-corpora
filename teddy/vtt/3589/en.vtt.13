They spend on the D part of R&amp;D.

00:06:31.667 --> 00:06:34.214
They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock,

00:06:34.214 --> 00:06:36.115
which is quite problematic.

Now, what's interesting in all of this

00:06:50.554 --> 00:06:52.788
is the state, in all these examples,

00:06:52.788 --> 00:06:56.902
was doing so much more than just fixing market failures.

00:06:56.902 --> 00:06:59.631
It was actually shaping and creating markets.

00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:01.907
It was funding not only the basic research,
