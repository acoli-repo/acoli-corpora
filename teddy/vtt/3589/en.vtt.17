00:08:28.549 --> 00:08:31.598
and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan,

00:08:31.598 --> 00:08:34.350
I think we've actually really stunted the possibility

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.922
to build these public-private partnerships

00:08:35.922 --> 00:08:37.468
in a really dynamic way.

00:08:37.468 --> 00:08:40.662
Even the words that we often use to justify the "P" part,

00:08:40.662 --> 00:08:42.890
the public part -- well, they're both P's --

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:44.250
with public-private partnerships

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.305
is in terms of de-risking.

00:08:46.305 --> 00:08:48.766
What the public sector did in all these examples

00:08:48.766 --> 00:08:50.853
I just gave you, and there's many more,

00:08:50.853 --> 00:08:54.317
which myself and other colleagues have been looking at,

00:08:54.317 --> 00:08:55.867
is doing much more than de-risking.

00:08:55.867 --> 00:08:58.433
It's kind of been taking on that risk. Bring it on.

00:08:58.433 --> 00:09:01.006
It's actually been the one thinking out of the box.
