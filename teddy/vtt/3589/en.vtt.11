00:05:29.847 --> 00:05:34.302
to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware.

00:05:34.302 --> 00:05:36.520
Now, you might be thinking, "Well, she's just said

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.855
the word 'defense' and 'military' an awful lot,"

00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:41.107
but what's really interesting is that this is actually true

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:44.115
in sector after sector and department after department.

00:05:44.115 --> 00:05:46.253
So the pharmaceutical industry, which I am personally

00:05:46.253 --> 00:05:48.182
very interested in because I've actually had the fortune

00:05:48.182 --> 00:05:50.896
to study it in quite some depth,

00:05:50.896 --> 00:05:53.073
is wonderful to be asking this question

00:05:53.073 --> 00:05:55.820
about the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits,

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.836
because each and every medicine can actually be

00:05:57.836 --> 00:06:01.807
divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental.
