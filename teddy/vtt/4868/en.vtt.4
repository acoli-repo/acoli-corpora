because it relied on axioms that 
everyone in the field already agreed on.

00:02:02.952 --> 00:02:06.222
Of course, many disagreements involve 
different beliefs

00:02:06.222 --> 00:02:08.994
that can’t simply be reconciled
through logic.

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:11.758
When these beliefs involve 
outside information,

00:02:11.758 --> 00:02:16.672
the issue often comes down to
what sources and authorities people trust.

00:02:16.672 --> 00:02:19.831
One study asked people to estimate 
several statistics

00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:22.393
related to the scope of climate change.

00:02:22.393 --> 00:02:24.471
Participants were asked questions,

00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:29.297
such as “how many of the years 
between 1995 and 2006

00:02:29.297 --> 00:02:33.819
were one of the hottest 12 years 
since 1850?”
