00:01:28.845 --> 00:01:31.185
and what they value.

00:01:31.185 --> 00:01:35.615
Mathematical and logical arguments 
like the dinner party brainteaser work

00:01:35.615 --> 00:01:38.215
because even when people 
reach different conclusions,

00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:41.543
they’re starting from 
the same set of shared beliefs.

00:01:41.543 --> 00:01:47.562
In 1931, a young, unknown mathematician 
named Kurt Gödel presented a proof

00:01:47.562 --> 00:01:51.347
that a logically complete
system of mathematics was impossible.

00:01:51.347 --> 00:01:54.553
Despite upending decades of
work by brilliant mathematicians

00:01:54.553 --> 00:01:56.824
like Bertrand Russell and David Hilbert,

00:01:56.824 --> 00:01:58.203
the proof was accepted

00:01:58.203 --> 00:02:02.952
because it relied on axioms that 
everyone in the field already agreed on.
