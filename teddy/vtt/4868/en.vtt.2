Researchers presented participants 
with a news article

00:01:01.938 --> 00:01:05.574
that showed no weapons 
of mass destruction had been found.

00:01:05.574 --> 00:01:10.669
Yet many participants not only continued 
to believe that WMDs had been found,

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:14.528
but they even became more convinced 
of their original views.

00:01:14.528 --> 00:01:20.136
So why do arguments change people’s minds 
in some cases and backfire in others?

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:25.034
Arguments are more convincing when they 
rest on a good knowledge of the audience,

00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:27.615
taking into account 
what the audience believes,

00:01:27.615 --> 00:01:28.845
who they trust,

00:01:28.845 --> 00:01:31.185
and what they value.
