Three people are at a dinner party.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.054
Paul, who’s married, is looking at Linda.

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:17.480
Meanwhile, Linda is looking at John, 
who’s not married.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.964
Is someone who’s married looking 
at someone who’s not married?

00:00:20.964 --> 00:00:24.564
Take a moment to think about it.

00:00:24.564 --> 00:00:28.395
Most people answer that there’s 
not enough information to tell.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:30.530
And most people are wrong.
