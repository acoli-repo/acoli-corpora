00:03:28.336 --> 00:03:30.279
Arguments based on fairness—

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:32.733
like that the military provides employment

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:35.458
and education to people 
from disadvantaged backgrounds—

00:03:35.458 --> 00:03:39.093
were more convincing than arguments 
based on loyalty—

00:03:39.093 --> 00:03:41.935

00:03:41.935 --> 00:03:44.323
These three elements—

00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:47.169
beliefs, trusted sources, and values—

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:51.232
may seem like a simple formula 
for finding agreement and consensus.

00:03:51.232 --> 00:03:55.446
The problem is that our initial 
inclination is to think of arguments

00:03:55.446 --> 00:03:59.660
that rely on our own beliefs, 
trusted sources, and values.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.953
And even when we don’t,
