And even when we don’t,

00:04:00.953 --> 00:04:04.496
it can be challenging to correctly 
identify what’s held dear

00:04:04.496 --> 00:04:07.259
by people who don’t already agree with us.

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:10.043
The best way to find out
is simply to talk to them.

00:04:10.043 --> 00:04:11.749
In the course of discussion,

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:14.927
you’ll be exposed to counter-arguments
and rebuttals.

00:04:14.927 --> 00:04:19.094
These can help you make your own 
arguments and reasoning more convincing

00:04:19.094 --> 00:04:23.303
and sometimes, you may even end up 
being the one changing your mind.
