00:09:24.512 --> 00:09:30.385
Is what unites us not far greater
than what can ever divide?

00:09:31.663 --> 00:09:35.453
Does it have to take
a tragedy or a disaster

00:09:35.477 --> 00:09:39.973
for us to feel deeply
connected as one species,

00:09:40.902 --> 00:09:42.761
as human beings?

00:09:43.755 --> 00:09:48.961
And when will we embrace
the wisdom of our era

00:09:49.764 --> 00:09:53.134
to rise above mere tolerance

00:09:53.931 --> 00:09:56.868
and move to an acceptance

00:09:56.892 --> 00:10:02.225
for all who are only a label
until we know them?
