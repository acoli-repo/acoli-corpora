00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:00.445
They didn't know that I published
architecture and design journals,

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.785
that I was a Fellow
of the Royal Society of Arts,

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:05.274
that I wore black --

00:04:06.695 --> 00:04:07.861
still do --

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:11.122
that I smoked cigarillos.

00:04:11.888 --> 00:04:14.191
I don't smoke cigarillos anymore.

00:04:14.215 --> 00:04:18.399
I drank gin and I watched TED Talks,

00:04:18.423 --> 00:04:24.629
of course, never dreaming
that one day I would be standing,

00:04:25.593 --> 00:04:28.488
balancing on prosthetic legs,

00:04:28.512 --> 00:04:29.669
giving a talk.
