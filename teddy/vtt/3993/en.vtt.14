00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:09.769
purely because I was a human being.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.794
Difference of any kind made no difference

00:07:14.818 --> 00:07:19.375
to the extraordinary lengths
that the rescuers were prepared to go

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:21.669
to save my life,

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:25.181
to save as many unknowns as they could,

00:07:25.205 --> 00:07:27.537
and putting their own lives at risk.

00:07:28.405 --> 00:07:32.576

if I was rich or poor,
