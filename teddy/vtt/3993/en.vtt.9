00:04:30.651 --> 00:04:36.295
I was a young Australian woman
doing extraordinary things in London.

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:39.152
And I wasn't ready for that all to end.

00:04:40.882 --> 00:04:44.040
I was so determined to survive

00:04:44.064 --> 00:04:49.266
that I used my scarf to tie tourniquets
around the tops of my legs,

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.623
and I just shut everything
and everyone out,

00:04:55.345 --> 00:04:58.605
to focus, to listen to myself,

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:01.763
to be guided by instinct alone.
