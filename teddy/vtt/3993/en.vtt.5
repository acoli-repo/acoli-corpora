00:02:26.321 --> 00:02:30.379
We were just a bunch of commuters
who, minutes earlier,

00:02:30.403 --> 00:02:32.887
had followed the Tube etiquette:

00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:35.117
no direct eye contact,

00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:36.291
no talking

00:02:36.894 --> 00:02:39.766
and absolutely no conversation.

00:02:41.948 --> 00:02:44.901
But in the lifting of the darkness,

00:02:45.776 --> 00:02:47.401
we were reaching out.

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:49.691
We were helping each other.

00:02:50.808 --> 00:02:53.269
We were calling out our names,

00:02:53.293 --> 00:02:55.444
a little bit like a roll call,

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.666
waiting for responses.
