as his hand hovered
over the detonation switch.

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:06.884
I've often wondered: What was he thinking?

00:01:06.908 --> 00:01:10.265
Especially in those final seconds.

00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:14.374
I know it wasn't personal.

00:01:14.977 --> 00:01:18.994
He didn't set out to kill
or maim me, Gill Hicks.

00:01:19.018 --> 00:01:20.771
I mean -- he didn't know me.

00:01:21.758 --> 00:01:22.932
No.

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:26.612
Instead, he gave me

00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:31.241
an unwarranted and an unwanted label.
