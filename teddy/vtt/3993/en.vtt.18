00:09:01.234 --> 00:09:07.499
I believe the potential
for widespread positive change

00:09:07.523 --> 00:09:09.103
is absolutely enormous

00:09:09.127 --> 00:09:12.031
because I know what we're capable of.

00:09:12.055 --> 00:09:15.252
I know the brilliance of humanity.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.840
So this leaves me with some
pretty big things to ponder

00:09:19.864 --> 00:09:23.266
and some questions for us all to consider:

00:09:24.512 --> 00:09:30.385
Is what unites us not far greater
than what can ever divide?
