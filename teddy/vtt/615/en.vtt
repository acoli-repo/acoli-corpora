00:00:01.458 --> 00:00:04.125
I am a capitalist,

00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:08.393
and after a 30-year career in capitalism

00:00:08.417 --> 00:00:10.934
spanning three dozen companies,

00:00:10.958 --> 00:00:14.309
generating tens of billions
of dollars in market value,

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:20.208
I'm not just in the top one percent,
I'm in the top .01 percent of all earners.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.518
Today, I have come
to share the secrets of our success,

00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:28.726
because rich capitalists like me
have never been richer.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.375
So the question is, how do we do it?
