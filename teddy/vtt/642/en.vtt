00:00:00.937 --> 00:00:03.214
I want to start with a question.

00:00:03.238 --> 00:00:05.171
Where does an artwork begin?

00:00:06.119 --> 00:00:09.095
Now sometimes that question is absurd.

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:12.683
It can seem deceptively simple,

00:00:12.707 --> 00:00:16.397
as it was when I asked the question
with this piece, "Portable Planetarium,"

00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:18.215
that I made in 2010.

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:20.104
I asked the question:

00:00:20.128 --> 00:00:23.624
"What would it look like
to build a planetarium of one's own?"

00:00:23.998 --> 00:00:25.831
I know you all ask that every morning,

00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:28.182
but I asked myself that question.

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:30.196
And as an artist,
