How long does it take
to get over a breakup?

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:05.076
The good news is
I've done the research for you.

00:00:05.116 --> 00:00:07.516

might not like the answer.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.436
See, a few years back,

00:00:11.476 --> 00:00:13.756
a number of publications
were touting a study

00:00:13.796 --> 00:00:17.356
telling their readers that it takes
11 weeks to get over a breakup.

00:00:17.396 --> 00:00:20.316
That's nearly three months spent
listening to depressing music

00:00:20.316 --> 00:00:21.756
while putting on a brave face.

00:00:21.796 --> 00:00:23.356

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:25.556
but it's only a few swipes
on the calendar app.

00:00:25.596 --> 00:00:26.756
No big deal, right?

00:00:26.756 --> 00:00:29.276
Well, unfortunately,
it's not so straightforward.

See, those articles drastically
misrepresented that study.
