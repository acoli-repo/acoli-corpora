00:06:57.857 --> 00:07:00.677
Vinny was hit by a car when he was 15,

00:07:00.701 --> 00:07:05.746
and from that moment forward,
spent more time in jail than in school.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.155
With some basic skill-building,

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:09.742
after our assessment revealed

00:07:09.766 --> 00:07:12.581
that he had some pretty
significant memory impairments,

00:07:13.276 --> 00:07:17.242
Vinny learned to use the alarm
and reminder function on his iPhone

00:07:17.266 --> 00:07:19.121
to track important appointments,

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:23.198
and he keeps a checklist
to break larger tasks

00:07:23.222 --> 00:07:25.614
into smaller, manageable ones.

00:07:25.638 --> 00:07:28.202
And with basic tools
like that under his belt,

00:07:28.226 --> 00:07:30.742
Vinny's been out of jail for two years,
