00:01:26.507 --> 00:01:31.417
50 to 80 percent of people
in criminal justice

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:33.256
have a traumatic brain injury.

00:01:33.913 --> 00:01:36.668
Up to 80 percent.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.133
In the general public,
in this room, for example,

00:01:40.157 --> 00:01:43.372
that number is less than five percent.

00:01:44.097 --> 00:01:46.788
And I'm not just talking about
getting your bell rung.

00:01:46.812 --> 00:01:51.384
These are the kinds of injuries
that require hospitalization.

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:55.208
Most of them are the product
of a physical assault,

00:01:55.946 --> 00:01:59.465
and some of them
are actually sustained in jail.

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:04.347
All of these numbers are even higher
among the women in criminal justice.
