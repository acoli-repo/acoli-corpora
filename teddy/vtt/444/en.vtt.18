He actually sits down
with all of his prosecutors

00:09:02.427 --> 00:09:06.342
to help them see that there's basically
two categories of defendants

00:09:06.366 --> 00:09:08.083
in the courtroom:

00:09:08.107 --> 00:09:12.174
the ones we're afraid of --
oftentimes, rightfully so --

00:09:12.198 --> 00:09:14.198
and the ones we're mad at.

00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:17.584
These are the ones who miss
all of their scheduled appointments

00:09:17.608 --> 00:09:20.533
and they blow through
the best-laid probation plans.

00:09:20.557 --> 00:09:23.572
And Judge Bowen believes that,
with a little more support,

00:09:23.596 --> 00:09:25.896
we could move people
in this latter category,

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.337
the maddening category,

00:09:28.361 --> 00:09:31.286
through and ultimately out of the system.
