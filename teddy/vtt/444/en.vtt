A traumatic brain injury, or TBI,

00:00:03.148 --> 00:00:08.666
is a disruption in brain function
caused by an external blow to the head.

00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:11.241

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:14.525

and professional athletes,

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.592

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:24.925

to define TBI in the public consciousness.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.692

in retired and college athletes.
