00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.500
We do quick neuropsychological
screening tests

00:04:32.524 --> 00:04:36.575
to identify strengths and weaknesses
in the way an inmate thinks.

00:04:37.055 --> 00:04:40.771
Using that information,
we write two reports.

00:04:40.795 --> 00:04:43.317
One, a report for the system

00:04:43.341 --> 00:04:47.383
with specific recommendations
on how to manage that inmate.

00:04:47.817 --> 00:04:50.607
The other is a letter to the inmate

00:04:50.631 --> 00:04:54.520
with specific suggestions
for how to manage themselves.

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:00.054
For example, if our test result suggests
that a probationer has a hard time
