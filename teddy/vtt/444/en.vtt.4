00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:04.347
All of these numbers are even higher
among the women in criminal justice.

00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:09.384
Almost every single woman
in the criminal justice system

00:02:09.408 --> 00:02:13.275
has been exposed to interpersonal
violence and abuse.

00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:19.527
More than half of these women have
been exposed to repeated brain injuries.

00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:27.496
In this way, these women's brains look
like the brains of retired NFL players,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.021
and they'll likely face the same risks
for dementing diseases as they age.
