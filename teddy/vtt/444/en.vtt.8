00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:02.309
so that we can recommend
basic modifications

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:05.106
to make this system more effective

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.454
and safer.

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:12.628
And here when I say "safer,"
I mean safer not only for the inmates,

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:15.245
but safer also for correctional staff.

00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:19.799
In some ways, this is
such a simple approach.

00:04:19.823 --> 00:04:22.658
We're not treating the brain injury,

00:04:22.682 --> 00:04:27.600
we're treating the underlying problem
that gets people into all of this trouble

00:04:27.624 --> 00:04:28.895
in the first place.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.500
We do quick neuropsychological
screening tests
