00:05:28.122 --> 00:05:31.499
This program does not
minimize responsibility

00:05:31.523 --> 00:05:34.767
or make excuses for anyone's behavior.

00:05:35.322 --> 00:05:39.237
This is about changing longstanding
negative perceptions

00:05:39.261 --> 00:05:41.672
and building self-advocacy.

00:05:42.084 --> 00:05:44.931
It's actually about taking responsibility.

00:05:45.295 --> 00:05:46.969
The inmates move from,

00:05:46.993 --> 00:05:49.391
"I'm a total screwup, I'm a loser,"

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:52.172
to, "Here's what I don't do well,

00:05:52.196 --> 00:05:54.961
and here's what I have to do about it."

00:05:56.292 --> 00:05:59.477
