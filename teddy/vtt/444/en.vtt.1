I stood on a TED stage in 2010,

00:00:32.652 --> 00:00:35.959
talking about concussions in kids' sports.

00:00:36.714 --> 00:00:40.219
So I have to say, as someone
who researches and treats these injuries,

00:00:40.243 --> 00:00:44.721
that I've been really gratified
to see the growing awareness of TBI

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:48.563
and specifically, the short-
and long-term risks to athletes.

00:00:49.518 --> 00:00:55.197
Today, though, I want to introduce you
to a larger but no less controversial

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.767
group of people impacted
by traumatic brain injury,

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:01.274
who don't often show up in the headlines.
