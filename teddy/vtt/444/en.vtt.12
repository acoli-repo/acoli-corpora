00:06:04.225 --> 00:06:07.816
And the system comes to see
an inmate's problematic behavior

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.905
as the things they can't do

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:13.231
versus the things they won't do.

00:06:13.255 --> 00:06:14.534
And that change --

00:06:14.558 --> 00:06:19.326
seeing behavior as a deficit
rather than outright defiance --

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.069
is everything in these settings.

00:06:23.632 --> 00:06:26.561
We hear from inmates around the country,

00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:31.390
and they write, and more than anything,
they want to know how to help themselves.
