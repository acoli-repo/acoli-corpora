00:01:26.506 --> 00:01:30.770
Now, it's really incredible
to be able to go back in time

00:01:30.794 --> 00:01:33.080
and access this moment.

00:01:33.548 --> 00:01:38.911
It's also really fascinating
that after 30 years, after that first TED,

00:01:38.935 --> 00:01:41.714
we're still talking about digital storage.

00:01:42.827 --> 00:01:45.614
Now, if we look back another 30 years,

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:48.823
IBM released the first-ever hard drive

00:01:48.847 --> 00:01:50.974
back in 1956.

00:01:50.998 --> 00:01:55.195
Here it is being loaded for shipping
in front of a small audience.

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.679
It held the equivalent of one MP3 song

00:01:59.354 --> 00:02:01.358
and weighed over one ton.
