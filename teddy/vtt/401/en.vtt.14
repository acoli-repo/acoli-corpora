Each pixel in a black-and-white photo
is simply a zero or a one.

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:06.673
And we can write DNA much like an inkjet
printer can print letters on a page.

00:07:06.697 --> 00:07:10.521
We just have to convert our data,
all of those zeroes and ones,

00:07:10.545 --> 00:07:12.683
to A's, T's, C's and G's,

00:07:12.707 --> 00:07:14.965
and then we send this
to a synthesis company.

00:07:14.989 --> 00:07:16.936
So we write it, we can store it,

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.194
and when we want to recover our data,
we just sequence it.

00:07:20.218 --> 00:07:24.299
Now, the fun part of all of this
is deciding what files to include.

00:07:24.323 --> 00:07:27.700
We're serious scientists,
so we had to include a manuscript

00:07:27.724 --> 00:07:29.467
for good posterity.

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:32.324
We also included a $50 Amazon gift card --
