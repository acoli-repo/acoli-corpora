How many of you even have
a disk drive in your laptop,

00:12:00.036 --> 00:12:01.760
never mind a floppy drive?

00:12:02.151 --> 00:12:04.703
This will never be the case with DNA.

00:12:04.727 --> 00:12:07.904
As long as we're around, DNA is around,

00:12:07.928 --> 00:12:10.108
and we'll find a way to sequence it.

00:12:11.214 --> 00:12:14.673
Archiving the world around us
is part of human nature.

00:12:15.172 --> 00:12:19.796
This is the progress we've made
in digital storage in 60 years,

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.196
at a time when we were only
beginning to understand DNA.

00:12:23.725 --> 00:12:28.570
Yet, we've made similar progress
in half that time with DNA sequencers,

00:12:28.594 --> 00:12:33.537
and as long as we're around,
DNA will never be obsolete.
