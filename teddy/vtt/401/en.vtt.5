you'd probably look at them
kind of strange, maybe laugh,

00:02:32.806 --> 00:02:35.221
but you'd have no way
to use the damn thing.

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:38.995
These devices can no longer meet
our storage needs,

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.721
although some of them can be repurposed.

00:02:42.682 --> 00:02:45.791
All technology eventually dies or is lost,

00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:47.666
along with our data,

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.230
all of our memories.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.326
There's this illusion that
the storage problem has been solved,

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.843
but really, we all just externalize it.

00:02:56.867 --> 00:03:00.344
We don't worry about storing
our emails and our photos.
