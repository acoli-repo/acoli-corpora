00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.952
and very soon after, how to write it,

00:06:30.976 --> 00:06:32.535
or synthesize it.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:36.123
This is much like how we learn
a new language.

00:06:36.812 --> 00:06:41.425
And now we have the ability
to read, write and copy DNA.

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:43.529
We do it in the lab all the time.

00:06:44.283 --> 00:06:48.165
So anything, really anything,
that can be stored as zeroes and ones

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:49.908
can be stored in DNA.

00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:53.774
To store something digitally,
like this photo,

00:06:53.798 --> 00:06:57.104
we convert it to bits, or binary digits.

00:06:57.128 --> 00:07:01.339
Each pixel in a black-and-white photo
is simply a zero or a one.
