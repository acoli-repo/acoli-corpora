DNA is nature's oldest storage device.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.161
After all, it contains
all the information necessary

00:04:07.185 --> 00:04:10.015
to build and maintain a human being.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.787
But what makes DNA so great?

00:04:13.493 --> 00:04:15.249
Well, let's take our own genome

00:04:15.273 --> 00:04:16.833
as an example.

00:04:16.857 --> 00:04:21.627
If we were to print out
all three billion A's, T's, C's and G's

00:04:21.651 --> 00:04:25.282
on a standard font, standard format,

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:28.046
and then we were
to stack all of those papers,

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.730
it would be about 130 meters high,
