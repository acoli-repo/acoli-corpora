WEBVTT

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.063
you can access web pages
as far back as 1996.

00:01:02.087 --> 00:01:03.771
Now, this is very tempting,

00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:09.784
but I decided to go back and look at
the TED website's very humble beginnings.

00:01:09.808 --> 00:01:13.720
As you can see, it's changed
quite a bit in the last 30 years.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.544
So this led me to the first-ever TED,

00:01:17.568 --> 00:01:19.748
back in 1984,

00:01:19.772 --> 00:01:22.297
and it just so happened
to be a Sony executive

00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:25.379
explaining how a compact disk works.

00:01:25.403 --> 00:01:26.482
(Laughter)

00:01:26.506 --> 00:01:30.770
Now, it's really incredible
to be able to go back in time
