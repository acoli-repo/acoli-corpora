00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.145
from an ancient human

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.211
than we do from an old phone.

00:05:33.783 --> 00:05:38.428
It's also much less likely
that we'll lose the ability to read DNA

00:05:38.452 --> 00:05:40.886
than any single man-made device.

00:05:41.567 --> 00:05:45.679
Every single new storage format
requires a new way to read it.

00:05:45.703 --> 00:05:47.836
We'll always be able to read DNA.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.928
If we can no longer sequence,
we have bigger problems

00:05:50.952 --> 00:05:53.233
than worrying about data storage.

00:05:53.725 --> 00:05:56.796
Storing data on DNA is not new.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.919
Nature's been doing it
for several billion years.

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:03.835
In fact, every living thing
is a DNA storage device.
