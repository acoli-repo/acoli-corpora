In fact, every living thing
is a DNA storage device.

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:07.183
But how do we store data on DNA?

00:06:07.725 --> 00:06:09.516
This is Photo 51.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.167
It's the first-ever photo of DNA,

00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:14.443
taken about 60 years ago.

00:06:14.467 --> 00:06:18.849
This is around the time that
that same hard drive was released by IBM.

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:24.738
So really, our understanding of digital
storage and of DNA have coevolved.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.916
We first learned to sequence, or read DNA,

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.952
and very soon after, how to write it,
