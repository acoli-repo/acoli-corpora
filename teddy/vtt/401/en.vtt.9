00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.730
it would be about 130 meters high,

00:04:30.754 --> 00:04:34.413
somewhere between the Statue of Liberty
and the Washington Monument.

00:04:34.437 --> 00:04:36.884
Now, if we converted
all those A's, T's, C's and G's

00:04:36.898 --> 00:04:39.454
to digital data, to zeroes and ones,

00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:41.247
it would total a few gigs.

00:04:41.786 --> 00:04:44.125
And that's in each cell of our body.

00:04:44.516 --> 00:04:47.354
We have more than 30 trillion cells.

00:04:47.757 --> 00:04:49.257
You get the idea:

00:04:49.281 --> 00:04:53.956
DNA can store a ton of information
in a minuscule space.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.445
DNA is also very durable,

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.303
and it doesn't even require
electricity to store it.
