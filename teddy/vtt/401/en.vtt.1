we rarely think about
our digital footprint.

00:00:31.536 --> 00:00:35.064
But humanity has collectively
generated more data

00:00:35.088 --> 00:00:36.961
in the last few years

00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:39.515
than all of preceding human history.

00:00:39.902 --> 00:00:42.800
Big data has become a big problem.

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:46.046
Digital storage is really expensive,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.793
and none of these devices that we have
really stand the test of time.

00:00:51.256 --> 00:00:55.006
There's this nonprofit website
called the Internet Archive.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.675
In addition to free books and movies,

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.063
you can access web pages
as far back as 1996.
