00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:32.324
We also included a $50 Amazon gift card --

00:07:32.348 --> 00:07:35.879
don't get too excited, it's already
been spent, someone decoded it --

00:07:35.903 --> 00:07:38.113
as well as an operating system,

00:07:38.137 --> 00:07:40.508
one of the first movies ever made

00:07:40.532 --> 00:07:42.270
and a Pioneer plaque.

00:07:42.294 --> 00:07:43.963
Some of you might have seen this.

00:07:43.987 --> 00:07:47.443
It has a depiction of a typical --
apparently -- male and female,

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:50.029
and our approximate location
in the Solar System,

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:54.055
in case the Pioneer spacecraft
ever encounters extraterrestrials.

00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:57.790
So once we decided what sort of files
we want to encode,

00:07:57.814 --> 00:07:59.282
we package up the data,

00:07:59.306 --> 00:08:02.960
convert those zeroes and ones
to A's, T's, C's and G's,
