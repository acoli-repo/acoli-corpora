00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.577
We've deciphered languages
from the Rosetta Stone.

00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:37.450
You know, we'll never really have
the whole story, though.

00:03:37.474 --> 00:03:39.368
Our data is our story,

00:03:39.392 --> 00:03:41.127
even more so today.

00:03:41.508 --> 00:03:44.769
We won't have our record
recorded on stone tablets.

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:48.390
But we don't have to choose
what is important now.

00:03:48.847 --> 00:03:50.740
There's a way to store it all.

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.117
It turns out that there's
a solution that's been around

00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:56.584
for a few billion years,

00:03:56.608 --> 00:03:58.448
and it's actually in this tube.
