00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.303
and it doesn't even require
electricity to store it.

00:05:00.327 --> 00:05:04.603
We know this because scientists
have recovered DNA from ancient humans

00:05:04.627 --> 00:05:07.379
that lived hundreds
of thousands of years ago.

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:10.366
One of those is Ötzi the Iceman.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.073
Turns out, he's Austrian.

00:05:12.097 --> 00:05:13.697
(Laughter)

00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:15.351
He was found high, well-preserved,

00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:18.189
in the mountains
between Italy and Austria,

00:05:18.213 --> 00:05:22.197
and it turns out that he has living
genetic relatives here in Austria today.

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:24.563
So one of you could be a cousin of Ötzi.

00:05:24.587 --> 00:05:25.642
(Laughter)

00:05:26.043 --> 00:05:29.896
The point is that we have a better chance
of recovering information

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.145
from an ancient human
