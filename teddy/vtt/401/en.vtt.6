We don't worry about storing
our emails and our photos.

00:03:00.368 --> 00:03:02.091
They're just in the cloud.

00:03:03.231 --> 00:03:06.168
But behind the scenes,
storage is problematic.

00:03:06.192 --> 00:03:10.172
After all, the cloud is just
a lot of hard drives.

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:15.196
Now, most digital data,
we could argue, is not really critical.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.343
Surely, we could just delete it.

00:03:17.957 --> 00:03:21.492
But how can we really know
what's important today?

00:03:22.132 --> 00:03:24.668
We've learned so much about human history

00:03:24.692 --> 00:03:27.518
from drawings and writings in caves,

00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:29.156
from stone tablets.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.577
We've deciphered languages
from the Rosetta Stone.
