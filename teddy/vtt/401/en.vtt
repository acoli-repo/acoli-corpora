00:00:00.652 --> 00:00:05.848
I could fit all movies ever made
inside of this tube.

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:08.125
If you can't see it,
that's kind of the point.

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:09.165
(Laughter)

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:12.432
Before we understand how this is possible,

00:00:12.456 --> 00:00:16.202
it's important to understand
the value of this feat.

00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:19.341
All of our thoughts
and actions these days,

00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:21.351
through photos and videos --

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.254
even our fitness activities --

00:00:23.278 --> 00:00:25.411
are stored as digital data.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.626
Aside from running out of space

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.801
on our phones,

00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:31.139
we rarely think about
our digital footprint.
