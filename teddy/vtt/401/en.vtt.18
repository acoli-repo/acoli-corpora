00:08:59.556 --> 00:09:03.423
So sequencing also introduces
errors into our DNA,

00:09:03.447 --> 00:09:05.754
into the A's, T's, C's and G's.

00:09:06.135 --> 00:09:09.113
Nature has a way
to deal with this in our cells.

00:09:09.137 --> 00:09:15.027
But our data is stored
in synthetic DNA in a tube,

00:09:15.051 --> 00:09:18.303
so we had to find our own way
to overcome this problem.

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:22.967
We decided to use an algorithm
that was used to stream videos.

00:09:23.452 --> 00:09:24.905
When you're streaming a video,

00:09:24.929 --> 00:09:29.390
you're essentially trying to recover
the original video, the original file.

00:09:29.414 --> 00:09:32.323
When we're trying to recover
our original files,
