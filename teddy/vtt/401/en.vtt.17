It does have some weaknesses.

00:08:31.364 --> 00:08:34.795
We recover our message
by sequencing the DNA,

00:08:34.819 --> 00:08:36.832
and every time data is retrieved,

00:08:36.856 --> 00:08:38.642
we lose the DNA.

00:08:38.666 --> 00:08:41.080
That's just part
of the sequencing process.

00:08:41.104 --> 00:08:43.039
We don't want to run out of data,

00:08:43.063 --> 00:08:46.159
but luckily, there's a way to copy the DNA

00:08:46.183 --> 00:08:50.768
that's even cheaper and easier
than synthesizing it.

00:08:51.275 --> 00:08:56.133
We actually tested a way to make
200 trillion copies of our files,

00:08:56.157 --> 00:08:58.889
and we recovered
all the data without error.

00:08:59.556 --> 00:09:03.423
So sequencing also introduces
errors into our DNA,
