00:00:00.542 --> 00:00:02.726
Who doesn't love efficiency?

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.018
I do.

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:07.393
Efficiency means more for less.

00:00:07.417 --> 00:00:11.309
More miles per gallon,
more light per watt,

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:12.792
more words per minute.

00:00:13.917 --> 00:00:16.393
More for less is the next best thing

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:17.958
to something for nothing.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.059
Algorithms, big data, the cloud
are giving us more for less.

00:00:24.083 --> 00:00:27.726
Are we heading toward
a friction-free utopia

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.559
or toward a nightmare of surveillance?
