00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
As a boy,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I loved cars.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
When I turned 18,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000

And then I decided I'd dedicate my life

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I saw the concept first

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in the DARPA Grand Challenges

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
where the U.S. government issued a prize
