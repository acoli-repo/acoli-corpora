In secondary school, a boy and a girl,
both of them teenagers,

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.096
both of them with the same amount
of pocket money, would go out

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.896
and then the boy
would be expected always to pay,

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.560
to prove his masculinity.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.240
And yet we wonder why boys are more likely
to steal money from their parents.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.736
What if both boys and girls were raised

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.880
not to link masculinity with money?

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.736
What if the attitude
was not "the boy has to pay"

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.520
but rather "whoever has more should pay?"
