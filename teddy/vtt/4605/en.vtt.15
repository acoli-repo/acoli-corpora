00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.595
Of course there are many exceptions.

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:33.176
(Laughter)

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.000
But today we live
in a vastly different world.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.776
The person more likely to lead
is not the physically stronger person;

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.296
it is the more creative person,
the more intelligent person,

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.736
the more innovative person,

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.416
and there are no hormones
for those attributes.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.056
A man is as likely as a woman
to be intelligent,

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.040
to be creative, to be innovative.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.096
We have evolved;

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.640
but it seems to me that our ideas
of gender had not evolved.
