00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.656
We do a great disservice to boys
on how we raise them;

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.520
we stifle the humanity of boys.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.056
We define masculinity
in a very narrow way,

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.576
masculinity becomes this hard, small cage

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.896
and we put boys inside the cage.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.840
We teach boys to be afraid of fear.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:49.240
We teach boys to be afraid
of weakness, of vulnerability.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.656
We teach them to mask their true selves,

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.920
because they have to be,
in Nigerian speak, "hard man!"

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.576
In secondary school, a boy and a girl,
both of them teenagers,
