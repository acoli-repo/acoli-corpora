00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.176
So I would like to start by telling you
about one of my greatest friends,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.840
Okoloma Maduewesi.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.336
Okoloma lived on my street

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.656
and looked after me like a big brother.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.720
If I liked a boy,
I would ask Okoloma's opinion.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.016
Okoloma died in the notorious
Sosoliso plane crash

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.400
in Nigeria in December of 2005.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.680
Almost exactly seven years ago.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.440
Okoloma was a person I could argue with,
laugh with and truly talk to.
