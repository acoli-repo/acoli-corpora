00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.775
In Lagos I cannot go alone
into many "reputable" bars and clubs.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:37.216
They just don't let you in
if you're a woman alone,

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.960
you have to be accompanied by a man.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.336
Each time I walk into
a Nigerian restaurant with a man,

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.560
the waiter greets the man and ignores me.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.816
The waiters are products --

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.976
(Laughter)

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.896
At this some women
felt like, "Yes! I thought that!"

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.856
The waiters are products of a society

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.920
that has taught them that men
are more important than women.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.096
And I know that waiters
don't intend any harm.
