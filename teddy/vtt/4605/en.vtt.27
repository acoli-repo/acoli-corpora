A marriage can be a good thing;

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.456
it can be a source of joy
and love and mutual support.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.936
But why do we teach girls
to aspire to marriage

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.680
and we don't teach boys the same?

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.016
I know a woman
who decided to sell her house

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.080
because she didn't want
to intimidate a man who might marry her.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.336
I know an unmarried woman in Nigeria
who, when she goes to conferences,

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.736
wears a wedding ring

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:54.976
because according to her,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.920
she wants the other participants
in the conference to "give her respect."
