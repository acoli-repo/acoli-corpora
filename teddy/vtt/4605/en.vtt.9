00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.347
and so he became the class monitor.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.240
And I've never forgotten that incident.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.056
I often make the mistake of thinking

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.536
that something that is obvious to me
is just as obvious to everyone else.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.136
Now, take my dear friend Louis

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.496
for example.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.376
Louis is a brilliant, progressive man,

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.896
and we would have conversations
and he would tell me,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.400
"I don't know what you mean by things
being different or harder for women.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.600
Maybe in the past, but not now."

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.136
And I didn't understand how Louis
could not see what seems so self-evident.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.296
Then one evening, in Lagos,
Louis and I went out with friends.
