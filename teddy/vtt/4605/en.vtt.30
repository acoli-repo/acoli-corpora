00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.936
this is an expression
I'm very amused by --

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.280
"I did it for peace in my marriage."

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.976
Now, when men say it,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.176

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.896
so for peace in my marriage,
I do it only on weekends."

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.616
(Laughter)

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.896
