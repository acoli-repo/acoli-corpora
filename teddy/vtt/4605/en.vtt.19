00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.320
"It was so angry."

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.336
Of course it was angry!

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.120
(Laughter)

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.496
I am angry.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.656
Gender as it functions today
is a grave injustice.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.416
We should all be angry.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.296
Anger has a long history
of bringing about positive change;

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.120
but, in addition to being angry,
I'm also hopeful.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.496
Because I believe deeply
in the ability of human beings

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.640
to make and remake
themselves for the better.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.816
Gender matters everywhere in the world,

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.496
but I want to focus on Nigeria
