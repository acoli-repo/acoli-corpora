00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.320
brought out my money
that I had earned from doing my work,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.520
and I gave it to the man.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.976
And he, this man who was
very grateful and very happy,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.776
took the money from me,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.216
looked across at Louis

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.096
and said, "Thank you, sir!"

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.600
(Laughter)

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.416
Louis looked at me, surprised,

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.840
and asked, "Why is he thanking me?
I didn't give him the money."

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.800
Then I saw realization
dawn on Louis' face.
