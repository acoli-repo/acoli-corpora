00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.256
was that I should never
call myself a feminist

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.856
because feminists
are women who are unhappy

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.816
because they cannot find husbands.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.240
(Laughter)

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.720
So I decided to call myself
"a happy feminist."

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.696
Then an academic, a Nigerian woman told me

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.416
that feminism was not our culture

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.056
and that feminism wasn't African,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.016
and that I was calling myself a feminist

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.280
because I had been corrupted
by "Western books."

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.336
Which amused me,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.696
because a lot of my early readings
were decidedly unfeminist.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.936
I think I must have read every single
Mills &amp; Boon romance published
