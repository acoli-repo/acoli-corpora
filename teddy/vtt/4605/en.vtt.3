While I was promoting
the novel in Nigeria,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.696
a journalist, a nice, well-meaning man,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.720
told me he wanted to advise me.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.616
And for the Nigerians here,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.136
I'm sure we're all familiar

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.400
with how quick our people are
to give unsolicited advice.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.216
He told me that people were saying
that my novel was feminist

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.856
and his advice to me --

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.056
and he was shaking his head
sadly as he spoke --

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.256
was that I should never
call myself a feminist
