00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.136
it was really about a man and a woman

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.936
doing the same job,
being equally qualified,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.360
and the man being paid more
because he's a man.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.496
So in the literal way, men rule the world,

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.360
and this made sense a thousand years ago

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.976
because human beings lived then in a world

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.176
in which physical strength was
the most important attribute for survival.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.480
The physically stronger person
was more likely to lead,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.856
and men, in general,
are physically stronger.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.595
Of course there are many exceptions.
