00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.936
I think I must have read every single
Mills &amp; Boon romance published

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.160
before I was sixteen.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.936
And each time I tried to read those books

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.776
called "the feminist classics,"

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.576
I'd get bored, and I really
struggled to finish them.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.336
But anyway, since feminism was un-African,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.840
I decided that I would now call myself
"a happy African feminist."

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.256
At some point I was a happy African
feminist who does not hate men

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.616
and who likes lip gloss

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.136
and who wears high heels
for herself but not for men.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.896
(Laughter)

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.096
Of course a lot of this
was tongue-in-cheek,
