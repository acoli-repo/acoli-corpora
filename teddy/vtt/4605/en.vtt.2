00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.696
the same tone that you would use
to say something like,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.456
"You're a supporter of terrorism."

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.256
(Laughter)

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.936
I did not know exactly
what this word "feminist" meant,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.176
and I did not want Okoloma
to know that I did not know.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.216
So I brushed it aside,
and I continued to argue.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.656
And the first thing
I planned to do when I got home

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.256
was to look up the word
"feminist" in the dictionary.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.416
Now fast forward to some years later,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.576
I wrote a novel about a man
who among other things beats his wife

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.560
and whose story doesn't end very well.
