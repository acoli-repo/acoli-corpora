00:00:01.365 --> 00:00:04.532
It's funny how foreigners
ask me the same questions

00:00:04.556 --> 00:00:06.317
when they first meet me.

00:00:06.341 --> 00:00:07.499
Questions like,

00:00:07.523 --> 00:00:09.952
"Wow, you're from Mongolia?

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:11.768
So do you ride horses to go to work?"

00:00:13.152 --> 00:00:15.487
"Do you know what Coke is?"

00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:18.546
Or, "Do you have chocolates in Mongolia?"

00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:22.458
And if I want to have fun with it,

00:00:22.482 --> 00:00:23.998
I say things like,

00:00:24.022 --> 00:00:25.356
"Oh my God,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.237
I've never heard any of those before.

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:29.121
What are Coke and chocolates?

00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:31.061
Can you tell me more about them?"
