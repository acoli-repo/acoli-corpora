Of the five senses, vision is the one
that I appreciate the most,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.976
and it's the one that I can
least take for granted.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.551
I think this is partially due
to my father, who was blind.

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:13.678
It was a fact that he didn't make
much of a fuss about, usually.

00:00:13.702 --> 00:00:17.336
One time in Nova Scotia, when we went
to see a total eclipse of the sun --

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:18.378
(Laughter)

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:20.491
Yeah, same one as in the Carly Simon song,

00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:23.339
which may or may not refer
to James Taylor, Warren Beatty

00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:25.195
or Mick Jagger; we're not really sure.

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:27.755
They handed out these dark plastic viewers

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.828
that allowed us to look
directly at the sun

00:00:29.852 --> 00:00:31.119
without damaging our eyes.
