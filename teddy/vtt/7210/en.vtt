00:00:00.997 --> 00:00:04.959
Choking smog, polluted waters,
climate change.

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:07.170
This has been the environmental cost

00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:10.548
of the tremendous growth in China
over the past 40 years.

00:00:11.466 --> 00:00:12.633
At the same time,

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:15.970
hundreds of millions of people
have put themselves out of poverty.

00:00:16.012 --> 00:00:20.266
As an environmentalist in China,
I have witnessed all of this firsthand.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.227
The challenge we're facing is:

00:00:23.227 --> 00:00:26.022
Can we clean up as fast and as broadly

00:00:26.064 --> 00:00:30.318
as the massive development
degrading our air, water and climate?
