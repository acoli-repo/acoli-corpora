Ben Roche: So I'm Ben, by the way.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Homaro Cantu: And I'm Homaro.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
BR: And we're chefs. So when Moto

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
opened in 2004, people didn't really know

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
what to expect. A lot of people thought

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that it was a Japanese restaurant, and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
maybe it was the name, maybe it was

the logo, which was like a Japanese

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
really not what we did. And after about

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the ten thousandth request for a maki roll,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we decided to give the people

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
what they wanted. So this picture is

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
an example of printed food, and this was

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the first foray into what we like to call
