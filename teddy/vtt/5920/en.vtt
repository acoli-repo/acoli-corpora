00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:11.487
On an auspicious day 
in November of 1986,

00:00:11.487 --> 00:00:15.467
5 Australian miners climbed Lunatic Hillâ€”

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:20.047
so named for the mental state 
anyone would be in to dig there.

00:00:20.047 --> 00:00:24.995
While their competitors searched 
for opals at a depth of 2 to 5 meters,

00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:29.953
the Lunatic Hill Syndicate bored 
20 meters into the earth.

00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:32.741
And for their audacity, the earth
rewarded them
