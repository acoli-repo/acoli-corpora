00:02:59.084 --> 00:03:01.846
These people wanted to have a life,

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.434
and the help, our help,
to deal with that dementia.

00:03:05.957 --> 00:03:10.689
These people wanted to live
in a normal house,

00:03:10.713 --> 00:03:11.863
not in a ward.

00:03:12.482 --> 00:03:15.307
They wanted to have a normal household,

00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:20.029
where they would smell their dinner
on the stove in the kitchen.

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:25.228
Or be free to go to the kitchen
and grab something to eat or drink.

00:03:25.611 --> 00:03:27.841
That's what these people needed.

00:03:27.865 --> 00:03:30.364
And that's what we should
organize for them.
