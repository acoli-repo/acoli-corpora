And they had fun together.

00:08:01.554 --> 00:08:04.632
And then they said goodbye,
and each went their own way.

00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:08.569
And that's what you want in life,
meeting other people

00:08:08.593 --> 00:08:10.640
and being part of society.

00:08:11.093 --> 00:08:13.227
And that's what I saw happening.

00:08:14.148 --> 00:08:16.155
The Hogeweyk has become a place

00:08:16.179 --> 00:08:19.861
where people with very advanced
dementia can live,

00:08:19.885 --> 00:08:21.821
have freedom and safety,

00:08:21.845 --> 00:08:26.329
because the professionals working there
and the volunteers working there

00:08:26.353 --> 00:08:28.575
know how to deal with dementia.

00:08:29.093 --> 00:08:32.426
And the professionals know
how to do their professional work
