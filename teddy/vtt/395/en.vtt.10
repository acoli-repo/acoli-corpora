00:04:56.005 --> 00:05:00.608
very often had a very small
family business, a small farm, a shop,

00:05:00.632 --> 00:05:04.767
or like Mr. B, he was a farmhand.

00:05:05.466 --> 00:05:08.966
And he told me that he would go
to his work every morning

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.194
with a paper bag with his lunch

00:05:12.014 --> 00:05:13.504
and one cigar.

00:05:14.824 --> 00:05:18.887
That one cigar was the only luxury
he could afford for himself.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.553
And after lunch,
he would have that one cigar.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.788
And until the day he died in the Hogeweyk,

00:05:26.812 --> 00:05:32.724
he was in this little shed, every day,
after lunch, to smoke his cigar.
