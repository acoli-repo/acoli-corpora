00:05:57.766 --> 00:06:02.617
But that's not life in a house
with a group of people,

00:06:02.641 --> 00:06:06.019
like-minded people, your own life,
your own household.

00:06:06.434 --> 00:06:07.763
There's more in life,

00:06:07.787 --> 00:06:11.091
everybody wants fun in life
and a meaningful life.

00:06:11.688 --> 00:06:13.109
We are social animals --

00:06:13.133 --> 00:06:15.402
we need a social life.

00:06:15.817 --> 00:06:17.617
And that's what we started.

00:06:18.817 --> 00:06:22.293
We want to go out of our house
and do some shopping,

00:06:22.317 --> 00:06:23.784
and meet other people.

00:06:24.698 --> 00:06:28.438
Or go to the pub,
have a beer with friends.

00:06:28.462 --> 00:06:33.444
Or like Mr. W -- he likes
to go out every day,
