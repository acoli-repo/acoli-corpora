Because it has to do
with thinking different,

00:09:31.822 --> 00:09:34.552
and looking at the person in front of you

00:09:34.576 --> 00:09:38.257
and looking at what
does this person need now.

00:09:39.352 --> 00:09:42.592
And it's about a smile,
it's about thinking different,

00:09:42.616 --> 00:09:46.663
it's about how you act,
and that costs nothing.

00:09:47.823 --> 00:09:51.490
And there's something else:
it's about making choices.

00:09:51.903 --> 00:09:55.636
It's about making choices
what you spend your money on.

00:09:56.855 --> 00:09:58.131
I always say,

00:09:59.323 --> 00:10:04.069
"Red curtains are
as expensive as gray ones."
