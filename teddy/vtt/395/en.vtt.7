00:03:27.865 --> 00:03:30.364
And that's what we should
organize for them.

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.990
And we said we should
organize this like at home,

00:03:36.014 --> 00:03:40.966
so they wouldn't live with a group
of 15 or 20 or 30, like in a ward.

00:03:41.434 --> 00:03:45.648
No, a small group of people,
six or seven, family-like.

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.942
Like living with friends.

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.788
And we should find a way to select people

00:03:53.812 --> 00:03:56.566
based on their ideas about life

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.690
so that they did have
a good chance to become friends,

00:03:59.714 --> 00:04:01.282
when they lived together.
