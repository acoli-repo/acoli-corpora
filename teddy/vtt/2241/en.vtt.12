00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.851
The game grows with every stop,

00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:06.268
because as soon as the elevator stops,

00:06:06.292 --> 00:06:07.559
the music stops.

00:06:07.583 --> 00:06:08.851
New passengers get on,

00:06:08.875 --> 00:06:12.434
and the current passengers
get to witness the new passengers --

00:06:12.458 --> 00:06:15.893
their surprise -- as they hear
the elevator music for the first time.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:19.768
You experience the shift of adults

00:06:19.792 --> 00:06:23.393
standing silently,
strangers in an elevator,

00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:25.684
to attempting to suppress their mirth,

00:06:25.708 --> 00:06:28.184
to, "Is this a party or an elevator,"

00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:30.684
filled with full-on laughter.
