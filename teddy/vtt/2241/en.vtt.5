Randomized controlled trials
in Israel and Italy

00:02:30.833 --> 00:02:33.934
show that medical clowns
can be as effective as tranquilizers

00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.351
with no side effects.

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:38.393
In 2004, I started conducting
my own clown rounds

00:02:38.417 --> 00:02:41.601
at the Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center in New York City.

00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:44.684
My colleague and I were invited
to accompany a young six-year-old

00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:46.726
with the most adorable southern accent,

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.643
to accompany him while he got
his chemotherapy port flushed,

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:51.726
a very uncomfortable
and regular procedure.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.184
We joined him, his mom and the nurse

00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:57.101
in this tiny, closed curtain cubicle.

00:02:57.125 --> 00:03:00.934
Every medical clown encounter begins
by obtaining consent from the patient.
