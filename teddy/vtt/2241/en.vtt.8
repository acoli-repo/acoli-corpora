00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:01.809
or make anyone feel better per se.

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:04.101
The medical clowns work moment by moment

00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:06.684
to create connections between the clowns,

00:04:06.708 --> 00:04:09.226
the nurse, the parent and the child.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.559
This provides a source of power
or control for the child

00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:15.268
while supporting the staff
with their work.

00:04:15.292 --> 00:04:18.143
I've spent over a decade
bringing joy and delight

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:20.226
to the bedsides of terminally ill children

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.060
in the top hospitals in New York City.

00:04:22.084 --> 00:04:23.668
And you know what I've learned?

00:04:24.625 --> 00:04:26.393
Everyone's hurting.

00:04:26.417 --> 00:04:29.351
Staff, family, patients.

00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:31.934
The patient's in the hospital
because they're hurting.
