00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:33.101
The dance gives us a chance
to find each other.

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:34.983
How did I learn to dance with dementia?

00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:36.268
Because I'm not a dancer.

00:00:36.292 --> 00:00:37.976
And I'm not a doctor.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.101
But I've played one in the hospital.

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:41.976
(Laughs)

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.059
I'm a clown doctor.

00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:46.309
Or a medical clown.

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:49.083
My tools are whoopee cushions,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.518
shakers

00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:56.500
(Shaker rattles)

00:00:57.583 --> 00:00:59.351
and a red nose.

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:03.476
You know the old adage
"laughter is the best medicine?"
