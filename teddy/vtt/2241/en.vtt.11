One of my favorite games
to play in the hospital

00:05:30.042 --> 00:05:31.309
is elevator music.

00:05:31.333 --> 00:05:33.851
I love elevators, because they're a place

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.934
where paths cross, different worlds meet.

00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.601
It's intimate,

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:40.143
uncomfortably quiet

00:05:40.167 --> 00:05:43.143
and just begging
for a little playful disruption.

00:05:43.167 --> 00:05:44.518
The doors close

00:05:44.542 --> 00:05:48.101
and "The Girl from Ipanema"
starts playing on Hammond organ,

00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:52.018
because I keep a portable speaker
hidden in my pocket.

00:05:52.042 --> 00:05:55.184
So for those used to using
the silent, sterile elevator,

00:05:55.208 --> 00:05:56.518
it's a moment of surprise.

00:05:56.542 --> 00:05:59.917
Folks have permission
to acknowledge or not this disruption.
