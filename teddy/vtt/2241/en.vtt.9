00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:31.934
The patient's in the hospital
because they're hurting.

00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.643
The family's hurting
as they navigate uncertainty, grief

00:04:34.667 --> 00:04:36.351
and the financial burdens of care.

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:38.726
The staff is hurting,
only it's more than burnout.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.351
More and more health care workers

00:04:40.375 --> 00:04:43.851
are reporting feeling overworked
and overextended.

00:04:43.875 --> 00:04:46.059
Now, I'm not so naive as to suggest

00:04:46.083 --> 00:04:48.833
that the solution is
to send in the clowns.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.750
(Laughter)

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.018
But what if?

00:04:55.042 --> 00:04:59.101
What if the tools of medical clown
arts practitioners from around the world

00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:01.559
permeated our entire health care system?
