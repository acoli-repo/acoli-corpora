00:02:57.125 --> 00:03:00.934
Every medical clown encounter begins
by obtaining consent from the patient.

00:03:00.958 --> 00:03:03.309
So we ask him if we can be there.

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:04.601
He says, "Sure."

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:07.184
We're often the one element
that a child could control

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:08.684
while they're in the hospital.

00:03:08.708 --> 00:03:10.851
So we start with a card trick,

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:12.351
fan the deck so he can pick.

00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:14.809
But as soon as the nurse
approaches with the needle

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:16.101
to flush the port,

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:17.768
he starts screaming and cussing

00:03:17.792 --> 00:03:20.351
like no six-year-old
I'd ever heard in my life.

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:22.476
So we say, "Hey, should we
come back later?"

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.934
He stops, mouth open,

00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.518
eyes wet with tears,
face flushed pink with anger,

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:29.851
and he smiles,

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:32.851
"Oh no, you're fine,
I want you to be here."
