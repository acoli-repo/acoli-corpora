00:00:00.958 --> 00:00:02.809
I danced with Bella for the first time

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:05.434
as Bei Mir Bistu Shein filled the room.

00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:07.542
And her blue eyes locked with mine.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:09.559
We took turns singing

00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:11.018
and forgetting the words.

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:12.309
She led, I followed.

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.393
A waltz step here,

00:00:14.417 --> 00:00:15.684
a shimmy here.

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:16.809
(Rattle sound)

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:18.083
(Laughter)

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.434
Hands on our hearts,

00:00:20.458 --> 00:00:21.726
our foreheads touching,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.351
as we communicated
through movement and music,

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:27.018
making sense through nonsense.

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:29.934
Bella is 83 and lives with dementia.

00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:33.101
The dance gives us a chance
to find each other.
