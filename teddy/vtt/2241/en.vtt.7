00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:32.851
"Oh no, you're fine,
I want you to be here."

00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:34.143
OK.

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:35.518
So we start playing a song,

00:03:35.542 --> 00:03:38.518
my colleague on recorder,
me on whoopee cushion.

00:03:38.542 --> 00:03:40.351
The nurse approaches with the needle,

00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:43.125
and it happens again,
this torrent of four-letter words.

00:03:44.583 --> 00:03:46.601
He went from playing and laughing

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.059
to screaming and crying,

00:03:48.083 --> 00:03:50.393
back and forth until
the procedure was complete.

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:51.684
For the first time,

00:03:51.708 --> 00:03:55.476
I experienced this odd duality
of joy and suffering.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.893
But not for the last time.

00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:59.893
See, when we're there,
we're not there merely to distract

00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:01.809
or make anyone feel better per se.
