00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
sharing some of the problems.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
being honest about what was going well, what wasn't,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and making it kind of an annual thing.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because I think there are some very important problems

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that don't get worked on naturally.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That is, the market does not drive the scientists,
