to using immune cells
as special delivery drivers in your body.

00:04:33.975 --> 00:04:37.691
For this example, we used two molecules,
e-selectin and trail,

00:04:37.715 --> 00:04:41.499
but really, the possibility
of drugs you can use are endless.

00:04:41.523 --> 00:04:43.917
And I talked about cancer,

00:04:43.941 --> 00:04:46.603
but where disease goes,
so do immune cells.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.015
So this could be used for any disease.

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.718
Imagine using immune cells
to deliver crucial wound-healing agents

00:04:54.742 --> 00:04:56.584
after a spinal cord injury,

00:04:57.474 --> 00:05:01.871
or using immune cells to deliver drugs
past the blood-brain barrier
