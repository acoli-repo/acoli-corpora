00:00:00.873 --> 00:00:02.906
After decades of research

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.199
and billions of dollars
spent in clinical trials,

00:00:06.223 --> 00:00:09.401
we still have a problem
with cancer drug delivery.

00:00:10.586 --> 00:00:12.730
We still give patients chemotherapy,

00:00:12.754 --> 00:00:14.587
which is so non-specific

00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:17.137
that even though
it kills the cancer cells,

00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:19.446
it kind of kills
the rest of your body, too.

00:00:20.494 --> 00:00:23.950
And yes, we have developed
more selective drugs,

00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:26.677
but it's still a challenge
to get them into the tumor,

00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:29.617
and they end up accumulating
in the other organs as well

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:31.272
or passing through your urine,
