00:02:27.276 --> 00:02:30.341
So what we did was we injected
the nanoparticles,

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:34.382
and they bound almost immediately
to the immune cells in the bloodstream.

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:37.331
And then we injected the cancer cells
to mimic a process

00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:40.506
through which cancer cells
spread throughout our bodies.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.662
And we found something very exciting.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.290
We found that in our treated group,

00:02:46.314 --> 00:02:51.094
over 75 percent of the cancer cells
we initially injected were dead or dying,

00:02:51.118 --> 00:02:53.815
in comparison to only around 25 percent.

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:57.021
So just imagine: these fewer
amount of cells were available

00:02:57.045 --> 00:03:00.157
to actually be able to spread
to a different part of the body.
