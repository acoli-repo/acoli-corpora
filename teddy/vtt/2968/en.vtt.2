Immune cells are these versatile vehicles
that travel throughout our body,

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:04.289
patrolling for signs of disease

00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:07.457
and arriving at a wound
mere minutes after injury.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.419
So I ask you guys:

00:01:10.054 --> 00:01:13.435
If immune cells are already traveling
to places of injury or disease

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:14.612
in our bodies,

00:01:14.636 --> 00:01:16.293
why not add an extra passenger?

00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:19.893
Why not use immune cells to deliver drugs

00:01:19.917 --> 00:01:21.879
to cure some of our biggest problems

00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:23.301
in disease?

00:01:24.446 --> 00:01:26.355
I am a biomedical engineer,

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:29.380
and I want to tell you guys a story
about how I use immune cells

00:01:29.404 --> 00:01:32.639
to target one of the largest
problems in cancer.
