00:03:28.595 --> 00:03:32.811
This was also my first experience
talking to patients

00:03:32.835 --> 00:03:35.728
where they asked how soon
our therapy would be available.

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:39.424
And I keep these stories with me
to remind me of the importance

00:03:39.448 --> 00:03:42.395
of the science,
the scientists and the patients.

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:46.350
Now, our fast-acting results
were pretty interesting,

00:03:46.374 --> 00:03:48.507
but we still had one lingering question:

00:03:48.531 --> 00:03:50.227
Can our sticky balls,

00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:52.934
our particles actually attached
to the immune cells,

00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.899
actually stop the spread of cancer?

00:03:55.624 --> 00:03:59.900
So we went to our animal model,
and we found three important parts.
