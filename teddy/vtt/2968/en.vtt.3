00:01:29.404 --> 00:01:32.639
to target one of the largest
problems in cancer.

00:01:32.663 --> 00:01:35.170
Did you know that over 90 percent
of cancer deaths

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:36.945
can be attributed to its spread?

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:39.234
So if we can stop these cancer cells

00:01:39.258 --> 00:01:42.332
from going from the primary tumor
to a distant site,

00:01:42.356 --> 00:01:44.832
we can stop cancer right in its tracks

00:01:44.856 --> 00:01:47.039
and give people more of their lives back.

00:01:48.182 --> 00:01:49.762
To do this special mission,

00:01:49.786 --> 00:01:52.836
we decided to deliver
a nanoparticle made of lipids,

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.093
which are the same materials
that compose your cell membrane.

00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:59.077
And we've added two special molecules.

00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:02.129
One is called e-selectin,
