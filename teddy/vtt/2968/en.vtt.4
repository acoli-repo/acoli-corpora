00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:02.129
One is called e-selectin,

00:02:02.153 --> 00:02:03.429
which acts as a glue

00:02:03.453 --> 00:02:06.784
that binds the nanoparticle
to the immune cell.

00:02:07.223 --> 00:02:09.716
And the second one is called trail.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.396
Trail is a therapeutic drug
that kills cancer cells

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.665
but not normal cells.

00:02:14.392 --> 00:02:17.194
Now, when you put both of these together,

00:02:17.218 --> 00:02:20.083
you have a mean killing machine on wheels.

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:26.162
To test this, we ran
an experiment in a mouse.

00:02:27.276 --> 00:02:30.341
So what we did was we injected
the nanoparticles,
