00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:03.633
Our primary tumors were smaller
in our treated animals,

00:04:03.657 --> 00:04:06.175
there were fewer cells in circulation,

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.665
and there was little to no
tumor burden in the distant organs.

00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:14.713
Now, this wasn't just a victory
for us and our sticky balls.

00:04:14.737 --> 00:04:16.844
This was also a victory to me

00:04:16.868 --> 00:04:18.123
in drug delivery,

00:04:18.147 --> 00:04:20.078
and it represents a paradigm shift,

00:04:20.102 --> 00:04:21.348
a revolution --

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.710
to go from just using drugs,
just injecting them

00:04:25.734 --> 00:04:28.187
and hoping they go to the right
places in the body,

00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:33.202
to using immune cells
as special delivery drivers in your body.
