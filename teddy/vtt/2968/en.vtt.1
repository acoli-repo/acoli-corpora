00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:31.272
or passing through your urine,

00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:33.077
which is a total waste.

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:36.359
And fields like mine have emerged

00:00:36.383 --> 00:00:38.349
where we try to encapsulate these drugs

00:00:38.373 --> 00:00:40.926
to protect them as they
travel through the body.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.803
But these modifications cause problems

00:00:43.827 --> 00:00:46.252
that we make more modifications to fix.

00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:51.489
So what I'm really trying to say
is we need a better drug delivery system.

00:00:51.513 --> 00:00:52.929
And I propose,

00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:55.584
rather than using solely human design,

00:00:55.608 --> 00:00:57.243
why not use nature's?

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.163
Immune cells are these versatile vehicles
that travel throughout our body,
