If you look at birds, which live a long time,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
cells from the birds tend to be more resistant

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
to a lot of different environmental stresses

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
like high temperature

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
or hydrogen peroxide, things like that.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And our long-lived mutants are too.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
They're more resistant to these kinds of stresses.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
So it could be that the pathways that I've been talking about,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
which are set to run really quickly in the worm,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
have a different normal set point

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
in something like a bird, so that a bird can live a lot longer.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And maybe they're even set really differently

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
in animals with no senescence at all -- but we don't know.
