00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about --

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
maybe they also affect aging.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And it's looking like that's the case.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So after we made our discoveries with little C. elegans,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
people who worked on other kinds of animals

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
started asking, if we made the same daf-2 mutation,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
the hormone receptor mutation, in other animals,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
will they live longer?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And that is the case in flies.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
If you change this hormone pathway in flies, they live longer.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And also in mice -- and mice are mammals like us.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So it's an ancient pathway,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
because it must have arisen a long time ago in evolution

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
such that it still works in all these animals.
