00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
such that it still works in all these animals.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And also, the common precursor also gave rise to people.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
So maybe it's working in people the same way.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And there are hints of this.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So for example, there was one study that was done

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
in a population of Ashkenazi Jews in New York City.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And just like any population,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
most of the people live to be about 70 or 80,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
but some live to be 90 or 100.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And what they found

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
was that people who lived to 90 or 100

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
were more likely to have daf-2 mutations --

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
that is, changes in the gene
