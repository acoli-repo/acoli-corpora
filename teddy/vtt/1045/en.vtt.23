00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And for at least one of them, there is a drug.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
There's one called TOR, which is another nutrient sensor,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
like the insulin pathway.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And mutations that damage the TOR gene --

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
just like the daf-2 mutations --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
extend lifespan in worms

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and flies and mice.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
But in this case, there's already a drug called rapamycin

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
that binds to the TOR protein

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and inhibits its activity.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And you can take rapamycin and give it to a mouse --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
even when it's pretty old, like age 60 for a human,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
that old for a mouse --

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
if you give the mouse rapamycin,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
it will live longer.
