00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And they've been tagged, and they've been found to be 70 years old.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And when you look at these 70 year-old turtles,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
you can't tell the difference, just by looking,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
between those turtles and 20 year-old turtles.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And the 70 year-old ones,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
actually they're better at scouting out the good nesting places,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and they also have more progeny every year.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And there are other examples of these kinds of animals,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
like turns, certain kinds of birds are like this.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And nobody knows if they really can live forever,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
or what keeps them from aging.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
It's not clear.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
If you look at birds, which live a long time,
