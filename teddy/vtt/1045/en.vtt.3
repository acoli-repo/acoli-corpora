00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
for studies of aging --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
in black, after a month, the normal worms are all dead.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But at that time,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
most of the mutant worms are still alive.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And it isn't until twice as long

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
that they're all dead.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And now I want to show what they actually look like in this movie here.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So the first thing you're going to see

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
is the normal worm

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
when it's about college student age -- a young adult.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It's quite a cute little fellow.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And next you're going to see the long-lived mutant when it's young.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So this animal is going to live twice as long.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Is it miserable? It doesn't seem to be.
