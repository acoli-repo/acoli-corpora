There's lots of hormones. There's testosterone, adrenalin.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
You know about a lot of them.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
These hormones are similar

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
to hormones that we have in our bodies.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The daf-2 hormone receptor

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
is very similar to the receptor

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
for the hormone insulin and IGF-1.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Now you've all heard of at least insulin.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
into your tissues after you eat a meal.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So these functions were known for these hormones for a long time,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
but our studies suggested

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that maybe they had a third function that nobody knew about --

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
maybe they also affect aging.
