00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And not only that, it can also just last longer,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
even if there isn't a hurricane.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So that's the concept here

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
for how we think this life extension ability exists.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Now the really cool thing about FOXO

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
is that there are different forms of it.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
We all have FOXO genes,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
but we don't all have exactly the same form of the FOXO gene.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Just like we all have eyes,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And there are certain forms of the FOXO gene

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
that have found to be more frequently present
