00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So this animal is going to live twice as long.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Is it miserable? It doesn't seem to be.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It's active. You can't tell the difference really.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And they can be completely fertile --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
have the same number of progeny as the normal worms do.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Now get out your handkerchiefs here.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
You're going to see, in just two weeks,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the normal worms are old.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You can see the little head moving down at the bottom there.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But everything else is just lying there.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The animal's clearly in the nursing home.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And if you look at the tissues of the animal, they're starting to deteriorate.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You know, even if you've never seen one of these little C. elegans --

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
which probably most of you haven't seen one --

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
you can tell they're old -- isn't that interesting?
