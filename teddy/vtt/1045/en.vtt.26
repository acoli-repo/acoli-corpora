00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
what you could do now pretty well in the lab,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
if you were allowed ethically,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
is start a human life from scratch

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
CK: Ah, so the kinds of drugs I was talking about

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
would not change the genes,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
they would just bind to the protein itself

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and change its activity.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
So if you stop taking the drug, the protein would go back to normal.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
You could change the genes in principle.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
There isn't the technology to do that.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
But I don't think that's a good idea.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And the reason is

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
that these hormones,
