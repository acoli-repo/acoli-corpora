00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
who looks really good for being 90 or 80.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
But it's really more like this:

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
let's say you're a 30 year-old guy -- or in your 30s --

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and you're a bachelor and you're dating people.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And you meet someone you really like, you get to know her.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And you're in a restaurant, and you say, "Well how old are you?"

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
She says, "I'm 60."

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
That's what it's like. And you would never know.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
You would never know, until she told you.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
(Laughter)

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Okay.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So what is the daf-2 gene?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Well as you know, genes, which are part of the DNA,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
they're instructions to make a protein that does something.
