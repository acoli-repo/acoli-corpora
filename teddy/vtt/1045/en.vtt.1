00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that somewhere in these genes, somewhere in the DNA,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
are genes for aging,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
genes that allow them to have different lifespans.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So if there are genes like that,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
then you can imagine that,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
if you could change one of the genes in an experiment,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
an aging gene,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
maybe you could slow down aging and extend lifespan.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And if you could do that, then you could find the genes for aging.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And if they exist and you can find them,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
then maybe one could eventually do something about it.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So we've set out to look for genes that control aging.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And we didn't study any of these animals.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Instead, we studied a little, tiny, round worm called C. elegans,
