00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And we didn't study any of these animals.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Instead, we studied a little, tiny, round worm called C. elegans,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And we were really optimistic that we could find something

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
because there had been a report of a long-lived mutant.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So we started to change genes at random,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
looking for long-lived animals.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And we were very lucky to find

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that mutations that damage one single gene called daf-2

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
doubled the lifespan of the little worm.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So you can see in black, after a month --

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
they're very short-lived; that's why we like to study them

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
for studies of aging --
