00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
It turns out that these long-lived mutants

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
are more resistant to all these diseases.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
They hardly get cancer,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and when they do it's not as severe.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So it's really interesting, and it makes sense in a way,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
that they're still young,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So it suggests

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
that, if we could have a therapeutic or a pill to take

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
to replicate some of these effects in humans,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
maybe we would have a way

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
of combating lots of different age-related diseases

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
all at once.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
How could that work?
