00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
But what we think is that, under conditions of stress,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
the levels of these hormones drop --

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
for example, having limited food supply.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And that, we think,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
is registered by the animal as a danger signal,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
a signal that things are not okay

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and that it should roll out its protective capacity.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So it activates FOXO, FOXO goes to the DNA,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and that triggers the expression of these genes

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
that improves the ability of the cell

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
to protect itself and repair itself.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And that's why we think the animals live longer.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So you can think of FOXO

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
as being like a building superintendent.
