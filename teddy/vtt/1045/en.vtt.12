00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
that is, changes in the gene

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
that encodes the receptor for IGF-1.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And these changes made the gene not act as well

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
as the normal gene would have acted.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
It damaged the gene.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
So those are hints

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
suggesting that humans are susceptible

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
to the effects of the hormones for aging.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So the next question, of course, is:

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Is there any effect on age-related disease?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
As you age, you're much more likely

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
to get cancer, Alzheimer's disease,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
heart disease, all sorts of diseases.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
It turns out that these long-lived mutants
