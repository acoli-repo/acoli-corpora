Well as you know, genes, which are part of the DNA,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
they're instructions to make a protein that does something.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And the daf-2 gene

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
encodes a hormone receptor.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So what you see in the picture there

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
is a cell with a hormone receptor in red

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
punching through the edge of the cell.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
So part of it is like a baseball glove.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Part of it's on the outside,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and it's catching the hormone as it comes by in green.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And the other part is on the inside

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
where it sends signals into the cell.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Okay, so what is the daf-2 receptor

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
telling the inside of the cell?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I just told you that, if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
that you get a receptor that doesn't work as well;
