00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that prevent FOXO

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
from getting into the nucleus where the DNA is.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So it can't turn the genes on.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
That's how it works. That's why we don't see the long lifespan,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
until we have the daf-2 mutant.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
But what good is this for the worm?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Well we think that insulin and IGF-1 hormones

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
are hormones that are particularly active

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
under favorable conditions -- in the good times --

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
when food is plentiful and there's not a lot of stress in the environment.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Then they promote the uptake of nutrients.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
You can store the food, use it for energy,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
grow, etc.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
But what we think is that, under conditions of stress,
