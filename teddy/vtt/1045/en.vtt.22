00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
we can increase the health and longevity of people.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So this is really exciting to me.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
A FOXO is a protein that we found in these little, round worms

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
to affect lifespan,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and here it affects lifespan in people.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So we've been trying in our lab now

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
to develop drugs

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
that will activate this FOXO cell

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
using human cells now

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
in order to try and come up with drugs

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
that will delay aging and age-related diseases.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And I'm really optimistic that this is going to work.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
There are lots of different proteins that are known to affect aging.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And for at least one of them, there is a drug.
