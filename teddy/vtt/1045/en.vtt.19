00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
as being like a building superintendent.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So maybe he's a little bit lazy,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
but he's there, he's taking care of the building.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
But it's deteriorating.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And then suddenly, he learns that there's going to be a hurricane.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
So he doesn't actually do anything himself.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
He gets on the telephone --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
just like FOXO gets on the DNA --

the roofer, the window person,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
the painter, the floor person.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And they all come and they fortify the house.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And then the hurricane comes through,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and the house is in much better condition than it would normally have been in.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And not only that, it can also just last longer,
