00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
it will live longer.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Now I don't want you all to go out taking rapamycin.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
It is a drug for people,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
but the reason is it suppresses the immune system.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
So people take it to prevent organ transplants from being rejected.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
So this may not be the perfect drug

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
for staying young longer.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
But still, here in the year 2011,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
there's a drug that you can give to mice at a pretty old age

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
that will extend their lifespan,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
which comes out of this science

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
that's been done in all these different animals.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
So I'm really optimistic,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and I think it won't be too long, I hope,
