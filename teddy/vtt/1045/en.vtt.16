00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
are more active in these animals.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And the immune system is more active.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And many of these different genes, we've shown,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
actually contribute to the long lifespan of the daf-2 mutant.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
So it's really interesting.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
These animals have within them

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
the latent capacity to live much longer than they normally do.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
They have the ability

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
to protect themselves from many kinds of damage,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
which we think makes them live longer.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So what about the normal worm?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Well when the daf-2 receptor is active,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
then it triggers a series of events

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that prevent FOXO
