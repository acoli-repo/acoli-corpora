00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So how can a hormone ultimately affect the rate of aging?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
How could that work?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Well it turns out that in the daf-2 mutants,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
a whole lot of genes are switched on in the DNA

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
that encode proteins that protect the cells and the tissues,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and repair damage.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And the way that they're switched on

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
is by a gene regulator protein called FOXO.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So in a daf-2 mutant --

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
you see that I have the X drawn here through the receptor.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
The receptor isn't working as well.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Under those conditions, the FOXO protein in blue

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
has gone into the nucleus --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that little compartment there in the middle of the cell --
