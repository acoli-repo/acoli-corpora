00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
has gone into the nucleus --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that little compartment there in the middle of the cell --

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and it's sitting down on a gene binding to it.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
You see one gene. There are lots of genes actually that bind on FOXO.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And it's just sitting on one of them.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
So FOXO turns on a lot of genes.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And the genes it turns on includes antioxidant genes,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
genes I call carrot-giver genes,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
whose protein products

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
actually help other proteins to function well --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
to fold correctly and function correctly.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And it can also escort them to the garbage cans of the cell

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and recycle them if they're damaged.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
DNA repair genes

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
are more active in these animals.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And the immune system is more active.
