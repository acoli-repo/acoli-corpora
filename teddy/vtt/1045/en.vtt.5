00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
you can tell they're old -- isn't that interesting?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So there's something about aging that's kind of universal.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And now here is the daf-2 mutant.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
One gene is changed out of 20,000, and look at it.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
It's the same age, but it's not in the nursing home;

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
it's going skiing.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
This is what's really cool: it's aging more slowly.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It takes this worm two days

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
to age as much as the normal worm ages in one day.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And when I tell people about this,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
they tend to think of maybe an 80 or 90 year-old person

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
who looks really good for being 90 or 80.
