00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Have you ever wanted to stay young a little longer

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and put off aging?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is a dream of the ages.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
But scientists have for a long time

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
thought this just was never going to be possible.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They thought you just wear out, there's nothing you can do about it --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
kind of like an old shoe.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But if you look in nature,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
you see that different kinds of animals

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
can have really different lifespans.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now these animals are different from one another,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
because they have different genes.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So that suggests

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that somewhere in these genes, somewhere in the DNA,
