00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And the reason is

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
that these hormones,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
like the insulin and the IGF hormones and the TOR pathway,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
they're essential.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
If you knock them out completely, then you're very sick.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
So it might be that you would just have to fine tune it very carefully

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
to get the benefits without getting any problems.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And I think that's much better,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
that kind of control would be much better as a drug.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And also, there are other ways of activating FOXO

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
that don't even involve insulin or IGF-1

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
that might even be safer.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
MR: I wasn't suggesting that I was going to go and do it, but ...

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
(Laughter)
