I just told you that, if you make a mutation in the daf-2 gene cell,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
that you get a receptor that doesn't work as well;

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
the animal lives longer.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So that means that the normal function of this hormone receptor

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
is to speed up aging.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
That's what that arrow means.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
It speeds up aging. It makes it go faster.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So it's like the animal has the grim reaper inside of itself,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
speeding up aging.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So this is altogether really, really interesting.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
It says that aging is subject to control by the genes,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and specifically by hormones.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So what kind of hormones are these?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
There's lots of hormones. There's testosterone, adrenalin.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
You know about a lot of them.
