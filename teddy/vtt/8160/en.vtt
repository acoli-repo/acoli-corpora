Do you remember this one?

00:00:02.276 --> 00:00:04.116
(Laughter)

Once recognized as the greatest
phone ever produced.

00:00:11.196 --> 00:00:14.436
I guess most of you
in this room owned one, didn't you?

00:00:21.276 --> 00:00:24.916
So you'll remember
that it never ran out of battery.

00:00:24.916 --> 00:00:26.116
(Laughter)

00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:27.796
You could play Snake on it.

00:00:27.836 --> 00:00:28.836
(Laughter)

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:32.916
It was world-famous for being
the indestructible phone.
