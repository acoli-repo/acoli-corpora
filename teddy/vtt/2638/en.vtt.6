00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:00.705
If this picture represents
the world's poor,

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:04.034
then more than half engage in farming
as a major source of income.

00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:06.295
This gets me really excited.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.671
All of these people, one profession.

00:03:09.247 --> 00:03:10.703
Think how powerful this is.

00:03:10.727 --> 00:03:14.245
When farmers become more productive,
then more than half the world's poor

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.673
earn more money and climb out of poverty.

00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:17.917
And it gets better.

00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:20.196
The product of farming
is, of course, food.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.825
So when farmers become more productive,
they earn more food,

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.570
and they don't just help themselves,

00:03:25.594 --> 00:03:28.820
but they help to feed healthy communities
and thriving economies.

00:03:29.228 --> 00:03:32.801
And when farmers become more productive,
they reduce environmental pressure.
