WEBVTT

00:10:26.532 --> 00:10:30.031
we have a vast amount of delivery
infrastructure available to us.

00:10:30.055 --> 00:10:32.779
The world's companies,
governments and non-profits

00:10:32.803 --> 00:10:35.026
have delivery armies
that are fully capable

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.433
of covering this relatively small area.

00:10:37.927 --> 00:10:40.052
We just lack the will.

00:10:40.913 --> 00:10:42.324
If we are willing,

00:10:42.348 --> 00:10:44.156
every one of us has a role to play.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.291
We first need more people to pursue
careers in human development,

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.463
especially if you live
in a developing nation.

00:10:51.487 --> 00:10:54.973
We need more front line health workers,
teachers, farmer trainers,

00:10:54.997 --> 00:10:57.109
sales agents for life-improving goods.

00:10:57.439 --> 00:11:00.109
These are the delivery people
that dedicate their careers
