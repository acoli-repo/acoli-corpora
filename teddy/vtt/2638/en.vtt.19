00:09:27.872 --> 00:09:30.895
then Africa's companies,
governments and non-profits

00:09:30.919 --> 00:09:33.942
can deliver farm services
to all of her farmers.

00:09:33.966 --> 00:09:35.249
This is possible.

00:09:36.995 --> 00:09:39.748
I'm going to wrap up by generalizing
beyond just farming.

00:09:40.292 --> 00:09:42.399
In every field of human development,

00:09:42.423 --> 00:09:46.252
humanity has already invented
effective tools to end poverty.

00:09:46.276 --> 00:09:47.687
We just need to deliver them.

00:09:48.322 --> 00:09:50.563
So again, in every area
of human development,

00:09:50.587 --> 00:09:53.989
super-smart people a long time ago
invented inexpensive,

00:09:54.013 --> 00:09:55.845
highly effective tools.

00:09:55.869 --> 00:09:57.801
Humanity is armed to the teeth

00:09:57.825 --> 00:10:01.163
with simple, effective
solutions to poverty.
