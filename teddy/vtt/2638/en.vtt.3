00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:30.761
Children need food not only to survive
but also to grow physically and mentally.

00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:34.431
Every day they fail to eat,
they lose a little bit of their future.

00:01:35.114 --> 00:01:37.996
Amongst the extreme poor,
one in three children

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.620
are permanently stunted
from a lifetime of not eating enough.

00:01:42.326 --> 00:01:44.838
When that's combined
with poor access to health care,

00:01:44.862 --> 00:01:49.322
one in 10 extremely poor children
die before they reach age five.

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.356
And only one quarter of children
complete high school

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.884
because they lack school fees.

00:01:53.908 --> 00:01:59.680
Hunger and extreme poverty curb
human potential in every possible way.
