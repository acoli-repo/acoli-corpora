Archimedes was an ancient Greek thinker,

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.013
and he taught us that if we lean
on the right levers,

00:00:35.037 --> 00:00:36.447
we can move the world.

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:40.675
In the fight against extreme poverty,
I believe there are three powerful levers

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.072
that we can lean on.

00:00:42.096 --> 00:00:45.098
This talk is all about those levers,
and why they make poverty

00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:47.207
a winnable fight in our lifetimes.

00:00:47.994 --> 00:00:49.396
What is extreme poverty?

00:00:50.287 --> 00:00:52.232
When I first moved to rural East Africa,

00:00:52.256 --> 00:00:54.156
I stayed overnight with a farm family.

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.729
They were wonderful people.

00:00:56.753 --> 00:00:59.625
They invited me into their home.
We sang songs together

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:00.800
and ate a simple dinner.
