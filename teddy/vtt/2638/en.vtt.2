00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:00.800
and ate a simple dinner.

00:01:00.824 --> 00:01:02.928
They gave me a blanket
to sleep on the floor.

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.738
In the morning, however,
there was nothing to eat.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:09.702
And then at lunchtime, I watched
with an increasingly sick feeling

00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:14.133
as the eldest girl in the family
cooked porridge as a substitute for lunch.

00:01:14.703 --> 00:01:18.907
For that meal, every child
drank one cup to survive.

00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:21.565
And I cannot tell you how ashamed I felt

00:01:21.589 --> 00:01:23.552
when they handed one of those cups to me,

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:26.048
and I knew I had to accept
their hospitality.

00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:30.761
Children need food not only to survive
but also to grow physically and mentally.
