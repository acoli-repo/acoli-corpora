First, hybrid seed is created
when you cross two seeds together.

00:05:04.365 --> 00:05:07.169
If you naturally pollinate
a high-yielding variety

00:05:07.193 --> 00:05:09.504
together with a drought-resistant variety,

00:05:09.528 --> 00:05:13.366
you get a hybrid that inherits
positive traits from both of its parents.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.087
Next, conventional fertilizer,
if used responsibly,

00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:18.910
is environmentally sustainable.

00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:22.427
If you micro-dose
just a pinch of fertilizer

00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:24.535
to a plant that's taller than I am,

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:26.733
you unlock enormous yield gain.

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:28.822
These are known as farm inputs.

00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:31.841
Farm inputs need to be combined
with good practice.
