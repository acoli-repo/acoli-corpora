00:12:28.516 --> 00:12:31.272
Logistically speaking,
it's incredibly possible

00:12:31.296 --> 00:12:32.896
to end extreme poverty.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.102
We just need to deliver
proven goods and services

00:12:36.126 --> 00:12:37.323
to everybody.

00:12:37.665 --> 00:12:41.389
If we have the will, every one of us
has a role to play.

00:12:42.024 --> 00:12:44.913
Let's deploy our time, our careers,

00:12:44.937 --> 00:12:46.188
our collective wealth.

00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:49.517
Let us deliver an end to extreme poverty

00:12:49.541 --> 00:12:51.208
in this lifetime.

00:12:51.971 --> 00:12:53.122
Thank you.

00:12:53.146 --> 00:13:00.146
