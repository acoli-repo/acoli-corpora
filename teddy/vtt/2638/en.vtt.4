00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:05.061
We see ourselves as a thinking,
feeling and moral human race,

00:02:05.085 --> 00:02:08.120
but until we solve these problems
for all of our members,

00:02:08.144 --> 00:02:09.829
we fail that standard,

00:02:10.332 --> 00:02:12.674
because every person
on this planet matters.

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:14.490
This child matters.

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:16.884
These children matter.

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:19.442
This girl matters.

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.898
You know, we see things like this,

00:02:21.922 --> 00:02:23.499
and we're upset by them,

00:02:23.523 --> 00:02:25.325
but they seem like such big problems.

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.184
We don't know how
to take effective action.

00:02:28.893 --> 00:02:30.790
But remember our friend Archimedes.
