00:07:28.536 --> 00:07:32.989
Farmers pay us little by little over time,
covering most of our expenses.

00:07:33.587 --> 00:07:35.724
And then we surround
all that with training.

00:07:36.151 --> 00:07:39.802
Our rural field officers
deliver practical, hands-on training

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:41.231
to farmers in the field

00:07:41.255 --> 00:07:42.800
every two weeks.

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:47.080
Wherever we deliver our services,
farmers use these tools

00:07:47.104 --> 00:07:48.674
to climb out of poverty.

00:07:49.193 --> 00:07:51.617
This is a farmer
in our program, Consolata.

00:07:52.033 --> 00:07:53.876
Look at the pride on her face.

00:07:54.212 --> 00:07:57.870
She has achieved a modest prosperity
that I believe is the human right

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:00.507
of every hardworking person on the planet.
