This is our delivery army,

00:08:30.991 --> 00:08:32.658

governments and nonprofits

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.081
that have delivery armies just like this.

00:08:38.105 --> 00:08:40.151
And I believe we stand at a moment in time

00:08:40.175 --> 00:08:45.078
where collectively, we are capable of
delivering farm services to all farmers.

00:08:45.755 --> 00:08:47.532
Let me show you how possible this is.

with a map of the United States for scale.

00:08:51.982 --> 00:08:55.370

00:08:55.394 --> 00:08:56.567
It's very challenging.

00:08:57.248 --> 00:09:00.901
But we analyzed every 50-mile
by 50-mile block on the continent,
