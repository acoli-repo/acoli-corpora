00:05:59.677 --> 00:06:00.884
in theory.

00:06:00.908 --> 00:06:03.832
We just haven't delivered these things
to everybody just yet.

00:06:04.354 --> 00:06:06.741
In this century, the reason
that people remain poor

00:06:06.765 --> 00:06:08.971
is because maybe they live
in remote places.

00:06:08.995 --> 00:06:11.090
They lack access to these things.

00:06:12.154 --> 00:06:14.715
Therefore, ending poverty
is simply a matter

00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:18.161
of delivering proven goods
and services to people.

00:06:18.185 --> 00:06:20.483
We don't need more genius types right now.

00:06:20.507 --> 00:06:24.956
The humble delivery guy is going
to end global poverty in our lifetime.

00:06:26.088 --> 00:06:27.576
So these are the three levers,

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.253
and the most powerful lever
is simply delivery.
