00:03:29.228 --> 00:03:32.801
And when farmers become more productive,
they reduce environmental pressure.

00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:35.725
We only have two ways
we can feed the world:

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:39.072
we can either make our existing farmland
a lot more productive,

00:03:39.096 --> 00:03:42.376
or we can clear cut forest and savannah
to make more farmland,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.650
which would be environmentally disastrous.

00:03:45.688 --> 00:03:49.000
Farmers are basically
a really important leverage point.

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:51.429
When farmers become more productive,

00:03:51.453 --> 00:03:54.064
they earn more income,
they climb out of poverty,

00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:58.163
they feed their communities and they
reduce environmental land pressure.

00:03:58.187 --> 00:04:00.832
Farmers stand at the center of the world.
