I've been living in rural East Africa
for about 10 years,

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.440
and I want to share a field perspective
with you on global poverty.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:10.508
I believe that the greatest failure
of the human race

00:00:10.532 --> 00:00:13.938
is the fact that we've left more than
one billion of our members behind.

00:00:14.335 --> 00:00:16.677
Hungry, extreme poverty:

00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:19.989
these often seem like gigantic,
insurmountable problems,

00:00:20.013 --> 00:00:21.446
too big to solve.

00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:23.715
But as a field practitioner,

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.543
I believe these are actually
very solvable problems

00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:29.008
if we just take the right strategies.
