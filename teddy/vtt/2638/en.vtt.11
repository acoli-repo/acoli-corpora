00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:31.841
Farm inputs need to be combined
with good practice.

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:35.959
When you space your seeds
and plant with massive amounts of compost,

00:05:35.983 --> 00:05:38.536
farmers multiply their harvests.

00:05:38.946 --> 00:05:41.522
These proven tools and practices
have more than tripled

00:05:41.546 --> 00:05:44.594
agricultural productivity
in every major region of the world,

00:05:44.618 --> 00:05:47.391
moving mass numbers of people
out of poverty.

00:05:47.928 --> 00:05:51.267
We just haven't finished delivering
these things to everybody just yet,

00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:53.032
particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:55.647
So overall, this is amazing news.

00:05:55.671 --> 00:05:59.227
Humanity actually solved
agricultural poverty a century ago,

00:05:59.677 --> 00:06:00.884
in theory.
