Now, this may appear
initially very challenging,

00:07:01.552 --> 00:07:03.763
but it's pretty possible. Let me show you.

00:07:03.787 --> 00:07:06.847
We buy farm inputs with the combined power
of our farmer network,

00:07:06.871 --> 00:07:09.190
and store it in 20 warehouses like this.

00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:13.614
Then, during input delivery,
we rent hundreds of 10-ton trucks

00:07:13.638 --> 00:07:16.476
and send them out to where farmers
are waiting in the field.

00:07:16.953 --> 00:07:20.391
They then get their individual orders
and walk it home to their farms.

00:07:20.415 --> 00:07:22.882
It's kind of like Amazon
for rural farmers.

00:07:23.694 --> 00:07:28.512
Importantly, realistic delivery
also includes finance, a way to pay.

00:07:28.536 --> 00:07:32.989
Farmers pay us little by little over time,
covering most of our expenses.
