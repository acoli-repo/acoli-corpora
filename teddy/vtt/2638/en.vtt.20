00:09:57.825 --> 00:10:01.163
with simple, effective
solutions to poverty.

00:10:01.596 --> 00:10:04.368
We just need to deliver these
to a pretty small area.

00:10:05.266 --> 00:10:08.368
Again using the map
of Sub-Saharan Africa as an example,

00:10:08.392 --> 00:10:11.866
remember that rural poverty is
concentrated in these blue shaded areas.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.324
Urban poverty is even more concentrated,
in these green little dots.

00:10:17.282 --> 00:10:19.798
Again, using a map
of the United States for scale,

00:10:20.317 --> 00:10:23.876
this is what I would call
a highly achievable delivery zone.

00:10:24.346 --> 00:10:26.508
In fact, for the first time
in human history,

00:10:26.532 --> 00:10:30.031
we have a vast amount of delivery
infrastructure available to us.
