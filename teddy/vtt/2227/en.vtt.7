00:03:29.964 --> 00:03:32.340
So, consulting with an engineer,

00:03:32.364 --> 00:03:36.026
I designed a slide system
that would hook into my left hook,

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.248
and I devised another pick-holder system
that would clip into my right hook.

00:03:40.272 --> 00:03:42.070
Now, if this worked,

00:03:42.094 --> 00:03:46.169
I would be able to play the guitar
open tuned on my lap, like a slide.

00:03:47.226 --> 00:03:49.901
So after weeks of testing and alterations,

00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:53.422
I finally had the accessories back
to play the guitar again,

00:03:53.446 --> 00:03:56.266
and I was right back where I was
before losing my hands --

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.394
being issued with noise complaints
from my neighbors, obviously.

00:03:59.418 --> 00:04:00.418
(Laughter)
