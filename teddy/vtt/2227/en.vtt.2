When I was 19, I contracted a disease

00:01:00.752 --> 00:01:04.672
that resulted in the loss
of both my arms at the elbows,

00:01:04.696 --> 00:01:06.601
both my legs below the knee,

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:09.950
and left enough scars on my face
to elicit jealousy in Freddy Krueger.

00:01:09.974 --> 00:01:11.370
(Laughter)

00:01:11.394 --> 00:01:14.520
Now, I may never be able
to communicate in sign language,

00:01:14.544 --> 00:01:17.999
but my increased resilience
and general ability to problem-solve

00:01:18.023 --> 00:01:20.548
has been heightened
by being forced to think laterally

00:01:20.572 --> 00:01:23.245
to overcome problems
that most people aren't faced with.

00:01:27.065 --> 00:01:29.200
One of the first lessons that I learned
