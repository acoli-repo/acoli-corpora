00:05:59.874 --> 00:06:02.096
and we started our own club night,

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.105
and we employed ourselves as the DJs.

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:06.506
(Laughter)

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.247
Suddenly, we had a headline slot.

00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:11.500
(Laughter)

00:06:11.946 --> 00:06:15.271
Now, when we started
that club night, I could not DJ.

00:06:16.487 --> 00:06:19.765
The first time I ever got behind the decks
was on our opening night,

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:21.305
in front of hundreds of people.

00:06:21.329 --> 00:06:23.677
I'd only just learned
where the play button was.

00:06:23.701 --> 00:06:25.080
(Laughter)

00:06:25.104 --> 00:06:27.652
But, being previously faced
with so many ultimatums,

00:06:27.676 --> 00:06:30.682
one's forced to be astute
in adapting to new situations.
