00:00:01.144 --> 00:00:03.184
Often when I'm out in public,

00:00:03.208 --> 00:00:04.557
a child will stare at me.

00:00:06.264 --> 00:00:10.807
And if the child is particularly brave,
they'll approach me and ask:

00:00:11.784 --> 00:00:12.935
"Are you a pirate?"

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.003
(Laughter)

00:00:16.355 --> 00:00:18.117
To which I then need to respond,

00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:19.618
once again,

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:20.793
"Yes."

00:00:20.817 --> 00:00:22.991
(Laughter)

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:24.689
I mean, let's be honest:

00:00:24.713 --> 00:00:28.182
I've got two hooks, prosthetic legs
and a penchant for hard liquor.

00:00:28.206 --> 00:00:29.658
(Laughter)

00:00:29.682 --> 00:00:32.746
All I need is an eye-patch and a parrot,
and I'm basically there.
