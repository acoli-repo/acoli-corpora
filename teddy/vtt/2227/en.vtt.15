00:07:29.203 --> 00:07:32.147
We're merely a blip on the time line
of the universe, right?

00:07:33.226 --> 00:07:34.425
Act accordingly.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.309
Now the ideas that I'm presenting today
were imbued upon me

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:42.738
through some otherwise
unfortunate circumstances, granted,

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:46.554
but they're lying dormant in the lives
of anyone who's willing to exploit them.

00:07:48.138 --> 00:07:51.526
If we all understand
that we all have unique weaknesses,

00:07:52.796 --> 00:07:54.923
and if we're honest about what they are,

00:07:55.753 --> 00:07:58.177
we can learn how to best
take advantage of them,

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:05.672
whether they be mounting a curb
or fear of presenting sales reports
