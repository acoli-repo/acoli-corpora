00:01:58.548 --> 00:02:00.788
until it became obvious
that the time and effort

00:02:00.812 --> 00:02:03.766
I was investing into this endeavor
was clearly disproportionate

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.280
to the benefit of its outcome.

00:02:05.304 --> 00:02:09.968
(Laughter)

00:02:10.517 --> 00:02:13.670
So, I decided to inspect the problem
from a different angle.

00:02:14.586 --> 00:02:16.594
If I couldn't use an ankle joint

00:02:16.618 --> 00:02:19.873
to achieve the range of motion
that I required to mount the curb,

00:02:19.897 --> 00:02:21.708
I would have to use a different joint,

00:02:21.732 --> 00:02:22.882
like my hip.

00:02:23.253 --> 00:02:25.993
So I turned my body
perpendicular to the curb

00:02:26.017 --> 00:02:28.132
and placed my foot up sideways,

00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:30.333
and I was able to step up immediately.
