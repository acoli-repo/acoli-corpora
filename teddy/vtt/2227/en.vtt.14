00:06:56.846 --> 00:07:01.180
It's certainly true that one's priorities
receive somewhat of a realignment

00:07:01.204 --> 00:07:03.527
immediately afterwards.

00:07:03.551 --> 00:07:05.885
And it's also true
that some of those priorities

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:07.948
are met with an increased
sense of urgency.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.576
But another, more salient realization
that comes to light

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.116
is the triviality of our own
self-importance and self-consciousness.

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:21.005
To truly understand the extent
to which your self-consciousness

00:07:22.092 --> 00:07:24.958
prohibits you from engaging
in opportunities

00:07:24.982 --> 00:07:27.972
should lead everyone to take risks
they otherwise wouldn't.

00:07:29.203 --> 00:07:32.147
We're merely a blip on the time line
of the universe, right?
