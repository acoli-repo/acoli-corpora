00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is a world-changing invention.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of lives, worldwide.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But smoke alarms don't prevent fires.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Every year in the USA, over 20,000 are killed or injured

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
with 350,000 home fires.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What if we could prevent electrical fires

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
before they start?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Well, a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So how does electricity ignite residential fires?
