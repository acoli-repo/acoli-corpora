I mean, really, wouldn't you go crazy?

00:01:31.944 --> 00:01:35.390
So fresh and dry, but then,
there's also long and short.

00:01:35.414 --> 00:01:39.310
And then within those families,
there's even more diversity.

00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:43.190
Let's talk about some really
classical types of short pasta.

00:01:43.214 --> 00:01:44.820
Penne -- we all know them, right?

00:01:44.844 --> 00:01:47.380
They are cut at a slanted angle,

00:01:47.404 --> 00:01:49.790
perfect to pick up some of the sauce.

00:01:49.814 --> 00:01:52.866
"Farfalle" means "butterflies,"
or how do you call it here,

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.970
bow ties, because they are,
like, pinched in the middle.

00:01:56.994 --> 00:01:58.730
"Orecchiette" means "little ears,"

00:01:58.754 --> 00:02:01.881
and they're typical from Puglia,
and they are delicious.
