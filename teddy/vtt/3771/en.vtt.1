00:00:29.724 --> 00:00:32.131
others use soy powder.

00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:34.340
In Italy, we tend to use durum wheat.

00:00:34.364 --> 00:00:36.210
Pasta existed for centuries,

00:00:36.234 --> 00:00:38.720
but it really blossomed
during the Renaissance.

00:00:38.744 --> 00:00:41.790
And it's only later on in the 17th century

00:00:41.814 --> 00:00:44.022
that it became more mass produced.

00:00:44.046 --> 00:00:47.070
Whenever you design an object of any kind,

00:00:47.094 --> 00:00:49.220
you think of how you want it to perform.

00:00:49.244 --> 00:00:51.920
So think about the same for pasta.

00:00:51.944 --> 00:00:53.691
Do you want it to be ribbed

00:00:53.715 --> 00:00:55.320
or you want it to be smooth?

00:00:55.344 --> 00:00:57.970
The ribbed ones absorb the sauce better.

00:00:57.994 --> 00:00:59.690
Do you want them to be round

00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:01.290
or do you want them to be square?
