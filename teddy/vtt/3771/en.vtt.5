Many so-called great designers
failed miserably,

00:02:31.124 --> 00:02:35.710
because they tried
to impose a shape onto pasta.

00:02:35.734 --> 00:02:38.400
The great Philippe Starck tried mandala.

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:40.600
Some parts of it, the walls,
were very thick,

00:02:40.624 --> 00:02:41.958
and the others were thinner,

00:02:41.982 --> 00:02:43.620
so when you would boil the pasta,

00:02:43.644 --> 00:02:45.359
some of it would be completely mushy

00:02:45.383 --> 00:02:47.780
while part of it
was too crunchy and uncooked.

00:02:47.804 --> 00:02:52.660
So really wrong, but they
were not women from Bologna,

00:02:52.684 --> 00:02:55.740
they were not chefs from Naples,

00:02:55.764 --> 00:03:00.170
they were not centuries
of families of grandmothers
