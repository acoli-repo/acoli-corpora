00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:01.290
or do you want them to be square?

00:01:01.314 --> 00:01:03.375
They have a different feel on the palate.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.430
Everything is for a reason.

00:01:05.454 --> 00:01:08.790
In the amazing taxonomy
of the pasta species,

00:01:08.814 --> 00:01:10.814
there are many different
ways to divide it,

00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:15.720
but one of the basic divisions
is between fresh pasta and dry pasta.

00:01:15.744 --> 00:01:19.920
Dry pasta is always durum
wheat flour and water.

00:01:19.944 --> 00:01:22.320
Fresh pasta could be either that

00:01:22.344 --> 00:01:25.010
or it could be flour and eggs.

00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:27.240
Just think of having a dough

00:01:27.264 --> 00:01:29.510
that you can shape in any way you want.

00:01:29.534 --> 00:01:31.920
I mean, really, wouldn't you go crazy?
