00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.601
is that these discs do indeed have
hydrogen cyanide in them.

00:07:30.625 --> 00:07:34.024
That last, more elusive ingredient.

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:40.215
Now the bad news is that we don't know
where in the disc it is.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.207
If we look at these,

00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:44.530
I mean, no one can say
they are beautiful images,

00:07:44.554 --> 00:07:47.316
even at the time when we got them.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.760
You see the pixel size is pretty big

00:07:50.784 --> 00:07:53.911
and it's actually bigger
than these discs themselves.

00:07:53.935 --> 00:07:55.391
So each pixel here

00:07:55.415 --> 00:07:58.895
represents something that's much bigger
than our solar system.

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:01.276
And that means
