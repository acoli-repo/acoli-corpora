00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.339
So a lot of this water
that is in interstellar medium

00:06:02.363 --> 00:06:07.950
will survive the rather dangerous,
collapsed journey from clouds

00:06:07.974 --> 00:06:10.156
to disc, to planet.

00:06:10.967 --> 00:06:13.046
So water is alright.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.927
That second ingredient
is not going to be a problem.

00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:20.173
Most planets are going to form
with some access to water.

00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:23.458
So what about hydrogen cyanide?

00:06:23.482 --> 00:06:27.990
Well, we also see cyanides
and other similar organic molecules

00:06:28.014 --> 00:06:30.601
in these interstellar clouds.
