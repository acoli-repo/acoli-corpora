And I would say the challenge
of the next decades,

00:13:02.337 --> 00:13:04.821
for both astronomy and chemistry,

00:13:04.845 --> 00:13:07.585
is to figure out just how often

00:13:07.609 --> 00:13:10.363
we go from having
a potentially living planet

00:13:10.387 --> 00:13:12.791
to having an actually living one.

00:13:12.815 --> 00:13:13.966
Thank you.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:18.825
