00:04:58.686 --> 00:05:01.305
is to instead of looking
for these molecules

00:05:01.329 --> 00:05:03.519
in the planets when they exist,

00:05:03.543 --> 00:05:07.283
is to look for them in the material
that's forming new planets.

00:05:07.307 --> 00:05:11.752
So planets form in discs
of dust and gas around young stars.

00:05:11.776 --> 00:05:15.895
And these discs get their material
from the interstellar medium.

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.633
Turns out that the empty space
you see between stars

00:05:18.657 --> 00:05:22.391
when you are looking up towards them,
asking existential questions,

00:05:22.415 --> 00:05:24.590
is not as empty as it seems,

00:05:24.614 --> 00:05:26.574
but actually full of gas and dust,

00:05:26.598 --> 00:05:28.844
which can, you know,
come together in clouds,

00:05:28.868 --> 00:05:32.223
then collapses to form these discs,
stars and planets.
