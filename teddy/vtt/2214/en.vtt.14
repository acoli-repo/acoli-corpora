00:06:59.546 --> 00:07:02.722
and other molecules
in these planet-forming discs.

00:07:02.746 --> 00:07:05.983
And this is what we found.

00:07:06.007 --> 00:07:08.928
So good news, in these six images,

00:07:08.952 --> 00:07:15.069
those bright pixels represent emissions
originating from hydrogen cyanide

00:07:15.093 --> 00:07:18.577
in planet-forming discs
hundreds of light-years away

00:07:18.601 --> 00:07:20.625
that have made it to our telescope,

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:21.926
onto the detector,

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.684
allowing us to see it like this.

00:07:25.228 --> 00:07:26.506
So the very good news

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.601
is that these discs do indeed have
hydrogen cyanide in them.
