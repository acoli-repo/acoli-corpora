00:03:30.188 --> 00:03:31.902
But the organic molecule

00:03:31.926 --> 00:03:35.705
that seems to be at the center
of the chemical networks

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:40.155
that can produce biomolecules
is hydrogen cyanide.

00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:43.814
So for those of you who know
what this molecule is like,

00:03:43.838 --> 00:03:47.219
you know it's something
that it's a good idea to stay away from.

00:03:47.776 --> 00:03:48.927
But it turns out

00:03:48.951 --> 00:03:52.117
that what's really, really bad
for advanced life forms,

00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:53.799
such as yourselves,

00:03:53.823 --> 00:03:57.307
is really, really good
to get the chemistry started,

00:03:57.331 --> 00:04:00.616
the right kind of chemistry
that can lead to origins of life.
