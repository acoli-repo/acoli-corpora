00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:36.663
Unfortunately, we don't yet
have large enough telescopes to do this.

00:04:36.687 --> 00:04:40.569
We can detect molecules
in the atmospheres of some planets.

00:04:40.593 --> 00:04:42.196
But these are large planets

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.680
sitting often pretty close to their star,

00:04:44.704 --> 00:04:47.490
nothing like these, you know,
just-right planets

00:04:47.514 --> 00:04:48.980
that we're talking about here,

00:04:49.004 --> 00:04:51.196
which are much smaller and further away.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.704
So we have to come up with another way.

00:04:53.728 --> 00:04:58.662
And the other way that we have
conceived of and then followed

00:04:58.686 --> 00:05:01.305
is to instead of looking
for these molecules
