00:10:57.585 --> 00:11:00.410
So when ALMA came online a few years ago,

00:11:00.434 --> 00:11:04.507
that was one of the first things
that I proposed that we use it for.

00:11:05.086 --> 00:11:09.022
And what does a map of hydrogen cyanide
look like in a disc?

00:11:09.046 --> 00:11:11.560
Is the hydrogen cyanide
at the right place?

00:11:11.584 --> 00:11:13.695
And the answer is that it is.

00:11:13.719 --> 00:11:15.726
So this is the map.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.694
You see the hydrogen cyanide emission
being spread out across the disc.

00:11:19.718 --> 00:11:21.568
First of all, it's almost everywhere,

00:11:21.592 --> 00:11:23.155
which is very good news.

00:11:23.179 --> 00:11:26.364
But you have a lot
of extra bright emission

00:11:26.388 --> 00:11:29.591
coming from close to the star
towards the center of the disc.

00:11:29.965 --> 00:11:33.125
And this is exactly
where we want to see it.
