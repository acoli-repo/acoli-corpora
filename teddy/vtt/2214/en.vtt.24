00:11:57.736 --> 00:12:00.276
So this is the opposite
of what we want to see, right?

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.458
This is not places where we could research

00:12:02.482 --> 00:12:06.490
if there is any hydrogen cyanide around
where these planets are forming.

00:12:06.514 --> 00:12:08.093
But in most cases,

00:12:08.117 --> 00:12:10.125
we just don't detect hydrogen cyanide,

00:12:10.149 --> 00:12:12.549
but we detect it in the right place.

00:12:13.038 --> 00:12:15.077
So what does all this mean?

00:12:15.101 --> 00:12:17.547
Well, I told you in the beginning

00:12:17.571 --> 00:12:20.958
that we have lots
of these temperate planets,

00:12:20.982 --> 00:12:22.887
maybe a billion or so of them,

00:12:22.911 --> 00:12:25.433
that could have life develop on them

00:12:25.457 --> 00:12:27.981
if they have the right ingredients.

00:12:28.005 --> 00:12:29.179
And I've also shown

00:12:29.203 --> 00:12:33.078
that we think a lot of the time,
the right ingredients are there --
