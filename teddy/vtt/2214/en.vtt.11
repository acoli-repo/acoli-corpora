00:05:28.868 --> 00:05:32.223
then collapses to form these discs,
stars and planets.

00:05:32.967 --> 00:05:37.538
And one of the things we always see
when we do look at these clouds

00:05:37.562 --> 00:05:38.967
is water.

00:05:38.991 --> 00:05:41.665
You know, I think we have a tendency
to think about water

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:44.289
as something that's,
you know, special to us.

00:05:44.852 --> 00:05:48.661
Water is one of the most abundant
molecules in the universe,

00:05:48.685 --> 00:05:50.410
including in these clouds,

00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:52.901
these star- and planet-forming clouds.

00:05:53.661 --> 00:05:54.815
And not only that --

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:56.815
water is also a pretty robust molecule:

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:59.236
it's actually not that easy to destroy.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.339
So a lot of this water
that is in interstellar medium
