So I'm pretty sure that I'm not
the only one in this room

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.522
who at some point have found myself,
you know, looking up towards the stars,

00:00:09.546 --> 00:00:12.180
and wondered, you know, "Are we it,

00:00:12.204 --> 00:00:16.005
or are there other living planets
out there such as our own?"

00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:20.521
I guess it is possible
that I'm then the only person

00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:22.816
who has obsessed enough
about that question

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.458
to make it my career.

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.482
But moving on.

00:00:26.506 --> 00:00:29.617
How do we get to this question?

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:32.008
Well, I would argue the first thing to do
