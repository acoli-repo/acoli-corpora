00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.665
So having the right kind of planet
is actually not that difficult

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:35.927
when we consider that there's
about 100 billion stars in our galaxy.

00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:40.046
So that gives you about a billion
potential living planets.

00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:43.013
But it's not enough to just be
at the right temperature

00:02:43.037 --> 00:02:44.847
or have the right overall composition.

00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:47.138
You also need the right chemicals.

00:02:47.553 --> 00:02:51.768
And what the second and important
ingredient to make a living planet is --

00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:54.720
I think it's pretty intuitive --

00:02:54.744 --> 00:02:56.331
it's water.

00:02:56.355 --> 00:03:01.498
After all, we did define our planet
as being potentially living
