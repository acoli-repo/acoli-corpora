00:01:59.862 --> 00:02:03.157
And it's just right
for liquid water, that is.

00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:06.276
So how many of these planets
do we have in our galaxy?

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.268
Well, one of the great discoveries
of the past decades

00:02:10.292 --> 00:02:12.772
is that planets are incredibly common.

00:02:13.212 --> 00:02:16.212
Almost every star
has a planet around them.

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:17.649
Some have many.

00:02:17.673 --> 00:02:20.562
And among these planets,

00:02:20.586 --> 00:02:24.426
on the order of a few percent
are earthlike enough

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.006
that we would consider them
potentially living planets.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.665
So having the right kind of planet
is actually not that difficult
