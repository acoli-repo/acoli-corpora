00:12:29.203 --> 00:12:33.078
that we think a lot of the time,
the right ingredients are there --

00:12:33.102 --> 00:12:35.281
we have water, we have hydrogen cyanide,

00:12:35.305 --> 00:12:37.506
there will be other
organic molecules as well

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.197
coming with the cyanides.

00:12:39.879 --> 00:12:44.101
This means that planets
with the most basic ingredients for life

00:12:44.125 --> 00:12:47.148
are likely to be incredibly
common in our galaxy.

00:12:48.133 --> 00:12:50.688
And if all it takes for life to develop

00:12:50.712 --> 00:12:54.014
is to have these basic
ingredients available,

00:12:54.038 --> 00:12:56.901
there should be a lot
of living planets out there.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:59.337
But that is of course a big if.

00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:02.313
And I would say the challenge
of the next decades,
