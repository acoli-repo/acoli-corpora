00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.934
where you have seen
beautiful Italian cypresses,

00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:34.371
and you want to understand, you know,

00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:37.014
does it make sense to import them

00:08:37.038 --> 00:08:38.672
Could you grow them here?

00:08:38.696 --> 00:08:40.760
So you talk to the cypress experts,

00:08:40.784 --> 00:08:42.448

00:08:46.434 --> 00:08:47.974
where you could grow them.

00:08:47.998 --> 00:08:51.896
And if you have a nice,
high-resolution map or image like this,

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.745
it's quite easy to see
that this cypress strip

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:58.229
overlaps with a lot of green
fertile land pixels.

00:08:58.753 --> 00:09:01.720
Even if I start degrading
this map quite a bit,
