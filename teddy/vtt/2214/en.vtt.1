Well, I would argue the first thing to do

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:37.450
is to turn our eyes back down from the sky
to our own planet, the Earth.

00:00:38.173 --> 00:00:42.380
And think about just how lucky
did the Earth have to be

00:00:42.404 --> 00:00:44.626
to be the living planet it is.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.895
Well, it had to be
at least somewhat lucky.

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:49.427
Had we been sitting closer to the Sun

00:00:49.451 --> 00:00:51.458
or a bit further away,

00:00:51.482 --> 00:00:55.998
any water that we have had
would have boiled off or frozen over.

00:00:56.022 --> 00:01:00.083
And I mean, it's not a given
that a planet has water on it.
