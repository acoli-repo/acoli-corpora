00:02:56.355 --> 00:03:01.498
After all, we did define our planet
as being potentially living

00:03:01.522 --> 00:03:04.202
if it had the right temperature
to keep water liquid.

00:03:04.838 --> 00:03:08.409
And I mean, here on Earth,
life is water-based.

00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:10.005
But more generally,

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:14.283
water is just really good
as a meeting place for chemicals.

00:03:14.307 --> 00:03:16.307
It is a very special liquid.

00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:19.911
So this is our second basic ingredient.

00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:22.208
Now the third ingredient, I think,

00:03:22.232 --> 00:03:24.847
is probably a little bit more surprising.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.656
I mean, we are going to need
some organics in there,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.814
since we are thinking about organic life.
