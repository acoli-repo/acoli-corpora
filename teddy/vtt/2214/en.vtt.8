00:03:57.331 --> 00:04:00.616
the right kind of chemistry
that can lead to origins of life.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.983
So now we have our three
ingredients that we need,

00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:06.007
you know, the temperate planet,

00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:08.579
water and hydrogen cyanide.

00:04:08.603 --> 00:04:11.372
So how often do these three come together?

00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:14.045
How many temperate planets
are there out there

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.536
that have water and hydrogen cyanide?

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.688
Well, in an ideal world,

00:04:18.712 --> 00:04:24.688
we would now turn one of our telescopes
towards one of these temperate planets

00:04:24.712 --> 00:04:26.275
and check for ourselves.

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:29.933
Just, "Do these planets have water
and cyanides on them?"
