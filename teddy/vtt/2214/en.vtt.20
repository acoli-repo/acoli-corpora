So coming to the rescue, a few years ago,

00:10:03.463 --> 00:10:07.447
is this new, amazing,
beautiful telescope ALMA,

00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:10.328
the Atacama Large Millimeter
and submillimeter Array

00:10:10.352 --> 00:10:11.552
in northern Chile.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.663
So, ALMA is amazing
in many different ways,

00:10:15.687 --> 00:10:18.171
but the one that I'm going to focus on

00:10:18.195 --> 00:10:22.116
is that, as you can see,
I call this one telescope,

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.475
but you can there are actually
many dishes in this image.

00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:30.126
And this is a telescope
that consists of 66 individual dishes
