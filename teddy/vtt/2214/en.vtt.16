00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:01.276
And that means

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.410
that we don't know where in the disc
the hydrogen cyanide is coming from.

00:08:05.768 --> 00:08:06.998
And that's a problem,

00:08:07.022 --> 00:08:08.571
because these temperate planets,

00:08:08.595 --> 00:08:11.553
they can't access
hydrogen cyanide just anywhere,

00:08:11.577 --> 00:08:14.954
but it must be fairly close
to where they assemble

00:08:14.978 --> 00:08:16.868
for them to have access to it.

00:08:16.892 --> 00:08:22.034
So to bring this home,
let's think about an analogous example,

00:08:22.058 --> 00:08:25.280
that is, of cypress growing
in the United States.

00:08:25.661 --> 00:08:27.371
So let's say, hypothetically,

00:08:27.395 --> 00:08:29.166
that you've returned from Europe

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.934
where you have seen
beautiful Italian cypresses,
