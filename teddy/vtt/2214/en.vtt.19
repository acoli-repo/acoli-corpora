00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.878
I mean, there's definitely
some fertile land there,

00:09:30.902 --> 00:09:33.656
or you wouldn't have
that green tint to the pixel,

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.649
but there's just no way of telling

00:09:35.673 --> 00:09:38.871
whether any of that green
is in the right place.

00:09:38.895 --> 00:09:41.663
And that is exactly the problem
we were facing

00:09:41.687 --> 00:09:44.879
with our single-pixel
images of these discs

00:09:44.903 --> 00:09:46.498
with hydrogen cyanide.

00:09:46.522 --> 00:09:48.696
So what we need is something analogous,

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.791
at least those low-resolution maps
that I just showed you,

00:09:51.815 --> 00:09:56.664
to be able to tell whether there's overlap
between where the hydrogen cyanide is

00:09:56.688 --> 00:09:59.648
and where these planets
can access it as they are forming.
