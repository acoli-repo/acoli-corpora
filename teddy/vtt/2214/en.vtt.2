00:00:56.022 --> 00:01:00.083
And I mean, it's not a given
that a planet has water on it.

00:01:00.107 --> 00:01:03.725
So had we been a dry planet,

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.083
there would not have been
a lot of life on it.

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:09.664
And even if we had had all the water
that we have today,

00:01:09.688 --> 00:01:11.934
if that water had not been accompanied

00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:15.069
by the right kind of chemicals
to get life going,

00:01:15.093 --> 00:01:18.012
we would have a wet planet,
but just as dead.

00:01:18.323 --> 00:01:20.577
So it's so many things that can go wrong,

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:23.522
what are the chances that they go right?

00:01:23.546 --> 00:01:25.983
What are the chances that the planet forms

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:28.657
with at least the basic ingredients needed

00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:31.281
to have an origins of life happening?
