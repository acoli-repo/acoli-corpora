00:10:25.499 --> 00:10:30.126
And this is a telescope
that consists of 66 individual dishes

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.750
that all work in unison.

00:10:32.483 --> 00:10:35.046
And that means that you have a telescope

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.937
that is the size of the largest distance
that you can put these dishes

00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:41.278
away from one another.

00:10:41.302 --> 00:10:44.405
Which in ALMA's case are a few miles.

00:10:44.429 --> 00:10:47.897
So you have a more
than mile-sized telescope.

00:10:48.267 --> 00:10:50.140
And when you have such a big telescope,

00:10:50.164 --> 00:10:52.665
you can zoom in on really small things,

00:10:52.689 --> 00:10:57.561
including making maps of hydrogen cyanide
in these planet-forming discs.

00:10:57.585 --> 00:11:00.410
So when ALMA came online a few years ago,
