00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:31.281
to have an origins of life happening?

00:01:32.515 --> 00:01:35.166
Well, let's explore that together.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.237
So if you're going to have
a living planet,

00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:40.667
the first thing you're going to need

00:01:40.691 --> 00:01:42.483
is a planet.

00:01:42.507 --> 00:01:43.508
(Laughter)

00:01:43.532 --> 00:01:45.656
But not any planet will do.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.458
You're probably going to need
a rather specific and earthlike planet.

00:01:49.482 --> 00:01:50.974
A planet that is rocky,

00:01:50.998 --> 00:01:53.106
so you can have both oceans and land,

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.362
and it's sitting neither too close
nor too far away from its star,

00:01:57.386 --> 00:01:59.838
but at the just-right temperature.

00:01:59.862 --> 00:02:03.157
And it's just right
for liquid water, that is.
