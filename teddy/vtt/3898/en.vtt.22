00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.176
In low-income countries,
after food leaves the farm,

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.856
most food is wasted
early in the supply chain

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.120
due to infrastructure
and storage challenges.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.816
Food is not wasted by consumers
in low-income countries

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.760
which struggle to feed their population.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.936
In the developed world, instead,
after food leaves the farm,

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.336
most food is wasted
at the end of the supply chain

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.816
by markets and consumers,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.976
and wasted food ends up in the landfill

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.200
where it emits methane

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.120
as it decomposes.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.720
This is a consumer choice problem.
