00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:31.056
So by installing solar, this family
is not only helping to reduce emissions,

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.720
but providing safety
and security for their household.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.799
And tropical forests tell their own story.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:41.736
Protecting currently degraded
land in the tropics

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.336
and allowing natural regeneration to occur

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.600
is the number five solution
to reversing global warming.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.520
We can think of trees
as giant sticks of carbon.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.376
This is drawdown in action every year,

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.040
as carbon is removed from
the atmosphere through photosynthesis,
