00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.096
when atmospheric concentrations
of greenhouse gases begin to decline

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.520
on a year-to-year basis.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.416
More simply, it's that point

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.680
when we take out more greenhouse gases
than we put into Earth's atmosphere.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.880
Now, I know we're all concerned
about climate change,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.736
but climate change is not the problem.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.456
Climate change is
the expression of the problem.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.200
It's the feedback of the system
of the planet telling us what's going on.
