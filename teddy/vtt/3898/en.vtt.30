restores soil health, benefits farmers

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.160
and brings carbon back to the land.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.216
Protecting our ecosystems
also protects biodiversity

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.880
and safeguards planetary health

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.360
and the oxygen that we breathe.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.960

Well, we estimate
that to implement all 80 solutions
