00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.136
and to biosequester carbon
in our plants' biomass and soil

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.536
through a process
we all learn in grade school,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.240
the magic of photosynthesis.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.016
It's through a combination
of these three mechanisms

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.800
that drawdown becomes possible.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.880
So how do we get there?

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.480
Well, here's the short answer.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.936
This is a list of the top 20 solutions
to reversing global warming.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.416
Now, I'll go into some detail,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.000
but take a few seconds
to look over the list.
