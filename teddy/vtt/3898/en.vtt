Hello.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.616
I'd like to introduce you to a word
you may never have heard before,

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.256
but you ought to know:

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.520
drawdown.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.880
Drawdown is a new way of thinking about
and acting on global warming.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.176
It's a goal for a future that we want,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.040
a future where reversing
global warming is possible.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.656
Drawdown is that point in time

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.096
when atmospheric concentrations
of greenhouse gases begin to decline
