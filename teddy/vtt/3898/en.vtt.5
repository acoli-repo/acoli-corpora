00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.776
And 20 are coming attractions,
solutions on the pipeline,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.736
and when they come online,

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.520
will speed up our progress.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.656
These are solutions

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.616
that are viable, scalable
and financially feasible.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.760
And they do one or more of three things:

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.136
replace existing fossil fuel-based energy
generation with clean, renewable sources;

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.616
reduce consumption
through technological efficiency

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.880
and behavior change;

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.136
and to biosequester carbon
in our plants' biomass and soil
