The climate impact of food
may come as a surprise to many people,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.576
but what these results show
is that the decisions we make every day

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.016
about the food we produce,
purchase and consume

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.856
are perhaps the most
important contributions

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.080
every individual can make
to reversing global warming.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.056
And how we manage land
is also very important.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.096
Protecting forests and wetlands

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.416
safeguards, expands
and creates new carbon sinks

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.456
that directly draw down carbon.
