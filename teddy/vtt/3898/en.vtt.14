00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.797
and compared against
what we would have to do anyway.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.256
The 84 gigatons reduced
from onshore wind turbines, for example,

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.296
results from the electricity
generated from wind farms

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.280
that would otherwise be produced
from coal or gas-fired plants.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:20.256
We calculate all the costs
to build and to operate the plants

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.840
and all the emissions generated.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.640
The same process is used
to compare recycling versus landfilling,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.176
regenerative versus
industrial agriculture,
