00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.936
is reduced by providing
the basic human right

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.640
to choose when, how
and if to raise a family.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:11.080
But family planning cannot happen
without equal quality of education

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.320
to girls currently being denied access.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.576
Now, we've taken a small liberty here,

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:22.056
because the impact of universal education

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.056
and family planning resources

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.016
are so inextricably intertwined

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.200
that we chose to cut it
right down the middle.
