00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.976
But taken together,
educating girls and family planning

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.256
is the number one solution
to reversing global warming,

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.880
reducing approximately 120 billion tons
of greenhouse gases.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.320
So is drawdown possible?

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.656
The answer is yes, it is possible,

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.400
but we need all 80 solutions.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.976
There are no silver bullets
or a subset of solutions

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.480
that are going to get us there.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.056
The top solutions would take us
far along the pathway,
