00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.816
according to this analysis,
would be refrigeration management,

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.536
or properly managing and disposing of
hydrofluorocarbons, also known as HFCs,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.440
which are used by refrigerators
and air conditioners to cool the air.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.976
We did a great job
with the Montreal Protocol

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.256
to limit the production
of chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs,

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.296
because of their effect
on the ozone layer.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.896
But they were replaced by HFCs,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.096
which are hundreds to thousands of times
more potent a greenhouse gas

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.320
than carbon dioxide.
