It's eclectic, I know,

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.416
from onshore wind turbines
to educating girls,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.000
from plant-rich diets
to rooftop solar technology.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.416
So let's break it down a little bit.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.576
To the right of the slide,
you'll see figures in gigatons,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.056
or billions of tons.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.376
That represents the total
equivalent carbon dioxide

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.136
reduced from the atmosphere

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.080
when the solution is implemented
globally over a 30-year period.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.216
Now, when we think
about climate solutions,
