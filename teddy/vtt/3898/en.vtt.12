00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.520
And that 90 gigatons reduced
is a conservative figure.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.896
If we were to account for the impact
of the Kigali agreement of 2016,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.856
which calls for the phaseout
of hydrofluorocarbons

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.400
and replace them with
natural refrigerants, which exist today,

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.776
this number could increase to 120,
to nearly 200 gigatons

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.016
of avoided greenhouse gases.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.840
Maybe you're surprised, as we were.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.376
Now, before going into some details
of specific solutions,
