caloric and protein intake.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.616
That needs rebalancing,

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.736
and it's in the rebalancing

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.376
that a plant-rich diet
becomes the number four solution

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.760
to reversing global warming.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.920
Moreover, approximately a third
of all food produced is not eaten,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.840
and wasted food emits an astounding
eight percent of global greenhouse gases.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.896
We need to look
where across the supply chain

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.640
these losses and wastage occurs.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.176
In low-income countries,
after food leaves the farm,
