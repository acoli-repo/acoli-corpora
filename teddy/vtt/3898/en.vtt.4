00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.336
to one of understanding and possibility,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.160
and, therefore, opportunity.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.960
I work for an organization
called Project Drawdown.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.295
And for the last four years,

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.176
together with a team of researchers
and writers from all over the world,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.576
we have mapped, measured and detailed

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.800
100 solutions to reversing global warming.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.456
Eighty already exist today,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.320
and when taken together,
those 80 can achieve drawdown.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.776
And 20 are coming attractions,
solutions on the pipeline,
