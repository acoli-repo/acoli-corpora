00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.720
This is a consumer choice problem.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.880
It's not a technology issue.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.656
Preventing food waste from the beginning

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.080
is the number three solution.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.016
But here's the interesting thing.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.416
When we look at the food system as a whole

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.896
and we implement
all the production solutions

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.360
like regenerative agriculture,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.376
and we adopt a plant-rich diet,

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.296
and we reduce food waste,

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:59.176
our research shows that we would produce
enough food on current farmland

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.216
to feed the world's growing population
a healthy, nutrient-rich diet
