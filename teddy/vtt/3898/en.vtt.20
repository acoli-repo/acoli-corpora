00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.960
(Laughter)

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.960
And it's not just how we produce food,

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.416
but what we consume

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.960
that has a massive impact
on global warming.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.176
A plant-rich diet is not
a vegan or a vegetarian diet,

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.280
though I applaud any
who make those choices.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.536
It's a healthy diet
in terms of how much we consume,

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.280
and particularly
how much meat is consumed.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.776
In the richer parts of the world,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.000
we overconsume.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.336
However, low-income countries

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.896
show an insufficient
caloric and protein intake.
