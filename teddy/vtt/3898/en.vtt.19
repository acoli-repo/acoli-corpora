00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.456
which promotes tillage, monocropping

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.776
and the use of synthetic fertilizers
and pesticides which degrade the land

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.600
and turn it into a net emitter
of greenhouse gases.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.176
Regenerative agriculture,
on the other hand,

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.896
restores soil health and productivity,

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.776
increases yield,

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.496
improves water retention,

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.456
benefits smallholder farmers
and large farming operations alike

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.440
and brings carbon back to the land.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.776
It's a win-win-win-win-win.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.960
