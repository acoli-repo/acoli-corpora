00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.176
regenerative versus
industrial agriculture,

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.280
protecting versus
cutting down our forests.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.936
The results are then integrated
within and across systems

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.536
to avoid double-counting

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.920
and add it up to see
if we actually get to drawdown.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.960
OK, let's go into some specific solutions.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.160
Rooftop solar comes in ranked number 10.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.136
When we picture rooftop solar in our minds

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:03.200
we often envision a warehouse in Miami
covered in solar panels.
