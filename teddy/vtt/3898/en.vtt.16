00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:03.200
we often envision a warehouse in Miami
covered in solar panels.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.456
But these are solutions that are relevant
in urban and rural settings,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.496
high and low-income countries,

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.160
and they have cascading benefits.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.096
This is a family
on a straw island in Lake Titicaca

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.376
receiving their first solar panel.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.896
Before, kerosene was used
for cooking and lighting,

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.440
kerosene on a straw island.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:31.056
So by installing solar, this family
is not only helping to reduce emissions,
