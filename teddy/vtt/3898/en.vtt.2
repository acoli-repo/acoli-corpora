00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.056
The problem is global warming,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.376
provoked by the increasing
concentrations of greenhouse gases

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.040
caused by human activity.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.456
So how do we solve the problem?

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.720
How do we begin the process
of reversing global warming?

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.896
The only way we know how is to draw down,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.456
to avoid putting greenhouse gases up

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.440
and to pull down what's already there.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.336
I know.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.560
Given the current situation,
it sounds impossible,
