00:00:00.962 --> 00:00:03.928
We do not choose where to be born.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.215
We do not choose who our parents are.

00:00:09.264 --> 00:00:13.499
But we do choose how we are going
to live our lives.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.527
I did not choose to be born
in South Sudan,

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:19.687
a country rife with conflict.

00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:22.534
I did not choose my name --

00:00:23.304 --> 00:00:24.842
Nyiriak,

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.348
which means "war."

00:00:27.308 --> 00:00:29.271
I've always rejected it

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.730
and all the legacy it was born into.
