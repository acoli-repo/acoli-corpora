00:11:30.457 --> 00:11:32.439
But the truth is,

00:11:32.463 --> 00:11:35.892
an educated woman is feared
in my community.

00:11:35.916 --> 00:11:37.915
But I told them, this is not what I want.

00:11:39.056 --> 00:11:42.049
I don't want to get kids at 16
like my mother did.

00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:45.091
This is not my life.

00:11:45.528 --> 00:11:47.604
Even though my sisters
and I are suffering,

00:11:47.628 --> 00:11:50.156
there's no way we are
heading in that direction.

00:11:50.528 --> 00:11:52.964
I refuse to repeat history.

00:11:54.094 --> 00:11:59.242
Educating a girl will create
equal and stable societies.

00:11:59.266 --> 00:12:03.569
And educated refugees will be the hope
