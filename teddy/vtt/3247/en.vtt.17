00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.177
But then, one of my aunts, Auntie Okoi,

00:08:32.201 --> 00:08:33.990
decided to take my sisters.

00:08:34.643 --> 00:08:37.992
My father sent me money from Juba
for me to go back to school.

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:42.519
Boarding school was heaven,
but it was also so hard.

00:08:43.154 --> 00:08:46.727
I remember during the visiting days
when parents would come to school,

00:08:46.751 --> 00:08:48.155
and my father would miss.

00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:49.889
But when he did come,

00:08:49.913 --> 00:08:51.700
he repeated the same faith in me.

00:08:51.724 --> 00:08:53.030
This time he would say,

00:08:53.054 --> 00:08:55.763
"Mary, you cannot go astray,

00:08:55.787 --> 00:08:58.989
because you are the future
of your siblings."
