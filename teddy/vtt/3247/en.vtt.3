My story is like that
of so many other refugees.

00:01:31.063 --> 00:01:33.137
The war came when I was still a baby.

00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:35.348
And my father,

00:01:35.372 --> 00:01:38.227
who had been absent
in most of my early childhood,

00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:40.827
was doing what other men were doing:

00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:42.578
fighting for the country.

00:01:43.283 --> 00:01:46.403
He had two wives and many children.

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.788
My mother was his second wife,

00:01:50.812 --> 00:01:53.091
married to him at the age of 16.

00:01:53.588 --> 00:01:57.610
This is simply because my mother
came from a poor background,

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:00.079
and she had no choice.
