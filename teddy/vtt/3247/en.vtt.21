Well, believe it or not,
he not only paid our school fees

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.733
but also our uniform
and pocket money for food.

00:10:37.757 --> 00:10:38.980
Clap for him.

00:10:39.004 --> 00:10:40.827
(Applause)

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:43.848
When I finished my high school career,

00:10:43.872 --> 00:10:45.405
I became the head girl.

00:10:45.984 --> 00:10:49.349
And when I sat for the KCSE
for a second time,

00:10:49.373 --> 00:10:52.023
I was able to receive a B minus. Clap.

00:10:52.047 --> 00:10:54.287
(Applause)

00:10:54.311 --> 00:10:55.466
Thank you.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.900
So I really want to say thank you
to Anester Victory, Mr. Gatimu

00:10:59.924 --> 00:11:03.607
and the whole Anester fraternity
for giving me that chance.
