for her children, who are all girls,
to attend her burial,

00:07:32.016 --> 00:07:33.764
simply because we were girls.

00:07:34.806 --> 00:07:36.835
They would lament to me and say,

00:07:37.634 --> 00:07:39.630
"We are sorry, Mary, for your loss.

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:45.848
We are sorry that your parents
never left behind any children."

00:07:47.415 --> 00:07:48.850
And I would wonder:

00:07:49.792 --> 00:07:50.976
What are we?

00:07:52.061 --> 00:07:53.385
Are we not children?

00:07:54.858 --> 00:07:57.760
In the mentality of my community,

00:07:57.784 --> 00:07:59.690
only the boy child counted.
