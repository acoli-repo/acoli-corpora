00:09:27.589 --> 00:09:30.958
"It's not about the A's;
it's about doing your best."

00:09:31.461 --> 00:09:32.640
That was not my best.

00:09:33.887 --> 00:09:35.152
I was determined.

00:09:35.176 --> 00:09:37.556
I wanted to go back and try again.

00:09:38.664 --> 00:09:40.295
But my parents were gone.

00:09:40.972 --> 00:09:42.527
I had no one to take care of me,

00:09:42.551 --> 00:09:44.445
and I had no one to pay that fee.

00:09:44.863 --> 00:09:46.382
I felt so hopeless.

00:09:48.412 --> 00:09:50.562
But then, one of my best friends,

00:09:50.586 --> 00:09:53.939
a beautiful Kenyan lady, Esther Kaecha,

00:09:53.963 --> 00:09:56.027
called me during this devastating moment,

00:09:56.051 --> 00:09:59.412
and she was like, "Mary,
you have a strong will.

00:09:59.436 --> 00:10:01.685
And I have a plan,
and it's going to work."
