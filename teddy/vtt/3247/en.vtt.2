Some of them belong to parents
back home in South Sudan

00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:03.473
who are killing each other

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:07.947
because they belong to a different tribe
or they have a different belief.

00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:13.209
Others come from other African countries
devastated by war.

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:16.858
But when they enter my class,
they make friends,

00:01:16.882 --> 00:01:18.519
they walk home together,

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.050
they do their homework together.

00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:24.739
There is no hatred allowed in my class.

00:01:26.078 --> 00:01:30.211
My story is like that
of so many other refugees.
