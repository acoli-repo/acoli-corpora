00:09:00.142 --> 00:09:03.764
But then, in 2012,

00:09:03.788 --> 00:09:07.762
life took away the only thing
that I was clinging on.

00:09:08.395 --> 00:09:09.721
My father died.

00:09:11.783 --> 00:09:14.019
My grades in school started to collapse,

00:09:15.643 --> 00:09:21.624
and when I sat for my final
high school exams in 2015,

00:09:21.648 --> 00:09:25.240
I was devastated to receive a C grade.

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:27.565
OK, I keep telling students in my class,

00:09:27.589 --> 00:09:30.958
"It's not about the A's;
it's about doing your best."
