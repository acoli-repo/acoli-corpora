00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:03.220
and together we walked
for many agonizing days

00:03:03.244 --> 00:03:05.166
in search of a secure place.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.863
But we could barely rest

00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:10.863
before we were attacked again.

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:14.603
I remember my mother was pregnant,

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:17.678
when she would take turns
to carry me and my younger sister.

00:03:18.362 --> 00:03:21.236
We finally made it across
the Kenyan border, yes.

00:03:21.887 --> 00:03:27.034
But that was the longest journey
that I have ever had in my whole life.

00:03:28.028 --> 00:03:31.551
My feet were raw with blisters.
