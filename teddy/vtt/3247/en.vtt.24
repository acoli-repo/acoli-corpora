Girls and women have

just as much as men.

00:12:12.578 --> 00:12:16.259
Well, we have men in my family
that encourage me to move on:

00:12:16.283 --> 00:12:19.239
my half brothers and also my half sisters.

00:12:20.726 --> 00:12:22.644
When I finished my high school career,

00:12:23.285 --> 00:12:28.802
I moved my sisters to Nairobi,
where they live with my stepsister.

They live 17 people in a house.
