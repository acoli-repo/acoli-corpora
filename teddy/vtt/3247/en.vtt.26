Education creates an equal and fair chance
for everyone to make it.

00:13:06.128 --> 00:13:09.419
I personally believe education
is not all about the syllabus.

00:13:09.841 --> 00:13:11.188
It's about friendship.

00:13:11.746 --> 00:13:13.981
It's about discovering our talents.

00:13:14.005 --> 00:13:17.238
It's about discovering our destiny.

00:13:17.914 --> 00:13:20.468
I will, for example, not forget
the joy that I had

00:13:20.492 --> 00:13:22.730

00:13:22.754 --> 00:13:24.397

00:13:24.421 --> 00:13:26.478
But I wouldn't have gotten that

00:13:26.502 --> 00:13:27.759
anywhere else.

00:13:29.061 --> 00:13:33.468
As a teacher, I see
my classroom as a laboratory
