00:13:29.061 --> 00:13:33.468
As a teacher, I see
my classroom as a laboratory

00:13:33.492 --> 00:13:36.437
that not only generates
skills and knowledge

00:13:36.461 --> 00:13:39.315
but also understanding and hope.

00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:41.166
Let's take a tree.

00:13:41.894 --> 00:13:43.939
A tree may have its branches cut,

00:13:45.022 --> 00:13:49.451
but give it water, and it will
grow new branches.

00:13:49.475 --> 00:13:51.078
For the child of war,

00:13:51.102 --> 00:13:57.129
an education can turn their tears of loss
into a passion for peace.

00:13:57.153 --> 00:14:02.163
And for that reason, I refuse to give up
on a single student in my class.
