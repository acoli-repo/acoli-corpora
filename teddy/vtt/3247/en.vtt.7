00:03:28.028 --> 00:03:31.551
My feet were raw with blisters.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.186
To our surprise,

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.521
we found other family members
who had fled into the camp earlier on,

00:03:38.545 --> 00:03:40.212
where you all are today,

00:03:40.236 --> 00:03:41.942
the Kakuma camp.

00:03:41.966 --> 00:03:45.646
Now, I want you all to be very quiet
just for a moment.

00:03:48.574 --> 00:03:50.153
Do you hear that?

00:03:52.022 --> 00:03:55.206
The sound of silence.

00:03:56.268 --> 00:03:57.642
No gunshots.

00:03:59.157 --> 00:04:01.500
Peace, at last.
