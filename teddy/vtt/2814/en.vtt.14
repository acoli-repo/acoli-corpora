00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.056
Now, I know some of you
won't believe me when I tell you this,

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.560
but I am not against fear.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.016
I know it's an important emotion,
and it's there to keep us safe.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.216
But the problem is
when fear is the primary reaction

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.576
that we teach and encourage in girls

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.240
whenever they face something
outside their comfort zone.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.400
So I was a paraglider pilot
for many years --

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.696
(Applause)

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.136
and a paraglider is a parachute-like wing,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.896
and it does fly very well,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.816
but to many people I realize
it looks just like a bedsheet
