00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.256
And then I picked myself up,

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.096
I groped for the nozzle,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.616
and I did what a firefighter
was supposed to do:

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.376
I lunged forward,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.856
opened up the water

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.760
and I tackled the fire myself.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.976
The explosion had been caused
by a water heater,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.696
so nobody was hurt,
and ultimately it was not a big deal,

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.976
but later Skip came up to me and said,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.736
"Nice job, Caroline,"

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.056
in this surprised sort of voice.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.680
(Laughter)

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.416
And I was confused, because
the fire hadn't been difficult physically,
