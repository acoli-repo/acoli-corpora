00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.120
I became a San Francisco firefighter,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.976
and I was the 15th woman
in a department of 1,500 men.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.760
(Applause)

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.096
And as you can imagine, when I arrived

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.816
there were many doubts
about whether we could do the job.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.176
So even though I was a 5'10",
150-pound collegiate rower,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.576
and someone who could endure
12 hours of searing knee pain --

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.216
(Laughter)

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.256
I knew I still had to prove
my strength and fitness.
