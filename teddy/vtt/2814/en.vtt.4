00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.096
Now, for many years, I thought
this was a story of abject failure,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.616
but today I see it differently,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.496
because when I was
attempting the world record,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.016
I was doing three things.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.376
I was getting outside my comfort zone,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.656
I was calling upon my resilience,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.416
and I was finding confidence in myself

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.840
and my own decisions.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.696
I didn't know it then,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.640
but those are not
the attributes of failure.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.080
Those are the attributes of bravery.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.856
Now, in 1989, at the age of 26,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.120
I became a San Francisco firefighter,
