00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.080
exhilaration, confidence.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.776
I knew I was a good pilot.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.816
I knew the conditions were good,
or I wouldn't be there.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.376
I knew how great it was going to be
a thousand feet in the air.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.016
So yes, fear was there,

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.216
but I would take a good hard look at it,

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.896
assess just how relevant it was

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.256
and then put it where it belonged,

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.696
which was more often than not

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.696
behind my exhilaration, my anticipation

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.920
and my confidence.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.416
So I'm not against fear.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.960
I'm just pro-bravery.
