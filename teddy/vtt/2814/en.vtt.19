00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.656
This is what my own mother did.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.456
She didn't know it then,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.776
but researchers have a name for this.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.896
They call it risky play,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.376
and studies show that risky play
is really important for kids, all kids,

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.976
because it teaches hazard assessment,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.176
it teaches delayed gratification,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.976
it teaches resilience,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.320
it teaches confidence.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.536
In other words,

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.856
when kids get outside
and practice bravery,

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.040
they learn valuable life lessons.
