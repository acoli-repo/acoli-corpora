"Caroline, all that fire, all that danger,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.600
aren't you scared?"

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.200
Honestly, I never heard
a male firefighter asked this.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.440
And I became curious.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.360
Why wasn't bravery expected of women?

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.536
Now, the answer began to come

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.296
when a friend of mine lamented to me

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.776
that her young daughter
was a big scaredy-cat,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.736
and so I began to notice,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.456
and yes, the daughter was anxious,

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.240
but more than that,
the parents were anxious.
