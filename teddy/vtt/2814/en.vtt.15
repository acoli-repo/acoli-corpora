00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.816
but to many people I realize
it looks just like a bedsheet

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.336
with strings attached.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.536
(Laughter)

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.016
And I spent a lot of time on mountaintops

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.616
inflating this bedsheet,

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.320
running off and flying.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.136
And I know what you're thinking.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.440
You're like, Caroline,
a little fear would make sense here.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.656
And you're right, it does.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.176
I assure you, I did feel fear.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.456
But on that mountaintop,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.536
waiting for the wind
to come in just right,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.776
I felt so many other things, too:

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.080
exhilaration, confidence.
