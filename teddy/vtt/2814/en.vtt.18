00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.296
our hesitation in speaking out,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.976
our deference so that we can be liked

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.720
and our lack of confidence
in our own decisions.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.280
So how do we become brave?

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.216
Well, here's the good news.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.216
Bravery is learned,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.656
and like anything learned,

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.520
it just needs to be practiced.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.616
So first,

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.336
we have to take a deep breath

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.416
and encourage our girls

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.136
to skateboard, climb trees

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.720
and clamber around
on that playground fire pole.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.656
This is what my own mother did.
