Well, that girls are fragile
and more in need of help,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.920
and that boys can and should
master difficult tasks by themselves.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.256
It says that girls should be fearful

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.600
and boys should be gutsy.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.656
Now, the irony is that at this young age,

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.176
girls and boys are actually
very alike physically.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.856
In fact, girls are often
stronger until puberty,

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.120
and more mature.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.456
And yet we adults act

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.816
as if girls are more fragile

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.776
and more in need of help,

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.480
and they can't handle as much.
