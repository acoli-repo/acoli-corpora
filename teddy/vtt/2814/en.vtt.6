00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.256
I knew I still had to prove
my strength and fitness.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.096
So one day a call came in for a fire,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.359
and sure enough,
when my engine group pulled up,

00:03:04.383 --> 00:03:08.416
there was black smoke billowing
from a building off an alleyway.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.656
And I was with a big guy named Skip,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.416

and I was right behind,

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.256
and it was a typical sort of fire.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.160
It was smoky, it was hot,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.376
and all of a sudden,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.176
there was an explosion,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.376
and Skip and I were blown backwards,

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.536
my mask was knocked sideways,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.816
and there was this moment of confusion.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.256
And then I picked myself up,
