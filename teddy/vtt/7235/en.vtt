Have you ever wondered
why a pair of siblings

00:00:03.196 --> 00:00:06.876
living in the same house
with the same parents,

00:00:06.916 --> 00:00:08.316
with the same food,

00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:11.876
sometimes end up in opposite sides
of the weight spectrum?

00:00:12.916 --> 00:00:14.316
My name is Mads

00:00:14.316 --> 00:00:16.116
and for the last 25 years,

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:20.796
I've been studying what we eat,
when we eat and how much we eat.

00:00:20.836 --> 00:00:22.476
And probably more importantly,

00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:24.916
I've been studying
how each of our unique bodies

00:00:24.956 --> 00:00:29.196
responds differently to the same food
and the same environment.

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:32.036
To be more precise, I study obesity.
