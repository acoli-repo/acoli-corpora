You need the social stuff there.

00:11:31.986 --> 00:11:33.960
So we've got a very interesting behavior

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.113
about which a lot of our
lay assumptions are incorrect,

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:40.964
but I'm coming to see that actually
there's even more to laughter

00:11:40.964 --> 00:11:43.695
than it's an important social emotion
we should look at,

00:11:43.695 --> 00:11:46.614
because it turns out
people are phenomenally nuanced

00:11:46.614 --> 00:11:48.201
in terms of how we use laughter.

00:11:48.201 --> 00:11:50.485
There's a really lovely
set of studies coming out

00:11:50.485 --> 00:11:52.579
from Robert Levenson's lab in California,

00:11:52.579 --> 00:11:55.055
where he's doing
a longitudinal study with couples.

00:11:55.055 --> 00:11:57.838
He gets married couples,
men and women, into the lab,

00:11:57.838 --> 00:12:00.132
and he gives them
stressful conversations to have
