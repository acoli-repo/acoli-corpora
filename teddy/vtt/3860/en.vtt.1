00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:31.570
and I kind of sat around at the edge
going, "Hoo hoo!" (Laughter)

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.009
Now, incidentally,
what they were laughing at

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:37.609
was a song which people used to sing,

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.255
which was based around
signs in toilets on trains

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:44.250
telling you what you could
and could not do

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.690
in toilets on trains.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.893
And the thing you have to remember
about the English is, of course,

00:00:48.893 --> 00:00:51.616
we do have an immensely
sophisticated sense of humor.

00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:52.775
(Laughter)

00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:55.508
At the time, though, I didn't
understand anything of that.

00:00:55.508 --> 00:00:57.067
I just cared about the laughter,

00:00:57.067 --> 00:01:00.419
and actually, as a neuroscientist,
I've come to care about it again.
