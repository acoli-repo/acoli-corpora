00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.808
you find it associated
with things like tickling.

00:04:31.808 --> 00:04:34.896
That's the same for humans.

00:04:34.896 --> 00:04:39.563
You find it associated with play,
and all mammals play.

00:04:39.563 --> 00:04:43.557
And wherever you find it,
it's associated with interactions.

00:04:43.557 --> 00:04:46.147
So Robert Provine, who has done
a lot of work on this,

00:04:46.147 --> 00:04:50.987
has pointed out that you are 30 times 
more likely to laugh

00:04:50.987 --> 00:04:54.353
if you are with somebody else
than if you're on your own,

00:04:54.353 --> 00:04:56.257
and where you find most laughter

00:04:56.257 --> 00:04:58.984
is in social interactions
like conversation.

00:04:58.984 --> 00:05:01.226
So if you ask human beings,
"When do you laugh?"
