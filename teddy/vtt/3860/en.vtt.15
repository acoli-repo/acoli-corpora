No, that was helpless laughter,

00:07:31.843 --> 00:07:35.118
and in fact, to record that,
all they had to do was record me

00:07:35.118 --> 00:07:38.895
watching one of my friends listening to
something I knew she wanted to laugh at,

00:07:38.895 --> 00:07:40.365
and I just started doing this.

00:07:40.365 --> 00:07:43.582
What you find is that people
are good at telling the difference

00:07:43.582 --> 00:07:45.127
between real and posed laughter.

00:07:45.127 --> 00:07:47.041
They seem to be different things to us.

00:07:47.041 --> 00:07:50.073
Interestingly, you see something
quite similar with chimpanzees.

00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:52.621
Chimpanzees laugh differently
if they're being tickled

00:07:52.621 --> 00:07:54.590
than if they're playing with each other,

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.852
and we might be seeing
something like that here,

00:07:56.852 --> 00:08:00.546
involuntary laughter, tickling laughter,
being different from social laughter.
