So if you ask human beings,
"When do you laugh?"

00:05:01.226 --> 00:05:05.177
they'll talk about comedy and they'll talk
about humor and they'll talk about jokes.

00:05:05.177 --> 00:05:08.376
If you look at when they laugh,
they're laughing with their friends.

00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:11.963
And when we laugh with people, we're

00:05:11.963 --> 00:05:14.626
You are laughing to show people
that you understand them,

00:05:14.626 --> 00:05:17.874

You're doing all that at the same time
as talking to them,

00:05:23.788 --> 00:05:26.808
and the laughter is doing a lot
of that emotional work for you.

00:05:26.808 --> 00:05:29.986
Something that Robert Provine
has pointed out, as you can see here,

00:05:29.986 --> 00:05:31.665
and the reason why we were laughing
