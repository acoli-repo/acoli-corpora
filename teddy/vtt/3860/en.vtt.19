00:09:29.274 --> 00:09:33.083
In contrast, when you hear somebody
laughing in a posed way,

00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:35.125
what you see are these regions in pink,

00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:38.004
which are occupying brain areas
associated with mentalizing,

00:09:38.004 --> 00:09:40.159
thinking about what
somebody else is thinking.

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:41.699
And I think what that means is,

00:09:41.699 --> 00:09:44.896
even if you're having your brain scanned,
which is completely boring

00:09:44.896 --> 00:09:46.096
and not very interesting,

00:09:46.096 --> 00:09:48.429
when you hear somebody going,
"A ha ha ha ha ha,"

00:09:48.429 --> 00:09:50.625
you're trying to work out
why they're laughing.

00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:52.070
Laughter is always meaningful.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.410
You are always trying
to understand it in context,

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.276
even if, as far as you are concerned,
at that point in time,

00:09:57.276 --> 00:09:59.463
it has not necessarily
anything to do with you,

00:09:59.463 --> 00:10:02.135
you still want to know
why those people are laughing.
