00:14:57.992 --> 00:15:00.436
"No seriously, Heinrich,
I think this is broken,"

00:15:00.436 --> 00:15:03.186
we wouldn't enjoy watching that.
That would be stressful.

00:15:03.186 --> 00:15:06.179
Or if he was running around
with a visibly broken leg laughing,

00:15:06.179 --> 00:15:10.010
and his friends are going, "Heinrich, I
think we need to go to the hospital now,"

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.407
that also wouldn't be funny.

00:15:11.407 --> 00:15:13.069
The fact that the laughter works,

00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:16.031
it gets him from a painful,
embarrassing, difficult situation,

00:15:16.031 --> 00:15:19.116
into a funny situation, into what we're 
actually enjoying there,

00:15:19.116 --> 00:15:21.303
and I think that's 
a really interesting use,

00:15:21.303 --> 00:15:23.281
and it's actually happening all the time.

00:15:23.281 --> 00:15:25.972
For example, I can remember
something like this happening

00:15:25.972 --> 00:15:27.169
at my father's funeral.

00:15:27.169 --> 00:15:29.784
We weren't jumping around
on the ice in our underpants.

00:15:29.784 --> 00:15:32.425
We're not Canadian.
