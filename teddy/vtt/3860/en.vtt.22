00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.365
how contagious is this laughter to you,
we see a different profile.

00:11:01.365 --> 00:11:02.868
And here, the younger you are,

00:11:02.868 --> 00:11:05.302
the more you want to join in
when you hear laughter.

00:11:05.302 --> 00:11:08.795
Remember me laughing with my parents
when I had no idea what was going on.

00:11:08.795 --> 00:11:10.021
You really can see this.

00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:11.416
Now everybody, young and old,

00:11:11.416 --> 00:11:14.261
finds the real laughs more contagious
than the posed laughs,

00:11:14.261 --> 00:11:17.171
but as you get older, it all becomes 
less contagious to you.

00:11:17.171 --> 00:11:21.375
Now, either we're all just becoming
really grumpy as we get older,

00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:24.304
or it may mean that as you
understand laughter better,

00:11:24.304 --> 00:11:26.393
and you are getting better at doing that,

00:11:26.393 --> 00:11:29.339
you need more than just
hearing people laugh to want to laugh.

00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:31.986
You need the social stuff there.
