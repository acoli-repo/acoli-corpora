00:00:57.067 --> 00:01:00.419
and actually, as a neuroscientist,
I've come to care about it again.

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:03.176
And it is a really weird thing to do.

00:01:03.176 --> 00:01:05.593
What I'm going to do now
is just play some examples

00:01:05.593 --> 00:01:07.144
of real human beings laughing,

00:01:07.144 --> 00:01:10.627
and I want you think about the sound
people make and how odd that can be,

00:01:10.627 --> 00:01:13.204
and in fact how primitive
laughter is as a sound.

00:01:13.204 --> 00:01:16.013
It's much more like an animal call
than it is like speech.

00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:19.487
So here we've got some laughter for you.
The first one is pretty joyful.
