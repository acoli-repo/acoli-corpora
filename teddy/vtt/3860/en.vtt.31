We're not Canadian.

00:15:32.425 --> 00:15:34.880
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:15:34.924 --> 00:15:38.807
These events are always difficult, I had
a relative who was being a bit difficult,

00:15:38.807 --> 00:15:40.337
my mum was not in a good place,

00:15:40.337 --> 00:15:43.621
and I can remember finding myself
just before the whole thing started

00:15:43.621 --> 00:15:47.868
telling this story about something
that happened in a 1970s sitcom,

00:15:47.868 --> 00:15:50.306
and I just thought at the time,
I don't know why I'm doing this,

00:15:50.306 --> 00:15:52.484
and what I realized I was doing

00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:55.182
was I was coming up with
something from somewhere

00:15:55.182 --> 00:15:59.571
I could use to make her laugh
together with me.

00:15:59.571 --> 00:16:02.884
It was a very basic reaction
to find some reason we can do this.
