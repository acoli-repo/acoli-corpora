00:05:29.986 --> 00:05:31.665
and the reason why we were laughing

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:33.806
when we heard those
funny laughs at the start,

00:05:33.806 --> 00:05:36.511
and why I was laughing
when I found my parents laughing,

00:05:36.511 --> 00:05:39.346
is that it's an enormously
behaviorally contagious effect.

00:05:39.346 --> 00:05:41.440
You can catch laughter from somebody else,

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.099
and you are more likely to catch laughter
off somebody else if you know them.

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:47.358
So it's still modulated
by this social context.

00:05:47.358 --> 00:05:48.946
You have to put humor to one side


00:05:48.946 --> 00:05:51.167
and think about the social 
meaning of laughter

00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:53.255
because that's where its origins lie.

00:05:53.255 --> 00:05:57.435
Now, something I've got very interested in
is different kinds of laughter,

00:05:57.435 --> 00:06:02.148
and we have some neurobiological evidence
about how human beings vocalize
