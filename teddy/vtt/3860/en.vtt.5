She actually says, "Oh my God,
what is that?" in French.

00:02:32.613 --> 00:02:36.179
We're all kind of with her.
I have no idea.

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.606
Now, to understand laughter,
you have to look at a part of the body

00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:43.430
that psychologists and neuroscientists
don't normally spend much time looking at,

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.495
which is the ribcage,

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:46.311
and it doesn't seem terribly exciting,

00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:48.990
but actually you're all using 
your ribcage all the time.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.573
What you're all doing 
at the moment with your ribcage,

00:02:51.573 --> 00:02:53.413
and don't stop doing it, is breathing.

00:02:53.413 --> 00:02:56.563
So you use the intercostal muscles,
the muscles between your ribs,

00:02:56.563 --> 00:02:58.340
to bring air in and out of your lungs

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.530
just by expanding
and contracting your ribcage,
