00:03:28.843 --> 00:03:31.209
and that enemy is laughter,

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.658
because what happens when you laugh

00:03:33.658 --> 00:03:36.959
is those same muscles
start to contract very regularly,

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.377
and you get this very marked
sort of zig-zagging,

00:03:39.377 --> 00:03:41.560
and that's just squeezing
the air out of you.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.027
It literally is that basic a way
of making a sound.

00:03:44.027 --> 00:03:47.023
You could be stamping on somebody,
it's having the same effect.

00:03:47.023 --> 00:03:48.507
You're just squeezing air out,

00:03:48.507 --> 00:03:51.340
and each of those contractions --
Ha! -- gives you a sound.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.303
And as the contractions run together,
you can get these spasms,

00:03:54.303 --> 00:03:58.083
and that's when you start getting
these -- (Wheezing) -- things happening.

00:03:58.083 --> 00:04:01.577
I'm brilliant at this. (Laughter)
