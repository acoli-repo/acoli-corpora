00:07:56.852 --> 00:08:00.546
involuntary laughter, tickling laughter,
being different from social laughter.

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:02.287
They're acoustically very different.

00:08:02.287 --> 00:08:04.779
The real laughs are longer.
They're higher in pitch.

00:08:04.779 --> 00:08:06.198
When you start laughing hard,

00:08:06.198 --> 00:08:08.251
you start squeezing air out
from your lungs

00:08:08.251 --> 00:08:11.442
under much higher pressures
than you could ever produce voluntarily.

00:08:11.442 --> 00:08:14.364
For example, I could never
pitch my voice that high to sing.

00:08:14.364 --> 00:08:18.032
Also, you start to get these sort of
contractions and weird whistling sounds,

00:08:18.032 --> 00:08:20.798
all of which mean that real laughter
is extremely easy,

00:08:20.798 --> 00:08:22.870
or feels extremely easy to spot.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:27.952
In contrast, posed laughter,
we might think it sounds a bit fake.

00:08:27.952 --> 00:08:30.692
Actually, it's not, it's actually
an important social cue.
