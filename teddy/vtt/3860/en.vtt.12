00:05:57.435 --> 00:06:02.148
and we have some neurobiological evidence
about how human beings vocalize

00:06:02.148 --> 00:06:06.281
that suggests there might be
two kinds of laughs that we have.

00:06:06.281 --> 00:06:11.227
So it seems possible that the neurobiology
for helpless, involuntary laughter,

00:06:11.227 --> 00:06:14.431
like my parents lying on the floor
screaming about a silly song,

00:06:14.431 --> 00:06:17.465
might have a different basis to it
than some of that more polite

00:06:17.465 --> 00:06:20.631
social laughter that you encounter,
which isn't horrible laughter,

00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:24.949
but it's behavior somebody is doing
as part of their communicative act to you,

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.050
part of their interaction with you;
they are choosing to do this.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.439
In our evolution, we have developed
two different ways of vocalizing.
