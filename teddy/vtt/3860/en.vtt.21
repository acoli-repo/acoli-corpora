00:10:28.977 --> 00:10:31.129
By the time you are older, you get better,

00:10:31.129 --> 00:10:34.751
but interestingly, you do not hit
peak performance in this dataset

00:10:34.751 --> 00:10:38.282
until you are in your
late 30s and early 40s.

00:10:38.282 --> 00:10:41.323
You don't understand laughter fully
by the time you hit puberty.

00:10:41.323 --> 00:10:44.620
You don't understand laughter fully
by the time your brain has matured

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.014
at the end of your teens.

00:10:46.014 --> 00:10:49.812
You're learning about laughter
throughout your entire early adult life.

00:10:49.812 --> 00:10:53.614
If we turn the question around and now say
not, what does the laughter sound like

00:10:53.614 --> 00:10:55.666
in terms of being real
or posed, but we say,

00:10:55.666 --> 00:10:58.150
how much does this laughter
make you want to laugh,

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.365
how contagious is this laughter to you,
we see a different profile.
