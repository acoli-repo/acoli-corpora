00:12:27.178 --> 00:12:30.684
with laughter,
positive emotions like laughter,

00:12:30.684 --> 00:12:34.492
not only immediately become less stressed,

00:12:34.492 --> 00:12:36.906
they can see them
physically feeling better,

00:12:36.906 --> 00:12:40.064
they're dealing with this
unpleasant situation better together,

00:12:40.064 --> 00:12:41.885
they are also the couples that report

00:12:41.885 --> 00:12:44.244
high levels of satisfaction
in their relationship

00:12:44.244 --> 00:12:45.915
and they stay together for longer.

00:12:45.915 --> 00:12:48.236
So in fact, when you look
at close relationships,

00:12:48.236 --> 00:12:50.134
laughter is a phenomenally useful index

00:12:50.134 --> 00:12:52.607
of how people are regulating
their emotions together.

00:12:52.607 --> 00:12:56.032
We're not just emitting it at each other
to show that we like each other,

00:12:56.032 --> 00:12:58.087
we're making ourselves
feel better together.

00:12:58.087 --> 00:13:01.538
Now, I don't think this is going
to be limited to romantic relationships.
