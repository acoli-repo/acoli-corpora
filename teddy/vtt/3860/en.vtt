Hi. I'm going to talk 
to you today about laughter,

00:00:03.918 --> 00:00:06.707
and I just want to start 
by thinking about the first time

00:00:06.707 --> 00:00:08.736
I can ever remember noticing laughter.

00:00:08.736 --> 00:00:11.558
This is when I was a little girl.
I would've been about six.

00:00:11.558 --> 00:00:15.113
And I came across my parents
doing something unusual,

00:00:15.113 --> 00:00:16.619
where they were laughing.

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.686
They were laughing very, very hard.

00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:20.590
They were lying on the floor laughing.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.540
They were screaming with laughter.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.767
I did not know what they were 
laughing at, but I wanted in.

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:28.471
I wanted to be part of that,

00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:31.570
and I kind of sat around at the edge
going, "Hoo hoo!" (Laughter)
