00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.439
In our evolution, we have developed
two different ways of vocalizing.

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:34.356
Involuntary vocalizations
are part of an older system

00:06:34.356 --> 00:06:37.559
than the more voluntary vocalizations
like the speech I'm doing now.

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:41.040
So we might imagine that laughter
might actually have two different roots.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.088
So I've been looking at this
in more detail.

00:06:43.088 --> 00:06:46.311
To do this, we've had to make
recordings of people laughing,

00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:49.088
and we've had to do whatever it takes
to make people laugh,

00:06:49.088 --> 00:06:52.297
and we got those same people
to produce more posed, social laughter.

00:06:52.297 --> 00:06:53.965
So imagine your friend told a joke,

00:06:53.965 --> 00:06:56.253
and you're laughing because
you like your friend,

00:06:56.253 --> 00:06:58.261
but not really because
the joke's all that.

00:06:58.261 --> 00:07:00.354
So I'm going to play you 
a couple of those.
