00:06:58.261 --> 00:07:00.354
So I'm going to play you 
a couple of those.

00:07:00.354 --> 00:07:03.507
I want you to tell me if you think
this laughter is real laughter,

00:07:03.507 --> 00:07:04.806
or if you think it's posed.

00:07:04.806 --> 00:07:07.742
So is this involuntary laughter
or more voluntary laughter?

00:07:07.742 --> 00:07:12.622
(Audio: Laughing)

00:07:12.622 --> 00:07:14.237
What does that sound like to you?

00:07:14.237 --> 00:07:16.310
Audience: Posed.
Sophie Scott: Posed? Posed.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.819
How about this one?

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:22.370
(Audio: Laughing)

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.802
(Laughter)

00:07:23.802 --> 00:07:25.218
I'm the best.

00:07:25.218 --> 00:07:27.857
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:27.857 --> 00:07:29.593
Not really.

00:07:29.593 --> 00:07:31.843
No, that was helpless laughter,
