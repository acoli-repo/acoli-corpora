00:09:59.463 --> 00:10:02.135
you still want to know
why those people are laughing.

00:10:02.135 --> 00:10:06.001
Now, we've had the opportunity to look 
at how people hear real and posed laughter

00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:07.064
across the age range.

00:10:07.064 --> 00:10:09.995
So this is an online experiment
we ran with the Royal Society,

00:10:09.995 --> 00:10:12.099
and here we just asked people
two questions.

00:10:12.099 --> 00:10:13.927
First of all, they heard some laughs,

00:10:13.927 --> 00:10:16.946
and they had to say, how real 
or posed do these laughs sound?

00:10:16.946 --> 00:10:20.403
The real laughs are shown in red
and the posed laughs are shown in blue.

00:10:20.403 --> 00:10:22.300
What you see is there is a rapid onset.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.652
As you get older, you get better
and better at spotting real laughter.

00:10:25.652 --> 00:10:28.977
So six-year-olds are at chance,
they can't really hear the difference.

00:10:28.977 --> 00:10:31.129
By the time you are older, you get better,
