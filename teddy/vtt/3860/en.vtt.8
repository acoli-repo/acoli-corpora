00:03:58.083 --> 00:04:01.577
I'm brilliant at this. (Laughter)

00:04:01.577 --> 00:04:05.802
Now, in terms of the science of laughter,
there isn't very much,

00:04:05.802 --> 00:04:08.850
but it does turn out that pretty much
everything we think we know

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.042
about laughter is wrong.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.998
So it's not at all unusual, for example,
to hear people to say

00:04:13.998 --> 00:04:16.001
humans are the only animals that laugh.

00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:18.934
Nietzsche thought that humans
are the only animals that laugh.

00:04:18.934 --> 00:04:21.387
In fact, you find laughter
throughout the mammals.

00:04:21.387 --> 00:04:23.973
It's been well-described
and well-observed in primates,

00:04:23.973 --> 00:04:25.377
but you also see it in rats,

00:04:25.377 --> 00:04:26.683
and wherever you find it --

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:28.789
humans, primates, rats --

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.808
you find it associated
with things like tickling.
