It's not something specific to humans --
it's a really ancient behavior

00:16:32.536 --> 00:16:36.600
which really helps us regulate how we feel
and makes us feel better.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.502
In other words, when it comes to laughter,

00:16:39.502 --> 00:16:42.172
you and me, baby, ain't nothing 
but mammals. (Laughter)

00:16:42.172 --> 00:16:44.517
Thank you.

00:16:44.517 --> 00:16:51.763
Thank you. (Applause)
