00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.530
just by expanding
and contracting your ribcage,

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.408
and if I was to put a strap 
around the outside of your chest

00:03:03.408 --> 00:03:05.978
called a breath belt, and just look 
at that movement,

00:03:05.978 --> 00:03:09.132
you see a rather gentle sinusoidal
movement, so that's breathing.

00:03:09.132 --> 00:03:10.710
You're all doing it. Don't stop.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.104
As soon as you start talking,

00:03:12.104 --> 00:03:14.731
you start using your breathing
completely differently.

00:03:14.731 --> 00:03:17.678
So what I'm doing now is you see
something much more like this.

00:03:17.678 --> 00:03:20.271
In talking, you use very fine
movements of the ribcage

00:03:20.271 --> 00:03:21.651
to squeeze the air out --

00:03:21.651 --> 00:03:24.140
and in fact, we're the only animals
that can do this.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.681
It's why we can talk at all.

00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:28.843
Now, both talking and breathing
has a mortal enemy,

00:03:28.843 --> 00:03:31.209
and that enemy is laughter,
