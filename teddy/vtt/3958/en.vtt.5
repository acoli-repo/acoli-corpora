00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.202
the big tech companies seem to agree.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.960
They're actually heavily invested
in touch and speech and gesture,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.760
and also in senses --

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.520
things that can turn
dumb objects, like cups,

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.360
and imbue them with the magic
of the Internet,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.760
potentially turning this digital cloud

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.360
into something we might touch and move.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.480
The parents in crisis over screen time

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.640
need physical digital toys
teaching their kids to read,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.440
as well as family-safe app stores.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.680
And I think, actually,
that's already really happening.
