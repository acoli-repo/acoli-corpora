Your phone is not a very simple tool.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.120
A fork is a simple tool.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.360
(Laughter)

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.199
And we don't like them made of plastic,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.907
in the same way I don't really like
my phone very much --

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:14.531
it's not how I want
to experience information.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.560
I think there are better solutions
than a world mediated by screens.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.000
I don't hate screens, but I don't feel --

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.040
and I don't think any of us feel that good

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.720
about how much time
we spend slouched over them.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.400
Fortunately,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.202
the big tech companies seem to agree.
