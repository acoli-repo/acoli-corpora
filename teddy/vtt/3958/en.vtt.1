00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.480
is meant to be
somewhere natural, outdoors --

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.119
on a beach, fireside.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:35.680
We'll be reading or eating or knitting.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.640
And we're surrounded
by natural light and organic elements.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.280
Natural things make us happy.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.160
And happiness is a great motivator;
we strive for happiness.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.800
Perhaps that's why
we're always redesigning everything,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.520
in the hopes that our solutions
might feel more natural.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.320
So let's start there --

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.760
with the idea that good design
should feel natural.
