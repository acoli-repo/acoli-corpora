00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.040
and then you do this and ... bosh! --

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.400
the website appears on your phone.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.920
It's about 10 cents.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.056
Treehugger is a project
that we're working on

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.480
with Grumpy Sailor and Finch,
here in Sydney.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.400
And I'm very excited
about what might happen

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.240
when you pull the phones apart
and you put the bits into trees,

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.160
and that my children
might have an opportunity

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.800
to visit an enchanted forest
guided by a magic wand,

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.840
where they could talk to digital fairies
and ask them questions,

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.080
and be asked questions in return.
