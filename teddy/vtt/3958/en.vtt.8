A while ago, I got to work
with a design agency, Berg,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.240
on an exploration of what the Internet
without screens might actually look like.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.320
And they showed us a range ways

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.279
that light can work with simple senses
and physical objects

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.600
to really bring the Internet to life,
to make it tangible.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.960
Like this wonderfully mechanical
YouTube player.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.960
And this was an inspiration to me.
