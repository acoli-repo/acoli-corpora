And I think, actually,
that's already really happening.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.760
Reality is richer than screens.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.560
For example, I love books.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.440
For me they are time machines --
atoms and molecules bound in space,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.440
from the moment of their creation
to the moment of my experience.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.000
But frankly,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.400
the content's identical on my phone.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.760
So what makes this
a richer experience than a screen?

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.400
I mean, scientifically.
