00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.640

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.400
But there's more than you can do
with these magic boxes.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.640
Your phone is not
the Internet's door bitch.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.880

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.760

using physics and pixels,

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.987
that can integrate the Internet
into the world around us.

00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:59.531
And I'm going to show you
a few examples of those.
