00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.640
Most of all,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.160
we wanted to create
an intimate, beautiful thing

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.120
that could live in your pocket

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.360
and be loved.

00:05:08.753 --> 00:05:10.896
The binoculars are actually
a birthday present

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.063
for the Sydney Opera House's
40th anniversary.

00:05:13.087 --> 00:05:17.040
Our friends at Tellart in Boston
brought over a pair of street binoculars,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.557
the kind you might find
on the Empire State Building,

00:05:19.581 --> 00:05:22.400
and they fitted them with 360-degree views

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.040
of other iconic world heritage sights --

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.760
(Laughter)

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.800
using Street View.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.880
And then we stuck them under the steps.
