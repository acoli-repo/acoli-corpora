Next I worked with
the Japanese agency, AQ,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.880
on a research project into mental health.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.301
We wanted to create an object

00:04:37.325 --> 00:04:41.040
that could capture the subjective data
around mood swings

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.480
that's so essential to diagnosis.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.120
This object captures your touch,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.000

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.160
or stroke it if you're calm.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.800
It's like a digital emoji stick.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.000

those moments later,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.760
and add context to them online.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.640
Most of all,
