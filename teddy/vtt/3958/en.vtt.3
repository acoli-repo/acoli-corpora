00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.160
through a period of digital information,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.440
towards a period of fluid information,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.680
where your children will expect to be able
to access anything, anywhere at any time,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.600
from quantum physics
to medieval viticulture,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.480
from gender theory to tomorrow's weather,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.840
just like switching on a lightbulb --

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.080
Imagine that.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.800
Humans also like simple tools.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.440
Your phone is not a very simple tool.
