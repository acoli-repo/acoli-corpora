These principles should underpin

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.520
not just for the Internet.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:11.680
You may feel uncomfortable about the age
of information that we're moving into.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.160
You may feel challenged,
rather than simply excited.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.200
Guess what? Me too.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.080
It's a really extraordinary period
of human history.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.680
We are the people
that actually build our world,

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.966
there are no artificial intelligences...

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.415
yet.
