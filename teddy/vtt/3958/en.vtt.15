(Laughter)

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.760
It's us -- designers, architects,
artists, engineers.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.280
And if we challenge ourselves,

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.240
I think that actually
we can have a happy place

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.760
filled with the information we love

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.600
that feels as natural and as simple
as switching on lightbulb.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.355
And although it may seem inevitable,

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:59.720
that what the public wants
is watches and websites and widgets,

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.920
maybe we could give a bit of thought
to cork and light and hacky sacks.
