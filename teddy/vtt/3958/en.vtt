I'd like to start by asking you all
to go to your happy place, please.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.640
Yes, your happy place,

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.600
I know you've got one even if it's fake.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.840
(Laughter)

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.160
OK, so, comfortable?

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.400
Good.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.393
Now I'd like to you to mentally answer
the following questions.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.480
Is there any strip lighting
in your happy place?

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.640
Any plastic tables?

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.360
Polyester flooring?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.200
Mobile phones?

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.720
No?

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.665
I think we all know that our happy place

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.480
is meant to be
somewhere natural, outdoors --
