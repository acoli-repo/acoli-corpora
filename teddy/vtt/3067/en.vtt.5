00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:31.911
I went about with my usual smile.

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:34.184
I didn't drop a single grade.

00:02:34.673 --> 00:02:38.339
When asked how I was doing,
I would shrug and say, "OK."

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:41.358
I was praised for being strong.

00:02:42.108 --> 00:02:44.902
I was the master of being OK.

00:02:46.673 --> 00:02:48.255
But back home, we struggled --

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:51.045
my father hadn't been able
to keep his small business going

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.228
during his illness.

00:02:52.252 --> 00:02:55.283
And my mother, alone,
was grieving the love of her life

00:02:55.307 --> 00:02:56.784
trying to raise three children,

00:02:56.808 --> 00:02:58.685
and the creditors were knocking.

00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:03.020
We felt, as a family, financially
and emotionally ravaged.
