00:13:57.324 --> 00:14:00.863
when I looked at what helps people
to bring the best of themselves to work,

00:14:00.887 --> 00:14:02.561
I found a powerful key contributor:

00:14:02.585 --> 00:14:04.519
individualized consideration.

00:14:05.084 --> 00:14:08.846
When people are allowed
to feel their emotional truth,

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:12.337
engagement, creativity and innovation
flourish in the organization.

00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:15.169
Diversity isn't just people,

00:14:15.193 --> 00:14:17.534
it's also what's inside people.

00:14:17.558 --> 00:14:19.625
Including diversity of emotion.

00:14:22.425 --> 00:14:26.313
The most agile, resilient
individuals, teams,

00:14:26.337 --> 00:14:28.649
organizations, families, communities

00:14:28.673 --> 00:14:31.421
are built on an openness
to the normal human emotions.
