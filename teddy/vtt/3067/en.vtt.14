00:06:59.191 --> 00:07:00.591
And the list goes on.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.414
It's a tyranny.

00:07:04.303 --> 00:07:06.450
It's a tyranny of positivity.

00:07:08.752 --> 00:07:10.061
And it's cruel.

00:07:11.021 --> 00:07:12.171
Unkind.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.641
And ineffective.

00:07:15.728 --> 00:07:18.260
And we do it to ourselves,

00:07:18.284 --> 00:07:19.817
and we do it to others.

00:07:21.373 --> 00:07:24.070
If there's one common feature

00:07:24.094 --> 00:07:27.745
of brooding, bottling
or false positivity, it's this:

00:07:28.666 --> 00:07:31.079
they are all rigid responses.
