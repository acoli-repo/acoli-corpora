00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.210
before I went to school.

00:02:00.234 --> 00:02:03.805
So I put my backpack down
and walked the passage that ran through

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.726
to where the heart of our home
my father lay dying of cancer.

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:10.316
His eyes were closed,
but he knew I was there.

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:13.628
In his presence, I had always felt seen.

00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:15.783
I told him I loved him,

00:02:15.807 --> 00:02:18.407
said goodbye and headed off for my day.

00:02:19.984 --> 00:02:24.072
At school, I drifted from science
to mathematics to history to biology,

00:02:24.096 --> 00:02:26.292
as my father slipped from the world.

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.687
From May to July to September to November,

00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:31.911
I went about with my usual smile.
