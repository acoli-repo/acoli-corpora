But when we push aside normal emotions
to embrace false positivity,

00:09:03.982 --> 00:09:08.982
we lose our capacity to develop skills
to deal with the world as it is,

00:09:10.013 --> 00:09:11.696
not as we wish it to be.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.209
I've had hundreds of people tell me
what they don't want to feel.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.878
They say things like,

00:09:18.902 --> 00:09:22.044
"I don't want to try because
I don't want to feel disappointed."

00:09:23.022 --> 00:09:26.490
Or, "I just want this feeling to go away."

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.102
"I understand," I say to them.
