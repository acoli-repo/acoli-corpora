And try not to say "I am,"
as in, "I'm angry" or "I'm sad."

00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:34.554
When you say "I am"

00:13:34.578 --> 00:13:37.125

00:13:43.046 --> 00:13:44.734

00:13:52.458 --> 00:13:54.708
They're also critical to the workplace.

In my research,

00:13:57.324 --> 00:14:00.863
when I looked at what helps people
to bring the best of themselves to work,
