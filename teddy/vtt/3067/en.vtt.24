Our emotions contain flashing lights
to things that we care about.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.791
We tend not to feel strong emotion

00:12:05.815 --> 00:12:09.036
to stuff that doesn't mean
anything in our worlds.

00:12:10.251 --> 00:12:12.863
If you feel rage when you read the news,

00:12:12.887 --> 00:12:17.136
that rage is a signpost, perhaps,
that you value equity and fairness --

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.736
and an opportunity to take active steps

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.966
to shape your life in that direction.

00:12:23.093 --> 00:12:25.276
When we are open
to the difficult emotions,

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.736
we are able to generate responses
that are values-aligned.

00:12:29.957 --> 00:12:31.942
But there's an important caveat.
