00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:31.606
But one person did not buy into
my story of triumph over grief.

00:03:32.751 --> 00:03:36.268
My eighth-grade English teacher
fixed me with burning blue eyes

00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:38.753
as she handed out blank notebooks.

00:03:39.598 --> 00:03:42.131
She said, "Write what you're feeling.

00:03:43.106 --> 00:03:44.256
Tell the truth.

00:03:44.876 --> 00:03:46.876
Write like nobody's reading."

00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:49.307
And just like that,

00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:52.953
I was invited to show up
authentically to my grief and pain.

00:03:53.395 --> 00:03:55.720
It was a simple act

00:03:55.744 --> 00:03:58.354
but nothing short of a revolution for me.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.341
It was this revolution
that started in this blank notebook
