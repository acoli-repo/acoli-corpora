00:14:59.915 --> 00:15:02.947
My father would comfort me
with soft pats and kisses.

00:15:03.677 --> 00:15:05.211
But he would never lie.

00:15:06.738 --> 00:15:08.856
"We all die, Susie," he would say.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.625
"It's normal to be scared."

00:15:12.483 --> 00:15:16.024
He didn't try to invent
a buffer between me and reality.

00:15:17.037 --> 00:15:18.887
It took me a while to understand

00:15:18.911 --> 00:15:21.499
the power of how he guided me
through those nights.

00:15:22.228 --> 00:15:26.361
What he showed me is that courage
is not an absence of fear;

00:15:27.579 --> 00:15:30.523
courage is fear walking.
