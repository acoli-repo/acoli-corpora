00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:03.020
We felt, as a family, financially
and emotionally ravaged.

00:03:03.553 --> 00:03:07.525
And I began to spiral down,
isolated, fast.

00:03:08.798 --> 00:03:11.916
I started to use food to numb my pain.

00:03:12.733 --> 00:03:14.147
Binging and purging.

00:03:14.893 --> 00:03:18.093
Refusing to accept
the full weight of my grief.

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:23.363
No one knew, and in a culture
that values relentless positivity,

00:03:23.387 --> 00:03:25.424
I thought that no one wanted to know.

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:31.606
But one person did not buy into
my story of triumph over grief.
