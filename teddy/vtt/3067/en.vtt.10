00:04:57.375 --> 00:05:00.977
and yet we are not navigating
this frailty successfully or sustainably.

00:05:02.164 --> 00:05:05.172
The World Health Organization
tells us that depression

00:05:05.196 --> 00:05:08.805
is now the single leading cause
of disability globally --

00:05:09.585 --> 00:05:11.386
outstripping cancer,

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.079
outstripping heart disease.

00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:18.505
And at a time of greater complexity,

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:22.077
unprecedented technological,
political and economic change,

00:05:22.895 --> 00:05:24.672
we are seeing how people's tendency

00:05:24.696 --> 00:05:28.807
is more and more to lock down
into rigid responses to their emotions.
