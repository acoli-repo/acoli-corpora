00:10:57.972 --> 00:11:00.553
Research now shows

00:11:00.577 --> 00:11:03.910
that the radical acceptance
of all of our emotions --

00:11:03.934 --> 00:11:05.593
even the messy, difficult ones --

00:11:05.617 --> 00:11:08.364
is the cornerstone
to resilience, thriving,

00:11:08.388 --> 00:11:11.529
and true, authentic happiness.

00:11:13.268 --> 00:11:18.205
But emotional agility is more
that just an acceptance of emotions.

00:11:18.229 --> 00:11:20.379
We also know that accuracy matters.

00:11:21.228 --> 00:11:25.751
In my own research,
I found that words are essential.

00:11:25.775 --> 00:11:28.807
We often use quick and easy labels
to describe our feelings.

00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:31.466
"I'm stressed" is the most
common one I hear.
