It's denial that makes 50 years
of racist legislation possible

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.522
while people convince themselves
that they are doing nothing wrong.

00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:41.267
And yet, I first learned
of the destructive power of denial

00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:42.624
at a personal level,

00:01:43.117 --> 00:01:47.132
before I understood what it was doing
to the country of my birth.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.650
My father died on a Friday.

00:01:52.564 --> 00:01:54.764
He was 42 years old and I was 15.

00:01:55.802 --> 00:01:58.635
My mother whispered to me to go
and say goodbye to my father

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.210
before I went to school.
