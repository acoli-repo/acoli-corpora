00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.323
When we internalize the difference
between how I feel in all my wisdom

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:05.260
and what I do in a values-aligned action,

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:08.475
we generate the pathway to our best selves

00:13:08.499 --> 00:13:09.906
via our emotions.

00:13:12.466 --> 00:13:15.199
So, what does this look like in practice?

00:13:16.474 --> 00:13:18.292
When you feel a strong, tough emotion,

00:13:18.316 --> 00:13:20.291
don't race for the emotional exits.

00:13:21.203 --> 00:13:24.847
Learn its contours, show up
to the journal of your hearts.

00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:27.569
What is the emotion telling you?

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:33.371
And try not to say "I am,"
as in, "I'm angry" or "I'm sad."
