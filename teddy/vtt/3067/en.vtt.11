On the one hand we might
obsessively brood on our feelings.

00:05:34.387 --> 00:05:36.220
Getting stuck inside our heads.

00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:38.204
Hooked on being right.

00:05:39.085 --> 00:05:41.212
Or victimized by our news feed.

00:05:43.124 --> 00:05:45.148
On the other, we might
bottle our emotions,

00:05:45.172 --> 00:05:47.156
pushing them aside

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.316
and permitting only those emotions
deemed legitimate.

00:05:52.068 --> 00:05:55.238
In a survey I recently conducted

00:05:55.262 --> 00:05:56.996
I found that a third of us --

00:05:57.704 --> 00:05:58.854
a third --

00:05:59.466 --> 00:06:04.366
either judge ourselves for having
so-called "bad emotions,"
