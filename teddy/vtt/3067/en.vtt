Hello, everyone.

00:00:03.531 --> 00:00:04.681
Sawubona.

00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:10.618
In South Africa, where I come from,

00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:13.197
"sawubona" is the Zulu word for "hello."

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:16.844
There's a beautiful and powerful
intention behind the word

00:00:16.868 --> 00:00:19.098
because "sawubona"
literally translated means,

00:00:19.122 --> 00:00:22.413
"I see you, and by seeing you,
I bring you into being."

00:00:23.538 --> 00:00:26.458
So beautiful, imagine
being greeted like that.

00:00:28.093 --> 00:00:31.013
But what does it take
in the way we see ourselves?
