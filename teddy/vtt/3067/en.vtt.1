00:00:28.093 --> 00:00:31.013
But what does it take
in the way we see ourselves?

00:00:31.037 --> 00:00:33.783
Our thoughts, our emotions and our stories

00:00:33.807 --> 00:00:35.139
that help us to thrive

00:00:35.163 --> 00:00:38.113
in an increasingly complex
and fraught world?

00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:42.783
This crucial question has been
at the center of my life's work.

00:00:42.807 --> 00:00:46.117
Because how we deal
with our inner world drives everything.

00:00:46.593 --> 00:00:49.783
Every aspect of how we love, how we live,

00:00:49.807 --> 00:00:51.807
how we parent and how we lead.

00:00:52.696 --> 00:00:56.481
The conventional view
of emotions as good or bad,

00:00:56.505 --> 00:00:58.172
positive or negative,

00:00:58.196 --> 00:00:59.346
is rigid.

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:03.051
And rigidity in the face
of complexity is toxic.
