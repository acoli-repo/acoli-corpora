00:00:07.804 --> 00:00:10.040
You are watching a TED Interview series

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.576

with Difficult Feelings."

I'm your host, Cloe Shasha Brooks,
and a curator at TED.

00:00:16.346 --> 00:00:19.249
Today, we'll be focusing
specifically on burnout,

00:00:19.283 --> 00:00:21.318
both personal and professional,

00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:22.886
with the help of two experts,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.256
Dr. Emily Nagoski and Dr. Amelia Nagoski.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.225
They are identical twin sisters

00:00:28.258 --> 00:00:30.561
