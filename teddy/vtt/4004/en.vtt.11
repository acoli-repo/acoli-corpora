"Strangers communicate
better than spouses!"

00:05:32.901 --> 00:05:34.434
It's a good headline, right?

00:05:35.547 --> 00:05:37.827
I think it entirely misses the point.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.153
The important thing about these studies

00:05:41.177 --> 00:05:43.970
is just how significant
these interactions can be;

00:05:44.795 --> 00:05:47.899
how this special form of closeness

00:05:47.923 --> 00:05:50.701
gives us something we need
as much as we need our friends

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:51.915
and our families.

00:05:52.933 --> 00:05:56.843
So how is it possible that we communicate
so well with strangers?

00:05:58.585 --> 00:06:00.221
There are two reasons.
