00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:00.183
how does it work?

00:07:00.721 --> 00:07:03.471
There are unwritten rules
we tend to follow.

00:07:03.495 --> 00:07:07.291

00:07:21.263 --> 00:07:25.023
So, imagine two people are walking
towards each other on the street.

00:07:25.047 --> 00:07:27.345
They'll glance at each other
from a distance.

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:29.351
That's the civility, the acknowledgment.

00:07:29.375 --> 00:07:31.582
And then as they get closer,
they'll look away,
