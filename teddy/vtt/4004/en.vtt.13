00:06:27.045 --> 00:06:30.647
and you can't believe
that your friend or your spouse

00:06:30.671 --> 00:06:33.474
isn't picking up on it
that you want to leave early.

00:06:33.498 --> 00:06:34.872
And you're thinking,

00:06:34.896 --> 00:06:36.418
"I gave you the look."

00:06:38.696 --> 00:06:41.211
With a stranger, we have
to start from scratch.

00:06:41.235 --> 00:06:42.622
We tell the whole story,

00:06:43.376 --> 00:06:46.464
we explain who the people are,
how we feel about them;

00:06:46.488 --> 00:06:48.656
we spell out all the inside jokes.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.156
And guess what?

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.841
Sometimes they do
understand us a little better.

00:06:54.087 --> 00:06:55.247
OK.

00:06:55.271 --> 00:06:58.767
So now that we know
that talking to strangers matters,

00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:00.183
how does it work?
