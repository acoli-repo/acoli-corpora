00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:04.150
For a minute, I felt like
my existence as a person

00:02:04.174 --> 00:02:05.517
had been noticed,

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:08.270
and I was worth saving.

00:02:11.058 --> 00:02:12.685
The really sad thing is,

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.382
in many parts of the world,

00:02:14.406 --> 00:02:18.336
we're raised to believe
that strangers are dangerous by default,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.478
that we can't trust them,
that they might hurt us.

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.967
But most strangers aren't dangerous.

00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:28.279
We're uneasy around them
because we have no context.

00:02:28.807 --> 00:02:31.004
We don't know what their intentions are.
