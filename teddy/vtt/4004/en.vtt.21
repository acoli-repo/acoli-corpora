00:10:29.854 --> 00:10:31.800
Sometimes in conversation, it comes up,

00:10:31.824 --> 00:10:35.181
people ask me, "What does your dad do?"
or, "Where does he live?"

00:10:35.205 --> 00:10:37.427
And sometimes I tell them the whole truth,

00:10:37.451 --> 00:10:39.608
which is that he died when I was a kid.

00:10:41.386 --> 00:10:43.403
Always in those moments,

00:10:43.427 --> 00:10:45.899
they share their own experiences of loss.

00:10:46.407 --> 00:10:49.543
We tend to meet
disclosure with disclosure,

00:10:49.567 --> 00:10:50.968
even with strangers.

00:10:52.453 --> 00:10:54.105
So, here it is.

00:10:55.425 --> 00:10:59.279
When you talk to strangers,
you're making beautiful interruptions

00:10:59.303 --> 00:11:02.789
into the expected narrative
of your daily life
