00:00:58.184 --> 00:01:01.454
These were really profound experiences.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.358
They were unexpected pleasures.

00:01:03.382 --> 00:01:05.847
They were genuine emotional connections.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.242
They were liberating moments.

00:01:10.098 --> 00:01:14.202
So one day, I was standing on a corner
waiting for the light to change,

00:01:14.226 --> 00:01:15.535
which, I'm a New Yorker,

00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:19.066
so that means I was actually standing
in the street on the storm drain,

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:22.014
as if that could get me across faster.

00:01:22.038 --> 00:01:24.039
And there's an old man
standing next to me.

00:01:24.063 --> 00:01:28.890
So he's wearing, like, a long overcoat
and sort of an old-man hat,

00:01:28.914 --> 00:01:31.040
and he looked like somebody from a movie.
