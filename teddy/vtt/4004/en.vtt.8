00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:05.111
I know an American researcher
who travels frequently

00:04:05.135 --> 00:04:07.945
in Central Asia and Africa, alone.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.449
She's entering into towns and cities

00:04:11.473 --> 00:04:13.524
as a complete stranger.

00:04:13.937 --> 00:04:16.102
She has no bonds, no connections.

00:04:16.126 --> 00:04:17.475
She's a foreigner.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:20.333
Her survival strategy is this:

00:04:20.357 --> 00:04:24.334
get one stranger to see you
as a real, individual person.

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:28.239
If you can do that, it'll help
other people see you that way, too.

00:04:28.817 --> 00:04:33.225
The second benefit of using our senses
has to do with intimacy.
