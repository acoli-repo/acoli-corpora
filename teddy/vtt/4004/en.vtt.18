If you're passing somebody on the street
or in the hallway here, smile.

00:09:00.342 --> 00:09:01.610
See what happens.

00:09:02.113 --> 00:09:04.150
Another is triangulation.

00:09:04.552 --> 00:09:06.231
There's you, there's a stranger,

00:09:06.255 --> 00:09:10.364
there's some third thing
that you both might see and comment on,

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:13.121
like a piece of public art

00:09:13.145 --> 00:09:15.270
or somebody preaching in the street

00:09:15.659 --> 00:09:17.882
or somebody wearing funny clothes.

00:09:18.689 --> 00:09:19.840
Give it a try.

00:09:19.864 --> 00:09:23.848
Make a comment about that third thing,
and see if starts a conversation.

00:09:24.621 --> 00:09:26.345
Another is what I call noticing.

00:09:26.369 --> 00:09:28.328
This is usually giving a compliment.

00:09:29.003 --> 00:09:32.259
I'm a big fan of noticing people's shoes.
