00:10:59.303 --> 00:11:02.789
into the expected narrative
of your daily life

00:11:02.813 --> 00:11:04.032
and theirs.

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.933
You're making unexpected connections.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.983
If you don't talk to strangers,
you're missing out on all of that.

00:11:13.544 --> 00:11:15.822
We spend a lot of time

00:11:15.846 --> 00:11:18.423
teaching our children about strangers.

00:11:18.764 --> 00:11:22.657
What would happen if we spent
more time teaching ourselves?

00:11:23.441 --> 00:11:27.784
We could reject all the ideas
that make us so suspicious of each other.

00:11:28.649 --> 00:11:31.284
We could make a space for change.
