00:03:27.867 --> 00:03:30.079
using perception instead of categories

00:03:30.103 --> 00:03:32.006
is much easier said than done.

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.074
Categories are something our brains use.

00:03:35.693 --> 00:03:37.330
When it comes to people,

00:03:37.354 --> 00:03:39.765
it's sort of a shortcut
for learning about them.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.538
We see male, female, young, old,

00:03:44.562 --> 00:03:48.924
black, brown, white, stranger, friend,

00:03:48.948 --> 00:03:51.353
and we use the information in that box.

00:03:52.112 --> 00:03:53.830
It's quick, it's easy

00:03:53.854 --> 00:03:55.630
and it's a road to bias.

00:03:56.052 --> 00:03:59.921
And it means we're not thinking
about people as individuals.
