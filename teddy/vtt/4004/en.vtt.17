00:08:29.563 --> 00:08:31.646
or when you're in a new place

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.867
and you're trying to figure out
what the right thing to do is.

00:08:35.332 --> 00:08:40.393
Sometimes breaking the rules a little bit
is where the action is.

00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:47.020
In case it's not clear,
I really want you to do this. OK?

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.679
So here's how it's going to go.

00:08:49.703 --> 00:08:51.729
Find somebody who is making eye contact.

00:08:51.753 --> 00:08:53.442
That's a good signal.

00:08:53.466 --> 00:08:55.609
The first thing is a simple smile.

00:08:56.402 --> 00:09:00.318
If you're passing somebody on the street
or in the hallway here, smile.
