I'm a big fan of noticing people's shoes.

00:09:32.283 --> 00:09:35.039
I'm actually not wearing
fabulous shoes right now,

00:09:35.063 --> 00:09:37.222
but shoes are fabulous in general.

00:09:37.817 --> 00:09:41.943
And they're pretty neutral
as far as giving compliments goes.

00:09:41.967 --> 00:09:45.575

00:09:45.599 --> 00:09:49.496
You may have already experienced

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.938
It can be awkward
to talk to someone on the street;

00:09:51.962 --> 00:09:54.033

they're going to respond.

00:09:54.057 --> 00:09:56.599
But you can always talk
to their dog or their baby.

00:09:56.623 --> 00:09:57.972
The dog or the baby

00:09:57.996 --> 00:10:00.582
is a social conduit to the person,
