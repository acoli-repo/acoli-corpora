00:00:01.012 --> 00:00:03.539
A long time ago, there lived a Giant,

00:00:04.353 --> 00:00:09.167
a Selfish Giant, whose stunning garden
was the most beautiful in all the land.

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:12.053
One evening, this Giant came home

00:00:12.077 --> 00:00:14.519
and found all these children
playing in his garden,

00:00:14.543 --> 00:00:16.136
and he became enraged.

00:00:16.773 --> 00:00:20.128
"My own garden is my own garden!"

00:00:20.152 --> 00:00:21.570
the Giant said.

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.720
And he built this high wall around it.

00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:30.881
The author Oscar Wilde wrote the story
of "The Selfish Giant" in 1888.
