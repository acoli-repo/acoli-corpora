00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This meeting has really been about a digital revolution,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but I'd like to argue that it's done; we won.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We've had a digital revolution but we don't need to keep having it.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I'd like to look after that,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to look what comes after the digital revolution.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So, let me start projecting forward.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
These are some projects I'm involved in today at MIT,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
looking what comes after computers.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
