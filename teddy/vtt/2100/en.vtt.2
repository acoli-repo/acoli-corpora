00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But I would go in on occasion.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And on one particular day,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
the campers were jumping through inner tubes,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
They were diving through inner tubes. And I thought this would be great fun.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So I dove through the inner tube,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and the bully of the camp grabbed my ankles.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And I tried to come up for air,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and my lower back hit the bottom of the inner tube.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And I went wild eyed and thought I was going to die.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
A camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
From that point onward I was terrified of swimming.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
That is something that I did not get over.
