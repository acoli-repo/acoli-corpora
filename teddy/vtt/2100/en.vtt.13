00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
I suffered through Spanish for junior high, first year of high school,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and the sum total of my knowledge

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
was pretty much, "Donde esta el bano?"

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And I wouldn't even catch the response. A sad state of affairs.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Then I transferred to a different school sophomore year, and

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I had a choice of other languages. Most of my friends were taking Japanese.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
So I thought why not punish myself? I'll do Japanese.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Six months later I had the chance to go to Japan.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
My teachers assured me, they said, "Don't worry.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
You'll have Japanese language classes every day to help you cope.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
It will be an amazing experience." My first overseas experience in fact.
