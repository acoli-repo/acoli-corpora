00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Even did lessons with Olympians -- nothing helped.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And then Chris Sacca, who is now a dear friend mine,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
had completed an Iron Man with 103 degree temperature,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
said, "I have the answer to your prayers."

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And he introduced me to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
the work of a man named Terry Laughlin

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
who is the founder of Total Immersion Swimming.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
That set me on the road to examining biomechanics.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So here are the new rules of swimming,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
if any of you are afraid of swimming, or not good at it.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
The first is, forget about kicking. Very counterintuitive.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So it turns out that propulsion isn't really the problem.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Kicking harder doesn't solve the problem

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent
