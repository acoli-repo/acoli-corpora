00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and then propelling himself by streamlining -- very important.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Incorrect, above, which is what almost every swimming coach will teach you.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Not their fault, honestly.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And I'll get to implicit versus explicit in a moment.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Below is what most swimmers

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
will find enables them to do what I did,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
which is going from 21 strokes per 20-yard length

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
to 11 strokes

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
in two workouts with no coach, no video monitoring.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And now I love swimming. I can't wait to go swimming.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I'll be doing a swimming lesson later, for myself, if anyone wants to join me.
