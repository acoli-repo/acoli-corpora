00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
of becoming an excellent long-distance swimmer,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
a world-class language learner,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and a tango champion.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And I would like to share my art.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
If I have an art, it's deconstructing things

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that really scare the living hell out of me.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So, moving onward.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Swimming, first principles.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
First principles, this is very important.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I find that the best results in life

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
are often held back by false constructs and untested assumptions.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And the turnaround in swimming came

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
when a friend of mine said, "I will go a year without any stimulants" --
