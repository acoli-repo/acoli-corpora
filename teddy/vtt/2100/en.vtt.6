00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And the turnaround in swimming came

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
when a friend of mine said, "I will go a year without any stimulants" --

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
this is a six-double-espresso-per-day type of guy --

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
"if you can complete a one kilometer open water race."

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So the clock started ticking.

I started seeking out triathletes

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Hand paddles, everything.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Even did lessons with Olympians -- nothing helped.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And then Chris Sacca, who is now a dear friend mine,
