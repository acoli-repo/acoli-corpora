00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
But I said, "Please rape me at eight a.m."

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
(Laughter)

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
You've never seen a more confused Japanese woman.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
(Laughter)

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I walked in to school.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I couldn't read any of it -- hieroglyphics, it could have been --

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
because it was Kanji,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Chinese characters adapted into the Japanese language.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Asked him what this said.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And he goes, "Ahh, okay okay,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
eehto, World History, ehh, Calculus,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Traditional Japanese." And so on.
