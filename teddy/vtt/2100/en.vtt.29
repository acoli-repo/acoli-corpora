00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So then we broke it down.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
This would be an example of one pivot.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
This is a back step pivot.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
There are many different types.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I have hundreds of hours of footage --

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
all categorized, much like George Carlin

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
categorized his comedy.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
So using my arch-nemesis,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Spanish, no less, to learn tango.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
So fear is your friend. Fear is an indicator.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Sometimes it shows you what you shouldn't do.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
More often than not it shows you exactly what you should do.
