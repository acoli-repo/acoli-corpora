This is Tim Ferriss circa 1979 A.D. Age two.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You can tell by the power squat, I was a very confident boy --

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and not without reason.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I had a very charming routine at the time,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which was to wait until late in the evening

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
when my parents were decompressing from a hard day's work,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
doing their crossword puzzles, watching television.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I would run into the living room, jump up on the couch,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
rip the cushions off, throw them on the floor,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
scream at the top of my lungs and run out

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
because I was the Incredible Hulk.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
