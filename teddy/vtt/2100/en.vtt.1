00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
(Laughter)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Obviously, you see the resemblance.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And this routine went on for some time.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
When I was seven I went to summer camp.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
My parents found it necessary for peace of mind.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And at noon each day

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000

I was born premature. I was always very small.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
My left lung had collapsed when I was born.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And I've always had buoyancy problems.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So water was something that scared me to begin with.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But I would go in on occasion.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And on one particular day,
