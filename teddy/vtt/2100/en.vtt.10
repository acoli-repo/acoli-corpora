00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up --

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
very important, especially for people with lower body fat.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Here is an example of the stroke.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So you don't kick. But you do use a small flick.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You can see this is the left extension.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Then you see his left leg.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Small flick, and the only purpose of that

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
is to rotate his hips so he can get to the opposite side.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And the entry point for his right hand -- notice this,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
he's not reaching in front and catching the water.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Rather, he is entering the water

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
at a 45-degree angle with his forearm,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and then propelling himself by streamlining -- very important.
