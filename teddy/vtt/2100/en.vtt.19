00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and at any given time, speak, read and write five or six.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
This brings us to the point,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
which is, it's oftentimes what you do,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
not how you do it, that is the determining factor.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
This is the difference between being effective -- doing the right things --

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and being efficient -- doing things well whether or not they're important.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
You can also do this with grammar.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I came up with these six sentences after much experimentation.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Having a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
by translating these sentences into past, present, future,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
will show you subject, object, verb,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
placement of indirect, direct objects, gender and so forth.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
From that point, you can then, if you want to,
