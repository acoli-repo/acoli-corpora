00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
not swimming, in the case of freestyle,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
on your stomach, as many people think, reaching on top of the water.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
But actually rotating from streamlined right

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
to streamlined left,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So let's look at some examples. This is Terry.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And you can see that he's extending his right arm

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
below his head and far in front.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And so his entire body really is underwater.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
The arm is extended below the head.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
The head is held in line with the spine,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up --
