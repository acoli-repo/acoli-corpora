00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
eehto, World History, ehh, Calculus,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Traditional Japanese." And so on.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And so it came to me in waves.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
There had been something lost in translation.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
The Japanese classes were not Japanese instruction classes, per se.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
They were the normal high school curriculum for Japanese students --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
the other 4,999 students in the school, who were Japanese, besides the American.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And that's pretty much my response.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
(Laughter)

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I tried everything. I went to Kinokuniya.
