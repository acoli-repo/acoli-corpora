00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
so 20 yards -- like a drowning monkey,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
at about 200 beats per minute heart rate --

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I measured it --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
to going to Montauk on Long Island,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
close to where I grew up,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
getting out and feeling better than when I went in.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And I came out,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
in my Speedos, European style,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
feeling like the Incredible Hulk.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And that's what I want everyone in here to feel like,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
the Incredible Hulk, at the end of this presentation.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
More specifically, I want you to feel like you're capable

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
of becoming an excellent long-distance swimmer,
