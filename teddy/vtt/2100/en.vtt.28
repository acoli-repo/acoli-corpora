00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So I think you'll agree, they look quite good together.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Now what I like about this video

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
is it's actually a video of the first time they ever danced together

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
because of his lead. He had a strong lead.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
He didn't lead with his chest, which requires you lean forward.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
I couldn't develop the attributes in my toes,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
the strength in my feet, to do that.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So he uses a lead that focuses on

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
his shoulder girdle and his arm.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
So he can lift the woman to break her, for example.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
That's just one benefit of that.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So then we broke it down.
