00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
placement of indirect, direct objects, gender and so forth.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
From that point, you can then, if you want to,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
acquire multiple languages, alternate them so there is no interference.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
We can talk about that if anyone in interested.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And now I love languages.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
So ballroom dancing, implicit versus explicit --

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
very important.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
You might look at me and say, "That guy must be a ballroom dancer."

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
But no, you'd be wrong

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
because my body is very poorly designed for most things --

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
pretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I used to be much bigger, much more muscular.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And so I ended up walking like this.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I looked a lot like an orangutan, our close cousins, or the Incredible Hulk.
