00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And so I ended up walking like this.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I looked a lot like an orangutan, our close cousins, or the Incredible Hulk.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Not very good for ballroom dancing.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I found myself in Argentina in 2005,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
decided to watch a tango class -- had no intention of participating.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Went in, paid my ten pesos,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
walked up -- 10 women two guys, usually a good ratio.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
The instructor says, "You are participating."

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Immediately: death sweat.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
(Laughter)

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Fight-or-flight fear sweat, because I tried ballroom dancing in college --

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
stepped on the girl's foot with my heel. She screamed.
