00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Then one month later, went to the world championships,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
made it to the semi-final. And then set a world record, following that,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
two weeks later.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
I want you to see part of what I practiced.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
I'm going to jump forward here.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
This is the instructor that Alicia and I chose for the male lead.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
His name is Gabriel Misse.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
One of the most elegant dancers of his generation,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
known for his long steps, and his tempo changes

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and his pivots.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Alicia, in her own right, very famous.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So I think you'll agree, they look quite good together.
