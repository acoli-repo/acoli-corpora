As soon as I focused on this material,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I took off.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
I ended up being able to read Asahi Shinbu, Asahi newspaper,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
about six months later -- so a total of 11 months later --

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and went from Japanese I to Japanese VI.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Ended up doing translation work at age 16 when I returned to the U.S.,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and have continued to apply this material

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Someone who was terrible at languages,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
