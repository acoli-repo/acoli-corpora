You'll have Japanese language classes every day to help you cope.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
It will be an amazing experience." My first overseas experience in fact.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So my parents encouraged me to do it. I left.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I arrived in Tokyo. Amazing.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I couldn't believe I was on the other side of the world.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I met my host family. Things went quite well I think,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
all things considered.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
My first evening, before my first day of school,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I said to my mother, very politely,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
"Please wake me up at eight a.m."

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So, (Japanese)

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
But I didn't say (Japanese). I said, (Japanese). Pretty close.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
But I said, "Please rape me at eight a.m."
