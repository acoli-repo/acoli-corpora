00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Kicking harder doesn't solve the problem

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
of their energy expenditure into forward motion.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
The problem is hydrodynamics.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So what you want to focus on instead

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
is allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
much like a small car behind a big car on the highway.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And you do that by maintaining a horizontal body position.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The only way you can do that

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
is to not swim on top of the water.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
The body is denser than water. 95 percent of it would be,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
at least, submerged naturally.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So you end up, number three,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
not swimming, in the case of freestyle,
