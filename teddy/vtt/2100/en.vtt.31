00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
without the educational opportunities that I had,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
it makes me wonder.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
I've spent the last two years trying to deconstruct

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
the American public school system,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
to either fix it or replace it.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And have done experiments with about 50,000 students thus far --

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
built, I'd say, about a half dozen schools,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
my readers, at this point.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And if any of you are interested in that,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
I would love to speak with you.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
I know nothing. I'm a beginner.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
But I ask a lot of questions, and I would love your advice.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
