00:00:07.086 --> 00:00:10.882
Every morning, Helios harnessed
his winged horses,

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:15.845
unleashed his golden chariot, 
and set out across the sky.

00:00:16.387 --> 00:00:22.477
As the Sun God transformed the rosy dawn 
into the golden blooms of day,

00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:24.562
he thought of those far below.

00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:29.984
Years ago, he fell in love 
with a water nymph named Clymene.
