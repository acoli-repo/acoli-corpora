I study ants, and that's because I like to think about how organizations work.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And in particular, how the simple parts of organizations

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
interact to create the behavior of the whole organization.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So, ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and there are many others. The web is one.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
There are many biological systems like that --

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
brains, cells, developing embryos.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There are about 10,000 species of ants.
