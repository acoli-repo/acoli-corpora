00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:01.282
and then right down at the bottom,
we have the fecal community in brown.

00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:03.299
And we've just over the last few years

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.098
found out that the microbes
in different parts of the body

00:04:06.098 --> 00:04:08.296
are amazingly different from one another.

00:04:08.296 --> 00:04:11.128
So if I look at just one person's microbes

00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:13.242
in the mouth and in the gut,

00:04:13.242 --> 00:04:16.702
it turns out that the difference between
those two microbial communities

00:04:16.702 --> 00:04:18.233
is enormous.

00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:21.398
It's bigger than the difference
between the microbes in this reef

00:04:21.398 --> 00:04:24.131
and the microbes in this prairie.

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:26.662
So this is incredible
when you think about it.

00:04:26.662 --> 00:04:30.028
What it means is that a few feet
of difference in the human body
