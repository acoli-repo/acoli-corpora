00:04:26.662 --> 00:04:30.028
What it means is that a few feet
of difference in the human body

00:04:30.028 --> 00:04:32.722
makes more of a difference
to your microbial ecology

00:04:32.722 --> 00:04:34.967
than hundreds of miles on Earth.

00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:37.987
And this is not to say that two people 
look basically the same

00:04:37.987 --> 00:04:39.839
in the same body habitat, either.

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:41.445
So you probably heard

00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:44.453
that we're pretty much all the same
in terms of our human DNA.

00:04:44.453 --> 00:04:48.542
You're 99.99 percent identical
in terms of your human DNA

00:04:48.542 --> 00:04:50.409
to the person sitting next to you.

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.651
But that's not true of your gut microbes:

00:04:52.651 --> 00:04:55.138
you might only share 10 percent similarity

00:04:55.138 --> 00:04:58.648
with the person sitting next to you
in terms of your gut microbes.

00:04:58.648 --> 00:05:01.444
So that's as different
as the bacteria on this prairie
