00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:32.339
and the reason why is that we have
different microbes on our skin

00:01:32.339 --> 00:01:36.061
that produce different chemicals
that the mosquitos detect.

00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:39.567
Now, microbes are also really important
in the field of medicine.

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:42.032
So, for example, what microbes
you have in your gut

00:01:42.032 --> 00:01:46.494
determine whether particular painkillers
are toxic to your liver.

00:01:46.494 --> 00:01:50.739
They also determine whether or not other
drugs will work for your heart condition.

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:53.426
And, if you're a fruit fly, at least,

00:01:53.426 --> 00:01:56.608
your microbes determine
who you want to have sex with.

00:01:56.608 --> 00:01:58.767
We haven't demonstrated this in humans yet

00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:03.063
but maybe it's just a matter of time
before we find out. (Laughter)
