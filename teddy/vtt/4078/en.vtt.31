00:15:27.563 --> 00:15:30.464
for finding out where we are
in terms of our health,

00:15:30.464 --> 00:15:32.872
but they can actually cure disease.

00:15:32.872 --> 00:15:35.797
This is one of the newest things
we've been able to visualize

00:15:35.797 --> 00:15:38.536
with colleagues 
at the University of Minnesota.

00:15:38.536 --> 00:15:41.153
So here's that map
of the human microbiome again.

00:15:41.153 --> 00:15:42.610
What we're looking at now --

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.980
I'm going to add in the community
of some people with C. diff.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.259
So, this is a terrible form of diarrhea

00:15:48.259 --> 00:15:50.604
where you have to go
up to 20 times a day,

00:15:50.604 --> 00:15:53.715
and these people have failed
antibiotic therapy for two years

00:15:53.715 --> 00:15:56.014
before they're eligible for this trial.

00:15:56.014 --> 00:16:00.427
So what would happen if we transplanted
some of the stool from a healthy donor,
