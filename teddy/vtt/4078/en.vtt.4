00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:03.063
but maybe it's just a matter of time
before we find out. (Laughter)

00:02:03.063 --> 00:02:05.686
So microbes are performing
a huge range of functions.

00:02:05.686 --> 00:02:07.452
They help us digest our food.

00:02:07.452 --> 00:02:09.726
They help educate our immune system.

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:11.676
They help us resist disease,

00:02:11.676 --> 00:02:14.184
and they may even
be affecting our behavior.

00:02:14.184 --> 00:02:18.131
So what would a map of all these
microbial communities look like?

00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:20.407
Well, it wouldn't look exactly like this,

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:23.286
but it's a helpful guide
for understanding biodiversity.

00:02:23.286 --> 00:02:27.210
Different parts of the world
have different landscapes of organisms

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.781
that are immediately characteristic
of one place or another
