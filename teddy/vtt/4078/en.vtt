00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:05.069
We humans have always been very concerned
about the health of our bodies,

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.285
but we haven't always been that good
at figuring out what's important.

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:11.677
Take the ancient Egyptians, for example:

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:15.624
very concerned about the body parts
they thought they'd need in the afterlife,

00:00:15.624 --> 00:00:17.714
but they left some parts out.

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:20.337
This part, for example.

00:00:20.337 --> 00:00:23.334
Although they very carefully 
preserved the stomach, the lungs,

00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:24.499
the liver, and so forth,

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.535
they just mushed up the brain,
drained it out through the nose,

00:00:27.535 --> 00:00:29.259
and threw it away,

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:30.600
which makes sense, really,
