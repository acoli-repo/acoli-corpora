Obesity has a really 
large effect, as it turns out,

00:11:32.113 --> 00:11:34.506
and today, we can tell
whether you're lean or obese

00:11:34.506 --> 00:11:36.385
with 90 percent accuracy

00:11:36.385 --> 00:11:38.497
by looking at the microbes in your gut.

00:11:38.497 --> 00:11:40.786
Now, although that might sound impressive,

00:11:40.786 --> 00:11:44.117
in some ways it's a little bit problematic
as a medical test,

00:11:44.117 --> 00:11:47.114
because you can probably tell
which of these people is obese

00:11:47.114 --> 00:11:49.866
without knowing anything
about their gut microbes,

00:11:49.866 --> 00:11:52.909
but it turns out that even
if we sequence their complete genomes

00:11:52.909 --> 00:11:54.566
and had all their human DNA,

00:11:54.566 --> 00:11:58.932
we could only predict which one
was obese with about 60 percent accuracy.

00:11:58.932 --> 00:12:00.306
So that's amazing, right?
