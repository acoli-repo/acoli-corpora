00:09:58.862 --> 00:10:01.392
a setback of many months 
of normal development,

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:03.644
followed by a relatively rapid recovery,

00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:07.777
and by the time he reaches day 838,

00:10:07.777 --> 00:10:09.496
which is the end of this video,

00:10:09.496 --> 00:10:13.193
you can see that he has essentially
reached the healthy adult stool community,

00:10:13.193 --> 00:10:15.641
despite that antibiotic intervention.

00:10:15.641 --> 00:10:18.969
So this is really interesting
because it raises fundamental questions

00:10:18.969 --> 00:10:23.068
about what happens when we intervene
at different ages in a child's life.

00:10:23.068 --> 00:10:26.679
So does what we do early on, where
the microbiome is changing so rapidly,

00:10:26.679 --> 00:10:27.979
actually matter,

00:10:27.979 --> 00:10:30.462
or is it like throwing a stone
into a stormy sea,
