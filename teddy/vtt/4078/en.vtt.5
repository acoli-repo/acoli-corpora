00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.781
that are immediately characteristic
of one place or another

00:02:31.781 --> 00:02:33.818
or another.

00:02:33.818 --> 00:02:37.683
With microbiology, it's kind of the same,
although I've got to be honest with you:

00:02:37.683 --> 00:02:40.786
All the microbes essentially
look the same under a microscope.

00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:43.315
So instead of trying
to identify them visually,

00:02:43.315 --> 00:02:45.801
what we do is we look
at their DNA sequences,

00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:48.725
and in a project called
the Human Microbiome Project,

00:02:48.725 --> 00:02:52.064
NIH funded this $173 million project

00:02:52.064 --> 00:02:54.473
where hundreds 
of researchers came together

00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:57.252
to map out all the A's, T's, G's, and C's,

00:02:57.252 --> 00:02:59.428
and all of these microbes
in the human body.

00:02:59.428 --> 00:03:02.789
So when we take them together,
they look like this.
