00:07:29.837 --> 00:07:32.287
that we've co-evolved with
might be really important

for a lot of these different conditions
that we now know involve the microbiome.

00:07:36.796 --> 00:07:39.533
When my own daughter was born
a couple of years ago

00:07:39.533 --> 00:07:41.968
by emergency C-section,

00:07:41.968 --> 00:07:43.809
we took matters into our own hands

Now, it's really difficult to tell
whether this has had an effect

00:07:51.913 --> 00:07:53.915
on her health specifically, right?

00:07:53.915 --> 00:07:57.596
With a sample size of just one child,
no matter how much we love her,

00:07:57.596 --> 00:07:59.813
you don't really have
enough of a sample size

00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.759
to figure out what happens on average,
