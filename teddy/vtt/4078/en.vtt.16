00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.759
to figure out what happens on average,

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:04.656
but at two years old,
she hasn't had an ear infection yet,

00:08:04.656 --> 00:08:06.941
so we're keeping our fingers
crossed on that one.

00:08:06.941 --> 00:08:10.398
And what's more, we're starting
to do clinical trials with more children

00:08:10.398 --> 00:08:13.320
to figure out whether
this has a protective effect generally.

00:08:15.031 --> 00:08:20.354
So how we're born has a tremendous effect
on what microbes we have initially,

00:08:20.354 --> 00:08:22.271
but where do we go after that?

00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:24.541
What I'm showing you
again here is this map

00:08:24.541 --> 00:08:26.539
of the Human Microbiome Project Data,

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:29.302
so each point represents
a sample from one body site

00:08:29.302 --> 00:08:31.842
from one of 250 healthy adults.
