00:12:29.418 --> 00:12:32.065
Well, one thing we can do
is we can raise some mice

00:12:32.065 --> 00:12:34.712
without any microbes of their own
in a germ-free bubble.

00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:37.665
Then we can add in some microbes
that we think are important,

00:12:37.665 --> 00:12:39.747
and see what happens.

00:12:39.747 --> 00:12:42.026
When we take the microbes
from an obese mouse

00:12:42.026 --> 00:12:44.530
and transplant them
into a genetically normal mouse

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.389
that's been raised in a bubble
with no microbes of its own,

00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:50.742
it becomes fatter than if it got them 
from a regular mouse.

00:12:52.142 --> 00:12:54.461
Why this happens
is absolutely amazing, though.

00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:56.661
Sometimes what's going on
is that the microbes

00:12:56.661 --> 00:12:59.719
are helping them digest food
more efficiently from the same diet,

00:12:59.719 --> 00:13:01.923
so they're taking more energy
from their food,
