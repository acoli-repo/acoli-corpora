00:11:58.932 --> 00:12:00.306
So that's amazing, right?

00:12:00.306 --> 00:12:04.118
What it means that the three pounds
of microbes that you carry around with you

00:12:04.118 --> 00:12:06.460
may be more important
for some health conditions

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.125
than every single gene in your genome.

00:12:11.555 --> 00:12:13.792
And then in mice, we can do a lot more.

00:12:13.792 --> 00:12:17.437
So in mice, microbes have been linked
to all kinds of additional conditions,

00:12:17.437 --> 00:12:20.153
including things like multiple sclerosis,

00:12:20.153 --> 00:12:23.891
depression, autism, and again, obesity.

00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:26.655
But how can we tell whether
these microbial differences

00:12:26.655 --> 00:12:29.418
that correlate with disease
are cause or effect?

00:12:29.418 --> 00:12:32.065
Well, one thing we can do
is we can raise some mice
