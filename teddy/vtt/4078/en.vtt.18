00:08:56.849 --> 00:09:00.329
and you can see that he's starting off
basically in the vaginal community,

00:09:00.329 --> 00:09:02.355
as we would expect from his delivery mode.

00:09:02.355 --> 00:09:05.069
And what's going to happen
over these two and a half years

00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:07.211
is that he's going to travel 
all the way down

00:09:07.211 --> 00:09:11.025
to resemble the adult fecal community from
healthy volunteers down at the bottom.

00:09:11.025 --> 00:09:14.373
So I'm just going to start this going
and we'll see how that happens.

00:09:14.913 --> 00:09:18.949
What you can see, and remember
each step in this is just one week,

00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:20.815
what you can see is that week to week,

00:09:20.815 --> 00:09:25.498
the change in the microbial community
of the feces of this one child,

00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:28.049
the differences week to week
are much greater

00:09:28.049 --> 00:09:30.580
than the differences between
individual healthy adults
