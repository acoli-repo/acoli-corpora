00:03:28.747 --> 00:03:31.077
See, I told you they basically
all look the same.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:34.966
So what we're looking at is each point
represents one microbial community

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:37.226
from one body site
of one healthy volunteer.

00:03:37.226 --> 00:03:41.022
And so you can see that there's different
parts of the map in different colors,

00:03:41.022 --> 00:03:42.821
almost like separate continents.

00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:44.279
And what it turns out to be

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:46.719
is that those, as the different
regions of the body,

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:48.797
have very different microbes in them.

00:03:48.797 --> 00:03:52.480
So what we have is we have
the oral community up there in green.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.294
Over on the other side,
we have the skin community in blue,

00:03:55.294 --> 00:03:57.581
the vaginal community in purple,

00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:01.282
and then right down at the bottom,
we have the fecal community in brown.
