00:08:29.302 --> 00:08:31.842
from one of 250 healthy adults.

00:08:31.842 --> 00:08:33.909
And you've seen children
develop physically.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.965
You've seen them develop mentally.

00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:38.040
Now, for the first time,
you're going to see

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.398
one of my colleague's children
develop microbially.

00:08:41.398 --> 00:08:42.963
So what we are going to look at

00:08:42.963 --> 00:08:45.650
is we're going to look 
at this one baby's stool,

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.099
the fecal community,
which represents the gut,

00:08:48.099 --> 00:08:51.268
sampled every week
for almost two and a half years.

00:08:51.268 --> 00:08:52.931
And so we're starting on day one.

00:08:52.931 --> 00:08:56.849
What's going to happen is that the infant
is going to start off as this yellow dot,

00:08:56.849 --> 00:09:00.329
and you can see that he's starting off
basically in the vaginal community,
