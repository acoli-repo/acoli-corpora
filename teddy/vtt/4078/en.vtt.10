00:04:58.648 --> 00:05:01.444
So that's as different
as the bacteria on this prairie

00:05:01.444 --> 00:05:03.500
and the bacteria in this forest.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.909
So these different microbes

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:09.076
have all these different kinds 
of functions that I told you about,

00:05:09.076 --> 00:05:10.772
everything from digesting food

00:05:10.772 --> 00:05:13.327
to involvement
in different kinds of diseases,

00:05:13.327 --> 00:05:15.193
metabolizing drugs, and so forth.

00:05:15.193 --> 00:05:17.299
So how do they do all this stuff?

00:05:17.299 --> 00:05:19.195
Well, in part it's because

00:05:19.195 --> 00:05:22.525
although there's just three pounds
of those microbes in our gut,

00:05:22.525 --> 00:05:24.285
they really outnumber us.

00:05:24.285 --> 00:05:26.505
And so how much do they outnumber us?

00:05:26.505 --> 00:05:29.617
Well, it depends on what
you think of as our bodies.

00:05:29.617 --> 00:05:31.102
Is it our cells?
