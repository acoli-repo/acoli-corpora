00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:30.600
which makes sense, really,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.609
because what does a brain
do for us anyway?

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:36.637
But imagine if there were a kind
of neglected organ in our bodies

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:38.773
that weighed just as much as the brain

00:00:38.773 --> 00:00:41.699
and in some ways was just
as important to who we are,

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.251
but we knew so little about
and treated with such disregard.

00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:48.154
And imagine if,
through new scientific advances,

00:00:48.154 --> 00:00:49.895
we were just beginning to understand

00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:52.797
its importance to how
we think of ourselves.

00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:55.003
Wouldn't you want to know more about it?

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:58.229
Well, it turns out that we do
have something just like that:

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:00.641
our gut,
