00:10:27.979 --> 00:10:30.462
or is it like throwing a stone
into a stormy sea,

00:10:30.462 --> 00:10:32.204
where the ripples will just be lost?

00:10:33.044 --> 00:10:37.335
Well, fascinatingly, it turns out
that if you give children antibiotics

00:10:37.335 --> 00:10:38.985
in the first six months of life,

00:10:38.985 --> 00:10:41.770
they're more likely
to become obese later on

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.897
than if they don't get antibiotics then
or only get them later,

00:10:44.897 --> 00:10:47.843
and so what we do early on
may have profound impacts

00:10:47.843 --> 00:10:51.340
on the gut microbial community
and on later health

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.666
that we're only beginning to understand.

00:10:53.666 --> 00:10:57.822
So this is fascinating, because one day,
in addition to the effects

00:10:57.822 --> 00:11:00.468
that antibiotics have
on antibiotic-resistant bacteria,
