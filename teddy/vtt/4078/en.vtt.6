00:02:59.428 --> 00:03:02.789
So when we take them together,
they look like this.

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:06.720
It's a bit more difficult
to tell who lives where now, isn't it?

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.268
What my lab does is develop
computational techniques that allow us

00:03:10.268 --> 00:03:12.879
to take all these terabytes
of sequence data

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.892
and turn them into something
that's a bit more useful as a map,

00:03:15.892 --> 00:03:18.645
and so when we do that
with the human microbiome data

00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:20.740
from 250 healthy volunteers,

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.384
it looks like this.

00:03:23.384 --> 00:03:26.564
Each point here represents
all the complex microbes

00:03:26.564 --> 00:03:28.747
in an entire microbial community.

00:03:28.747 --> 00:03:31.077
See, I told you they basically
all look the same.
