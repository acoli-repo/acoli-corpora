00:05:29.617 --> 00:05:31.102
Is it our cells?

00:05:31.102 --> 00:05:34.515
Well, each of us consists
of about 10 trillion human cells,

00:05:34.515 --> 00:05:37.746
but we harbor as many
as 100 trillion microbial cells.

00:05:37.746 --> 00:05:40.520
So they outnumber us 10 to one.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.431
Now, you might think, well,
we're human because of our DNA,

00:05:44.431 --> 00:05:47.752
but it turns out that each of us has
about 20,000 human genes,

00:05:47.752 --> 00:05:49.708
depending on what you count exactly,

00:05:49.708 --> 00:05:54.200
but as many as two million
to 20 million microbial genes.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.959
So whichever way we look at it,
we're vastly outnumbered

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:59.791
by our microbial symbionts.

00:05:59.791 --> 00:06:03.018
And it turns out that in addition 
to traces of our human DNA,
