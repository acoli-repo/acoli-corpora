00:14:58.724 --> 00:15:01.879
so anyone can have access to the data.

00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:03.050
On the other hand,

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.332
when we do tours of our lab
at the BioFrontiers Institute,

00:15:06.332 --> 00:15:09.892
and we explain that we use robots
and lasers to look at poop,

00:15:09.892 --> 00:15:13.004
it turns out that not
everyone wants to know.

00:15:13.004 --> 00:15:14.286
(Laughter)

00:15:14.286 --> 00:15:16.207
But I'm guessing that many of you do,

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:18.866
and so I brought some kits here
if you're interested

00:15:18.866 --> 00:15:21.596
in trying this out for yourself.

00:15:23.046 --> 00:15:24.993
So why might we want to do this?

00:15:24.993 --> 00:15:27.563
Well, it turns out that microbes
are not just important

00:15:27.563 --> 00:15:30.464
for finding out where we are
in terms of our health,
