00:14:29.177 --> 00:14:31.883
to participate in this discovery.

00:14:31.883 --> 00:14:33.131
So, a couple of years ago,

00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:35.202
we started this project
called American Gut,

00:14:35.202 --> 00:14:39.406
which allows you to claim a place 
for yourself on this microbial map.

00:14:39.406 --> 00:14:42.763
This is now the largest crowd-funded
science project that we know of --

00:14:42.763 --> 00:14:45.651
over 8,000 people
have signed up at this point.

00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:48.229
What happens is,
they send in their samples,

00:14:48.229 --> 00:14:52.014
we sequence the DNA of their microbes
and then release the results back to them.

00:14:52.014 --> 00:14:55.705
We also release them, de-identified,
to scientists, to educators,

00:14:55.705 --> 00:14:58.724
to interested members
of the general public, and so forth,

00:14:58.724 --> 00:15:01.879
so anyone can have access to the data.
