our gut,

00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:03.303
or rather, its microbes.

00:01:03.303 --> 00:01:06.196
But it's not just the microbes
in our gut that are important.

00:01:06.196 --> 00:01:07.704
Microbes all over our body

00:01:07.704 --> 00:01:10.617
turn out to be really critical
to a whole range of differences

00:01:10.617 --> 00:01:13.114
that make different people who we are.

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:15.428
So for example, have you ever noticed

00:01:15.428 --> 00:01:19.611
how some people get bitten by mosquitos
way more often than others?

00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:24.190
It turns out that everyone's anecdotal
experience out camping is actually true.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.999
For example, I seldom
get bitten by mosquitos,

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:29.276
but my partner Amanda
attracts them in droves,

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:32.339
and the reason why is that we have
different microbes on our skin
