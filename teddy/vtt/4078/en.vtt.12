00:05:59.791 --> 00:06:03.018
And it turns out that in addition 
to traces of our human DNA,

00:06:03.018 --> 00:06:05.245
we also leave traces
of our microbial DNA

00:06:05.245 --> 00:06:07.025
on everything we touch.

00:06:07.025 --> 00:06:08.817
We showed in a study a few years ago

00:06:08.817 --> 00:06:11.612
that you can actually match
the palm of someone's hand up

00:06:11.612 --> 00:06:13.889
to the computer mouse
that they use routinely

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.186
with up to 95 percent accuracy.

00:06:16.186 --> 00:06:19.042
So this came out in a scientific journal
a few years ago,

00:06:19.042 --> 00:06:21.595
but more importantly,
it was featured on "CSI: Miami,"

00:06:21.595 --> 00:06:23.382
so you really know it's true.

00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:24.977
(Laughter)

00:06:24.977 --> 00:06:28.374
So where do our microbes
come from in the first place?

00:06:28.374 --> 00:06:31.021
Well if, as I do, you have dogs or kids,
