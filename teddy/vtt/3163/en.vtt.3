00:01:31.317 --> 00:01:34.052
and I wanted to hurt him,

00:01:34.076 --> 00:01:35.291
or at the very least,

00:01:35.315 --> 00:01:37.423
run after him and yell in his face."

00:01:38.952 --> 00:01:41.809
So later, I was left pondering this fury,

00:01:43.408 --> 00:01:48.397
and looking for an explanation as to why,
even in her telling of it,

00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:49.906
I felt fury, too,

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.514
and why this was a word and a feeling
that I was hearing a lot about lately.

00:01:55.792 --> 00:01:57.801
I feel like this is the point in the room

00:01:57.825 --> 00:02:00.705
where all the men are getting
a little bit uncomfortable.
