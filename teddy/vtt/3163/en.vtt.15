00:07:31.028 --> 00:07:32.947
our frustration

00:07:32.971 --> 00:07:34.378
and our rage.

00:07:36.022 --> 00:07:39.265
When someone thinks
they can help themselves to our bodies,

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:42.508
it not only ignites the current fury,

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:45.234
but it lights up the past.

00:07:47.686 --> 00:07:50.209
What seems like a benign moment
at the post office

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.466
is actually an anger grenade.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.251
Well,

00:07:56.907 --> 00:07:58.075
kaboom!
