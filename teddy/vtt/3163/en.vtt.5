00:02:29.744 --> 00:02:32.299
There's a culture of men
helping themselves to women,

00:02:32.323 --> 00:02:33.477
and in this case,

00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:35.645
in a seemingly innocuous way,

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:37.761
where a woman's body is like a saltshaker:

00:02:37.785 --> 00:02:40.151
"Get out of the way
so I can get to the fries" --

00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:41.325
(Laughter)

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.811
to the most egregious,

00:02:44.835 --> 00:02:46.263
violent

00:02:46.287 --> 00:02:48.209
and horrific situations.

00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:52.737
I imagine that some of you
are wondering what the connection is

00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:55.376
between the innocuous and the horrific,

00:02:55.845 --> 00:02:59.560
two things that seem to be
on opposite ends of the spectrum.
