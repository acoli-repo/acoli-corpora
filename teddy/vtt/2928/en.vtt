Someday, we may have robots
as smart as people,

00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:08.463
artificial intelligence, AI.

00:00:08.487 --> 00:00:09.963
How could that happen?

00:00:10.812 --> 00:00:13.996
One route is that we'll just keep
accumulating better software,

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.012
like we've been doing for 70 years.

00:00:16.543 --> 00:00:19.479
At past rates of progress,
that may take centuries.

00:00:20.138 --> 00:00:22.488
Some say it'll happen a lot faster

00:00:22.512 --> 00:00:26.003
as we discover grand new
powerful theories of intelligence.

00:00:26.407 --> 00:00:27.606
I'm skeptical.

00:00:28.608 --> 00:00:31.669
But a third scenario
