00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.852
And ems also have
some more action possibilities.

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.105
For example, your mind just always
runs at the same speed,

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.970
but an em can add more or less
computer hardware to run faster or slower,

00:03:38.994 --> 00:03:42.682
and therefore, if the world around them
seems to be going too fast,

00:03:42.706 --> 00:03:44.325
they can just speed up their mind,

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.699
and the world around them
would seem to slow down.

00:03:46.723 --> 00:03:51.564
In addition, an em can make
a copy of itself at that moment.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.217
This copy would remember
everything the same,

00:03:54.241 --> 00:03:57.557
and if it starts out with the same speed,
looking at the same speed,

00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:00.232
it might even need to be told,
"You are the copy."
