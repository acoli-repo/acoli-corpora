00:09:59.043 --> 00:10:02.330
They make more copies of themselves
when there's more demand for that.

00:10:02.354 --> 00:10:04.451
They don't know which way
the future's going.

00:10:04.475 --> 00:10:05.774
This is an em designer,

00:10:05.798 --> 00:10:07.400
who conceives of a large system

00:10:07.424 --> 00:10:10.909
and then breaks recursively into copies
who elaborate that,

00:10:10.933 --> 00:10:14.345
so ems can implement
larger, more coherent designs.

00:10:14.369 --> 00:10:15.727
This an emulation plumber

00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:18.196
who remembers that every day,
for the last 20 years,

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.001
they only ever worked
two hours a day, a life of leisure.

00:10:21.025 --> 00:10:24.122
But what really happened is,
every day they had a thousand copies,

00:10:24.146 --> 00:10:26.099
each of whom did a two-hour plumbing job,

00:10:26.123 --> 00:10:28.288
and only one of them
went on to the next day.

00:10:28.312 --> 00:10:31.311
Objectively, they're working
well over 99 percent of the time.
