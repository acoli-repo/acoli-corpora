Also, ems need computer hardware,
energy, cooling, or they can't exist.

00:05:01.636 --> 00:05:04.211
For every subjective minute
that an em experiences,

00:05:04.235 --> 00:05:07.509
someone, usually that em,
had to work to pay for it.

00:05:08.136 --> 00:05:09.826
Third, ems are poor.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.000
(Laughter)

00:05:11.715 --> 00:05:14.350
The em population can grow

most of the time.

00:05:20.361 --> 00:05:23.289
So that means
this is what ems usually see:

00:05:23.684 --> 00:05:26.232

00:05:26.256 --> 00:05:27.980
they're working most of the time.

00:05:28.283 --> 00:05:32.252
Now, a subsistence wage scenario,
you might think, is exotic and strange,
