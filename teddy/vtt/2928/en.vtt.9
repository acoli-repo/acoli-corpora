What do ems choose to do?

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:35.382
To understand that, we'll need
to understand three key facts.

00:04:36.096 --> 00:04:42.247
First, ems by definition do what
the human they emulate would do

00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:43.572
in the same situation.

00:04:44.305 --> 00:04:46.948
So their lives and behavior
are very human.

00:04:46.972 --> 00:04:50.269
They're mainly different because
they're living in a different world.

00:04:50.293 --> 00:04:53.591
Second, ems need
real resources to survive.

00:04:53.615 --> 00:04:57.278
You need food and shelter or you'll die.

00:04:57.302 --> 00:05:01.612
Also, ems need computer hardware,
energy, cooling, or they can't exist.
