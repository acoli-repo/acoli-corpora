you can interact with them
if you pay the price.

00:09:31.364 --> 00:09:33.793
But they don't know much,
they can't influence much,

00:09:33.817 --> 00:09:36.515
and they're obsessed with the past,
so what's the point?

00:09:36.539 --> 00:09:37.690
(Laughter)

00:09:37.714 --> 00:09:40.671
Ems also have more variety
in the structure of their lives.

00:09:40.695 --> 00:09:43.377
This is your life: you start
and you end, really simple.

00:09:43.401 --> 00:09:45.014
This is the life of an em,

00:09:45.038 --> 00:09:47.331
who every day splits off
some short-term copies

00:09:47.355 --> 00:09:49.313
to do short-term tasks and then end.

00:09:49.337 --> 00:09:53.464
We'll talk more about
those short term versions in a moment,

00:09:53.488 --> 00:09:55.098
but they are much more efficient

00:09:55.122 --> 00:09:57.487
because they don't have to rest
for the next day.

00:09:57.511 --> 00:09:59.019
This em is more opportunistic.

00:09:59.043 --> 00:10:02.330
They make more copies of themselves
when there's more demand for that.
