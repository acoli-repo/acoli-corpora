00:05:56.776 --> 00:06:00.400
So we've been talking about the em world
from the point of view of the ems --

00:06:00.424 --> 00:06:02.939
now, let's step back
and look at their whole world.

00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:06.043
First, the em world grows
much faster than ours,

00:06:06.067 --> 00:06:08.531
roughly a hundred times faster.

00:06:08.555 --> 00:06:11.718
So the amount of change
we would experience in a century or two,

00:06:11.742 --> 00:06:13.600
they would experience in a year or two.

00:06:13.624 --> 00:06:16.662
And I'm not really willing to project
this age much beyond that,

00:06:16.686 --> 00:06:20.123
because plausibly by then something else
will happen, I don't know what.

00:06:20.147 --> 00:06:22.505
Second, the typical emulation
runs even faster,

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:24.718
roughly a thousand times human speed.

00:06:25.316 --> 00:06:30.656
So for them, they experience
thousands of years in this year or two,
