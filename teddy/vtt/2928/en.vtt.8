00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:00.232
it might even need to be told,
"You are the copy."

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:02.352
And em could make archive copies,

00:04:02.376 --> 00:04:04.200
and with enough archives,

00:04:04.224 --> 00:04:06.296
an em can be immortal --

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.510
in principle, though not
usually in practice.

00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:12.943
And an em can move its brain,
the computer that represents its brain,

00:04:12.967 --> 00:04:15.054
from one physical location to another.

00:04:16.037 --> 00:04:19.355
Ems can actually move around the world
at the speed of light,

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:20.911
and by moving to a new location,

00:04:20.935 --> 00:04:24.199
they can interact more quickly
with ems near that new location.

00:04:24.223 --> 00:04:28.500
So far, I've been talking about
what ems can do.

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:31.127
What do ems choose to do?
