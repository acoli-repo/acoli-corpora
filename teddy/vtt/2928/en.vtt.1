00:00:28.608 --> 00:00:31.669
But a third scenario

00:00:31.693 --> 00:00:33.520
is what I'm going to talk about today.

00:00:33.544 --> 00:00:36.282
The idea is to port the software
from the human brain.

00:00:36.972 --> 00:00:40.273
To do this, we're going to need
three technologies to be good enough,

00:00:40.297 --> 00:00:41.852
and none of them are there yet.

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:47.131
First, we're going to need
lots of cheap, fast, parallel computers.

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:53.062
Second, we're going to need
to scan individual human brains

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.324
in fine spatial and chemical detail,

00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:59.376
to see exactly what cells are where,
connected to what, of what type.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.756
And third, we're going to need
computer models
