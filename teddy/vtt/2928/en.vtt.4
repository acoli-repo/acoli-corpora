00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.344
I became obsessed with this question.

00:02:03.993 --> 00:02:06.946
I spent four years trying to analyze it,

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.517
using standard academic tools,
to guess what would happen,

00:02:10.541 --> 00:02:12.390
and I'm here to tell you what I found.

00:02:12.928 --> 00:02:14.310
But be warned --

00:02:14.722 --> 00:02:18.129
I'm not offering inspiration,
I'm offering analysis.

00:02:18.153 --> 00:02:20.947
I see my job as telling you
what's most likely to happen

00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:22.748
if we did the least to avoid it.

00:02:24.132 --> 00:02:27.434
If you aren't at least a bit disturbed
by something I tell you here,

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:29.052
you're just not paying attention.

00:02:29.076 --> 00:02:30.427
