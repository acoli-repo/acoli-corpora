00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.756
And third, we're going to need
computer models

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.002
of how each kind of brain cell works --

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:09.582
taking input signals,
changing interval state

00:01:09.606 --> 00:01:10.900
and sending output signals.

00:01:10.924 --> 00:01:14.742
If we have good enough models
of all the kinds of brain cells

00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.529
and a good enough model of the brain,

00:01:16.553 --> 00:01:19.987
we can put it together to make
a good enough model of an entire brain,

00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:24.014
and that model would have the same
input-output behavior as the original.

00:01:24.038 --> 00:01:26.523
So if you talk to it, it might talk back.

00:01:26.547 --> 00:01:28.644
If you ask it to do things,
it might do them.

00:01:28.668 --> 00:01:31.490
And if we could do that,
everything would change.
