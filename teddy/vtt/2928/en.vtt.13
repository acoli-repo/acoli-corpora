00:06:25.316 --> 00:06:30.656
So for them, they experience
thousands of years in this year or two,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.872
and for them, the world around them
is actually changing more slowly

00:06:33.896 --> 00:06:35.838
than your world seems to change for you.

00:06:36.277 --> 00:06:40.761
Third, ems are crammed together
in a small number of very dense cities.

00:06:40.785 --> 00:06:44.251
This is not only how they see
themselves in virtual reality,

00:06:44.275 --> 00:06:47.171
it's also how they actually are
physically crammed together.

00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:51.360
So at em speeds, physical travel
feels really painfully slow,

00:06:51.384 --> 00:06:53.706
so most em cities are self-sufficient,

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.480
most war is cyber war,

00:06:55.504 --> 00:06:58.195
and most of the rest of the earth
away from the em cities

00:06:58.219 --> 00:07:01.893
is left to the humans, because the ems
really aren't that interested in it.
