00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:01.561
move to a new virtual world,

00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:02.885
check your bank account.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.617
Now, while this is what
you would look like in virtual reality,

00:03:07.641 --> 00:03:10.769
this is what an em
would look like in virtual reality.

00:03:10.793 --> 00:03:13.549
It's computer hardware
sitting in a server rack somewhere.

00:03:13.573 --> 00:03:16.731
But still, it could see
and experience the same thing.

00:03:17.282 --> 00:03:19.112
But some things are different for ems.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.476
First, while you'll probably always notice
that virtual reality isn't entirely real,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.754
to an em, it can feel as real to them
as this room feels to you now

00:03:27.778 --> 00:03:29.416
or as anything ever feels.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.852
And ems also have
some more action possibilities.
