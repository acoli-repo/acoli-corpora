00:10:57.591 --> 00:11:00.020
This is an em who splits off
a short-term copy

00:11:00.044 --> 00:11:01.908
to do a short-term task and then end.

00:11:01.932 --> 00:11:04.138
They have the same two
attitude possibilities.

00:11:04.162 --> 00:11:07.841
They can say, "I'm a new short-term
creature with a short life. I hate this."

00:11:07.865 --> 00:11:10.999
Or "I'm a part of a larger creature
who won't remember this part."

00:11:11.023 --> 00:11:13.141
I predict they'll have
that second attitude,

00:11:13.165 --> 00:11:16.841
not because it's philosophically correct,
but because it helps them get along.

00:11:16.865 --> 00:11:19.193
Today, if the president says
we must invade Iraq,

00:11:19.217 --> 00:11:20.368
and you say, "Why?"

00:11:20.392 --> 00:11:21.774
and they say, "State secret,"

00:11:21.798 --> 00:11:23.648
you're not sure if you can trust them,

00:11:23.672 --> 00:11:27.288
but for ems, a copy of the president
and a copy of you can go inside a safe,

00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:28.966
explain all their secret reasons,

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.521
and then one bit comes out
from your copy to yourself,
