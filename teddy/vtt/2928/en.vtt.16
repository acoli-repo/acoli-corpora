00:07:57.664 --> 00:08:02.390
so plausibly, ems may well let humans
retire in peace during the age of em.

00:08:02.414 --> 00:08:05.463
You should worry more that
the age of em only lasts a year or two

00:08:05.487 --> 00:08:07.315
and you don't know what happens next.

00:08:09.207 --> 00:08:11.573
Ems are very much like humans,

00:08:11.597 --> 00:08:13.906
but they are not like the typical human.

00:08:14.438 --> 00:08:20.421
The typical em is a copy
of the few hundred most productive humans.

00:08:21.329 --> 00:08:24.909
So in fact, they are as elite,
compared to the typical human,

00:08:24.933 --> 00:08:27.195
as the typical billionaire,
Nobel Prize winner,

00:08:27.219 --> 00:08:29.568
Olympic gold medalist, head of state.
