00:00:06.704 --> 00:00:10.538
The ravenous swarm stretches
as far as the eye can see.

00:00:10.663 --> 00:00:13.954
It has no commanding general
or strategic plan;

00:00:13.954 --> 00:00:17.829
its only goals are to eat, breed, 
and move on—

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:24.038
a relentless advance that transforms 
pastures and farms into barren wastelands.

00:00:25.163 --> 00:00:29.538
These are desert locusts— 
infamous among their locust cousins

00:00:29.538 --> 00:00:32.912
for their massive swarms 
and capacity for destruction.
