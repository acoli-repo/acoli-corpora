00:00:02.023 --> 00:00:04.642
It's wonderful to be back.

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.368
I love this wonderful gathering.

00:00:07.392 --> 00:00:09.589
And you must be wondering, "What on earth?

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:11.265
Have they put up the wrong slide?"

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.447
No, no.

00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:17.638
Look at this magnificent beast,

00:00:17.662 --> 00:00:21.166
and ask the question: Who designed it?

00:00:23.152 --> 00:00:27.062
This is TED; this is
Technology, Entertainment, Design,

00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:28.825
and there's a dairy cow.

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.210
It's a quite wonderfully designed animal.
