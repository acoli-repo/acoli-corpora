00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.411
I started looking for a way

00:06:00.435 --> 00:06:05.140
to think about how I can do
a more democratic form of portraiture,

00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:09.395
something that's more about
my country and how it works.

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.220
Every 10 years, we make a census
in the United States.

00:06:13.244 --> 00:06:14.702
We literally count people,

00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:18.450
find out who lives where,
what kind of jobs we've got,

00:06:18.474 --> 00:06:19.951
the language we speak at home.

00:06:19.975 --> 00:06:22.546
And this is important stuff --
really important stuff.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.803
But it doesn't really tell us who we are.

00:06:24.827 --> 00:06:27.498
It doesn't tell us about our dreams
and our aspirations.

00:06:27.522 --> 00:06:30.912
And so in 2010, I decided
to make my own census.
