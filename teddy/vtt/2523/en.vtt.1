00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:32.634
that art made with data is a new thing,

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:34.800
it's a product of our age,

00:00:34.824 --> 00:00:36.711

And it's called music.

00:00:53.632 --> 00:00:57.504
We've been making music
for tens of thousands of years, right?

00:00:57.528 --> 00:00:59.488
And if you think about what music is --

00:00:59.512 --> 00:01:02.336
