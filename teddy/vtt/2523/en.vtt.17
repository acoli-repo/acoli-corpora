They play in a band and they smoke.

00:08:31.604 --> 00:08:33.588
And right above that you can see "email."

00:08:33.612 --> 00:08:34.918
That's Redmond, Washington,

00:08:34.942 --> 00:08:37.537
which is the headquarters
of the Microsoft Corporation.

00:08:37.561 --> 00:08:40.385
Some of these you can guess --

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.027
and San Francisco is "gay."

00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:44.043

People in Baltimore, Maryland,
will say they're afraid.

00:08:54.713 --> 00:08:56.250
This is New Jersey.

00:08:56.274 --> 00:08:58.963
I grew up somewhere
between "annoying" and "cynical."

00:08:58.987 --> 00:09:03.226
