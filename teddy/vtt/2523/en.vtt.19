And this is gentrified North Brooklyn,

00:09:30.828 --> 00:09:34.024
so you've got "DJ" and "glamorous"
and "hipsters" and "urbane."

00:09:34.048 --> 00:09:36.470
So that's maybe
a more democratic portrait.

00:09:36.494 --> 00:09:39.563
And the idea was, what if we made
red-state and blue-state maps

00:09:39.587 --> 00:09:41.756
based on what we want to do
on a Friday night?

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.287
This is a self-portrait.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.027
This is based on my email,

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:48.020
about 500,000 emails sent over 20 years.

00:09:48.044 --> 00:09:50.997
You can think of this
as a quantified selfie.

00:09:51.021 --> 00:09:54.115
So what I'm doing is running
a physics equation

00:09:54.139 --> 00:09:55.537
based on my personal data.

00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:58.304
You have to imagine everybody
I've ever corresponded with.

00:09:58.328 --> 00:10:01.727
It started out in the middle
and it exploded with a big bang.
