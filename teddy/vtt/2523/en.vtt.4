00:01:59.178 --> 00:02:01.539
you speed it up to one minute each

00:02:01.563 --> 00:02:03.144
and string them all together.

00:02:03.168 --> 00:02:07.079
And so in 75 minutes, I can show you
the history of Hollywood cinema.

00:02:07.592 --> 00:02:10.571
And what it really shows you
is the history of editing

00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:11.776
in Hollywood cinema.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.948
So on the left, we've got Casablanca;
on the right, we've got Chicago.

00:02:15.972 --> 00:02:18.896
And you can see that Casablanca
is a little easier to read.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.252
That's because the average length
of a cinematic shot in the 1940s

00:02:22.276 --> 00:02:23.915
was 26 seconds,

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:25.967
and now it's around six seconds.

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:28.743
This is a project that was inspired

00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:31.711
by some work that was funded
by the US Federal Government
