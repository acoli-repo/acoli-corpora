00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:31.711
by some work that was funded
by the US Federal Government

00:02:31.735 --> 00:02:32.904
in the early 2000s,

00:02:32.928 --> 00:02:38.756
to look at video footage and find
a specific actor in any video.

00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:44.281
And so I repurposed this code
to train a system on one person

00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:48.152
in our culture who would never need
to be surveilled in that manner,

00:02:48.176 --> 00:02:49.703
which is Britney Spears.

00:02:49.727 --> 00:02:53.219
I downloaded 2,000 paparazzi
photos of Britney Spears

00:02:53.243 --> 00:02:55.719
and trained my computer to find her face

00:02:55.743 --> 00:02:57.124
and her face alone.

00:02:57.148 --> 00:03:01.424
I can run any footage of her through it
and will center her eyes in the frame,
