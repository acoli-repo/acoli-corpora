00:00:00.884 --> 00:00:02.632
So I'm an artist,

00:00:02.656 --> 00:00:04.362
but a little bit of a peculiar one.

00:00:04.386 --> 00:00:05.869
I don't paint.

00:00:06.434 --> 00:00:07.718
I can't draw.

00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:11.253
My shop teacher in high school
wrote that I was a menace

00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:13.443
on my report card.

00:00:13.953 --> 00:00:17.552
You probably don't really
want to see my photographs.

00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:19.956
But there is one thing I know how to do:

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.639
I know how to program a computer.

00:00:21.663 --> 00:00:22.875
I can code.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:26.172
And people will tell me
that 100 years ago,

00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:27.546
folks like me didn't exist,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.660
that it was impossible,

00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:32.634
that art made with data is a new thing,
