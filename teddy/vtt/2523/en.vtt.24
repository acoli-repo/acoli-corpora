Every civilization,

00:12:00.183 --> 00:12:03.108
will use the maximum level
of technology available to make art.

00:12:03.132 --> 00:12:05.940
And it's the responsibility
of the artist to ask questions

00:12:05.964 --> 00:12:07.595
about what that technology means

00:12:07.619 --> 00:12:09.638
and how it reflects our culture.

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:12.148
So I leave you with this:
we're more than numbers.

00:12:12.172 --> 00:12:14.173
We're people, and we have
dreams and ideas.

00:12:14.197 --> 00:12:16.996
And reducing us to statistics
is something that's done

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.271
at our peril.

00:12:18.295 --> 00:12:19.473
Thank you very much.

00:12:19.497 --> 00:12:30.283
