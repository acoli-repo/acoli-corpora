So what you're seeing on the screen
is literally being drawn

00:01:32.295 --> 00:01:35.237
by the musical structure
of the musicians onstage,

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.793
and there's no accident
that it looks like a plant,

00:01:37.817 --> 00:01:41.156
because the underlying
algorithmic biology of the plant

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.491
is what informed the musical structure
in the first place.

00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:47.919
So once you know how to do this,
once you know how to code with media,

00:01:47.943 --> 00:01:50.031
you can do some pretty cool stuff.

00:01:50.055 --> 00:01:53.532
This is a project I did
for the Sundance Film Festival.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:57.909
Really simple idea: you take
every Academy Award Best Picture,

00:01:59.178 --> 00:02:01.539
you speed it up to one minute each
