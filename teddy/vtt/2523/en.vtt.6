I can run any footage of her through it
and will center her eyes in the frame,

00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:03.624
and this sort of is a little
double commentary

00:03:03.648 --> 00:03:05.672
about surveillance in our society.

00:03:05.696 --> 00:03:08.688
We are very fraught with anxiety
about being watched,

00:03:08.712 --> 00:03:11.311
but then we obsess over celebrity.

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.949
What you're seeing on the screen here
is a collaboration I did

00:03:15.973 --> 00:03:18.529
with an artist named Lián Amaris.

00:03:18.553 --> 00:03:22.427
What she did is very simple
to explain and describe,

00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:23.683
but very hard to do.

00:03:23.707 --> 00:03:26.558
She took 72 minutes of activity,

00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:29.781
getting ready for a night out on the town,

00:03:29.805 --> 00:03:31.894
and stretched it over three days
