00:07:59.851 --> 00:08:02.701
This will be your one takeaway
from this whole conference.

00:08:02.725 --> 00:08:05.465
You're going to remember
that fact for, like, 30 years.

00:08:05.489 --> 00:08:08.321
(Laughter)

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.078
When you bring this down
to a cartographic level,

00:08:11.102 --> 00:08:14.556
you can make maps and do the same trick
I was doing with the eye charts.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.397
You can replace the name
of every city in the United States

00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:20.413
with the word people use more
in that city than anywhere else.

00:08:20.437 --> 00:08:23.666
If you've ever dated anyone
from Seattle, this makes perfect sense.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.392
You've got "pretty."
You've got "heartbreak."

00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:28.831
You've got "gig." You've got "cigarette."

00:08:28.855 --> 00:08:30.881
They play in a band and they smoke.
