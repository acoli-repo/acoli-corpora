00:06:57.518 --> 00:07:00.750
about 20 percent of the adult population
of the United States.

00:07:01.241 --> 00:07:03.060
I have obsessive-compulsive disorder.

00:07:03.084 --> 00:07:06.185
This is going to become
really freaking obvious. Just go with me.

00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:07.351
(Laughter)

00:07:07.375 --> 00:07:10.414
So what I did was I sorted
all this stuff by zip code.

00:07:11.922 --> 00:07:13.413
And I looked at word analysis.

00:07:13.437 --> 00:07:16.110
These are some dating profiles from 2010

00:07:16.134 --> 00:07:18.229
with the word "lonely" highlighted.

00:07:18.253 --> 00:07:21.234
If you look at these things
topographically,

00:07:21.258 --> 00:07:24.758
if you imagine dark colors to light colors
are more use of the word,

00:07:24.782 --> 00:07:29.083
you can see that Appalachia
is a pretty lonely place.

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:34.926
You can also see
that Nebraska ain't that funny.
