00:06:27.522 --> 00:06:30.912
And so in 2010, I decided
to make my own census.

00:06:30.936 --> 00:06:34.256
And I started looking for a corpus of data

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.392
that had a lot of descriptions
written by ordinary Americans.

00:06:37.416 --> 00:06:38.567
And it turns out

00:06:38.591 --> 00:06:40.333
that there is such a corpus of data

00:06:40.357 --> 00:06:42.341
that's just sitting there for the taking.

00:06:42.365 --> 00:06:43.691
It's called online dating.

00:06:44.574 --> 00:06:49.520
So in 2010, I joined 21 different
online dating services,

00:06:49.544 --> 00:06:52.644
as a gay man, a straight man,
a gay woman and a straight woman,

00:06:52.668 --> 00:06:54.285
in every zip code in America

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:57.494
and downloaded about
19 million people's dating profiles --

00:06:57.518 --> 00:07:00.750
about 20 percent of the adult population
of the United States.
