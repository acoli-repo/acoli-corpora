notes and chords and keys
and harmonies and melodies --

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.766
these things are algorithms.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.617
These things are systems

00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:08.025
that are designed to unfold over time,

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.506
to make us feel.

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:11.807
I came to the arts through music.

00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:13.219
I was trained as a composer,

00:01:13.243 --> 00:01:16.525
and about 15 years ago,
I started making pieces

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.084
that were designed to look
at the intersection

00:01:19.108 --> 00:01:21.012
between sound and image,

00:01:21.036 --> 00:01:23.868
to use an image to unveil
a musical structure

00:01:23.892 --> 00:01:26.756
or to use a sound to show you
something interesting

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.780
about something that's usually pictorial.

00:01:28.804 --> 00:01:32.271
So what you're seeing on the screen
is literally being drawn
