00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:31.802
that was used in a shooting
in the French Quarter of New Orleans

00:10:31.826 --> 00:10:35.135
about two years ago on Valentine's Day
in an argument over parking.

00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:36.374
Those are my cigarettes.

00:10:36.398 --> 00:10:38.673
This is the house
where the shooting took place.

00:10:38.697 --> 00:10:41.071
This project involved
a little bit of engineering.

00:10:41.095 --> 00:10:43.310
I've got a bike chain
rigged up as a cam shaft,

00:10:43.334 --> 00:10:44.650
with a computer driving it.

00:10:44.674 --> 00:10:47.440
That computer and the mechanism
are buried in a box.

00:10:47.464 --> 00:10:49.678
The gun's on top welded to a steel plate.

00:10:49.702 --> 00:10:52.047
There's a wire going
through to the trigger,

00:10:52.071 --> 00:10:54.262
and the computer in the box is online.

00:10:54.286 --> 00:10:57.519
It's listening to the 911 feed
of the New Orleans Police Department,

00:10:57.543 --> 00:11:00.420
so that anytime there's a shooting
reported in New Orleans,
