00:03:29.805 --> 00:03:31.894
and stretched it over three days

00:03:31.918 --> 00:03:35.506
and performed it on a traffic island
in slow motion in New York City.

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.168
I was there, too, with a film crew.

00:03:38.192 --> 00:03:39.444
We filmed the whole thing,

00:03:39.468 --> 00:03:42.869
and then we reversed the process,
speeding it up to 72 minutes again,

00:03:42.893 --> 00:03:44.787
so it looks like she's moving normally

00:03:44.811 --> 00:03:46.643
and the whole world is flying by.

00:03:47.091 --> 00:03:49.667
At a certain point, I figured out

00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:52.358
that what I was doing
was making portraits.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.062
When you think about portraiture,
you tend to think about stuff like this.

00:03:57.086 --> 00:03:59.149
The guy on the left
is named Gilbert Stuart.

00:03:59.173 --> 00:04:02.237
He's sort of the first real portraitist
of the United States.
