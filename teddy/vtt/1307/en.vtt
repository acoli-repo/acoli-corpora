00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is Shivdutt Yadav,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and he's from Uttar Pradesh, India.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now Shivdutt was visiting the local land registry office

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
in Uttar Pradesh,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and he discovered

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that official records were listing him as dead.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
His land was no longer registered

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
in his name.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
His brothers, Chandrabhan and Phoolchand,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
were also listed as dead.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Family members had bribed officials

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to interrupt the hereditary transfer of land

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
by having the brothers declared dead,
