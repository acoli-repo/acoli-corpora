WEBVTT

00:09:29.992 --> 00:09:33.503
which somehow are better
connected than the others,

00:09:33.527 --> 00:09:35.800
more pointed at than the others.

00:09:35.824 --> 00:09:37.546
And here we see clearly

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.602
which are the web pages
we want to first try.

00:09:41.507 --> 00:09:42.658
Once again,

00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:45.142
the solution emerges from the randomness.

00:09:45.775 --> 00:09:48.026
Of course, since that time,

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.757
Google has come up with much more
sophisticated algorithms,

00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:54.061
but already this was beautiful.

00:09:54.981 --> 00:09:56.457
And still,

00:09:56.481 --> 00:09:58.092
just one problem in a million.

00:09:58.734 --> 00:10:01.004
With the advent of digital area,
