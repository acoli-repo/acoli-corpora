00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.446
and the Gauss Curve

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.398
to explain and prove that our
world is made of atoms.

00:05:07.524 --> 00:05:09.326
It was not the first time

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.740
that mathematics was revolutionizing
our view of the world.

00:05:13.555 --> 00:05:15.767
More than 2,000 years ago,

00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:18.401
at the time of the ancient Greeks,

00:05:19.502 --> 00:05:20.981
it already occurred.

00:05:21.827 --> 00:05:23.113
In those days,

00:05:23.137 --> 00:05:26.420
only a small fraction of the world
had been explored,

00:05:26.444 --> 00:05:29.486
and the Earth might have seemed infinite.
