00:07:28.136 --> 00:07:32.356
suppose that there is person number seven,

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.531
tells you a story,

00:07:33.555 --> 00:07:35.569
but when you ask where he got if from,

00:07:35.593 --> 00:07:38.629
he points to person
number three as a source.

00:07:38.653 --> 00:07:40.721
And maybe person number three, in turn,

00:07:40.745 --> 00:07:44.441
points at person number one
as the primary source.

00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:46.126
Now number one is a prime witness,

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.388
so I definitely want
to interview him -- priority.

00:07:50.148 --> 00:07:51.299
And from the graph

00:07:51.323 --> 00:07:54.551
we also see that person
number four is a prime witness.

00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:57.018
And maybe I even want
to interview him first,

00:07:57.042 --> 00:07:59.401
because there are more
people who refer to him.
