00:05:58.774 --> 00:06:01.080
Newton rightly deduced

00:06:01.104 --> 00:06:06.645
that the Earth is a wee bit
flattened at the poles,

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.270
like 0.3 percent --

00:06:08.843 --> 00:06:13.256
so tiny that you wouldn't even
notice it on the real view of the Earth.

00:06:14.276 --> 00:06:18.204
These stories show that mathematics

00:06:18.228 --> 00:06:22.990
is able to make us go out of our intuition

00:06:23.512 --> 00:06:26.997
measure the Earth which seems infinite,

00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:29.315
see atoms which are invisible

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:32.720
or detect an imperceptible
variation of shape.
