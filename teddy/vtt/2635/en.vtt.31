00:15:30.494 --> 00:15:35.268
And I've been working with my staff
at Institut Henri Poincaré,

00:15:35.292 --> 00:15:40.473
together with partners and artists
of mathematical communication worldwide,

00:15:40.497 --> 00:15:45.084
so that we can found our own,
very special museum of mathematics there.

00:15:46.537 --> 00:15:48.314
So in a few years,

00:15:48.885 --> 00:15:50.462
when you come to Paris,

00:15:50.486 --> 00:15:56.144
after tasting the great, crispy
baguette and macaroon,

00:15:56.168 --> 00:15:59.831
please come and visit us
at Institut Henri Poincaré,

00:15:59.856 --> 00:16:02.371
and share the mathematical dream with us.
