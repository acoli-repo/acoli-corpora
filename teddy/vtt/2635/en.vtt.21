00:10:29.646 --> 00:10:32.714
That's because of the applications:

00:10:32.738 --> 00:10:34.877
communication theory,

00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:36.721
information theory,

00:10:36.745 --> 00:10:38.005
game theory,

00:10:38.029 --> 00:10:39.475
compressed sensing,

00:10:39.499 --> 00:10:41.061
machine learning,

00:10:41.085 --> 00:10:42.652
graph analysis,

00:10:42.676 --> 00:10:44.418
harmonic analysis.

00:10:44.442 --> 00:10:47.082
And why not stochastic processes,

00:10:47.106 --> 00:10:48.736
linear programming,

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.788
or fluid simulation?

00:10:51.292 --> 00:10:55.187
Each of these fields have
monster industrial applications.

00:10:55.211 --> 00:10:56.362
And through them,

00:10:56.386 --> 00:10:58.385
there is big money in mathematics.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.440
And let me concede
