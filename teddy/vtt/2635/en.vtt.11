But clever Eratosthenes,

00:05:31.825 --> 00:05:33.242
using mathematics,

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:38.377
was able to measure the Earth
with an amazing accuracy of two percent.

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:41.385
Here's another example.

00:05:42.238 --> 00:05:46.043
In 1673, Jean Richer noticed

00:05:46.067 --> 00:05:52.979
that a pendulum swings slightly
slower in Cayenne than in Paris.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.750
From this observation alone,
and clever mathematics,

00:05:58.774 --> 00:06:01.080
Newton rightly deduced
