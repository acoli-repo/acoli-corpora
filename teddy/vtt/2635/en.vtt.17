WEBVTT

00:08:30.015 --> 00:08:32.551
one of the early cornerstones of Google.

00:08:33.337 --> 00:08:37.579
This algorithm uses the laws
of mathematical randomness

00:08:37.603 --> 00:08:41.460
to determine automatically
the most relevant web pages,

00:08:41.484 --> 00:08:46.546
in the same way as we used randomness
in the Galton Board experiment.

00:08:47.341 --> 00:08:49.682
So let's send into this graph

00:08:49.706 --> 00:08:52.556
a bunch of tiny, digital marbles

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.329
and let them go randomly
through the graph.

00:08:56.353 --> 00:08:58.020
Each time they arrive at some site,

00:08:58.044 --> 00:09:02.210
they will go out through some link
chosen at random to the next one.
