00:13:57.574 --> 00:14:00.931
"Ah, it's time to get
the kids to school --"

00:14:00.955 --> 00:14:02.106
What is this?

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.272
There was this voice in my head, I swear.

00:14:04.894 --> 00:14:06.807
"Take the second term to the other side,

00:14:06.831 --> 00:14:08.750
Fourier transform and invert in L2."

00:14:09.257 --> 00:14:10.408
(Laughter)

00:14:10.432 --> 00:14:12.134
Damn it,

00:14:12.158 --> 00:14:14.271
that was the start of the solution!

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:16.670
You see,

00:14:16.694 --> 00:14:18.977
I thought I had taken some rest,

00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:22.389
but really my brain had
continued to work on it.

00:14:23.008 --> 00:14:24.605
In those moments,

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:27.230
you don't think of your career
or your colleagues,

00:14:27.254 --> 00:14:30.944
it's just a complete battle
between the problem and you.
