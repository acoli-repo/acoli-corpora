00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.160
that the life a mathematical
researcher is an easy one.

00:11:30.959 --> 00:11:33.700
It is filled with perplexity,

00:11:34.347 --> 00:11:35.497
frustration,

00:11:36.172 --> 00:11:38.617
a desperate fight for understanding.

00:11:39.955 --> 00:11:42.095
Let me evoke for you

00:11:42.119 --> 00:11:46.499
one of the most striking days
in my mathematician's life.

00:11:46.523 --> 00:11:47.674
Or should I say,

00:11:47.698 --> 00:11:49.435
one of the most striking nights.

00:11:50.713 --> 00:11:51.864
At that time,

00:11:51.888 --> 00:11:55.039
I was staying at the Institute
for Advanced Studies in Princeton --

00:11:55.063 --> 00:11:57.202
for many years, the home
of Albert Einstein

00:11:57.226 --> 00:12:01.654
and arguably the most holy place
for mathematical research in the world.
