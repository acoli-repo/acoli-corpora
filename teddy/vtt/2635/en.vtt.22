00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.440
And let me concede

00:11:01.464 --> 00:11:03.941
that when it comes to making
money from the math,

00:11:03.965 --> 00:11:07.789
the Americans are by a long shot
the world champions,

00:11:07.813 --> 00:11:12.432
with clever, emblematic billionaires
and amazing, giant companies,

00:11:12.456 --> 00:11:15.736
all resting, ultimately,
on good algorithm.

00:11:17.091 --> 00:11:21.063
Now with all this beauty,
usefulness and wealth,

00:11:21.087 --> 00:11:23.371
mathematics does look more sexy.

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:26.016
But don't you think

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.160
that the life a mathematical
researcher is an easy one.
