00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:03.185
And together with my former student
and main collaborator Clément Mouhot,

00:13:03.209 --> 00:13:04.701
in Paris at the time,

00:13:04.725 --> 00:13:08.811
we had been working for months
and months on such a proof.

00:13:09.832 --> 00:13:11.167
Actually,

00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:15.937
I had already announced by mistake
that we could solve it.

00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:17.686
But the truth is,

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:19.857
the proof was just not working.

00:13:20.196 --> 00:13:24.545
In spite of more than 100 pages
of complicated, mathematical arguments,

00:13:24.569 --> 00:13:26.259
and a bunch discoveries,

00:13:26.283 --> 00:13:27.550
and huge calculation,

00:13:27.574 --> 00:13:28.743
it was not working.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:30.971
And that night in Princeton,
