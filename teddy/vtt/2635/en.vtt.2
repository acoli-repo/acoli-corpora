Mathematics may be abstract,

00:01:00.654 --> 00:01:01.805
but it's not dull

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.558
and it's not about computing.

00:01:04.178 --> 00:01:05.925
It is about reasoning

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:08.209
and proving our core activity.

00:01:08.513 --> 00:01:10.035
It is about imagination,

00:01:10.059 --> 00:01:12.078
the talent which we most praise.

00:01:12.102 --> 00:01:14.203
It is about finding the truth.

00:01:15.613 --> 00:01:18.350
There's nothing like the feeling
which invades you

00:01:18.374 --> 00:01:20.545
when after months of hard thinking,

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:23.867
you finally understand the right
reasoning to solve your problem.

00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:28.618
The great mathematician
André Weil likened this --

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:29.793
no kidding --

00:01:29.817 --> 00:01:31.406
to sexual pleasure.
