00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.852
This curve tells about the statistics
of velocities of particles

00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:36.415
in the same way as a demographic curve

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:40.280
would tell about the statistics
of ages of individuals.

00:02:40.884 --> 00:02:43.534
It's one of the most
important curves ever.

00:02:44.137 --> 00:02:47.323
It keeps on occurring again and again,

00:02:47.347 --> 00:02:49.750
from many theories and many experiments,

00:02:49.774 --> 00:02:53.055
as a great example of the universality

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.631
which is so dear to us mathematicians.

00:02:57.694 --> 00:02:58.921
Of this curve,

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:01.994
the famous scientist Francis Galton said,
