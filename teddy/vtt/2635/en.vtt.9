00:04:25.345 --> 00:04:30.630
but to my students I explain why
it could not be any other curve.

00:04:31.128 --> 00:04:33.998
And this is touching
the mystery of that goddess,

00:04:34.022 --> 00:04:38.723
replacing a beautiful coincidence
by a beautiful explanation.

00:04:39.027 --> 00:04:41.360
All of science is like this.

00:04:42.213 --> 00:04:47.561
And beautiful mathematical explanations
are not only for our pleasure.

00:04:47.585 --> 00:04:50.245
They also change our vision of the world.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.277
For instance,

00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:53.451
Einstein,

00:04:53.476 --> 00:04:54.626
Perrin,

00:04:54.651 --> 00:04:55.801
Smoluchowski,

00:04:55.826 --> 00:04:59.385
they used the mathematical analysis
of random trajectories

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.446
and the Gauss Curve
