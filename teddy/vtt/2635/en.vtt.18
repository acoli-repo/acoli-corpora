00:08:58.044 --> 00:09:02.210
they will go out through some link
chosen at random to the next one.

00:09:02.234 --> 00:09:03.987
And again, and again, and again.

00:09:04.358 --> 00:09:05.986
And with small, growing piles,

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.763
we'll keep the record of how many
times each site has been visited

00:09:09.787 --> 00:09:11.732
by these digital marbles.

00:09:12.243 --> 00:09:13.394
Here we go.

00:09:13.418 --> 00:09:15.266
Randomness, randomness.

00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:17.259
And from time to time,

00:09:17.283 --> 00:09:21.235
also let's make jumps completely
randomly to increase the fun.

00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:23.687
And look at this:

00:09:24.358 --> 00:09:27.143
from the chaos will emerge the solution.

00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:29.968
The highest piles
correspond to those sites

00:09:29.992 --> 00:09:33.503
which somehow are better
connected than the others,
