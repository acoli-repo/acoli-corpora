OK, that was easy,

00:08:03.042 --> 00:08:08.288
but now what about if you have
a big bunch of people who will testify?

00:08:08.864 --> 00:08:10.216
And this graph,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:15.859
I may think of it as all people
who testify in a complicated crime case,

00:08:15.883 --> 00:08:19.905
but it may just as well be web pages
pointing to each other,

00:08:19.929 --> 00:08:22.000
referring to each other for contents.

00:08:22.878 --> 00:08:25.214
Which ones are the most authoritative?

00:08:25.587 --> 00:08:26.921
Not so clear.

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:29.991
