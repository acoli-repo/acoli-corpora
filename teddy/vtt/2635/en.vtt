00:00:00.804 --> 00:00:05.216
What is it that French people
do better than all the others?

00:00:06.454 --> 00:00:08.380
If you would take polls,

00:00:08.404 --> 00:00:10.211
the top three answers might be:

00:00:10.235 --> 00:00:14.274
love, wine and whining.

00:00:14.298 --> 00:00:15.599
(Laughter)

00:00:15.623 --> 00:00:16.782
Maybe.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.868
But let me suggest a fourth one:

00:00:19.892 --> 00:00:21.082
mathematics.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.613
Did you know that Paris
has more mathematicians

00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:26.438
than any other city in the world?

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:29.295
And more streets
with mathematicians' names, too.
