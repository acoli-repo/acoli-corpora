With the advent of digital area,

00:10:01.028 --> 00:10:06.044
more and more problems lend
themselves to mathematical analysis,

00:10:06.068 --> 00:10:10.433
making the job of mathematician
a more and more useful one,

00:10:11.166 --> 00:10:13.888
to the extent that a few years ago,

00:10:13.912 --> 00:10:17.691

among hundreds of jobs

00:10:17.715 --> 00:10:21.683
in a study about the best and worst jobs

published by the Wall Street

00:10:25.445 --> 00:10:27.297
Mathematician --

00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:28.754
best job in the world.

00:10:29.646 --> 00:10:32.714
That's because of the applications:
