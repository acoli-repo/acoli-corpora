00:01:58.337 --> 00:02:01.830
Invisible particles from the air
around are bumping on you

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:04.587
by the billions and billions
at each second,

00:02:04.611 --> 00:02:06.674
all in complete chaos.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.200
And still,

00:02:08.224 --> 00:02:12.912
their statistics can be accurately
predicted by mathematical physics.

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:16.507
And open your eyes now

00:02:16.531 --> 00:02:19.841
to the statistics of the velocities
of these particles.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.750
The famous bell-shaped Gauss Curve,

00:02:23.774 --> 00:02:25.955
or the Law of Errors --

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.701
of deviations with respect
to the mean behavior.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.852
This curve tells about the statistics
of velocities of particles
