For the past decade,

00:00:02.344 --> 00:00:05.246
I've been studying non-state armed groups:

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.137
armed organizations like terrorists,
insurgents or militias.

00:00:09.588 --> 00:00:12.761
I document what these groups do
when they're not shooting.

00:00:12.785 --> 00:00:16.348
My goal is to better understand
these violent actors

00:00:16.372 --> 00:00:20.062
and to study ways to encourage transition
from violent engagement

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.963
to nonviolent confrontation.

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:25.391
I work in the field, in the policy world
and in the library.

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:30.860
Understanding non-state armed groups
is key to solving most ongoing conflict,
