Understanding non-state armed groups
is key to solving most ongoing conflict,

00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:32.440
because war has changed.

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:34.924
It used to be a contest between states.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:36.719
No longer.

00:00:36.743 --> 00:00:40.681
It is now a conflict between states
and non-state actors.

00:00:41.236 --> 00:00:44.972
For example, of the 216 peace agreements

00:00:44.996 --> 00:00:48.406
signed between 1975 and 2011,

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.610
196 of them were between a state
and a non-state actor.

00:00:53.634 --> 00:00:56.871
So we need to understand these groups;
we need to either engage them

00:00:56.895 --> 00:01:01.784
or defeat them in any conflict resolution
process that has to be successful.
