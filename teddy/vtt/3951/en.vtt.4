00:01:58.278 --> 00:02:00.421
radio stations, TV channels,

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:03.398
Internet websites
and social media strategies.

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:05.714
And up here, you have the ISIS magazine,

00:02:05.738 --> 00:02:08.863
printed in English
and published to recruit.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.166
Armed groups also invest
in complex fund-raising --

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.053
not looting, but setting up
profitable businesses;

00:02:16.077 --> 00:02:18.467
for example, construction companies.

00:02:18.491 --> 00:02:20.374
Now, these activities are keys.

00:02:20.398 --> 00:02:22.818
They allow these groups
to increase their strength,

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:24.197
increase their funds,

00:02:24.221 --> 00:02:27.093
to better recruit
and to build their brand.

00:02:27.537 --> 00:02:29.276
Armed groups also do something else:

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.960
they build stronger bonds
with the population
