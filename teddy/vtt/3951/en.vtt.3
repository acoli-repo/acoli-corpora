Take the Lebanese Hezbollah,

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.932
known for its violent
confrontation against Israel.

00:01:32.956 --> 00:01:35.791
But since its creation in the early 1980s,

00:01:35.815 --> 00:01:38.400
Hezbollah has also set up
a political party,

00:01:38.424 --> 00:01:41.741
a social-service network,
and a military apparatus.

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:44.391
Similarly, the Palestinian Hamas,

00:01:44.415 --> 00:01:46.982
known for its suicide attacks
against Israel,

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.210
also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007.

00:01:50.234 --> 00:01:52.912
So these groups do way more
than just shoot.

00:01:53.453 --> 00:01:54.612
They multi-task.

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:58.254
They set up complex
communication machines --

00:01:58.278 --> 00:02:00.421
radio stations, TV channels,
