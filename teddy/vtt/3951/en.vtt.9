00:04:26.862 --> 00:04:30.275
and the more states are weak,
like in the Middle East today,

00:04:30.299 --> 00:04:33.775
the more non-state actors
step in and fill that gap.

00:04:33.799 --> 00:04:36.925
This matters for governments,
because to counter these groups,

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.399
they will have to invest more
in non-military tools.

00:04:41.202 --> 00:04:42.673
Filling that governance gap

00:04:42.697 --> 00:04:46.126
has to be at the center
of any sustainable approach.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.789
This also matters very much
for peacemaking and peacebuilding.

00:04:49.813 --> 00:04:51.844
If we better understand armed groups,

00:04:51.868 --> 00:04:54.330
we will better know
what incentives to offer

00:04:54.354 --> 00:04:58.130
to encourage the transition
from violence to nonviolence.

00:04:58.487 --> 00:05:02.131
So in this new contest
between states and non-states,
