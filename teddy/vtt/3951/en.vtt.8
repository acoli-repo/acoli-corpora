00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:01.439
And the more these organizations
are complex and sophisticated,

00:04:01.463 --> 00:04:04.804
the less we can think of them
as the opposite of a state.

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:07.107
Now, what do you call
a group like Hezbollah?

00:04:07.131 --> 00:04:10.446
They run part of a territory,
they administer all their functions,

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.604
they pick up the garbage,
they run the sewage system.

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:16.339
Is this a state? Is it a rebel group?

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.057
Or maybe something else,
something different and new?

00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:21.762
And what about ISIS?

00:04:21.786 --> 00:04:23.056
The lines are blurred.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.838
We live in a world of states,
non-states, and in-between,

00:04:26.862 --> 00:04:30.275
and the more states are weak,
like in the Middle East today,
