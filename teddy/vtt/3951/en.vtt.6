00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:01.002
or even the beginning
of the ascent of ISIS,

00:03:01.026 --> 00:03:04.084
can be understood also by looking
at these groups' efforts

00:03:04.108 --> 00:03:06.324
to provide security.

00:03:06.348 --> 00:03:08.619
Now, unfortunately, in these cases,

00:03:08.643 --> 00:03:11.889
the provision of security
came at an unbearably high price

00:03:11.913 --> 00:03:13.323
for the population.

00:03:13.347 --> 00:03:17.588
But in general, providing
social services fills a gap,

00:03:17.612 --> 00:03:19.873
a governance gap left by the government,

00:03:19.897 --> 00:03:22.492
and allows these groups
to increase their strength

00:03:22.516 --> 00:03:23.714
and their power.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.446
For example, the 2006 electoral victory
of the Palestinian Hamas

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.049
cannot be understood without
acknowledging the group's social work.
