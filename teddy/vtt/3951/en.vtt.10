00:04:58.487 --> 00:05:02.131
So in this new contest
between states and non-states,

00:05:02.155 --> 00:05:04.807
military power can win some battles,

00:05:04.831 --> 00:05:07.664
but it will not give us
peace nor stability.

00:05:08.085 --> 00:05:09.933
To achieve these objectives,

00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:14.762
what we need is a long-term investment
in filling that security gap,

00:05:14.786 --> 00:05:16.787
in filling that governance gap

00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:19.902
that allowed these groups
to thrive in the first place.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.371
Thank you.

00:05:21.395 --> 00:05:24.952
(Applause)
