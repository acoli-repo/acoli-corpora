00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How do groups get anything done? Right?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
How do you organize a group of individuals

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
so that the output of the group

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is something coherent and of lasting value,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
instead of just being chaos?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And the economic framing of that problem

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
is called coordination costs.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
or institutional difficulties in arranging group output.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And we've had a classic answer for coordination costs,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
which is, if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
you start an institution, right? You raise some resources.
