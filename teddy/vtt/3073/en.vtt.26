00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.120
One day when I go to heaven
to be judged by God,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.280
I will ask to see your brother.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.240
And I will hug him.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.200
And I will ask him for forgiveness."

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.840
And Rana says ...

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.640
"We already forgave you."

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.960
Forgiveness is not forgetting.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.840
Forgiveness is freedom from hate.
