00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.216
where my family has lived
and farmed for a century.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.856
When I was told that I would go to hell
because I was not Christian,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.616
called a "black dog"
because I was not white,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.576
I ran to my grandfather's arms.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.616
Papa Ji dried my tears --

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.376
gave me the words of Guru Nanak,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.376
the founder of the Sikh faith.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.696
"I see no stranger," said Nanak.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.959
"I see no enemy."

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.296
My grandfather taught me

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.040
that I could choose
to see all the faces I meet

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.480
and wonder about them.
