00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.536
I turned to my mother and said, "I can't,"

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.536
but she was already pouring
my grandfather's prayer in my ear.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.960
(Sikh Prayer) "Tati Vao Na Lagi,
Par Brahm Sarnai."

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.720
"The hot winds cannot touch you."

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.640
"You are brave," she said.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.880
"You are brave."

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.000
And suddenly I saw my grandmother
standing behind my mother.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.840
And her mother behind her.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.480
And her mother behind her.
