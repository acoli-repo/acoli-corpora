00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.536
A long line of women who had
pushed through the fire before me.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.816
I took a breath;

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.056
I pushed;

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.320
my son was born.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.856
As I held him in my arms,
shaking and sobbing

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.296
from the rush of oxytocin
that flooded my body,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.896
my mother was already
preparing to feed me.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.976
Nursing her baby as I nursed mine.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.096
My mother had never stopped
laboring for me,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.456
from my birth to my son's birth.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.480
She already knew
what I was just beginning to name.
