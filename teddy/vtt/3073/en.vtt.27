Forgiveness is freedom from hate.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.176
Because when we are free from hate,

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.416
we see the ones who hurt us
not as monsters,

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.096
but as people who themselves are wounded,

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.176
who themselves feel threatened,

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.656
who don't know what else
to do with their insecurity

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.816
but to hurt us, to pull the trigger,

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.096
or cast the vote,

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.176
or pass the policy aimed at us.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.920
But if some of us
begin to wonder about them,

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.320
listen even to their stories,
