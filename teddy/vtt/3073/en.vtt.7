Now, if you cringe when people say,
"Love is the answer ..."

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.656
I do, too.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.696
(Laughter)

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.976
I am a lawyer.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.296
(Laughter)

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.576
So let me show you how I came to see love
as a force for social justice

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.280
through three lessons.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.696
My first encounter with hate
was in the schoolyard.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.296
I was a little girl
growing up in California,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.216
where my family has lived
and farmed for a century.
