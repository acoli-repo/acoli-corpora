Shah Rukh Khan: In every Indian home,
on any happy occasion,

00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:11.476
the saree has a very special place.

Women dressing up in one,

00:00:13.956 --> 00:00:16.356
gifting sarees to each other,

00:00:16.356 --> 00:00:19.416
accepting the sarees ...
each is a special feeling.

Today is a special day for us as well on

celebrating our own Womenâ€™s Day.
