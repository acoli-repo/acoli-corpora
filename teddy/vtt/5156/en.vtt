[How can we control
the coronavirus pandemic?]

00:00:02.579 --> 00:00:04.984
[From infectious disease expert
Adam Kucharski]

00:00:05.614 --> 00:00:09.206
[Question 1: What does containment mean
when it comes to outbreaks?]

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.843
Containment is this idea
that you can focus your effort on control

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:15.164
very much on the cases and their contacts.

00:00:15.188 --> 00:00:17.887
So you're not causing disruption
to the wider population,

00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:20.596
you have a case that comes in,
you isolate them,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.923
you work out who they've come
into contact with,

00:00:22.947 --> 00:00:25.984
who's potentially these
opportunities for exposure

00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:28.136
and then you can follow up those people,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.656
maybe quarantine them, to make sure
that no further transmission happens.
