00:07:28.453 --> 00:07:30.570
to have the capability to hack into the computers

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.269
of the real bad guys,

00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:34.245
they also have to have the capability

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.430
to hack into our devices too.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.182
So governments around the world

00:07:38.182 --> 00:07:39.643
have been embracing this technology.

00:07:39.643 --> 00:07:41.248
They've been embracing hacking

00:07:41.248 --> 00:07:43.068
as a law enforcement technique,

00:07:43.068 --> 00:07:45.018
but without any real debate.

00:07:45.018 --> 00:07:46.837
In the United States, where I live,

00:07:46.837 --> 00:07:48.662
there have been no congressional hearings.

00:07:48.662 --> 00:07:50.623
There's no law that's been passed

00:07:50.623 --> 00:07:52.696
specifically authorizing this technique,

00:07:52.696 --> 00:07:55.365
and because of its power and potential for abuse,

00:07:55.365 --> 00:07:58.312
it's vital that we have an informed public debate.

00:07:58.312 --> 00:08:00.258
Thank you very much.
