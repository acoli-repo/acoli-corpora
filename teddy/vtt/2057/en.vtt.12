00:05:58.253 --> 00:06:01.101
detailing their next generation
of surveillance technologies.

00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:03.735
Most of these documents were heavily redacted,

00:06:03.735 --> 00:06:06.551
but what you can see from the slides,

00:06:06.551 --> 00:06:08.513
if I zoom in, is this term:

00:06:08.513 --> 00:06:10.333
Remote Operations Unit.

00:06:10.333 --> 00:06:12.567
Now, when I first looked into this,

00:06:12.567 --> 00:06:14.637

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:18.224
I'd never heard of it.

00:06:18.224 --> 00:06:20.187
And so I went online and I did some research,

00:06:20.187 --> 00:06:22.312
and ultimately I hit the mother lode

00:06:22.312 --> 00:06:23.946
when I went to LinkedIn,

00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:26.515
the social networking site for job seekers.

00:06:26.515 --> 00:06:29.428
There were lots of former
U.S. government contractors

00:06:29.428 --> 00:06:30.815
who had at one point worked
