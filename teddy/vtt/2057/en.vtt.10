WEBVTT

00:04:58.658 --> 00:05:00.195
They've been attending

00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:01.792
surveillance industry conferences

00:05:01.792 --> 00:05:03.807
where law enforcement officials show up.

00:05:03.807 --> 00:05:05.641
They've spoken at the conferences.

00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:07.229
What I thought was most fascinating was

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.330
they've actually paid for the coffee break

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.270
at one of the law enforcement conferences

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.763
earlier this year.

00:05:12.763 --> 00:05:14.862
I can't tell you for sure that Hacking Team

00:05:14.862 --> 00:05:17.587
has sold their technology in the United States,

00:05:17.587 --> 00:05:19.558
but what I can tell you that if they haven't sold it,

00:05:19.558 --> 00:05:22.733
it isn't because they haven't been trying hard.

00:05:22.733 --> 00:05:24.775
So as I said before,

00:05:24.775 --> 00:05:26.695
governments that don't really have the resources

00:05:26.695 --> 00:05:28.291
to build their own tools will buy

00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:29.701
off-the-shelf surveillance software,

00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:31.089
and so for that reason,
