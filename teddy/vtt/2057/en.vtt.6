Gamma's software has been located on servers

00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:01.817
in countries around the world,

00:03:01.817 --> 00:03:04.208
many with really atrocious track records

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:05.769
and human rights violations.

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.164
They really are selling their
software around the world.

00:03:09.164 --> 00:03:11.465
Gamma is not the only company in the business.

00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:14.216
As I said, it's a $5 billion industry.

00:03:14.216 --> 00:03:17.055
One of the other big guys in the industry

00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:19.450
is an Italian company called Hacking Team.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.175
Now, Hacking Team has what is probably

00:03:21.175 --> 00:03:23.145
the slickest presentation.

00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:26.173
The video they've produced is very sexy,

00:03:26.173 --> 00:03:27.821
and so I'm going to play you a clip

00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:29.135
just so you can get a feel

00:03:29.135 --> 00:03:30.966
both for the capabilities of the software
