00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:01.024
(Laughter)

00:02:01.024 --> 00:02:04.522
So this screenshot is from a sales video

00:02:04.522 --> 00:02:06.087
that Gamma produced.

00:02:06.087 --> 00:02:08.070
Really, they're just emphasizing

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.721
in a relatively slick presentation

00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:11.914
the fact that the police can sort of sit

00:02:11.914 --> 00:02:13.364
in an air-conditioned office

00:02:13.364 --> 00:02:14.775
and remotely monitor someone

00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:16.950
without them having any idea that it's going on.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.985
You know, your webcam light won't turn on.

00:02:18.985 --> 00:02:22.339
There's nothing to indicate that
the microphone is enabled.

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.674
This is the managing director
of Gamma International.

00:02:25.674 --> 00:02:27.535
His name is Martin Muench.

00:02:27.535 --> 00:02:30.466
There are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist.
