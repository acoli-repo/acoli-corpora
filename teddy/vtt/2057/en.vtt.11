00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:31.089
and so for that reason,

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:33.805
you see that the government of, say, Tunisia,

00:05:33.805 --> 00:05:35.993
might use the same software
as the government of Germany.

00:05:35.993 --> 00:05:38.265
They're all buying off-the-shelf stuff.

00:05:38.265 --> 00:05:40.464
The Federal Bureau of
Investigation in the United States

00:05:40.464 --> 00:05:43.226
does have the budget to build
their own surveillance technology,

00:05:43.226 --> 00:05:45.007
and so for several years, I've been trying

00:05:45.007 --> 00:05:47.398
to figure out if and how the FBI

00:05:47.398 --> 00:05:50.296
is hacking into the computers of surveillance targets.

00:05:50.296 --> 00:05:53.449
My friends at an organization called
the Electronic Frontier Foundation --

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.761
they're a civil society group —

00:05:55.761 --> 00:05:58.253
obtained hundreds of documents from the FBI

00:05:58.253 --> 00:06:01.101
detailing their next generation
of surveillance technologies.
