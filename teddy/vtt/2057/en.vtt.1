00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.088
and text messages.

00:00:30.088 --> 00:00:31.744
Of course, it's no secret

00:00:31.744 --> 00:00:34.940
that governments are able to intercept
telephone calls and text messages.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.312
It's for that reason that many activists

00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:39.238
specifically avoid using the telephone.

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:41.586
Instead, they use tools like Skype,

00:00:41.586 --> 00:00:44.106
which they think are immune to interception.

00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:45.878
They're wrong.

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:48.604
There have now been over the last few years

00:00:48.604 --> 00:00:50.250
an industry of companies

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.504
who provide surveillance technology to governments,

00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:55.865
specifically technology that
allows those governments

00:00:55.865 --> 00:00:57.518
to hack into the computers

00:00:57.518 --> 00:00:59.113
of surveillance targets.

00:00:59.113 --> 00:01:01.953
Rather than intercepting the communications 
as they go over the wire,
