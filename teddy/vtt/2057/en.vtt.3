00:01:28.324 --> 00:01:30.390
don't really have the in-house capabilities

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.855
to develop this software.

00:01:31.855 --> 00:01:33.474
Smaller ones don't have the resources

00:01:33.474 --> 00:01:35.250
or the expertise,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.557
and so there's this market of Western companies

00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:40.524
who are happy to supply them with the tools

00:01:40.524 --> 00:01:42.242
and techniques for a price.

00:01:42.242 --> 00:01:44.848
Gamma is just one of these companies.

00:01:44.848 --> 00:01:47.756
I should note also that Gamma never actually sold

00:01:47.756 --> 00:01:49.653
their software to the Egyptian government.

00:01:49.653 --> 00:01:52.250
They'd sent them an invoice for a sale,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.892
but the Egyptians never bought it.

00:01:53.892 --> 00:01:55.616
Instead, apparently, the Egyptian government

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:58.249
used a free demo version of Gamma's software.

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:01.024
