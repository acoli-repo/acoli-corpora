The 2011 Arab Spring

00:00:02.776 --> 00:00:04.579
captured the attention of the world.

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:06.228
It also captured the attention

00:00:06.228 --> 00:00:08.605
of authoritarian governments in other countries,

00:00:08.605 --> 00:00:11.568
who were worried that revolution would spread.

00:00:11.568 --> 00:00:13.645
To respond, they ramped up surveillance

00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:16.741
of activists, journalists and dissidents

00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:18.695
who they feared would inspire revolution

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:20.530
in their own countries.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.575
One prominent Bahraini activist,

00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:24.685

00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:26.410

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.280
transcripts of his telephone calls

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.088
