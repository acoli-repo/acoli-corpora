00:00:00.788 --> 00:00:03.541
When you work,
you expect to be paid for it.

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:06.669
You don't expect to be paid
less than you were promised

00:00:06.711 --> 00:00:08.880
or worse, nothing at all.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.758
But that's exactly what's happening
to millions of Americans

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:13.634
who work in a range of industries.

00:00:13.676 --> 00:00:18.473
It's especially a problem in agriculture,
construction, restaurants,

00:00:18.473 --> 00:00:20.641
garment factories, poultry plants,

00:00:20.683 --> 00:00:22.643
nursing homes, in day labor

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:25.063
and among independent contractors.

00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:26.606
It's called wage theft,

00:00:26.606 --> 00:00:30.068
and chances are that you
or someone you know has experienced it.
