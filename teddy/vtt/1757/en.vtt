00:00:00.705 --> 00:00:02.930
In System D, this

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.977
is a store,

00:00:04.977 --> 00:00:07.304
and what I mean by that is that this is a photograph

00:00:07.304 --> 00:00:12.619
I took in Makoko, shantytown in Lagos, Nigeria.

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.002
It's built over the lagoon, and there are no streets

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:16.818
where there can be stores to shop,

00:00:16.818 --> 00:00:18.708
and so the store comes to you.

00:00:18.708 --> 00:00:20.493
And in the same community,

00:00:20.493 --> 00:00:22.245
this is business synergy.

00:00:22.245 --> 00:00:26.351
This is the boat that that lady was paddling around in,

00:00:26.351 --> 00:00:29.091
and this artisan makes the boat and the paddles

00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:30.396
and sells directly
