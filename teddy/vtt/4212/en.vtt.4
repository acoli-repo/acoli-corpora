00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.916
like northwest, southeast, what have you.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.648
And for the first time,
they knew where they were going.

00:02:03.672 --> 00:02:05.239
That's kind of a big deal.

00:02:05.263 --> 00:02:09.146
But also, I think it was part
of this general reinvigoration

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.565
of European science.

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:12.385
You might know it as the Renaissance.

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.685
Lots of new tools were invented,

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.635
from the telescope to the microscope.

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.176
Maps got better because
of compasses, right?

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.450
Because then you start to understand
which direction is which,

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:23.784
you get a lot more detail,

00:02:23.808 --> 00:02:25.497
and that just kind of changes

00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:27.855
the human relationship to the world.

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.555
The compass with a map
is like a superpower.
