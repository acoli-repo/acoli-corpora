00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.555
The compass with a map
is like a superpower.

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.305
Everything that we think
of as world history

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.909
would not have taken place
without the compass:

00:02:35.933 --> 00:02:39.812
the age of exploration, Magellan
circumnavigating the globe,

00:02:39.836 --> 00:02:41.945
even the fact that we know it is a globe.

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.400
The compass ends up getting embedded
in all these other tools,

00:02:45.424 --> 00:02:47.767
because it is such a functional object.

00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:50.455
So you might have it
embedded in your multi-tool,

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:52.412
you might have it
embedded in your phone.

00:02:52.436 --> 00:02:53.692
The compass is everywhere,

00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:57.555
because it's literally how we find our way
across the face of the Earth.

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.275
So you can go off and explore,

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.673
and find out what is over that next hill
or that next horizon,
