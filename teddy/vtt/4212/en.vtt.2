00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.235
is spinning around
and creating a magnetic field.

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:03.035
Just like a magnet you can
play with on your tabletop,

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.931
it has a north pole and a south pole,

00:01:04.955 --> 00:01:08.165
and we use compasses to find our way
north because of that fact.

00:01:08.743 --> 00:01:13.798
The earliest known compass comes
from about 200 BC in China.

00:01:13.822 --> 00:01:17.047
They figured out that some of the metal
coming out of the ground

00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:18.334
was naturally magnetic,

00:01:18.358 --> 00:01:21.106
and so they fashioned
this magnetized metal

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.959
into this kind of ladle-looking thing,

00:01:22.983 --> 00:01:24.466
put it on a brass plate

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.926
and then it would point north.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.730
It seems to have been primarily
used to improve feng shui,

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:32.281
so they could figure out
what was the best way for energy to flow
