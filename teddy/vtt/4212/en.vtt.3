00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:32.281
so they could figure out
what was the best way for energy to flow

00:01:32.305 --> 00:01:34.044
through their living spaces.

00:01:34.068 --> 00:01:36.769
Sailors were probably the early adopters

00:01:36.793 --> 00:01:39.184
of the more portable versions of it,

00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:40.932
because no matter where the sun was,

00:01:40.956 --> 00:01:43.152
no matter what the condition
of the stars were,

00:01:43.176 --> 00:01:45.042
they would always
be able to find north.

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:48.568
Now, much later, the Europeans
are the ones who innovate

00:01:48.592 --> 00:01:50.418
and come up with the compass rose.

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:51.765
It essentially laid out

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.335
what north, south, east
and west looked like,

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:57.795
and it also enabled you
to kind of create new directions,

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.916
like northwest, southeast, what have you.
