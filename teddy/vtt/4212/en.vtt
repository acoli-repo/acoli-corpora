Growing up in Missouri,

00:00:01.503 --> 00:00:04.155
they would kind of take us
out into the woods,

00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:07.238
and they would give you a map,
and they would give you a compass,

00:00:07.262 --> 00:00:08.887
and you had to find your way home.

00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:10.583
And without the compass,

00:00:10.607 --> 00:00:12.089
you can't even read the map.

00:00:12.113 --> 00:00:13.715
That's what I'm here to tell you.

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:14.972
The compass is the key.

00:00:14.996 --> 00:00:16.228
[Small thing.]

00:00:16.252 --> 00:00:18.124
[Big idea.]

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:25.256
A compass is most simply a piece of metal
that has been magnetized,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.729
so that it will turn towards
the Earth's magnetic pole.

00:00:28.753 --> 00:00:31.655
The one that we all think of
is the pocket compass.
