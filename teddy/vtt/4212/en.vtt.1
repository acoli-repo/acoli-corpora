00:00:28.753 --> 00:00:31.655
The one that we all think of
is the pocket compass.

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.200
It looks like a watch, right?

00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:34.639
You can hold it in your hand

00:00:34.663 --> 00:00:37.045
and watch the little needle bounce around

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:38.596
until you find north.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.618
Magnetism is still a pretty
mysterious force to physicists,

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:45.825
but what we do know for sure
is that a compass works

00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:48.071
because the Earth is this giant magnet.

00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:49.757
And when you use a compass,

00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:53.435
you are in touch with
the very center of our planet,

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:57.245
where this kind of roiling
ball of molten iron

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.235
is spinning around
and creating a magnetic field.
