00:00:00.476 --> 00:00:03.356
David Biello: In the wake
of Dr. Anthony Fauci's announcement

00:00:03.356 --> 00:00:04.556
that he will be retiring

00:00:04.596 --> 00:00:08.756
as the head of the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

00:00:08.796 --> 00:00:10.196
at the end of the year,

00:00:10.236 --> 00:00:12.596
I've invited him to join me
for a conversation

00:00:12.636 --> 00:00:15.116
on the future of the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:00:15.156 --> 00:00:18.796
reflections on his career
and the future of public health.

00:00:18.836 --> 00:00:21.876
Please welcome Brooklyn's own Dr. Fauci.

00:00:21.916 --> 00:00:25.436
Anthony Fauci: Hi, David, nice to see you,
thank you for having me.

00:00:25.476 --> 00:00:27.436
DB: Thank you for joining us.

00:00:27.436 --> 00:00:30.996
So my first question is very simple.
