Pause the video now 
if you want to figure it out for yourself!

00:02:01.735 --> 00:02:03.023
Answer in: 3

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:04.379
Answer in: 2

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:05.632

you're just a minute or two short of time,
but there is a way.

00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:16.997
The key is to minimize the time wasted
by the two slowest people

00:02:16.997 --> 00:02:19.088
by having them cross together.

00:02:19.088 --> 00:02:22.621
And because you'll need to make
a couple of return trips with the lantern,

00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:26.639
you'll want to have the fastest people
available to do so.

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:31.461
So, you and the lab assistant quickly
run across with the lantern,
