00:01:26.994 --> 00:01:30.883
Remember: no more than two people
can cross the bridge together,

00:01:30.883 --> 00:01:35.247
anyone crossing must either
hold the lantern or stay right next to it,

00:01:35.247 --> 00:01:40.321
and any of you can safely wait in the dark
on either side of the gorge.

00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:45.603
Most importantly, everyone must be
safely across before the zombies arrive.

00:01:45.603 --> 00:01:50.573
Otherwise, the first zombie could step on
the bridge while people are still on it.

00:01:50.573 --> 00:01:53.007
Finally, there are no tricks to use here.

00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:54.645
You can't swing across,

00:01:54.645 --> 00:01:56.388
use the bridge as a raft,

00:01:56.388 --> 00:01:58.760
or befriend the zombies.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.735
