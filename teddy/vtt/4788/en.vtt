00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:12.031
Taking that internship 
in a remote mountain lab

00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:14.539
might not have been the best idea.

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.291
Pulling that lever with the skull symbol
just to see what it did

00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:20.743
probably wasn't so smart, either,

00:00:20.743 --> 00:00:23.278
but now is not the time for regrets

00:00:23.278 --> 00:00:28.223
because you need to get away
from these mutant zombies fast.

00:00:28.223 --> 00:00:32.236
With you are the janitor, 
the lab assistant, and the old professor.
