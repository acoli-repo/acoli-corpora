00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:03.248
By the time they're across,
there are only four minutes left,

00:03:03.248 --> 00:03:05.925
and you're still stuck
on the wrong side of the bridge.

00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:10.965
But remember, the lab assistant
has been waiting on the other side,

00:03:10.965 --> 00:03:13.790
and she's the second fastest of the group.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.111
So she grabs the lantern 
from the professor

00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:18.804
and runs back across to you.

00:03:18.804 --> 00:03:23.010
Now with only two minutes left,
the two of you make the final crossing.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.122
As you step on the far side of the gorge,

00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:28.823
you cut the ropes 
and collapse the bridge behind you,

00:03:28.823 --> 00:03:30.589
just in the nick of time.
