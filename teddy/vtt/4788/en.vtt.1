00:00:28.223 --> 00:00:32.236
With you are the janitor, 
the lab assistant, and the old professor.

00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:36.255
You've gotten a headstart,
but there's only one way to safety:

00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:40.684
across an old rope bridge
spanning a massive gorge.

00:00:40.684 --> 00:00:42.805
You can dash across in a minute,

00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:46.265
while the lab assistant takes two minutes.

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:49.452
The janitor is a bit slower
and needs five minutes,

00:00:49.452 --> 00:00:52.725
and the professor takes
a whole ten minutes,

00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:56.031
holding onto the ropes 
every step of the way.

00:00:56.031 --> 00:00:58.677
By the professor's calculations,

00:00:58.677 --> 00:01:02.611
the zombies will catch up to you
in just over 17 minutes,
