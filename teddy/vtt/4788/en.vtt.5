00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:31.461
So, you and the lab assistant quickly
run across with the lantern,

00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:34.646
though you have to slow down 
a bit to match her pace.

00:02:34.646 --> 00:02:37.559
After two minutes, both of you are across,

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:41.287
and you, as the quickest, 
run back with the lantern.

00:02:41.287 --> 00:02:43.213
Only three minutes have passed.

00:02:43.213 --> 00:02:44.788
So far, so good.

00:02:44.788 --> 00:02:46.614
Now comes the hard part.

00:02:46.614 --> 00:02:50.320
The professor and the janitor take
the lantern and cross together.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.949
This takes them ten minutes

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.460
since the janitor has to slow down 
for the old professor

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.460
who keeps muttering

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.501
that he probably shouldn't 
have given the zombies night vision.

00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:03.248
By the time they're across,
there are only four minutes left,
