00:00:58.677 --> 00:01:02.611
the zombies will catch up to you
in just over 17 minutes,

00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:08.778
so you only have that much time
to get everyone across and cut the ropes.

00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:13.305
Unfortunately, the bridge can only hold
two people at a time.

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:14.729
To make matters worse,

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.972
it's so dark out that you can barely see,

00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:21.698
and the old lantern you grabbed on
your way only illuminates a tiny area.

00:01:21.698 --> 00:01:26.994
Can you figure out a way
to have everyone escape in time?

00:01:26.994 --> 00:01:30.883
Remember: no more than two people
can cross the bridge together,
