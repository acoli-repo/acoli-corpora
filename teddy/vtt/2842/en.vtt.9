This illustrates to me
the deadly danger of fake news.

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:32.811
So what can we do about it?

00:04:33.883 --> 00:04:35.800
There are some very smart people,

00:04:35.824 --> 00:04:38.283
smart engineers at Google and Facebook,

00:04:38.307 --> 00:04:43.372
who are trying to use technology
to stop the spread of fake news.

00:04:43.396 --> 00:04:48.147
But beyond that, I think
everybody here -- you and I --

00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:50.358
we have a role to play in that.

00:04:50.382 --> 00:04:52.675
We are the ones who share the content.

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.210
We are the ones who share
the stories online.

00:04:55.234 --> 00:04:57.421
In this day and age, we're all publishers,

00:04:58.535 --> 00:05:01.026
and we have responsibility.
