Hadiza is a Chibok girl,

00:00:30.845 --> 00:00:34.078
and on April 14, 2014, she was kidnapped

00:00:34.102 --> 00:00:35.726
by Boko Haram terrorists.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.979
She managed to escape, though,

00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:42.200
by jumping off the truck
that was carrying the girls.

00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:45.517
But when she landed,
she broke both her legs,

00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:48.961
and she had to crawl on her tummy
to hide in the bushes.

00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:53.063
She told me she was terrified
that Boko Haram would come back for her.

00:00:53.704 --> 00:00:58.331
She was one of 57 girls who would escape
by jumping off trucks that day.

00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:00.896
This story, quite rightly, caused ripples
