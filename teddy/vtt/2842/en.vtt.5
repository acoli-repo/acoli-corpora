00:02:27.345 --> 00:02:31.008
For two years, inevitably,
the news agenda moved on,

00:02:31.032 --> 00:02:32.762
and for two years,

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:35.945
we didn't hear much
about the Chibok girls.

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.838
Everyone presumed they were dead.

00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:40.220
But in April last year,

00:02:40.244 --> 00:02:42.449
I was able to obtain this video.

00:02:43.036 --> 00:02:44.776
This is a still from the video

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.914
that Boko Haram filmed as a proof of life,

00:02:48.923 --> 00:02:51.467
and through a source,
I obtained this video.

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.646
But before I could publish it,

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.695
I had to travel
to the northeast of Nigeria

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:58.786
to talk to the parents, to verify it.

00:02:59.317 --> 00:03:02.694
I didn't have to wait
too long for confirmation.
