and we have responsibility.

In my job as a journalist,

00:05:03.384 --> 00:05:05.412

00:05:05.436 --> 00:05:08.717
I trust my gut, but I ask tough questions.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.496
Why is this person telling me this story?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.019
What do they have to gain
by sharing this information?

00:05:16.043 --> 00:05:17.851
Do they have a hidden agenda?

00:05:18.682 --> 00:05:24.173
I really believe that we must all start
to ask tougher questions

00:05:24.197 --> 00:05:26.507
of information that we discover online.

00:05:29.673 --> 00:05:35.404
Research shows that some of us
don't even read beyond headlines
