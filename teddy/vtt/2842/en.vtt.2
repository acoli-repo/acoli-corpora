00:00:58.355 --> 00:01:00.896
This story, quite rightly, caused ripples

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.292
around the world.

00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:05.586
People like Michelle Obama,
Malala and others

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.702
lent their voices in protest,

00:01:07.726 --> 00:01:10.987
and at about the same time --
I was living in London at the time --

00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:15.654
I was sent from London to Abuja
to cover the World Economic Forum

00:01:15.678 --> 00:01:18.100
that Nigeria was hosting
for the first time.

00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:22.719
But when we arrived, it was clear
that there was only one story in town.

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.754
We put the government under pressure.

00:01:25.778 --> 00:01:28.340
We asked tough questions
about what they were doing

00:01:28.364 --> 00:01:29.855
to bring these girls back.
