Hello, everybody,

00:00:01.596 --> 00:00:03.516
I am delighted to be here

00:00:03.556 --> 00:00:05.676
and grateful to all of you

00:00:05.716 --> 00:00:08.596
for joining us for this discussion.

00:00:11.236 --> 00:00:13.556
In 2015,

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:16.836
I gave a TEDx Talk

00:00:16.876 --> 00:00:20.876
in a little elementary school auditorium,

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:23.156
and much to my surprise,

00:00:23.196 --> 00:00:27.596
the talk became one
of the 10 most-viewed talks

00:00:27.636 --> 00:00:29.156
in the history of TED.
