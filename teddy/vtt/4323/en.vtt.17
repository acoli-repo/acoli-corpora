00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.993
And thorium is not
a rare substance, either.

00:08:32.017 --> 00:08:34.116
There are many sites
like this one in Idaho,

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.023
where an area the size of a football field
would produce enough thorium each year

00:08:38.047 --> 00:08:39.323
to power the entire world.

00:08:39.347 --> 00:08:41.312
Using liquid fluoride thorium technology,

00:08:41.336 --> 00:08:44.234
we could move away from
expensive and difficult aspects

00:08:44.258 --> 00:08:47.097
of current water-cooled, solid-fueled
uranium nuclear power.

00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:50.015
We wouldn't need large,
high-pressure nuclear reactors

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:52.197
and big containment buildings
that they go in.

00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:54.829
We wouldn't need large,
low-efficiency steam turbines.

00:08:54.853 --> 00:08:56.039
We wouldn't need to have

00:08:56.063 --> 00:08:58.751
as many long-distance power
transmission infrastructure,

00:08:58.775 --> 00:09:01.234
because thorium is
a very portable energy source
