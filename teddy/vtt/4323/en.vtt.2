00:00:59.402 --> 00:01:01.933
And we had to think about
how we would provide energy

00:01:01.957 --> 00:01:03.475
for this very unique community.

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:04.971
There’s no coal on the Moon.

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:06.333
There's no petroleum.

00:01:06.357 --> 00:01:08.034
There’s no natural gas.

00:01:08.058 --> 00:01:09.241
There's no atmosphere.

00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:10.526
There’s no wind, either.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.604
And solar power had a real problem:

00:01:12.628 --> 00:01:15.115
the Moon orbits the Earth once a month.

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:17.140
For two weeks, the sun goes down,

00:01:17.164 --> 00:01:19.378
and your solar panels
don't make any energy.

00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:22.670
If you want to try to store
enough energy in batteries for two weeks,

00:01:22.694 --> 00:01:24.187
it just simply isn't practical.

00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:26.335
So nuclear energy
was really the only choice.

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:29.742
Now, back in 2000, I didn't really know
too much about nuclear power,

00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.156
so I started trying to learn.
