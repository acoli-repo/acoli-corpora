Water-cooled reactors have
another additional challenge:

00:03:30.356 --> 00:03:32.661
they need to be near
large bodies of water,

00:03:32.685 --> 00:03:35.474
where the steam they generate
can be cooled and condensed.

00:03:35.498 --> 00:03:37.760
Otherwise, they can't generate
electrical power.

00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:39.886
Now, there's no lakes
or rivers on the Moon,

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.719
so if all of this makes it sound
like water-cooled reactors

00:03:42.743 --> 00:03:44.846
aren't such a good fit
for a lunar community,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.359
I would tend to agree with you.

00:03:46.383 --> 00:03:47.434
(Laughter)

00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:50.928
I had the good fortune to learn about
a different form of nuclear power

00:03:50.952 --> 00:03:52.727
that doesn't have all these problems,

00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:53.983
for a very simple reason:

00:03:54.007 --> 00:03:57.064
it's not based on water-cooling,
and it doesn't use solid fuel.

00:03:57.088 --> 00:03:59.306
Surprisingly, it's based on salt.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.416
One day, I was at a friend's
office at work,
