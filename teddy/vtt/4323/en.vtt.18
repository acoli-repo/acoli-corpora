00:08:58.775 --> 00:09:01.234
because thorium is
a very portable energy source

00:09:01.258 --> 00:09:03.564
that can be located
near to where it is needed.

00:09:03.588 --> 00:09:06.803
A liquid fluoride thorium reactor
would be a compact facility,

00:09:06.827 --> 00:09:08.769
very energy-efficient and safe,

00:09:08.793 --> 00:09:11.269
that would produce the energy
we need day and night,

00:09:11.293 --> 00:09:13.349
and without respect to weather conditions.

00:09:13.373 --> 00:09:16.347
In 2007, we used
five billion tons of coal,

00:09:16.371 --> 00:09:18.085
31 billion barrels of oil

00:09:18.109 --> 00:09:20.342
and five trillion cubic meters
of natural gas,

00:09:20.366 --> 00:09:23.444
along with 65,000 tons of uranium

00:09:23.468 --> 00:09:25.351
to produce the world's energy.

00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:27.314
With thorium, we could do the same thing

00:09:27.338 --> 00:09:30.574
with 7,000 tons of thorium
that could be mined at a single site.
