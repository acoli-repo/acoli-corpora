00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.614
and others have to run at as much as
150 atmospheres of pressure.

00:02:03.638 --> 00:02:05.131
There's no getting around this;

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:08.363
it's simply what you have to do
if you want to generate electricity

00:02:08.387 --> 00:02:09.795
using a water-cooled reactor.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.308
This means you have to build
a water-cooled reactor

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:13.491
as a pressure vessel,

00:02:13.515 --> 00:02:15.889
with steel walls
over 20 centimeters thick.

00:02:15.913 --> 00:02:18.175
If that sounds heavy,
that's because it is.

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:20.387
Things get a lot worse
if you have an accident

00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:22.484
where you lose pressure
inside the reactor.

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:25.346
If you have liquid water
at 300 degrees Celsius

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.043
and suddenly you depressurize it,

00:02:27.067 --> 00:02:28.857
it doesn't stay liquid for very long;

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:30.083
it flashes into steam.
