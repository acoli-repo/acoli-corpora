00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.519
They do not react with air and water.

00:04:30.543 --> 00:04:33.392
You have to heat them up
to about 400 degrees Celsius

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:34.570
to get them to melt.

00:04:34.594 --> 00:04:37.237
But that's actually perfect
for trying to generate power

00:04:37.261 --> 00:04:38.415
in a nuclear reactor.

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:39.600
Here's the real magic:

00:04:39.624 --> 00:04:41.903
they don't have to operate
at high pressure.

00:04:41.927 --> 00:04:44.058
And that makes the biggest
difference of all.

00:04:44.082 --> 00:04:47.550
This means they don't have to be
in heavy, thick steel pressure vessels,

00:04:47.574 --> 00:04:49.502
they don't have to use water for coolant

00:04:49.526 --> 00:04:51.155
and there's nothing in the reactor

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:53.899
that's going to make
a big change in density, like water.

00:04:53.923 --> 00:04:56.084
So the containment building
around the reactor

00:04:56.108 --> 00:04:57.967
can be much smaller and close-fitting.

00:04:57.991 --> 00:05:01.162
Unlike the solid fuels that can melt down
if you stop cooling them,
