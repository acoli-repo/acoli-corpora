Inside the drain tank, it's all configured
to maximize the transfer of heat,

00:05:33.303 --> 00:05:35.600
so as to keep the salt passively cooled

00:05:35.624 --> 00:05:37.496
as its heat load drops over time.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.177
In water-cooled reactors,

00:05:39.201 --> 00:05:41.466
you generally have to provide
power to the plant

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.178
to keep the water circulating
and to prevent a meltdown,

00:05:44.202 --> 00:05:45.621
as we saw in Japan.

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:48.885
But in this reactor,
if you lose the power to the reactor,

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.170
it shuts itself down all by itself,
without human intervention,

00:05:52.194 --> 00:05:54.814
and puts itself in a safe
and controlled configuration.

00:05:54.838 --> 00:05:56.822
Now, this was sounding pretty good to me,

00:05:56.846 --> 00:06:00.260
and I was excited about the potential
of using a liquid fluoride reactor
