Nearly everyone in the world
is part of some community,

00:00:03.309 --> 00:00:04.952
whether large or small.

00:00:04.976 --> 00:00:07.998
And all of these communities
have similar needs.

00:00:08.022 --> 00:00:09.202
They need light,

00:00:09.226 --> 00:00:10.390
they need heat

00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:11.760
they need air-conditioning.

00:00:11.784 --> 00:00:14.979
People can't function very well
when it's too hot or too cold.

00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:19.449
They need food to be grown or provided,
distributed and stored safely.

00:00:19.473 --> 00:00:23.553
They need waste products to be collected,
removed and processed.

00:00:23.577 --> 00:00:27.004
People in the community need to be able
to get from one place to another

00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:28.202
as quickly as possible.

00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:31.548
And a supply of energy is the basis
for all of these activities.
