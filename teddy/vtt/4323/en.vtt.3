00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:31.156
so I started trying to learn.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.536
Almost all of the nuclear power
we use on Earth today uses water

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.846
as a basic coolant.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.920
This has some advantages,
but it has a lot of disadvantages.

00:01:38.944 --> 00:01:42.542
If you want to generate electricity,
you have to get the water a lot hotter

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:43.732
than you normally can.

00:01:43.756 --> 00:01:47.255
At normal pressures, water will boil
at 100 degrees Celsius.

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:51.005
This isn't nearly hot enough
to generate electricity effectively.

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:54.320
So water-cooled reactors have to run
at much higher pressures

00:01:54.344 --> 00:01:55.836
than atmospheric pressure.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.955
Some water-cooled reactors run
at over 70 atmospheres of pressure,

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.614
and others have to run at as much as
150 atmospheres of pressure.
