00:04:57.991 --> 00:05:01.162
Unlike the solid fuels that can melt down
if you stop cooling them,

00:05:01.186 --> 00:05:03.401
these liquid fluoride fuels
are already melted,

00:05:03.425 --> 00:05:05.066
at a much, much lower temperature.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.381
In normal operation,
you have a little plug here

00:05:07.405 --> 00:05:09.121
at the bottom of the reactor vessel.

00:05:09.145 --> 00:05:11.745
This plug is made
out of a piece of frozen salt

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:13.795
that you've kept frozen
by blowing cool gas

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:15.209
over the outside of the pipe.

00:05:15.233 --> 00:05:17.874
If there's an emergency
and you lose all the power

00:05:17.898 --> 00:05:19.276
to your nuclear power plant,

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.980
the little blower stops blowing,

00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:22.792
the frozen plug of salt melts,

00:05:22.816 --> 00:05:25.180
and the liquid fluoride fuel
inside the reactor

00:05:25.204 --> 00:05:27.235
drains out of the vessel, through the line

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.369
and into another vessel
called a drain tank.

00:05:29.393 --> 00:05:33.279
Inside the drain tank, it's all configured
to maximize the transfer of heat,
