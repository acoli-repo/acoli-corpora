One day, I was at a friend's
office at work,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.297
and I noticed this book on the shelf,
"Fluid Fuel Reactors."

00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:06.782
I was interested
and asked him if I could borrow it.

00:04:06.806 --> 00:04:09.784
Inside that book, I learned
about research in the United States

00:04:09.808 --> 00:04:10.975
back in the 1950s,

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:13.556
into a kind of reactor
that wasn't based on solid fuel

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.751
or on water-cooling.

00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:17.440
It didn't have the problems
of the water-cooled reactor,

00:04:17.464 --> 00:04:19.213
and the reason why was pretty neat.

00:04:19.237 --> 00:04:22.448
It used a mixture of fluoride salts
as a nuclear fuel,

00:04:22.472 --> 00:04:25.891
specifically, the fluorides of lithium,
beryllium, uranium and thorium.

00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:28.306
Fluoride salts are remarkably
chemically stable.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.519
They do not react with air and water.
