00:02:57.584 --> 00:03:01.388
The reactors we have today
use uranium oxide as a fuel.

00:03:01.412 --> 00:03:03.776
It's a ceramic material
similar in performance

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.753
to the ceramics we use to make
coffee cups or cookware

00:03:06.777 --> 00:03:08.893
or the bricks we use to line fireplaces.

00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:10.178
They're chemically stable,

00:03:10.202 --> 00:03:12.408
but they're not very good
at transferring heat.

00:03:12.432 --> 00:03:14.459
If you lose pressure, you lose your water,

00:03:14.483 --> 00:03:16.082
and soon your fuel will melt down

00:03:16.106 --> 00:03:18.707
and release the radioactive
fission products within it.

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.836
Making solid nuclear fuel
is a complicated and expensive process.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.392
And we extract less than one percent
of the energy for the nuclear fuel

00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:27.572
before it can no longer
remain in the reactor.

00:03:27.596 --> 00:03:30.332
Water-cooled reactors have
another additional challenge:
