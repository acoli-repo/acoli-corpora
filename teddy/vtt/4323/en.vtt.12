00:05:56.846 --> 00:06:00.260
and I was excited about the potential
of using a liquid fluoride reactor

00:06:00.284 --> 00:06:01.609
to power a lunar community.

00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:04.662
But then I learned about thorium,
and the story got even better.

00:06:04.686 --> 00:06:06.809
Thorium is a naturally
occurring nuclear fuel

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:09.898
that is four times more common
in the Earth's crust than uranium.

00:06:09.922 --> 00:06:12.351
It can be used in liquid fluoride
thorium reactors

00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:15.958
to produce electrical energy, heat
and other valuable products.

00:06:15.982 --> 00:06:19.730
It's so energy-dense that you could hold
a lifetime supply of thorium energy

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:20.996
in the palm of your hand.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.568
Thorium is also common on the Moon
and easy to find.

00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:26.647
Here's an actual map of where
the lunar thorium is located.

00:06:26.671 --> 00:06:29.887
Thorium has an electromagnetic signature
that makes it easy to find,

00:06:29.911 --> 00:06:31.072
even from a spacecraft.
