00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:31.548
And a supply of energy is the basis
for all of these activities.

00:00:31.572 --> 00:00:34.902
Energy in the form of electricity
provides light and air-conditioning.

00:00:34.926 --> 00:00:36.900
Energy in the form of heat keeps us warm.

00:00:36.924 --> 00:00:39.970
And energy in chemical
form provides fertilizer;

00:00:39.994 --> 00:00:42.799
it drives farm machinery
and transportation energy.

00:00:42.823 --> 00:00:44.793
Now, I spent 10 years working at NASA.

00:00:44.817 --> 00:00:47.528
In the beginning of my time there in 2000,

00:00:47.552 --> 00:00:49.552
I was very interested in communities.

00:00:49.576 --> 00:00:52.211
But this is the kind of community
I was thinking of --

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:53.476
a lunar community

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.802
It had all of the same needs
as a community on Earth would have,

00:00:56.826 --> 00:00:59.378
but it had some very unique constraints.

00:00:59.402 --> 00:01:01.933
And we had to think about
how we would provide energy
