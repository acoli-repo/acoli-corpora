00:07:57.697 --> 00:08:01.156
and combining it with carbon
harvested from CO2 in the atmosphere,

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.712
making fuels like methanol,
ammonia, and dimethyl ether,

00:08:04.736 --> 00:08:07.271
which could be a direct replacement
for diesel fuels.

00:08:07.295 --> 00:08:10.455
Imagine carbon-neutral
gasoline and diesel,

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:12.922
sustainable and self-produced.

00:08:12.946 --> 00:08:14.301
Do we have enough thorium?

00:08:14.325 --> 00:08:15.480
Yes, we do.

00:08:15.504 --> 00:08:19.467
In fact, in the United States, we have
over 3,200 metric tons of thorium

00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:21.267
that was stockpiled 50 years ago

00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:23.838
and is currently buried
in a shallow trench in Nevada.

00:08:23.862 --> 00:08:26.103
This thorium, if used in LFTRs,

00:08:26.127 --> 00:08:29.766
could produce almost as much energy
as the United States uses in three years.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.993
And thorium is not
a rare substance, either.
