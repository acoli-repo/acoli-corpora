00:07:28.002 --> 00:07:30.636
Things could be very different
if we were using thorium.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.119
You see, in a LFTR, we could use thorium
about 200 times more efficiently

00:07:34.143 --> 00:07:35.584
than we're using uranium now.

00:07:35.608 --> 00:07:38.642
And because the LFTR is capable
of almost completely releasing

00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:39.828
the energy in thorium,

00:07:39.852 --> 00:07:43.946
this reduces the waste generated
over uranium by factors of hundreds,

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.580
and by factors of millions
over fossil fuels.

00:07:46.604 --> 00:07:49.751
We're still going to need liquid fuels
for vehicles and machinery,

00:07:49.775 --> 00:07:53.659
but we could generate these liquid fuels
from the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

00:07:53.683 --> 00:07:55.512
and from water, much like nature does.

00:07:55.536 --> 00:07:57.673
We could generate hydrogen
by splitting water

00:07:57.697 --> 00:08:01.156
and combining it with carbon
harvested from CO2 in the atmosphere,
