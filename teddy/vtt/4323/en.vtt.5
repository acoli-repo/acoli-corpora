00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:30.083
it flashes into steam.

00:02:30.107 --> 00:02:34.077
So water-cooled reactors are built
inside of big, thick concrete buildings

00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:35.529
called containment buildings,

00:02:35.553 --> 00:02:39.103
which are meant to hold all of the steam
that would come out of the reactor

00:02:39.127 --> 00:02:41.348
if you had an accident
where you lost pressure.

00:02:41.372 --> 00:02:45.097
Steam takes up about 1,000 times
more volume than liquid water,

00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:47.611
so the containment building
ends up being very large,

00:02:47.635 --> 00:02:49.361
relative to the size of the reactor.

00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:51.561
Another bad thing happens
if you lose pressure

00:02:51.585 --> 00:02:53.119
and your water flashes to steam.

00:02:53.143 --> 00:02:56.098
If you don't get emergency coolant
to the fuel in the reactor,

00:02:56.122 --> 00:02:57.560
it can overheat and melt.

00:02:57.584 --> 00:03:01.388
The reactors we have today
use uranium oxide as a fuel.
