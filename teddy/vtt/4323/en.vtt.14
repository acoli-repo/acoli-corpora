00:06:59.923 --> 00:07:02.733
why not a community on the Earth,
a community of the future,

00:07:02.757 --> 00:07:04.779
self-sustaining and energy-independent?

00:07:04.803 --> 00:07:07.968
The same energy generation
and recycling techniques

00:07:07.992 --> 00:07:11.038
that could have a powerful impact
on surviving on the Moon

00:07:11.062 --> 00:07:14.112
could also have a powerful impact
on surviving on the Earth.

00:07:14.136 --> 00:07:15.934
Right now, we're burning fossil fuels

00:07:15.958 --> 00:07:18.258
because they're easy to find
and because we can.

00:07:18.282 --> 00:07:21.999
Unfortunately, they're making some parts
of our planet look like the Moon.

00:07:22.023 --> 00:07:24.409
Using fossil fuels
entangles us in conflict

00:07:24.433 --> 00:07:26.041
in unstable regions of the world

00:07:26.065 --> 00:07:27.978
and costs money and lives.

00:07:28.002 --> 00:07:30.636
Things could be very different
if we were using thorium.
