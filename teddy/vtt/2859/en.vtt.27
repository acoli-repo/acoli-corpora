unless it is coupled with a sense of love
and compassion for their fellow beings.

00:13:32.708 --> 00:13:36.284
The two and a half alphabets
which form the word "प्रेम,"

00:13:36.308 --> 00:13:37.724
which means "love,"

00:13:37.748 --> 00:13:39.644
if you are able to understand that

00:13:39.668 --> 00:13:41.244
and practice it,

00:13:41.268 --> 00:13:44.468
that itself is enough
to enlighten mankind.

00:13:45.308 --> 00:13:47.188
So I truly believe the future "you"

00:13:48.148 --> 00:13:49.828

Otherwise it will cease to flourish.

00:13:53.628 --> 00:13:56.988
It will perish in its own self-absorption.

00:13:58.508 --> 00:13:59.948
So you may use your power
