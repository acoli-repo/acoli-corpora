00:06:27.028 --> 00:06:33.508
We had not bargained
for the village-like enclosure of thought,

00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:36.724
of judgment, of definition

00:06:36.748 --> 00:06:38.884
that flowed from the same place

00:06:38.908 --> 00:06:41.148
that freedom and revolution
was taking place in.

00:06:42.508 --> 00:06:44.270
Everything I said took a new meaning.

00:06:44.908 --> 00:06:46.868
Everything I did -- good, bad, ugly --

00:06:47.828 --> 00:06:51.164
was there for the world
to comment upon and judge.

00:06:51.188 --> 00:06:53.788
As a matter of fact,
everything I didn't say or do also

00:06:54.588 --> 00:06:55.788
met with the same fate.

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:57.908
Four years ago,

00:06:58.948 --> 00:07:02.908
my lovely wife Gauri and me
decided to have a third child.
