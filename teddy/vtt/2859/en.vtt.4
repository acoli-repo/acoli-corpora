00:01:58.948 --> 00:02:03.844
and I remember the driver of a neighbor
who was driving us to the hospital.

00:02:03.868 --> 00:02:06.684
He mumbled something
about "dead people don't tip so well"

00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:08.148
and walked away into the dark.

00:02:08.988 --> 00:02:10.884
And I was only 14 then,

00:02:10.908 --> 00:02:14.364
and I put my father's dead body
in the back seat of the car,

00:02:14.388 --> 00:02:15.604
and my mother besides me,

00:02:15.628 --> 00:02:18.204
I started driving back
from the hospital to the house.

00:02:18.228 --> 00:02:21.844
And in the middle of her quiet crying,
my mother looked at me and she said,

00:02:21.868 --> 00:02:23.668
"Son, when did you learn to drive?"

00:02:26.028 --> 00:02:29.284
And I thought about it
and realized, and I said to my mom,

00:02:29.308 --> 00:02:30.604
"Just now, Mom."
