00:05:26.828 --> 00:05:30.244
I'm sorry, France, and thank you,
France, for doing that.

00:05:30.268 --> 00:05:33.604
But much bigger than that,
I got to meet Angelina Jolie --

00:05:33.628 --> 00:05:36.364
(Laughter)

00:05:36.388 --> 00:05:37.884
for two and a half seconds.

00:05:37.908 --> 00:05:39.204
(Laughter)

00:05:39.228 --> 00:05:41.924
And I'm sure she also remembers
that encounter somewhere.

00:05:41.948 --> 00:05:43.164
OK, maybe not.

00:05:43.188 --> 00:05:46.724
And I sat next to Hannah Montana
on a round dinner table

00:05:46.748 --> 00:05:48.788
with her back towards me most of the time.

00:05:49.588 --> 00:05:51.828
Like I said, I was flying,
from Miley to Jolie,

00:05:52.748 --> 00:05:56.004
and humanity was soaring with me.

00:05:56.028 --> 00:05:58.708
We were both pretty much
flying off the handle, actually.

00:05:59.268 --> 00:06:00.988
And then you all know what happened.
