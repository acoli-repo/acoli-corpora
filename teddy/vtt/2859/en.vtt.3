00:01:29.948 --> 00:01:32.444
And my father was a freedom fighter.

00:01:32.468 --> 00:01:35.498
My mother was, well,
just a fighter like mothers are.

00:01:37.548 --> 00:01:40.564
And much like the original homo sapiens,

00:01:40.588 --> 00:01:42.228
we struggled to survive.

00:01:42.908 --> 00:01:45.044
When I was in my early 20s,

00:01:45.068 --> 00:01:46.804
I lost both my parents,

00:01:46.828 --> 00:01:50.164
which I must admit
seems a bit careless of me now,

00:01:50.188 --> 00:01:51.484
but --

00:01:51.508 --> 00:01:54.508
(Laughter)

00:01:57.028 --> 00:01:58.924
I do remember the night my father died,

00:01:58.948 --> 00:02:03.844
and I remember the driver of a neighbor
who was driving us to the hospital.
