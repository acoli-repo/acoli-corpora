00:00:59.778 --> 00:01:02.714
Naturally, it follows I'm going
to speak about the present me.

00:01:02.738 --> 00:01:05.058
(Laughter)

00:01:07.268 --> 00:01:10.044
Because I truly believe
that humanity is a lot like me.

00:01:10.068 --> 00:01:11.284
(Laughter)

00:01:11.308 --> 00:01:12.684
It is. It is.

00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:14.228
It's an aging movie star,

00:01:15.428 --> 00:01:18.004
grappling with all
the newness around itself,

00:01:18.028 --> 00:01:20.684
wondering whether
it got it right in the first place,

00:01:20.708 --> 00:01:22.724
and still trying to find a way

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:24.828
to keep on shining regardless.

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:29.068
I was born in a refugee colony
in the capital city of India, New Delhi.

00:01:29.948 --> 00:01:32.444
And my father was a freedom fighter.
