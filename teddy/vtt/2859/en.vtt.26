00:13:01.108 --> 00:13:02.764
(Poem ends)

00:13:02.788 --> 00:13:05.364
Which loosely translates
into that whatever --

00:13:05.388 --> 00:13:07.464
yeah, if you know Hindi,
please clap, yeah.

00:13:07.488 --> 00:13:08.924
(Applause)

00:13:08.948 --> 00:13:10.472
It's very difficult to remember.

00:13:11.428 --> 00:13:14.004
Which loosely translates
into actually saying

00:13:14.028 --> 00:13:16.484
that all the books of knowledge
that you might read

00:13:16.508 --> 00:13:19.404
and then go ahead
and impart your knowledge

00:13:19.428 --> 00:13:22.764
through innovation,
through creativity, through technology,

00:13:22.788 --> 00:13:25.924
but mankind will never be
the wiser about its future

00:13:25.948 --> 00:13:32.068
unless it is coupled with a sense of love
and compassion for their fellow beings.
