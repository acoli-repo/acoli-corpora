00:09:28.268 --> 00:09:30.844
but some of the responses I got
from those tweets

00:09:30.868 --> 00:09:34.204
were extremely confusing acronyms
which I didn't understand. You know?

00:09:34.228 --> 00:09:36.284
ROFL, LOL.

00:09:36.308 --> 00:09:40.604
"Adidas," somebody wrote back
to one of my more thought-provoking tweets

00:09:40.628 --> 00:09:42.964
and I was wondering
why would you name a sneaker,

00:09:42.988 --> 00:09:45.884
I mean, why would you write back
the name of a sneaker to me?

00:09:45.908 --> 00:09:48.764
And I asked my 16-year-old daughter,
and she enlightened me.

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:51.748
"Adidas" now means
"All day I dream about sex."

00:09:52.308 --> 00:09:54.564
(Laughter)

00:09:54.588 --> 00:09:55.884
Really.

00:09:55.908 --> 00:09:57.404
I didn't know if you know that.

00:09:57.428 --> 00:10:02.004
So I wrote back,
"WTF" in bold to Mr. Adidas,
