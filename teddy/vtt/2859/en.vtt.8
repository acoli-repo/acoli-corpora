00:03:57.988 --> 00:04:00.844
Most importantly, you were who you were

00:04:00.868 --> 00:04:02.708
and you said what you thought.

00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:04.644
Then in my late 20s,

00:04:04.668 --> 00:04:08.404
I shifted to the sprawling
metropolis of Mumbai,

00:04:08.428 --> 00:04:09.764
and my framework,

00:04:09.788 --> 00:04:13.084
like the newly industrialized
aspirational humanity,

00:04:13.108 --> 00:04:14.308
began to alter.

00:04:14.948 --> 00:04:17.548
In the urban rush for a new,
more embellished survival,

00:04:18.387 --> 00:04:20.404
things started to look a little different.

00:04:20.428 --> 00:04:23.228
I met people who had descended
from all over the world,

00:04:24.148 --> 00:04:27.364
faces, races, genders, money-lenders.

00:04:27.388 --> 00:04:29.508
Definitions became more and more fluid.
