00:12:30.508 --> 00:12:32.588
I've learned that whatever moves you,

00:12:33.268 --> 00:12:35.964
whatever urges you to create, to build,

00:12:35.988 --> 00:12:37.644
whatever keeps you from failing,

00:12:37.668 --> 00:12:39.924
whatever helps you survive,

00:12:39.948 --> 00:12:44.324
is perhaps the oldest and the simplest
emotion known to mankind,

00:12:44.348 --> 00:12:46.228
and that is love.

00:12:47.508 --> 00:12:50.404
A mystic poet from my land famously wrote,
