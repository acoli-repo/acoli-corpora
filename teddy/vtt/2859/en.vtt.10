00:04:58.188 --> 00:05:02.684
when supported by the resourcefulness
of this collective endeavor,

00:05:02.708 --> 00:05:04.548
catapulted me into superstardom.

00:05:05.148 --> 00:05:07.564
I started to feel that I had arrived,

00:05:07.588 --> 00:05:11.084
and generally, by the time I was 40,
I was really, really flying.

00:05:11.108 --> 00:05:12.364
I was all over the place.

00:05:12.388 --> 00:05:14.404
You know? I'd done 50 films by then

00:05:14.428 --> 00:05:16.028
and 200 songs,

00:05:16.788 --> 00:05:19.044
and I'd been knighted by the Malaysians.

00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:22.364
I had been given the highest civil honor
by the French government,

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:25.724
the title of which for the life of me
I can't pronounce even until now.

00:05:25.748 --> 00:05:26.804
(Laughter)

00:05:26.828 --> 00:05:30.244
I'm sorry, France, and thank you,
France, for doing that.
