00:00:30.068 --> 00:00:32.724
If you don't tell anyone,
I'm going to tell you I'm not,

00:00:32.748 --> 00:00:34.684
but I never let that assumption go away.

00:00:34.708 --> 00:00:35.724
(Laughter)

00:00:35.748 --> 00:00:37.364
I've also been made to understand

00:00:37.388 --> 00:00:39.844
there are lots of you here
who haven't seen my work,

00:00:39.868 --> 00:00:41.324
and I feel really sad for you.

00:00:41.348 --> 00:00:43.764
(Laughter)

00:00:43.788 --> 00:00:46.468
(Applause)

00:00:48.828 --> 00:00:52.164
That doesn't take away from the fact
that I'm completely self-obsessed,

00:00:52.188 --> 00:00:53.444
as a movie star should be.

00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:54.524
(Laughter)

00:00:54.548 --> 00:00:58.164
That's when my friends,
Chris and Juliet called me here

00:00:58.188 --> 00:00:59.754
to speak about the future "you."

00:00:59.778 --> 00:01:02.714
Naturally, it follows I'm going
to speak about the present me.
