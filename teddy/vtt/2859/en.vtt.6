You married the first girl that you dated,

00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:05.548
and you were a techie if you could fix
the carburetor in your car.

00:03:07.108 --> 00:03:10.588
I really thought that gay was
a sophisticated English word for happy.

00:03:11.828 --> 00:03:15.084
And Lesbian, of course, was the capital
of Portugal, as you all know.

00:03:15.108 --> 00:03:16.364
(Laughter)

00:03:16.388 --> 00:03:17.588
Where was I?

00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:23.044
We relied on systems

00:03:23.068 --> 00:03:26.764
created through the toil and sacrifice
of generations before

00:03:26.788 --> 00:03:28.244
to protect us,

00:03:28.268 --> 00:03:31.924
and we felt that governments
actually worked for our betterment.
