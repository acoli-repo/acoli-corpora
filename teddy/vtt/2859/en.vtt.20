So I wrote back,
"WTF" in bold to Mr. Adidas,

00:10:02.028 --> 00:10:06.468
thanking secretly that some acronyms
and things won't change at all.

00:10:07.188 --> 00:10:08.388
WTF.

00:10:10.188 --> 00:10:11.508
But here we are.

00:10:12.388 --> 00:10:14.084
I am 51 years old, like I told you,

00:10:14.108 --> 00:10:17.684
and mind-numbing acronyms notwithstanding,

00:10:17.708 --> 00:10:19.004
I just want to tell you

00:10:19.028 --> 00:10:22.244

for humanity to exist,

00:10:22.268 --> 00:10:23.884
it is now,

00:10:23.908 --> 00:10:26.148
because the present you is brave.

00:10:27.308 --> 00:10:28.644
The present you is hopeful.

00:10:28.668 --> 00:10:31.964
The present you
is innovative and resourceful,
