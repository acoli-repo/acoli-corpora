00:07:58.428 --> 00:08:00.124
I started to sell everything,

00:08:00.148 --> 00:08:03.044
from hair oil to diesel generators.

00:08:03.068 --> 00:08:05.084
Humanity was buying everything

00:08:05.108 --> 00:08:07.484
from crude oil to nuclear reactors.

00:08:07.508 --> 00:08:11.484
You know, I even tried
to get into a skintight superhero suit

00:08:11.508 --> 00:08:13.548
to reinvent myself.

00:08:14.268 --> 00:08:16.228
I must admit I failed miserably.

00:08:17.028 --> 00:08:22.044
And just an aside I want to say
on behalf of all the Batmen, Spider-Men

00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:24.164
and Supermen of the world,

00:08:24.188 --> 00:08:26.044
you have to commend them,

00:08:26.068 --> 00:08:28.844
because it really hurts in the crotch,
that superhero suit.

00:08:28.868 --> 00:08:29.924
(Laughter)

00:08:29.948 --> 00:08:32.428
Yeah, I'm being honest.
I need to tell you this here.
