00:00:00.496 --> 00:00:02.915
My dad's first lesson to me was,

00:00:02.915 --> 00:00:05.293
"Look people in the eye, mi hija,

00:00:05.334 --> 00:00:08.421
make sure people see you
and you see them."

00:00:08.963 --> 00:00:12.842
He has been a proud janitor,
farm worker, shoe shiner,

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:15.136
home builder and small business owner.

00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:17.972
He has seen the world
from so many different lenses

00:00:18.014 --> 00:00:19.932
and has lots of stories to tell.

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:23.895
But there's one I've never
been able to get out of my head.

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:26.981
A story when my dad was a young kid.

00:00:27.857 --> 00:00:32.278
He and my tio Milo knew exactly
when the trucks would come in.
