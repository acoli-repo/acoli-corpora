was not just that it fooled
so many people.

What was really striking to me
about fake news,

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.798
the phenomenon,

00:07:09.822 --> 00:07:14.877
is how quickly it itself became
the subject of knowledge polarization;

00:07:15.582 --> 00:07:19.261
so much so, that the very term --
the very term -- "fake news"

00:07:19.285 --> 00:07:22.689

00:07:23.367 --> 00:07:28.240
That's an example of the bad faith
towards the truth that I'm talking about.
