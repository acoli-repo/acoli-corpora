00:11:34.128 --> 00:11:36.181
But it also means something
more than that.

00:11:36.205 --> 00:11:40.655
It means seeing your worldview
as open to improvement

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:42.810
by the evidence and experience of others.

00:11:42.834 --> 00:11:44.883
Seeing your worldview
as open to improvement

00:11:44.907 --> 00:11:47.030

being open to change.

00:11:50.147 --> 00:11:52.545
It's more than just being open
to self-improvement.

00:11:52.569 --> 00:11:56.854
It means seeing your knowledge
as capable of enhancing

00:11:56.878 --> 00:11:59.404
or being enriched
by what others contribute.
