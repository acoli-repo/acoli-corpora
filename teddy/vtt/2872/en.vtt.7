00:03:36.267 --> 00:03:37.430
You might have noticed

00:03:37.454 --> 00:03:40.469
that our culture is having
something of a troubled relationship

00:03:40.493 --> 00:03:41.894
with that concept right now.

00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:46.274
It seems as if we disagree so much that,

00:03:46.298 --> 00:03:49.107
as one political commentator
put it not long ago,

00:03:49.131 --> 00:03:51.366
it's as if there are no facts anymore.

00:03:52.986 --> 00:03:57.208
But that thought is actually an expression

00:03:57.232 --> 00:04:01.241
of a sort of seductive line
of argument that's in the air.
