So, imagine that you had
your smartphone miniaturized

00:00:04.443 --> 00:00:06.803
and hooked up directly to your brain.

00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:09.604
If you had this sort of brain chip,

00:00:09.628 --> 00:00:12.159
you'd be able to upload
and download to the internet

00:00:12.183 --> 00:00:13.375
at the speed of thought.

00:00:13.986 --> 00:00:17.253
Accessing social media or Wikipedia
would be a lot like --

00:00:17.277 --> 00:00:18.917
well, from the inside at least --

00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:20.691
like consulting your own memory.

00:00:21.247 --> 00:00:24.445
It would be as easy
and as intimate as thinking.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.736
But would it make it easier
for you to know what's true?

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.721
Just because a way
of accessing information is faster
