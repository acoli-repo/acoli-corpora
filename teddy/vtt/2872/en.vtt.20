00:10:01.237 --> 00:10:05.611
Understanding why
a particular disease spreads,

00:10:05.635 --> 00:10:07.694
or how a mathematical proof works,

00:10:07.718 --> 00:10:09.731
or why your friend is depressed,

00:10:09.755 --> 00:10:12.220
involves more than just downloading.

00:10:13.396 --> 00:10:15.477
It's going to require, most likely,

00:10:15.501 --> 00:10:17.603
doing some work for yourself:

00:10:18.503 --> 00:10:20.343
having a little creative insight;

00:10:20.367 --> 00:10:21.633
using your imagination;

00:10:21.657 --> 00:10:22.975
getting out into the field;

00:10:22.999 --> 00:10:24.181
doing the experiment;

00:10:24.205 --> 00:10:25.476
working through the proof;

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.944
talking to someone.
