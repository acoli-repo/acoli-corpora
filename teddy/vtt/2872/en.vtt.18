I think in the early days of the internet,

00:09:00.274 --> 00:09:01.440
a lot of us thought

00:09:01.464 --> 00:09:05.274
that information technology
was always going to make it easier

00:09:05.298 --> 00:09:07.153
for us to know for ourselves,

00:09:07.177 --> 00:09:09.869
and of course in many ways, it has.

00:09:09.893 --> 00:09:13.731
But as the internet has become
more and more a part of our lives,

00:09:13.755 --> 00:09:15.714
our reliance on it, our use of it,

00:09:15.738 --> 00:09:18.298
has become often more passive.

00:09:18.322 --> 00:09:20.687
Much of what we know today we Google-know.

00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:24.994
We download prepackaged sets of facts

00:09:25.018 --> 00:09:28.830
and sort of shuffle them along
the assembly line of social media.

00:09:29.357 --> 00:09:30.787
Now, Google-knowing is useful
