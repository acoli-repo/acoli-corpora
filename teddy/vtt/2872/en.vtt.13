00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:31.590
live in bad faith,

00:06:31.614 --> 00:06:35.365
and take those bubbles
as the measure of reality.

00:06:36.595 --> 00:06:42.440
An example, I think, of how
this bad faith gets into our action

00:06:42.464 --> 00:06:47.249
is our reaction
to the phenomenon of fake news.

00:06:47.874 --> 00:06:50.804
The fake news that spread on the internet

00:06:50.828 --> 00:06:55.482
during the American
presidential election of 2016

00:06:55.506 --> 00:06:58.133
was designed to feed into our biases,

00:06:58.157 --> 00:07:00.271
designed to inflate our bubbles.
