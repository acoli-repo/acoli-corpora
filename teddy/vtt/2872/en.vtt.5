I think that fixing technology
is obviously really important,

00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:35.613
but I don't think technology alone,
fixing it, is going to solve the problem

of knowledge polarization.

00:02:53.953 --> 00:02:57.203
But we're also going to need help,
I think, from philosophy.

00:02:58.663 --> 00:03:02.191
Because to solve the problem
of knowledge polarization,
