00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.721
Just because a way
of accessing information is faster

00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:33.990
it doesn't mean it's more
reliable, of course,

00:00:34.014 --> 00:00:37.245
and it doesn't mean that we would all
interpret it the same way.

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.863
And it doesn't mean that you would be
any better at evaluating it.

00:00:40.887 --> 00:00:42.544
In fact, you might even be worse,

00:00:42.568 --> 00:00:45.350
because, you know, more data,
less time for evaluation.

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:49.773
Something like this is already
happening to us right now.

00:00:49.797 --> 00:00:53.655
We already carry a world of information
around in our pockets,

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.908
but it seems as if the more information
we share and access online,

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:00.734
the more difficult it can be for us
to tell the difference
