Now, Google-knowing is useful

00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:34.007
precisely because it involves
a sort of intellectual outsourcing.

00:09:34.031 --> 00:09:39.796
We offload our effort onto a network
of others and algorithms.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.827
And that allows us, of course,
to not clutter our minds

00:09:42.851 --> 00:09:44.290
with all sorts of facts.

00:09:44.314 --> 00:09:46.601
We can just download them
when we need them.

00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:48.007
And that's awesome.

00:09:49.348 --> 00:09:54.129
But there's a difference
between downloading a set of facts

00:09:54.809 --> 00:09:59.635
and really understanding how or why
those facts are as they are.
