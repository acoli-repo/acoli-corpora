00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:00.734
the more difficult it can be for us
to tell the difference

00:01:00.758 --> 00:01:02.875
between what's real and what's fake.

00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:07.445
It's as if we know more
but understand less.

00:01:08.152 --> 00:01:11.089
Now, it's a feature
of modern life, I suppose,

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:15.101
that large swaths of the public
live in isolated information bubbles.

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:20.503
We're polarized: not just over values,
but over the facts.

00:01:20.527 --> 00:01:24.124
One reason for that is, the data
analytics that drive the internet

00:01:24.148 --> 00:01:26.547
get us not just more information,

00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:28.757
but more of the information that we want.

00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:31.171
