00:04:31.173 --> 00:04:34.169
That's not a new philosophical thought --

00:04:34.193 --> 00:04:36.041
skepticism about truth.

00:04:37.332 --> 00:04:40.213
During the end of the last century,
as some of you know,

00:04:40.237 --> 00:04:42.531
it was very popular in certain
academic circles.

00:04:43.317 --> 00:04:48.450
But it really goes back all the way
to the Greek philosopher Protagoras,

00:04:48.474 --> 00:04:49.800
if not farther back.

00:04:50.252 --> 00:04:52.701
Protagoras said that objective
truth was an illusion

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:55.632
because "man is the measure
of all things."

00:04:55.656 --> 00:04:57.596
Man is the measure of all things.

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.992
That can seem like a bracing bit
of realpolitik to people,
