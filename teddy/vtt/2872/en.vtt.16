00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:07.617
into believing two plus two equals five.

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.375
What O'Brien says is the point,

00:08:13.486 --> 00:08:17.907
is that he wants to convince Smith
that whatever the party says is the truth,

00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:20.816
and the truth is whatever the party says.

00:08:21.484 --> 00:08:25.004
And what O'Brien knows
is that once this thought is accepted,

00:08:26.387 --> 00:08:28.941
critical dissent is impossible.
