00:02:58.663 --> 00:03:02.191
Because to solve the problem
of knowledge polarization,

00:03:03.522 --> 00:03:05.517
we're going to need to reconnect

00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:10.291
with one fundamental, philosophical idea:

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.616
that we live in a common reality.

00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:18.698
The idea of a common reality
is like, I suppose,

00:03:18.722 --> 00:03:20.285
a lot of philosophical concepts:

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:21.475
easy to state

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:24.134
but mysteriously difficult
to put into practice.

00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:26.308
To really accept it,

00:03:26.332 --> 00:03:28.549
I think we need to do three things,

00:03:28.573 --> 00:03:30.885
each of which is a challenge right now.
