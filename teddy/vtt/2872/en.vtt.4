of thinking that we know so much more,

00:02:00.568 --> 00:02:03.578
and yet not agreeing
on what it is we know.

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.831
So how are we going to solve
this problem of knowledge polarization?

00:02:08.855 --> 00:02:13.023
One obvious tactic is to try
to fix our technology,

00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:14.956
to redesign our digital platforms,

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.123
so as to make them less
susceptible to polarization.

00:02:18.884 --> 00:02:20.083
And I'm happy to report

00:02:20.107 --> 00:02:24.747
that many smart people at Google
and Facebook are working on just that.

00:02:24.771 --> 00:02:26.360
And these projects are vital.

00:02:27.837 --> 00:02:30.967
I think that fixing technology
is obviously really important,
