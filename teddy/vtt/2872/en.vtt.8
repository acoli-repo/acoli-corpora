00:03:57.232 --> 00:04:01.241
of a sort of seductive line
of argument that's in the air.

00:04:01.668 --> 00:04:02.936
It goes like this:

00:04:04.188 --> 00:04:07.039
we just can't step outside
of our own perspectives;

00:04:07.063 --> 00:04:09.505
we can't step outside of our biases.

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:11.002
Every time we try,

00:04:11.026 --> 00:04:14.611
we just get more information
from our perspective.

00:04:15.536 --> 00:04:17.786
So, this line of thought goes,

00:04:19.016 --> 00:04:22.778
we might as well admit
that objective truth is an illusion,

00:04:22.802 --> 00:04:23.956
or it doesn't matter,

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.126
because either we'll never
know what it is,

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.182
or it doesn't exist in the first place.
