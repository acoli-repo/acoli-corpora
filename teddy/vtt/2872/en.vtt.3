00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:31.171
Our online life is personalized;

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:32.925
everything from the ads we read

00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:35.539
to the news that comes down
our Facebook feed

00:01:35.563 --> 00:01:38.569
is tailored to satisfy our preferences.

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:41.085
And so while we get more information,

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.339
a lot of that information ends up
reflecting ourselves

00:01:44.363 --> 00:01:46.567
as much as it does reality.

00:01:47.198 --> 00:01:48.837
It ends up, I suppose,

00:01:49.691 --> 00:01:52.224
inflating our bubbles
rather than bursting them.

00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:55.460
And so maybe it's no surprise

00:01:55.484 --> 00:01:58.389
that we're in a situation,
a paradoxical situation,

00:01:58.413 --> 00:02:00.544
of thinking that we know so much more,
