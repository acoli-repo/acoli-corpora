Twenty years ago,

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:08.881
my family introduced a system
called "Friday Democracy Meetings."

00:00:09.812 --> 00:00:15.106
Every Friday at 7pm, my family
came together for an official meeting

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.090
to discuss the current family affairs.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.034
These meetings were facilitated
by one of my parents,

00:00:23.058 --> 00:00:25.527
and we even had a notetaker.

00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:27.666
These meetings had two rules.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.907
First, you are allowed
to speak open and freely.
