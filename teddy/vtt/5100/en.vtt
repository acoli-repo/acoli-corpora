A mosquito lands on your arm,

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:13.831
injects its chemicals into your skin, 
and begins to feed.

00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:18.103
You wouldn’t even know it was there,
if not for the red lump that appears,

00:00:18.103 --> 00:00:20.882
accompanied by a telltale itch.

00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:24.037
It’s a nuisance, but that bump 
is an important signal

00:00:24.037 --> 00:00:26.932
that you’re protected 
by your immune system,

00:00:26.932 --> 00:00:31.881
your body’s major safeguard 
against infection, illness, and disease.
