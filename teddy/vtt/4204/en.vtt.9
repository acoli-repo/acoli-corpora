00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.776
They have no train
to catch, no one to meet,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.416
they keep staring far into the horizon.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.376
Looking for a new life.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.656
From one such small station, my parents
boarded a train in search of a new life.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.136
Seaside, shrines, temples
and a small railway station

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.496
are horizons that are very important
to every city, town, district and village

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.536
because apart from the humdrum of life,
they ask us what more we can be.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.856
What new dreams can we dream?
