You must have seen those lovers holding hands,
hiding from the police sitting some place.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.010
These lovers are amazing,

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.456
no matter how strong the boundaries in every city,
they manage to create a sunset point!

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.776
And why not?

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.040
Where does our society give
us the liberty to love?

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.296
I studied historical monuments
but not for history.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.537
I went there and understood
these lovers ...

00:03:25.077 --> 00:03:27.416
sitting in dark corners.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.736
Which norms of society were they breaking,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.216
and what happiness were they seeking.
