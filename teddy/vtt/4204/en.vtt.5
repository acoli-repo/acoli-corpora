00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.776
what do people sit there
for hours and look at?

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.336
What are they looking for?

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.856
What is it that our society
is unable to give them?

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.320
The same society that is stuck
in so many questions.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.616
Who fell in love with whom?

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.816
Who ate what?

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.176
Who drank water from whose well?

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.936
Why do these questions crop
up repeatedly in our society?

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.520
Being a social scientist,
my job is to understand

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.000
the questions of the society 
and keep asking those.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.420
You must have seen those lovers holding hands,
hiding from the police sitting some place.
