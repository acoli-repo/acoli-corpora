They took a new path and opened
a new horizon for us.

00:02:00.058 --> 00:02:07.816
Horizons set us free and yet keep us tied.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.136
In my work I seek them out;

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.016
I try to understand 
the society and the people.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.936
I try to understand their dreams,
their desires and their joys.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.936
Like why they go to temples,
mosques and shrines?

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.520
Why do they fall in love?

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.776
Bandstand in Mumbai or the sunset
point in a small town,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.776
what do people sit there
for hours and look at?
