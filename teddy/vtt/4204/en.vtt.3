00:01:28.614 --> 00:01:30.736
When I grew up and went to college

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.616
I thought probably my life
has been different.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.976
My upbringing far from ordinary
has actually been special.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.776
Now how could I be both Hindu
and Muslim at the same time?

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.416
I did not have an answer to this question.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.336
Neither did my parents have the answer.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.696
They had tried to give us
a simple life, a decent life,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.750
away from the way society is steeped
in casteism and communalism.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.058
They took a new path and opened
a new horizon for us.
