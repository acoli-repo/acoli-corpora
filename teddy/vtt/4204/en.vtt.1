Sarover Zaidi: It is a little difficult
to explain who I am.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.936
And even tougher
than that is to explain what I do.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.136
My work and my identity
are intertwined.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.336
My interest in religion and philosophy
begins with the lives of my parents.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.120
My mother is a Hindu,
and my father a Muslim.
