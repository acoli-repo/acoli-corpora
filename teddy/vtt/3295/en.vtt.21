00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.812
we should just get rid
of fines altogether.

00:10:34.236 --> 00:10:36.591
Now, you might think
I've forgotten a money piece,

00:10:36.615 --> 00:10:39.130
where we need to finance libraries, right?

00:10:39.752 --> 00:10:41.767
But there's a couple of things to consider

00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:46.027
when we think about how fines function
in library budgets.

00:10:47.379 --> 00:10:52.372
The first is that fines have never been
a stable source of revenue.

00:10:52.396 --> 00:10:54.133
They've always fluctuated,

00:10:54.157 --> 00:10:58.841
and in fact, they've continued to go down
over the last few decades.

00:10:59.661 --> 00:11:03.282
When the recession hit, especially,
people's ability to pay was hit, as well.
