placid, calm, mellow,

00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:35.036
laid-back and, well, slothful!

00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:39.418
I am relaxed and tranquil,
and I like to live in peace.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.275
But I am not lazy.'

00:02:42.282 --> 00:02:44.648
Then the sloth yawned and said,

00:02:44.672 --> 00:02:46.139
'That's just how I am.

00:02:46.472 --> 00:02:50.653
I like to do things
slowly, slowly, slowly.'"

00:02:52.085 --> 00:02:57.093

00:02:57.117 --> 00:03:01.326
how Eric Carle used 20 different words
to get the same idea across to children.
