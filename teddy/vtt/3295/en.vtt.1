00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.099
Or the solution to a tricky problem.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.162
Libraries in general
have this wonderful reputation

00:00:34.186 --> 00:00:36.672
of really caring about our communities.

00:00:36.696 --> 00:00:39.636
We put out mission statements
and statements of purpose

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.093
that say that we connect
our community to the broader world.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.430
We engage minds,

00:00:46.075 --> 00:00:48.048
we create lifelong learners.

00:00:49.488 --> 00:00:52.225
And these ideals are really
important to us as libraries,

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:55.990
because we know the power they have
to create a better world.

00:00:56.434 --> 00:01:00.712
A more connected world,
a more engaged and empathetic world.
