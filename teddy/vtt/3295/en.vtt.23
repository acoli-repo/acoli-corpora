If you're looking at a large library
or a large library system,

00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:33.950
the dollar amount can be high.

00:11:33.974 --> 00:11:37.488
But it's an achievable cut
for most libraries to absorb.

00:11:38.768 --> 00:11:43.812
And finally, and maybe most importantly,
fines cost us money to collect.

00:11:44.395 --> 00:11:47.947
When you start to factor in
all of the ways that we collect fines,

00:11:47.971 --> 00:11:52.240
supplies like mailers that we send out
to remind people of their fines,

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:57.260
services, like collections
management services,

00:11:57.284 --> 00:12:00.530
even telephone and email notifications
can cost libraries money.
