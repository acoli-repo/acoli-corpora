There was a library in San Francisco
that did an amnesty day last year,

00:09:30.315 --> 00:09:33.837
and they welcomed back
5,000 users who had been blocked.

00:09:34.585 --> 00:09:39.298
That same day, they received
more than 700,000 items that were overdue.

00:09:40.392 --> 00:09:43.401
Among them was one book
that was 100 years overdue.

00:09:44.377 --> 00:09:47.964
So I know that sounds ridiculous,
but I know from experience

00:09:47.988 --> 00:09:50.300
that people will stay away
from the library

00:09:50.324 --> 00:09:52.561
rather than face
the authority of the librarian

00:09:52.585 --> 00:09:54.076
when they have late items.

00:09:54.521 --> 00:09:57.879
As Michael might have mentioned,
I've been a librarian for 15 years

00:09:57.903 --> 00:10:00.577
and my mom hasn't been
in a library in decades,
