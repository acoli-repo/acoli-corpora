Hello, friends.

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:06.267
I'm happy to see all of you here today.

00:00:06.746 --> 00:00:09.889
This is actually exactly what I say
to the people who visit us

00:00:09.913 --> 00:00:11.771
at the La Crosse Public Library.

00:00:11.795 --> 00:00:13.862
And I say it because I mean it.

00:00:14.668 --> 00:00:17.611
The children who come
into our library are my friends

00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:20.273
in that I care about their needs
and their futures.

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.485
I want them to be happy and successful.

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.228
I hope that they'll find great books
or a movie that delights them.

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.099
Or the solution to a tricky problem.
