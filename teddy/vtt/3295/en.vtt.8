00:03:59.482 --> 00:04:01.216
At the library, we provide programs

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.722
that are based on the five tenants
of early literacy:

00:04:03.746 --> 00:04:06.001
playing, singing, talking,
reading and writing.

00:04:06.936 --> 00:04:08.587
We offer programs for adults

00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:11.477
on computer classes
and job-skills training.

00:04:12.603 --> 00:04:13.803
Business start-ups.

00:04:14.703 --> 00:04:17.974
We do all of this great work
for our community members

00:04:17.998 --> 00:04:22.474
and at the same time, we counteract it
by charging fines and fees of our patrons.

00:04:23.895 --> 00:04:25.760
Today in La Crosse,

00:04:25.784 --> 00:04:28.992
10,000 of our users are unable
to check out library materials

00:04:29.016 --> 00:04:30.682
because of fines and fees.
