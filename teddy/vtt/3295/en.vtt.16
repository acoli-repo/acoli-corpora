00:07:59.387 --> 00:08:01.353
There are some libraries that really feel

00:08:01.377 --> 00:08:04.219
that it's our job
to teach people responsibility.

00:08:04.243 --> 00:08:07.260
And they haven't figured out
that there might be ways to do that

00:08:07.284 --> 00:08:08.839
that don't equate to dollars.

00:08:09.664 --> 00:08:13.434
There's also this idea that we share
the resources collectively in a community,

00:08:13.458 --> 00:08:15.061
and so we have to take turns.

00:08:15.417 --> 00:08:18.831
If I keep my "My Little Pony"
movie for too long,

00:08:18.855 --> 00:08:21.665
and somebody else
wants to watch it, it's not fair.

00:08:22.395 --> 00:08:24.156
And then, there's the money.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.670
Community members
often love their libraries,

00:08:26.694 --> 00:08:30.893
and they don't want us to not be able
to sustain the services we offer.
