00:01:27.581 --> 00:01:30.566
are hearing so many fewer words each day

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.776
that by the time they are three years old,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.838
there's this enormous disparity
in their learned language.

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:39.265
And that gap in words follows them
as they enter school,

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.260
and it results in later reading,
poorer reading skills,

00:01:43.284 --> 00:01:45.132
a lack of success overall.

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:48.545
Children need to hear words every day

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:51.339
and they need to hear
not just our day-to-day conversation,

00:01:51.363 --> 00:01:53.101
they have to hear rare words:

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:56.538
those outside the common lexicon
we share, of around 10,000.

00:01:57.887 --> 00:02:01.355
I'm going to read you a short snippet
