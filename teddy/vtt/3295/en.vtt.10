In fact, the Colorado State Library
was so worried about this,

00:05:00.375 --> 00:05:02.193
they published a white paper

00:05:02.217 --> 00:05:03.725
and they stated unequivocally

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:07.515
that it's the fear of fines
that keeps poor families out of libraries.

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:12.785
A colleague of mine took a ride
in a Lyft in Atlanta last year,

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:16.372
and he started chatting with his driver
about libraries, as we do.

00:05:16.976 --> 00:05:21.009
And she told him she grew up
visiting her local library, she loved it.

00:05:21.578 --> 00:05:24.459
But now that she's a parent
with three children of her own,

00:05:24.483 --> 00:05:27.298
there's no way she would allow them
to get a library card,

00:05:27.322 --> 00:05:29.889
because of the strict deadlines
libraries impose.
