WEBVTT

00:05:58.975 --> 00:06:01.308
We have these two disparate ideas.

00:06:01.332 --> 00:06:04.634
On the one hand,
we're champions of democracy

00:06:04.658 --> 00:06:10.011
and we claim that we're there so that
every citizen can educate themselves.

00:06:10.532 --> 00:06:12.814
We're advocates for the power
early literacy has

00:06:12.838 --> 00:06:16.215
to reduce that achievement gap
and eliminate the word gap.

00:06:17.215 --> 00:06:19.690
We tell people, "We're here to help you."

00:06:20.553 --> 00:06:21.950
On the other hand,

00:06:21.974 --> 00:06:24.863
if you're struggling financially,
and you make a mistake,

00:06:24.887 --> 00:06:27.783
the kind of mistake
that anyone in this room could make --

00:06:27.807 --> 00:06:31.712
your tote bag that belongs to the library
sits by your back door
