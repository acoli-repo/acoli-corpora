Basically, we fine
because we've always fined.

00:13:02.871 --> 00:13:07.973
So, the best option for your libraries
is to put their mission first.

00:13:08.776 --> 00:13:12.466
And they will do that
if their community members ask it of them.

00:13:12.918 --> 00:13:15.760
When you leave here,
I hope you'll visit your public library

00:13:15.784 --> 00:13:17.156
and talk to your librarians,

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.244
talk to your neighbors
and community members

00:13:19.268 --> 00:13:20.696
who serve on library boards.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.396
Tell them that you know
how important literacy is

00:13:24.673 --> 00:13:26.673
to everyone in your community.

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:31.023
That if our libraries
are truly for everyone,
