A more connected world,
a more engaged and empathetic world.

00:01:02.224 --> 00:01:04.898
Books have power, information has power.

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:07.152
And for the powerless in our communities,

00:01:07.176 --> 00:01:10.224
being able to connect to that
is even more important.

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:14.045
In 1995, Betty Hart and Todd Risley

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:16.712
published a study that found
that working class families

00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:18.700
and those being served by welfare

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:22.776
experience what we now refer to
as the "30 million word gap."

00:01:23.947 --> 00:01:27.557
Essentially, what they learned
is that children in these families

00:01:27.581 --> 00:01:30.566
are hearing so many fewer words each day
