00:00:07.704 --> 00:00:11.871
In the 20th century, most vaccines took
well over a decade

00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:14.413
to research, test, and produce.

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:19.121
But the vaccines for COVID-19 cleared 
the threshold for emergency use

00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:21.163
in less than 11 months.

00:00:21.538 --> 00:00:24.996
The secret behind this speed 
is a medical technology

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:27.329
that’s been developing for decades:

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.288
the mRNA vaccine.

00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:33.662
This new treatment uses our body’s 
existing cellular machinery
