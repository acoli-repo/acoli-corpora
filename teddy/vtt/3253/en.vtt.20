00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.616
to other countries,

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.400
and greenhouse gas emissions
simply don't have a passport.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.416
So when we're trying
to evaluate this question

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.536
of whether or not China
is actually leading,

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:11.120
we can see it's still
very much an open debate.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.656
But time is running out.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.136
I've studied the climate models,
and the outlook is not good.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.696
We still have a gap
between current policies

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.440
and what needs to happen if we want
to avoid dangerous climate change.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.776
Leadership is what we desperately need,

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.296
but it's not coming
from the US, for example.
