00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.296
but it's not coming
from the US, for example.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.336
The US administration last June
announced its intent

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.976
to withdraw from
the Paris Climate Agreement,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.440
so now people are looking towards China
to fill that leadership void.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.416
So China is very much in the driver's seat

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.760
determining our global
environmental future.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.816
What they do on carbon trading,

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.280
on clean energy, on air pollution,

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.280
we can learn many lessons.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.216
One of those lessons is that clean energy
is not just good for the environment,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.560
it can save lives
by reducing air pollution.
