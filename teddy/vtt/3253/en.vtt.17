00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.280
that tell a more cautionary tale.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.976
Sometimes, solutions can move too fast

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.240
and outpace demand.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:38.360
And of course,
coal is still king in China,

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.400
at least for now.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.056
So why should we care about
what China is doing on the environment?

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.136
Well, what China does at home
on the environment

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.896
can have global implications
for the rest of us.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.856
To borrow a line from Chai Jing,

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.736
we're all under the same dome,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.416
and air pollution that originates in China

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.536
can travel beyond its borders

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.840
and affect populations
as far away as those in North America.
