00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.016
In fact, they crushed their 2020 target

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.496
of installing 105 gigawatts
of solar power.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.856
This is after the government
already revised upwards

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.536
several times its solar energy target

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.720
between 2009 and 2015.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.296
Last year, in seven months alone,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.016
China was able to install
a whopping 35 gigawatts of solar power.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.776
This is more than half
of what the US has combined in total

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.120
and China did this
in just seven months alone.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.136
We can verify this remarkable growth
in solar power from space,
