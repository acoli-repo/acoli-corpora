00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.136
We can verify this remarkable growth
in solar power from space,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.840
like the startup SpaceKnow
has done in this slide.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.576
By 2020, China is on track to generate
Germany's entire electricity consumption

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.040
from just wind and solar power alone.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.960
It's pretty darn remarkable.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.536
And we see some evidence now

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.696
that China's efforts on clean energy

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.816
is actually having an effect,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.816
not just on air pollution reduction,

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.536
but also on global climate change,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.070
where China has the world's
largest carbon footprint.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.016
If we look at some of the data,
we can see that China's coal consumption
