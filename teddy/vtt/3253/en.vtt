00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.080
When is seeing not believing?

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.656
A couple years ago, my friend
sent me this photo from Ürümqi,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.776
which is the capital of Xinjiang
province in northwest China.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.136
On this particular day,
she couldn't believe her eyes.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.400
Checking the quality of the air outside
using this app on her iPad,

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.296
the numbers were telling her
the air quality was good,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.160
one on a scale of 500.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.840
But when she looked outside,
she saw something much different.
