00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.480
and that's largely because
the data are still being determined.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.136
At the end of last year,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.336
after roughly three years
of pretty steady global carbon emissions,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.896
scientific projections suggest

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.776
that global emissions
may be on the rise again

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.936
and that could be due to increases
in China's fossil fuel consumptions,

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.216
so they may not have reached
that peak that I showed earlier.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.856
But of course, the statistics
and the data are still murky

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.056
and that's because China regularly revises
its coal statistics after the fact.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.576
Actually, it's funny,
