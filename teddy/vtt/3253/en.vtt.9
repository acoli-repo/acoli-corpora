00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.176
has decided since 2014
to wage a war on coal,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.456
shutting down small coal mines,

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.016
setting limits on coal consumption,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.440
even canceling an Australia's worth
of coal-fired power plants.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.256
They've also been making
enormous investments

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.536
when it comes to clean
and renewable energy,

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.496
like hydropower, wind and solar,

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.416
and the pace and the scale
of this transformation

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.296
has been absolutely mind-blowing.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.736
Let me give you a couple of statistics
to show you what I mean.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.376
China leads the world
when it comes to hydropower,

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.040
with a third of total capacity.
