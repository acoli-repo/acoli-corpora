00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.976
At that time, PM2.5 data
was considered too politically sensitive

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.696
and so the government
was keeping it secret,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.496
but citizens were becoming aware
of its harmful human health effects,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.616
and they were demanding
greater transparency

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.096
on the part of the government.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.296
I actually started to see some of this
growing evolution and awareness myself

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.800
cropping up all over China.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.456
Department stores, for example,
started to market these air purifiers

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.040
that could filter out harmful PM2.5.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.136
Citizens were also adopting PM2.5
as the title of musical festivals.
