found that in the last 15 years,

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.816
China has invested in more
than 240 coal-fired power plants

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.936
in more than 68 countries

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.736
affiliated with the One Belt,
One Road Initiative.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.896
That's more than a quarter of China's
own domestic coal-fired capacity

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.736
that is exported abroad.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.896
So we can see that even though
China is cleaning up at home,

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.096

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.616
to other countries,
