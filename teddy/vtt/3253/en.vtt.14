00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.720
air pollution has fallen
by as much as 30 percent.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.736
And this reduction in air pollution
is actually leading people

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.736
to live longer lives in China,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.760
on average two and a half years more
than they would have in 2013.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.656
In yellow, we can see
the cities that have experienced

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.633
the greatest improvements in air quality.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.496
But of course, as I mentioned
at the beginning of this talk,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.536
we have to temper some of this optimism

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.736
with a healthy dose of caution,

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.480
and that's largely because
the data are still being determined.
