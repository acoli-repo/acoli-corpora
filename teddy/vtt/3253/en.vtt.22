00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.560
it can save lives
by reducing air pollution.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.160
It's also good for the economy.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.136
We can see that last year,

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.496
China was responsible
for 30 percent of the global growth

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.896
in green jobs.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.400
The US? Only six.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.216
So the picture that I just painted for you

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.416
hopefully seems much different

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.576
from those murky,
foggy air quality statistics

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.056
to a much clearer picture
of China's clean energy.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.016
And even though China
is headed in the right direction,

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.760
we know that there's still
a very long road ahead.
