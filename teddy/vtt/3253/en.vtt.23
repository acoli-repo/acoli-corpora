00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.240
So let me ask you once more:
Is seeing believing?

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.816
Can we trust the data and the statistics

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.096
that show that China's
air quality is coming down

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.360
and that its war on coal
is actually having an effect?

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.856
Well, let's take a look
at some of the latest satellite images

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.240
of China's solar power installations.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.200
I want you to look
very closely at this image.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.640
Can you see?

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.336
The proof may just be in the pandas.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.576
Thank you so much.
