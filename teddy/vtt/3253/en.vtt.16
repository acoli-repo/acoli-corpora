Actually, it's funny,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.296
since I've been here I've been
having a debate on Twitter

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.856
with other climate modelers,

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.376
trying to figure out
whether China's carbon emissions

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.080
have gone up, gone down or whether
they're staying relatively stable.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.720
And of course, China is still
a rapidly developing country.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.856
It's still experimenting
with a range of policies,

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.496
like dockless bike sharing,

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.760
which has been hailed as a possible
sustainable transport solution.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.336
But then we have images
of this bicycle graveyard

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.280
that tell a more cautionary tale.
