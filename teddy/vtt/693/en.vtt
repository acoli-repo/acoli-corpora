00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.536
Here's my thing.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.760
Hold on. There I go. Hey.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.286
I want to start today --
talk about the structure of a polypeptide.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.656
(Laughter)

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.856
I get a lot of people asking me,
in terms of "Lost," you know,

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.336
"What the hell's that island?"

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.296
You know, it's usually followed by,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.496
"No, seriously,
what the hell is that island?"

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.776
Why so many mysteries?

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.160
What is it about mystery
that I seem to be drawn to?

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.456
And I was thinking about this,
what to talk about at TED.
