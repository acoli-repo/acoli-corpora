00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And we do something different

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
than what we did in the past;

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We use CNC to make scaffolding

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
to train semi-epithetic matter, plants,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
into a specific geometry

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It fits into the environment. It is the environment.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It is the landscape, right?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And you can have a hundred million of these homes,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and it's great because they suck carbon.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
They're perfect.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You can have 100 million families, or take things out of the suburbs,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
because these are homes that are a part of the environment.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Imagine pre-growing a village --
