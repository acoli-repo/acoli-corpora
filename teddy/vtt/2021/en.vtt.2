00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Imagine pre-growing a village --

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
it takes about seven to 10 years --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and everything is green.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So not only do we do the veggie house,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
we also do the in-vitro meat habitat,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
where, as an architecture office, we're for the first of its kind

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
to put in a molecular cell biology lab

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and start experimenting with regenerative medicine

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and tissue engineering

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and start thinking about what the future would be

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
if architecture and biology became one.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So we've been doing this for a couple of years, and that's our lab.
