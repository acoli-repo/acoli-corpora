00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So we've been doing this for a couple of years, and that's our lab.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And what we do is we grow

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
extracellular matrix from pigs.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We use a modified inkjet printer,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and we print geometry.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
like, you know, shoes, leather belts,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
handbags, etc.,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
where no sentient creature is harmed.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It's victimless. It's meat from a test tube.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So our theory is that eventually

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
we should be doing this with homes.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So here is a typical stud wall,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
an architectural construction,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and this is a section
