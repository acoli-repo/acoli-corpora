WEBVTT

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and this is a section

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
of our proposal for a meat house,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
cilia for dealing with wind loads

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
(Laughter)

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And we know it's incredibly ugly.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
but we kind of chose this shape.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And there it is kind of grown, at least one particular section of it.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We had a big show in Prague,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
so religion can confront the house of meat.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
That's why we grow homes. Thanks very much.
