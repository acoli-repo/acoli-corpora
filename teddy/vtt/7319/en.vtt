00:00:00.756 --> 00:00:03.476
Iâ€™m going to start
today with a question.

00:00:03.516 --> 00:00:06.396
In other contexts,
perhaps, a risky question,

00:00:06.396 --> 00:00:09.476
not one you would expect
from somebody in my position

00:00:09.516 --> 00:00:12.116
in a talk about climate change.

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:13.836
But it's important.

00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:16.236
Does size matter?

00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:17.276
(Laughter)

00:00:17.276 --> 00:00:20.836
My answer, perhaps also unexpected,

00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:24.316
is that no, it really, really doesn't.

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:25.396
(Laughter)

00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:26.916
And Scotland --

00:00:26.956 --> 00:00:28.836
(Applause)

00:00:28.876 --> 00:00:31.316
Scotland is proving that.
