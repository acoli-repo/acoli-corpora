00:00:07.746 --> 00:00:09.579
Here in this abundant forest,

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:13.413
Malassezia is equipped with everything 
it could ever need.

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:16.288
Feasting constantly, it’s in paradise.

00:00:16.288 --> 00:00:18.454
But wait— what’s this?

00:00:18.454 --> 00:00:23.954
In fact, Malassezia is a type of yeast 
that lives and dines

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:26.038
on all of our scalps.

00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:31.454
And in about half of the human population,
its activity causes dandruff.
