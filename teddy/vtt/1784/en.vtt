"People do stupid things.

00:00:02.996 --> 00:00:04.996
That's what spreads HIV."

00:00:04.996 --> 00:00:06.996
This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper,

00:00:06.996 --> 00:00:08.996
The Guardian, not that long ago.

00:00:08.996 --> 00:00:11.996
I'm curious, show of hands, who agrees with it?

00:00:13.996 --> 00:00:15.996
Well, one or two brave souls.

00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:18.996
This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist

00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:20.996
who's been in field of HIV for 15 years,

00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:22.996
worked on four continents,

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:24.996
and you're looking at her.

00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:26.996
And I am now going to argue

00:00:26.996 --> 00:00:28.996
that this is only half true.

00:00:28.996 --> 00:00:31.996
People do get HIV because they do stupid things,
