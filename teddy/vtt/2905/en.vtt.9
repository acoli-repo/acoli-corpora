00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.574
I began to doubt myself,
to doubt my mental health.

00:04:33.042 --> 00:04:36.015
And with doubt came desperation,

00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:38.839
and with desperation came depression.

00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:42.745
I was suffering notorious
behavioral changes

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:46.396
and it wasn't just paranoia
in moments of panic.

00:04:47.149 --> 00:04:49.911
It was distrust,

00:04:50.872 --> 00:04:52.122
it was hatred,

00:04:52.896 --> 00:04:54.817
and it was also the urge to kill.

00:04:55.754 --> 00:04:58.021
This, I realized

00:04:58.045 --> 00:05:02.606
when they had me
chained by the neck to a tree.
