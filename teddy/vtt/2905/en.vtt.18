00:08:53.951 --> 00:09:00.612
beyond fear was the need
to defend my identity,

00:09:00.636 --> 00:09:04.183
to not let them turn me into
a thing or a number.

00:09:04.207 --> 00:09:05.777
That was one of the principles:

00:09:06.318 --> 00:09:08.318
to defend

00:09:09.596 --> 00:09:12.036
what I considered to be human dignity.

00:09:13.457 --> 00:09:15.360
But make no mistake:

00:09:15.384 --> 00:09:17.384
the guerrillas had it all

00:09:18.714 --> 00:09:20.361
very well analyzed --

00:09:20.385 --> 00:09:22.576
they had been kidnapping for years,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.077
and they had developed a technique

00:09:27.045 --> 00:09:28.650
to break us,

00:09:28.674 --> 00:09:30.434
to defeat us, to divide us.
