00:06:29.585 --> 00:06:31.689
"I'm not going to become one of them.

00:06:31.713 --> 00:06:33.713
I'm not going to become an assassin.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.968
I still have enough freedom

00:06:40.936 --> 00:06:42.345
to decide

00:06:43.507 --> 00:06:44.901
who I want to be."

00:06:48.012 --> 00:06:49.825
That's when I learned that fear

00:06:52.314 --> 00:06:54.314
brought me face to face with myself.

00:06:55.227 --> 00:06:56.410
It forced me

00:06:57.392 --> 00:06:59.854
to align my energies,

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:02.446
to align my meridians.
