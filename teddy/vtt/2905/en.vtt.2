00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.961
I had to send my very young children
out of the country one morning,

00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:10.147
hidden, all the way to the airport,
in the French ambassador's armored car.

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:11.985
Days later,

00:01:12.922 --> 00:01:15.545
I was the victim of an attack,
but emerged unharmed.

00:01:17.124 --> 00:01:18.447
The following year,

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:22.822
the Colombian people elected me
with the highest number of votes.

00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:27.418
I thought people applauded me
because I was brave.

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:30.531
I, too, thought I was brave.
