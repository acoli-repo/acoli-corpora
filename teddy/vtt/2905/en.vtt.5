00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:30.202
Meanwhile, one of his men
stepped on an antipersonnel mine

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.008
and flew through the air.

00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:35.754
He landed, sitting upright,

00:02:36.436 --> 00:02:38.085
right in front of me.

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.109
We made eye contact

00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:43.370
and it was then
that the young man understood:

00:02:44.426 --> 00:02:46.909
his rubber boot with his leg still in it

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:48.378
had landed far away.

00:02:49.924 --> 00:02:51.114
(Sighs)

00:02:53.003 --> 00:02:54.234
He started

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:59.122
screaming like crazy.
