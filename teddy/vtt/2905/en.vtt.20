00:09:56.117 --> 00:10:00.707
with the hum of millions of bugs --

00:10:00.731 --> 00:10:02.936
majiña ants, bullet ants.

00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:06.951
I didn't stop scratching a single day
while I was in the jungle.

00:10:09.212 --> 00:10:13.799
And of course, there were tarantulas,
scorpions, anacondas ...

00:10:13.823 --> 00:10:18.026
I once came face to face
with a 24-foot long anaconda

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.204
that could have swallowed me in one bite.

00:10:20.228 --> 00:10:21.410
Jaguars ...

00:10:22.101 --> 00:10:24.101
But I want to tell you

00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:28.172
that none of these animals
did us as much harm

00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:30.238
as the human beings.
