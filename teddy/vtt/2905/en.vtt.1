00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:31.336
And when I entered into
Colombian politics,

00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:34.926
I thought I'd be able
to withstand any temperature.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.121
I wanted to end corruption;

00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:41.324
I wanted to cut ties between politicians
and drug traffickers.

00:00:41.348 --> 00:00:44.006
The first time I was elected,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.713
it was because I called out, by name,

00:00:46.737 --> 00:00:49.758
corrupt and untouchable politicians.

00:00:50.352 --> 00:00:52.698
I also called out the president

00:00:53.568 --> 00:00:56.478
for his ties to the cartels.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.767
That's when the threats started.
