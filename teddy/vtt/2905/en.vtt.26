00:12:58.109 --> 00:13:00.437
was a police officer

00:13:00.461 --> 00:13:02.881
who had been a hostage
for more than eight years.

00:13:03.565 --> 00:13:07.471
He was famous for being
the biggest scaredy-cat of us all.

00:13:10.343 --> 00:13:13.098
But Pincho -- I called him "Pincho" --

00:13:13.122 --> 00:13:17.777
Pincho decided that he wanted to escape.

00:13:18.372 --> 00:13:19.735
And he asked me to help him.

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:23.264
By that point, I basically had
a master's degree in escape attempts.

00:13:23.288 --> 00:13:24.713
(Laughter)

00:13:25.192 --> 00:13:26.424
So

00:13:28.194 --> 00:13:29.929
we got started but we had a delay,

00:13:29.953 --> 00:13:32.612
because first, Pincho
had to learn how to swim.
