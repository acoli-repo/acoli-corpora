00:01:59.981 --> 00:02:02.069
That creates a low-pressure zone

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.506
that pulls dissolved gases 
out of the synovial fluid,

00:02:06.506 --> 00:02:09.287
just like the carbon dioxide 
that fizzes out of soda

00:02:09.287 --> 00:02:11.481
when you twist open the cap.

00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:17.258
Inside the joint, the escaping gases 
form a bubble with a pop.

00:02:17.258 --> 00:02:19.454
But the bubble doesn't last long.

00:02:19.454 --> 00:02:23.938
The surrounding fluid presses on it
until it finally collapses.

00:02:23.938 --> 00:02:27.636
The bubble's gases scatter 
throughout the synovial cavity

00:02:27.636 --> 00:02:32.853
and slowly dissolve back into the fluid
over the course of about twenty minutes,
