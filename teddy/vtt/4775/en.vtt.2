00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:01.006
All these joints are synovial joints,

00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:03.672
and they're the most flexible 
ones in your body.

00:01:03.672 --> 00:01:07.399
The space between the two bones
is filled with a viscous liquid,

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.858
synovial fluid, which contains long,
lubricating molecules,

00:01:11.858 --> 00:01:15.489
like hyaluronic acid and lubricin.

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:18.985
Synovial fluid is more or less
the texture of egg yolk

00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:21.938
and its primary purpose 
is to cushion the bones

00:01:21.938 --> 00:01:24.679
and help them glide past each other.

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:26.885
It also contains phagocytic cells

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:32.379
that help clean up any bone or cartilage
debris that ends up in the joint.
