00:03:27.402 --> 00:03:30.369
For this selfless act 
of devotion to science,

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:33.505
Dr. Unger received an Ig Nobel Prize,

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:37.305
a parody of the Nobel Prize
that recognizes wacky,

00:03:37.305 --> 00:03:41.729
but weirdly fascinating,
scientific accomplishments.

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:47.211
Unger wrote that his results should prompt
investigation into other parental beliefs,

00:03:47.211 --> 00:03:50.007
like the importance of eating spinach.

00:03:50.007 --> 00:03:51.901
The jury's still out on that one.

00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:53.478
As for knuckle-cracking,

00:03:53.478 --> 00:03:56.532
one study suggests 
that all that joint stretching

00:03:56.532 --> 00:03:59.561
and bubble bursting
can cause your hands to swell

00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:01.282
and weaken your grip.
