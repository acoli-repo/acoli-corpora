00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:32.379
that help clean up any bone or cartilage
debris that ends up in the joint.

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:34.944
But the reason it's important 
for knuckle cracking

00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:37.129
is that, like other fluids in your body,

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:41.143
it contains lots of dissolved 
gas molecules.

00:01:41.143 --> 00:01:44.517
Knuckle-crackers know that 
to get that satisfying pop,

00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:48.107
you stretch the joint farther
than it normally goes

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:51.148
by bending your fingers 
backwards, for example.

00:01:51.148 --> 00:01:54.077
When you do that, 
the bones move away from each other.

00:01:54.077 --> 00:01:56.486
The space between bones gets bigger,

00:01:56.486 --> 00:01:59.981
but the amount of synovial fluid 
stays constant.

00:01:59.981 --> 00:02:02.069
That creates a low-pressure zone
