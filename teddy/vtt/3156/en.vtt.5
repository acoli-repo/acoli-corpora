00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:30.984
which is the execution phase.

00:02:31.008 --> 00:02:33.633
The execution phase is when
we get to build this thing,

00:02:33.657 --> 00:02:38.086
and when this conversation goes
from a few people to a few hundred people

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.780
now translating this idea.

00:02:39.804 --> 00:02:41.903
We put it in this beautiful little thing,

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:44.786
put it in the "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
super-sizer machine

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.113
and blow it up full-scale,

00:02:46.137 --> 00:02:47.939
and we never know if we did it right

00:02:47.963 --> 00:02:50.798
until we show up onstage and go,
"Is it OK? Is it OK?"

00:02:50.822 --> 00:02:52.021
Here's the thing:

00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:53.452
you don't have to be Lin,

00:02:53.476 --> 00:02:56.791
you don't have to have a book
that you want to turn into a show

00:02:56.815 --> 00:02:58.641
in order to do this in your real life.

00:02:58.665 --> 00:03:01.922
You're already starring in a show,
by the way. It's called your life.
