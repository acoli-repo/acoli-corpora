00:06:00.246 --> 00:06:04.030
The architecture and the furniture
and everything come to life,

00:06:04.054 --> 00:06:06.808
but nothing more important
than those stairs.

00:06:06.832 --> 00:06:09.119
Those stairs are 12 inches high,

00:06:09.143 --> 00:06:11.868
so when Pee-Wee clomps
up and down those stairs,

00:06:11.892 --> 00:06:14.075
he interacts with them like a kid.

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:16.319
You can't fake that kind of interaction,

00:06:16.343 --> 00:06:21.109
and that's the exact opposite
of what we ask people in opera to do.

00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:23.721
In opera, we shrink those stairs

00:06:23.745 --> 00:06:28.118
so that our main characters
can glide up and down effortlessly

00:06:28.142 --> 00:06:30.054
without ever breaking their voice.
