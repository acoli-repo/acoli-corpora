and a couple of little tricks,
as I said, I'm going to tell you,

00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:32.978

It's important to remember that,
because when we design the world for you,

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:58.090
It tells you that emotion
is going to become light and color.

00:03:58.114 --> 00:04:02.218
A good example of that light and color
