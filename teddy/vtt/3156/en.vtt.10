00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:03.850
So think about that emotion, the one I had
you file away in your mental Rolodex.

00:05:03.874 --> 00:05:05.027
What color is it?

00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:08.603
Where in your wardrobe does it exist,
and where in your home does it exist?

00:05:08.627 --> 00:05:10.508
When we design the show for you,

00:05:10.532 --> 00:05:14.045
we're going to use that color
to tell you how you feel in certain times.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.905
But also, you know this exists
because you put the hero in white,

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:21.215
you put the lead character in red,
you put the villain in all black.

00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:23.280
It's typecasting. You know that.

00:05:23.304 --> 00:05:24.462
So think about it.

00:05:24.486 --> 00:05:27.208
But there's also something else
that happens in the world

00:05:27.232 --> 00:05:29.665
that helps us move through
the world in a safe way.

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:31.715
They're called architectural standards.
