A good example of that light and color

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.473
is a show I designed called
"Dear Evan Hansen."

00:04:04.497 --> 00:04:05.512
(Cheers)

00:04:05.536 --> 00:04:07.497
"Dear Evan Hansen" exists -- oh my God --

00:04:07.521 --> 00:04:11.081
"Dear Evan Hansen" exists in a world
of almost all light and color.

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:13.690
So I chose a color: inky-black darkness.

00:04:13.714 --> 00:04:14.749
(Laughter)

00:04:14.773 --> 00:04:19.613
Inky-black darkness is a color
the way that sadness is an emotion.

00:04:19.637 --> 00:04:23.898
And this show transforms people,
but not before it wrecks people.

00:04:23.922 --> 00:04:28.442
I bet you're wondering, "How expensive
could the set possibly be to transform you

00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:30.463
if you sit for two hours and 20 minutes
