00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:30.636
But --

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.838
(Laughter)

00:07:31.862 --> 00:07:36.612
when we started working together,
we were sending images back and forth,

00:07:36.636 --> 00:07:38.872
and he sent me a picture
of the aurora borealis

00:07:38.896 --> 00:07:40.547
with lightning strikes through it.

00:07:40.571 --> 00:07:43.211
And he sent me pictures
from a mountaintop looking down

00:07:43.235 --> 00:07:45.344
at a smoke-filled canyon,

00:07:45.368 --> 00:07:47.826
or smoke underneath
the surface of water --

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.146
like, epic stuff.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.547
So the first set I designed for him
was a huge light box

00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:54.242
with the name of his record label.

00:07:54.266 --> 00:07:56.317
He would stand triumphantly
in front of it,

00:07:56.341 --> 00:07:58.603
and it would flash lights
like a lightning bolt.

00:07:58.627 --> 00:08:00.749
And it was epic, but, like,
starter-kit epic.
