00:01:58.138 --> 00:02:01.695
and what do you want people to feel like
when they experience the show?"

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.592
It's important. When we get that,
we move into step two: the design phase.

00:02:05.616 --> 00:02:07.894
And I'll give you
some little tricks about that,

00:02:07.918 --> 00:02:12.469
but the design phase is important
because we get to make these cool toys.

00:02:12.493 --> 00:02:15.086
I reach into Lin's brain,
he reaches into mine,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.889
this monologue becomes a dialogue.

00:02:16.913 --> 00:02:18.220
And I make these cool toys,

00:02:18.244 --> 00:02:20.453
and I say, "Does this world
look like the world

00:02:20.477 --> 00:02:23.533
that you think could be a place
where we could house your show?"

00:02:23.557 --> 00:02:26.065
If the answer is yes --
and when the answer is yes --

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.247
we move into what I think
is the most terrifying part,

00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:30.984
which is the execution phase.
