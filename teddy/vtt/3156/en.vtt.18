When I was 20 years old,

00:09:01.628 --> 00:09:04.987
I was driving through a parking lot,
and I saw a puddle.

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:08.469
I thought, "I'm going to veer to the left.
No -- I'm going through it."

00:09:08.493 --> 00:09:11.954
And I hit the puddle, and -- ffftt! --
all the water underneath my car,

00:09:11.978 --> 00:09:13.904
and instantly, I have an aha moment.

00:09:14.463 --> 00:09:15.808
Light bulb goes off.

00:09:16.364 --> 00:09:18.591
Everything in the world
needs to be designed.

00:09:19.923 --> 00:09:23.131
I mean, I'm sure I was thinking,
"The drainage needs to be designed

00:09:23.155 --> 00:09:24.316
in this parking lot."

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.576
But then I was like, "Everything
in the world needs to be designed."

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.482
And it's true: left to its own devices,

00:09:29.506 --> 00:09:33.515
Mother Nature isn't going to carve
an interesting or necessarily helpful path
