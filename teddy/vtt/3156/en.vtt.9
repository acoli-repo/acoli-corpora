00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:30.463
if you sit for two hours and 20 minutes

00:04:30.487 --> 00:04:31.895
in inky-black darkness?"

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.073
The answer is: cheap!

00:04:34.572 --> 00:04:35.920
Inky-black darkness,

00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:38.516
turn the lights on at the right time.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.153
Seriously, think about leaving
Miss Darling's class.

00:04:41.177 --> 00:04:43.977
Inky-black darkness gives way
at the right moment,

00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:48.895
we fly away that wall and reveal
a beautiful blue sky.

00:04:49.558 --> 00:04:51.684
It blows people away
and it transports them,

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:53.200
and it makes them feel hopeful.

00:04:53.224 --> 00:04:55.430
And we know this because color is emotion,

00:04:55.454 --> 00:04:58.903
and when you paint with color,
you're painting with feelings.
