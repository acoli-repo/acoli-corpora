00:07:58.627 --> 00:08:00.749
And it was epic, but, like,
starter-kit epic.

00:08:00.773 --> 00:08:03.821
We moved on to a large swath of sky
with a tear down the middle,

00:08:03.845 --> 00:08:07.967
and through the tear, you could see
deep parts of the cosmos.

00:08:07.991 --> 00:08:09.462
Getting closer.

00:08:09.486 --> 00:08:13.097
We evolved to standing
on top of an obelisk,

00:08:13.121 --> 00:08:15.980
standing on top of a mountainside,
standing on top of boxes.

00:08:16.004 --> 00:08:18.507
You know, he was evolving
as an artist through space,

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:20.374
and it was my job to try and keep up.

00:08:20.398 --> 00:08:22.153
When we did Coachella,

00:08:22.177 --> 00:08:23.329
there he was,

00:08:23.353 --> 00:08:27.360
standing in front of an 80-foot-wide
by 40-foot-tall ancient artifact,

00:08:27.384 --> 00:08:29.751
literally handed down from God to man.
