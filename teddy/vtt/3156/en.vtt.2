00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:00.675
and finally, you're outside.

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:03.888
Oh, you can feel the wind on your face,

00:01:03.912 --> 00:01:06.406
then the sun on your skin

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.589
and most importantly, the big blue sky.

00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:13.135
That is a revelation of space.

00:01:13.853 --> 00:01:18.951
Making revelations of space is what I do;
I'm a designer and creative director,

00:01:18.975 --> 00:01:20.605
and that's what I do for a living.

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:23.624
I do it for all sorts of people
in all kinds of different ways,

00:01:23.648 --> 00:01:25.754
and it might seem
complicated, but it's not.

00:01:25.778 --> 00:01:29.111
And over the next couple of minutes,
I'm going to give you three ways

00:01:29.135 --> 00:01:31.229
that I think you can
move through your world
