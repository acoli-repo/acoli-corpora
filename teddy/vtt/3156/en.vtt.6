You're already starring in a show,
by the way. It's called your life.

00:03:01.946 --> 00:03:03.289
Congratulations. (Laughter)

and the makeup artists in our own world,

00:03:20.122 --> 00:03:23.916
and I want to get you to think about
being the set designer in your world.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.026
Because I think you can leave here
if you do these three steps

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.097
and a couple of little tricks,
as I said, I'm going to tell you,
