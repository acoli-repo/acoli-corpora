00:11:58.312 --> 00:12:00.263
and again, Seth's not driving.

00:12:01.552 --> 00:12:04.793
We've planned out a path for it to go --

00:12:04.817 --> 00:12:06.924
it looked like it was
going off the path --

00:12:06.948 --> 00:12:09.306
and now Seth's going
to take over control again,

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.779
because I'm a little bit chicken
about having it do this by itself.

00:12:12.803 --> 00:12:14.179
Thank you, Spot.

00:12:16.411 --> 00:12:21.694
(Applause)

00:12:23.069 --> 00:12:24.659
So, Spot:

00:12:24.683 --> 00:12:28.250
How do you feel about having just finished
your TED performance?

00:12:29.194 --> 00:12:31.883
(Laughter)
