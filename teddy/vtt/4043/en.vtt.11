(Laughter)

00:05:33.472 --> 00:05:36.016
And here's our latest robot,
called "Handle."

00:05:36.637 --> 00:05:40.755
Handle is interesting,
because it's sort of half like an animal,

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.093
and it's half something else

00:05:43.117 --> 00:05:45.873
with these leg-like things and wheels.

00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:49.347
It's got its arms on
in kind of a funny way,

00:05:49.371 --> 00:05:51.467
but it really does some remarkable things.

00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:54.822
It can carry 100 pounds.

00:05:54.846 --> 00:05:56.905
It's probably going to lift
more than that,

00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:58.707
but so far we've done 100.

00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:01.167
It's got some pretty good
rough-terrain capability,
