00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.896
and the computer is listening
through its sensors.

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:34.933
But that's really only half of the story.

00:06:34.957 --> 00:06:38.066
The real story is
that the computer is on one side,

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.034
making suggestions to the robot,

00:06:40.058 --> 00:06:42.550
and on the other side
are the physics of the world.

00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:47.880
And that physics involves gravity,
friction, bouncing into things.

00:06:48.418 --> 00:06:50.253
In order to have a successful robot,

00:06:50.277 --> 00:06:54.868
my religion is that you have to do
a holistic design,

00:06:54.892 --> 00:06:58.445
where you're designing the software,
the hardware and the behavior

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:59.705
all at one time,

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:03.431
and all these parts really intermesh
and cooperate with each other.
