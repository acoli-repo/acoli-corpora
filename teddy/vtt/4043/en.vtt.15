00:07:28.706 --> 00:07:31.107
it's supposed to look like
an anatomy drawing.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.020
Using the miracle of 3-D printing,

00:07:34.044 --> 00:07:36.681
we're starting to build parts of robots

00:07:36.705 --> 00:07:39.602
that look a lot more
like the anatomy of an animal.

00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:42.970
So that's an upper-leg part
that has hydraulic pathways --

00:07:42.994 --> 00:07:44.924
actuators, filters --

00:07:44.948 --> 00:07:47.328
all embedded, all printed as one piece,

00:07:47.352 --> 00:07:50.554
and the whole structure is developed

00:07:50.578 --> 00:07:53.614
with a knowledge of what the loads
and behavior are going to be,

00:07:53.638 --> 00:07:56.541
which is available from data
recorded from robots

00:07:56.565 --> 00:07:58.374
and simulations and things like that.

00:07:58.398 --> 00:08:01.335
So it's a data-driven hardware design.
