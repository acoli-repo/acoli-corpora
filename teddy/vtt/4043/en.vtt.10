And this robot is using both hands,
it's using its body,

00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:03.060
it's stepping,

00:05:03.084 --> 00:05:05.811
so it's really an example
of dynamic stability,

00:05:05.835 --> 00:05:07.214
mobile manipulation

00:05:07.238 --> 00:05:08.849
and mobile perception.

00:05:10.372 --> 00:05:11.545
Here --

00:05:12.085 --> 00:05:13.992
(Laughter)

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.179
We actually have two Atlases.

00:05:16.663 --> 00:05:17.848
(Laughter)

00:05:18.378 --> 00:05:21.774
Now, everything doesn't go exactly
the way it's supposed to.

00:05:21.798 --> 00:05:23.500
(Laughter)

00:05:26.498 --> 00:05:28.026
(Laughter)

00:05:28.716 --> 00:05:30.587
(Laughter)
