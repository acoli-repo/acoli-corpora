00:00:57.124 --> 00:01:00.035
So, dynamic mobility and balance --

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.696
I'm going to do a demo for you.

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:04.826
I'm standing here, balancing.

00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:09.015
I can see you're not very impressed.
OK, how about now?

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:10.199
(Laughter)

00:01:10.223 --> 00:01:11.416
How about now?

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.483
(Applause)

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.602
Those simple capabilities mean that people
can go almost anywhere on earth,

00:01:18.626 --> 00:01:20.278
on any kind of terrain.

00:01:20.302 --> 00:01:22.957
We want to capture that for robots.

00:01:23.952 --> 00:01:25.344
What about manipulation?

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.510
I'm holding this clicker in my hand;

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:28.826
I'm not even looking at it,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.580
and I can manipulate it
without any problem.
