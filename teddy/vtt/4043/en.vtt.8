00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.490
but make them deal with the uncertainty
of what happens in the real world.

00:04:02.234 --> 00:04:05.245
So we have Steve there,
one of the engineers,

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.877
giving the robot a hard time.

00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:07.933
(Laughter)

00:04:07.957 --> 00:04:12.147
And the fact that the programming
still tolerates all that disturbance --

00:04:12.171 --> 00:04:13.668
it does what it's supposed to.

00:04:13.692 --> 00:04:16.483
Here's another example,
where Eric is tugging on the robot

00:04:16.507 --> 00:04:17.805
as it goes up the stairs.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:18.981
And believe me,

00:04:19.005 --> 00:04:22.277
getting it to do what it's supposed to do
in those circumstances

00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:23.642
is a real challenge,

00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:26.406
but the result is something
that's going to generalize

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.301
and make robots much more autonomous
than they would be otherwise.
