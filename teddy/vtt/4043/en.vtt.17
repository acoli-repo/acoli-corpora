with all the same
strength and capabilities.

00:08:30.413 --> 00:08:33.143
So these things are really getting
better very quickly.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.722
So it's time for Spot to come back out,

00:08:37.746 --> 00:08:41.494
and we're going to demonstrate
a little bit of mobility,

00:08:41.518 --> 00:08:43.118
dexterity and perception.

00:08:43.861 --> 00:08:47.625
This is Seth Davis,
who's my robot wrangler today,

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:50.689
and he's giving Spot
some general direction

00:08:50.713 --> 00:08:52.539
by steering it around,

00:08:52.563 --> 00:08:55.634
but all the coordination
of the legs and the sensors

00:08:55.658 --> 00:08:58.167

00:08:58.723 --> 00:09:02.169
The robot can walk
with a number of different gaits;
