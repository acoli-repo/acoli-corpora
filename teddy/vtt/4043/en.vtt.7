00:03:29.934 --> 00:03:30.958
(Laughter)

00:03:30.982 --> 00:03:32.210
the various access ways.

00:03:32.234 --> 00:03:34.118
And believe me, in the Boston area,

00:03:34.142 --> 00:03:37.316
there's every manner
of stairway twists and turns.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.577
So it's a real challenge.

00:03:38.601 --> 00:03:41.418
But we're doing very well,
about 70 percent of the way.

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.224
And here's mobile manipulation,

00:03:44.248 --> 00:03:46.839
where we've put an arm on the robot,

00:03:46.863 --> 00:03:49.197
and it's finding its way through the door.

00:03:49.922 --> 00:03:53.081
Now, one of the important things
about making autonomous robots

00:03:53.105 --> 00:03:56.325
is to make them not do
just exactly what you say,

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.490
but make them deal with the uncertainty
of what happens in the real world.
