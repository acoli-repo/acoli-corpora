00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:03.431
and all these parts really intermesh
and cooperate with each other.

00:07:03.455 --> 00:07:06.562
And when you get the perfect design,
you get a real harmony

00:07:06.586 --> 00:07:09.465
between all those parts
interacting with each other.

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:12.709
So it's half software and half hardware,

00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:14.024
plus the behavior.

00:07:14.878 --> 00:07:18.420
We've done some work lately
on the hardware, where we tried to go --

00:07:18.444 --> 00:07:20.921
the picture on the left
is a conventional design,

00:07:20.945 --> 00:07:23.845
where you have parts
that are all bolted together,

00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:26.609
conductors, tubes, connectors.

00:07:26.633 --> 00:07:28.682
And on the right
is a more integrated thing;

00:07:28.706 --> 00:07:31.107
it's supposed to look like
an anatomy drawing.
