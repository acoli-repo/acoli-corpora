00:02:28.518 --> 00:02:33.058
The first three robots are all
dynamically stabilized robots.

00:02:33.082 --> 00:02:35.730
This one goes back
a little over 10 years ago --

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:36.922
"BigDog."

00:02:36.946 --> 00:02:40.256
It's got a gyroscope
that helps stabilize it.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.616
It's got sensors and a control computer.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.807
Here's a Cheetah robot
that's running with a galloping gait,

00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:48.527
where it recycles its energy,

00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:50.118
it bounces on the ground,

00:02:50.142 --> 00:02:51.696
and it's computing all the time

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.607
in order to keep itself
stabilized and propelled.

00:02:56.114 --> 00:02:57.942
And here's a bigger robot

00:02:57.966 --> 00:03:00.671
that's got such good
locomotion using its legs,
