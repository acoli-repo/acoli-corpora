00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.301
and make robots much more autonomous
than they would be otherwise.

00:04:31.497 --> 00:04:33.928
This is Atlas, a humanoid robot.

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:38.512
It's a third-generation humanoid
that we've been building.

00:04:38.851 --> 00:04:41.669
I'll tell you a little bit
about the hardware design later.

00:04:41.693 --> 00:04:42.869
And we've been saying:

00:04:42.893 --> 00:04:47.316
How close to human levels
of performance and speed could we get

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.915
in an ordinary task,

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.408
like moving boxes around on a conveyor?

00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:57.417
We're getting up to about two-thirds
of the speed that a human operates

00:04:57.441 --> 00:04:58.603
on average.

00:04:58.938 --> 00:05:01.867
And this robot is using both hands,
it's using its body,
