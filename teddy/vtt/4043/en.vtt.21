00:10:28.292 --> 00:10:30.722
where it adjusts the steps
a little bit longer

00:10:30.746 --> 00:10:32.022
or a little bit shorter.

00:10:33.396 --> 00:10:35.826
Now we're going to change it
into a different mode,

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.273
where it's just going to treat
the blocks like terrain

00:10:39.297 --> 00:10:43.016
and decide whether to step up or down

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.325
as it goes.

00:10:45.265 --> 00:10:48.234
So this is using dynamic balance

00:10:48.258 --> 00:10:50.116
and mobile perception,

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:55.527
because it has to coordinate what it sees
along with how it's moving.

00:10:57.168 --> 00:11:01.486
The other thing Spot has is a robot arm.
