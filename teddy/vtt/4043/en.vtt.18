The robot can walk
with a number of different gaits;

00:09:02.193 --> 00:09:04.352
it's got a gyro,

00:09:04.376 --> 00:09:05.713
or a solid-state gyro,

00:09:05.737 --> 00:09:07.157
an IMU on board.

00:09:07.622 --> 00:09:10.649
Obviously, it's got a battery,
and things like that.

00:09:11.532 --> 00:09:14.038
One of the cool things
about a legged robot is,

00:09:14.062 --> 00:09:15.511

00:09:15.535 --> 00:09:18.308
In addition to going forward,
it can go sideways,

00:09:19.593 --> 00:09:21.033
it can turn in place.

00:09:24.662 --> 00:09:26.930
And this robot
is a little bit of a show-off.

00:09:27.855 --> 00:09:29.815
It loves to use its dynamic gaits,

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:30.997
