00:01:59.374 --> 00:02:02.639
I'm looking at a room
with over 1,000 people in it,

00:02:02.663 --> 00:02:07.438
and my amazing visual system
can see every one of you --

00:02:07.462 --> 00:02:09.423
you're all stable in space,

00:02:09.447 --> 00:02:10.766
even when I move my head,

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.336
even when I move around.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.139
That kind of mobile perception
is really important for robots

00:02:16.163 --> 00:02:17.807
that are going to move and act

00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:19.044
out in the world.

00:02:20.045 --> 00:02:22.323
I'm going to give you
a little status report

00:02:22.347 --> 00:02:26.193
on where we are in developing robots
toward these ends.

00:02:28.518 --> 00:02:33.058
The first three robots are all
dynamically stabilized robots.
