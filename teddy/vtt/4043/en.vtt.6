00:02:57.966 --> 00:03:00.671
that's got such good
locomotion using its legs,

00:03:00.695 --> 00:03:02.099
that it can go in deep snow.

00:03:02.123 --> 00:03:04.534
This is about 10 inches deep,

00:03:04.558 --> 00:03:06.669
and it doesn't really have any trouble.

00:03:08.346 --> 00:03:10.975
This is Spot, a new generation of robot --

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:13.807
just slightly older than the one
that came out onstage.

00:03:14.438 --> 00:03:16.270
And we've been asking the question --

00:03:16.294 --> 00:03:18.268
you've all heard about drone delivery:

00:03:18.292 --> 00:03:20.915
Can we deliver packages
to your houses with drones?

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.726
Well, what about plain old
legged-robot delivery?

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.882
(Laughter)

00:03:24.906 --> 00:03:28.303
So we've been taking our robot
to our employees' homes

00:03:28.327 --> 00:03:29.910
to see whether we could get in --

00:03:29.934 --> 00:03:30.958
(Laughter)
