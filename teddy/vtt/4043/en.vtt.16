00:07:58.398 --> 00:08:01.335
So it's a data-driven hardware design.

00:08:01.727 --> 00:08:03.453
And using processes like that,

00:08:03.477 --> 00:08:05.721
not only the upper leg
but some other things,

00:08:05.745 --> 00:08:10.885
we've gotten our robots to go from big,
behemoth, bulky, slow, bad robots --

00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:14.528
that one on the right,
weighing almost 400 pounds --

00:08:14.552 --> 00:08:17.661
down to the one in the middle
which was just in the video,

00:08:17.685 --> 00:08:19.248
weighs about 190 pounds,

00:08:19.272 --> 00:08:20.969
just a little bit more than me,

00:08:20.993 --> 00:08:22.479
and we have a new one,

00:08:22.503 --> 00:08:25.245
which is working but I'm not
going to show it to you yet,

00:08:25.269 --> 00:08:26.431
on the left,

00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:28.099
which weighs just 165 pounds,

00:08:28.123 --> 00:08:30.389
with all the same
strength and capabilities.
