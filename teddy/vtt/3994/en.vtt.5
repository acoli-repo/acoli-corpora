00:02:29.534 --> 00:02:32.083
for how sick we got trying
to collect this species.

00:02:32.614 --> 00:02:34.192
Now, believe it or not,

00:02:34.216 --> 00:02:36.806
swimming around sinkholes
full of dead things

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.713

isn't the smartest thing you could
be doing with your life,

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.079
but YOLO.

and that's because

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.763
its closest relatives
are 6,000 kilometers away,

00:02:56.787 --> 00:02:58.151
cavefishes in Australia.

00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:02.336
Now, there's no way a three-inch-long
freshwater cavefish
