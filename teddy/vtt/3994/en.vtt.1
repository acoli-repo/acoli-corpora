00:00:29.068 --> 00:00:30.566
And that's what I get to do.

00:00:30.873 --> 00:00:35.328
Now, in recent years, I really focused
on caves for finding new species.

00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:38.618
And it turns out, there's lots of new
cavefish species out there.

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:40.425
You just have to know where to look,

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.658
and to maybe be a little thin.

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:43.776
(Laughter)

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.825
Now, cavefishes can tell me
a lot about biology and geology.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:52.197
They can tell me how the landmasses
around them have changed and moved

00:00:52.221 --> 00:00:54.439
by being stuck in these little holes,

00:00:54.463 --> 00:00:58.026
and they can tell me about
the evolution of sight, by being blind.

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:02.470
Now, fish have eyes
that are essentially the same as ours.
