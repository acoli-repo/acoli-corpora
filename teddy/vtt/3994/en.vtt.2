00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:02.470
Now, fish have eyes
that are essentially the same as ours.

00:01:02.494 --> 00:01:06.322
All vertebrates do, and each time
a fish species starts to adapt

00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:08.758
to this dark, cold, cave environment,

00:01:08.782 --> 00:01:12.719
over many, many generations,
they lose their eyes and their eyesight

00:01:12.743 --> 00:01:15.893
until the end up like an eyeless
cavefish like this one here.

00:01:15.917 --> 00:01:19.754
Now, each cavefish species
has evolved in a slightly different way,

00:01:19.778 --> 00:01:23.850
and each one has a unique geological
and biological story to tell us,

00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:26.801
and that's why it's so exciting
when we find a new species.

00:01:27.217 --> 00:01:30.654
So this is a new species
we described, from southern Indiana.
