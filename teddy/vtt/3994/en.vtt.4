00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.123
except one species has lost
all function in that gene,

00:02:00.147 --> 00:02:01.821
and the other one maintains it.

00:02:02.234 --> 00:02:06.257
So this sets up this beautiful
natural experiment

00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:09.245
where we can look at the genes
behind our vision,

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.928
and at the very roots of how we can see.

00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:14.761
But the genes in these cavefishes

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:17.571
can also tell us
about deep geological time,

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:20.055
maybe no more so
than in this species here.

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.896
This is a new species
we described from Madagascar

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.221
that we named Typhleotris mararybe.

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:29.510
That means "big sickness" in Malagasy,

00:02:29.534 --> 00:02:32.083
for how sick we got trying
to collect this species.
