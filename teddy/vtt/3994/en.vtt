00:00:00.992 --> 00:00:02.604
Ichthyology,

00:00:02.628 --> 00:00:04.088
the study of fishes.

00:00:04.112 --> 00:00:06.970
It looks like a big, boring word,

00:00:06.994 --> 00:00:09.175
but it's actually quite exciting,

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:12.172
because ichthyology is the only "ology"

00:00:12.196 --> 00:00:13.527
with "YOLO" in it.

00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:15.335
(Laughter)

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.185
Now, to the cool kids in the audience,

00:00:17.209 --> 00:00:21.386
you already know, YOLO stands for
"you only live once,"

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.072
and because I only have one life,

00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:25.859
I'm going to spend it doing
what I always dreamt of doing:

00:00:25.883 --> 00:00:29.043
seeing the hidden wonders of the world
and discovering new species.

00:00:29.068 --> 00:00:30.566
And that's what I get to do.
