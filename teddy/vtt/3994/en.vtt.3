00:01:27.217 --> 00:01:30.654
So this is a new species
we described, from southern Indiana.

00:01:31.075 --> 00:01:34.972
We named it Amblyopsis hoosieri,
the Hoosier cavefish.

00:01:34.996 --> 00:01:36.057
(Laughter)

00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:39.010
Its closest relatives
are cavefishes in Kentucky,

00:01:39.034 --> 00:01:40.636
in the Mammoth Cave system.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.693
And they start to diverge
when the Ohio River split them

00:01:43.717 --> 00:01:45.002
a few million years ago.

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:48.162
And in that time they developed
these subtle differences

00:01:48.186 --> 00:01:50.947
in the genetic architecture
behind their blindness.

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.805
There's this gene called rhodopsin
that's super-critical for sight.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.226
We have it, and these species have it too,

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.123
except one species has lost
all function in that gene,
