00:03:29.064 --> 00:03:31.296
Now, this species here is so new

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.803
I'm not even allowed
to tell you its name yet,

00:03:33.827 --> 00:03:36.489
but I can tell you
it's a new species from Mexico,

00:03:36.513 --> 00:03:38.264
and it's probably already extinct.

00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:42.014
It's probably extinct because
the only known cave system it's from

00:03:42.038 --> 00:03:44.690
was destroyed when a dam was built nearby.

00:03:44.714 --> 00:03:46.676
Unfortunately for cavefishes,

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.280
their groundwater habitat

00:03:48.304 --> 00:03:50.500
is also our main source of drinking water.

00:03:51.103 --> 00:03:55.801
Now, we actually don't know
this species' closest relative, yet.

00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:58.475
It doesn't appear to be
anything else in Mexico,

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:00.199
so maybe it's something in Cuba,
