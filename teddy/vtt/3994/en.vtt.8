00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:00.199
so maybe it's something in Cuba,

00:04:00.223 --> 00:04:02.245
or Florida, or India.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.335
But whatever it is, it might tell us
something new about the geology

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.567
of the Caribbean, or the biology
of how to better diagnose

00:04:10.591 --> 00:04:12.712
certain types of blindness.

00:04:12.736 --> 00:04:16.146
But I hope we discover this species
before it goes extinct too.

00:04:16.733 --> 00:04:18.648
And I'm going to spend my one life

00:04:18.672 --> 00:04:22.201
as an ichthyologist
trying to discover and save

00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:24.803
these humble little blind cavefishes

00:04:24.827 --> 00:04:28.293
that can tell us so much
about the geology of the planet

00:04:28.317 --> 00:04:30.133
and the biology of how we see.
