00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:02.336
Now, there's no way a three-inch-long
freshwater cavefish

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.399
can swim across the Indian Ocean,

00:03:04.423 --> 00:03:07.254
so what we found when we compared
the DNA of these species

00:03:07.278 --> 00:03:10.575
is that they've been separated
for more than 100 million years,

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.938
or about the time that the southern
continents were last together.

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:18.081
So in fact, these species
didn't move at all.

00:03:18.105 --> 00:03:19.906
It's the continents that moved them.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.953
And so they give us, through their DNA,

00:03:21.977 --> 00:03:24.398
this precise model and measure

00:03:24.422 --> 00:03:27.580
of how to date and time
these ancient geological events.

00:03:29.064 --> 00:03:31.296
Now, this species here is so new
