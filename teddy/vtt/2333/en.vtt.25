And if you think about it,

00:12:30.252 --> 00:12:33.580
grace is the gift we give
someone else in a relationship

00:12:33.604 --> 00:12:38.093
that says our relationship
is way more important

00:12:38.117 --> 00:12:39.902
than the things that separate us.

00:12:41.672 --> 00:12:44.172
And if you really think
about it some more,

00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:49.450
we all have the power to execute
in our relationships,

00:12:49.474 --> 00:12:50.624
or to pardon.

00:12:55.109 --> 00:12:58.389
We never did find out
the identity of our anonymous neighbor.

00:12:59.086 --> 00:13:00.236
