00:06:28.347 --> 00:06:31.030
and Muhammad Ali comes to your doorstep.

00:06:31.054 --> 00:06:32.454
And you open the door.

00:06:33.078 --> 00:06:35.633
Would you address him as Muhammad Ali

00:06:35.657 --> 00:06:37.924
or his former name of Cassius Clay?

00:06:39.013 --> 00:06:42.347
I'm guessing that most of you
would say Muhammad Ali.

00:06:42.371 --> 00:06:44.799
And I'm also guessing that most of you

00:06:44.823 --> 00:06:48.521
wouldn't think we'd have to
immediately convert to Islam,

00:06:48.545 --> 00:06:50.079
just by using his name.

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:55.093
To honor him would cost me,
would cost any of us

00:06:55.117 --> 00:06:56.624
absolutely nothing,

00:06:56.648 --> 00:07:00.815
and it would give us the common ground
to have a relationship.
