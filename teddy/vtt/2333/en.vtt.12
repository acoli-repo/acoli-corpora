00:05:59.648 --> 00:06:00.879
or I convinced them.

00:06:00.903 --> 00:06:03.073
No, it taught me to start relationships

00:06:03.097 --> 00:06:07.029
by loving them as a coequal member
of the human race.

00:06:09.357 --> 00:06:10.508
Honestly though,

00:06:10.532 --> 00:06:12.944
some who share my faith draw a line

00:06:12.968 --> 00:06:16.809
and refuse to address somebody
by their preferred gender pronoun.

00:06:17.112 --> 00:06:20.561
But isn't that believing the lie
that in order for me to honor you,

00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:22.785
I have to give up what I believe?

00:06:25.616 --> 00:06:26.958
Come back in time with me --

00:06:26.982 --> 00:06:28.323
let's say it's 20 years ago,

00:06:28.347 --> 00:06:31.030
and Muhammad Ali comes to your doorstep.
