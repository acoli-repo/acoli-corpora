00:07:59.672 --> 00:08:00.822
To pause.

00:08:01.299 --> 00:08:02.751
To calm down.

00:08:03.474 --> 00:08:07.465
To have the kind of relationships
that cure agonism.

00:08:08.188 --> 00:08:10.988
And how to keep those relationships alive.

00:08:12.815 --> 00:08:18.238
Our second strategy is to exchange
extravagant grace.

00:08:18.262 --> 00:08:19.412
(Laughs)

00:08:20.101 --> 00:08:21.816
Once again, I'm not mincing words --

00:08:24.659 --> 00:08:25.899
that would be weird.

00:08:25.923 --> 00:08:27.204
(Laughter)

00:08:27.228 --> 00:08:31.561
What I mean is not canceling
everything over one mistake.
