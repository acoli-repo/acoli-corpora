I just gently ask that you reflect

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.823
and see if you're buying into agonism.

00:04:34.847 --> 00:04:36.045
If you're rejecting me

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.863
simply because you think
you see the world differently than I do,

00:04:39.887 --> 00:04:42.196
because isn't that
what we're here talking about?

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.890
Alright, ready?

00:04:44.398 --> 00:04:48.089
So I've been thinking a lot
about how to find common ground

00:04:48.113 --> 00:04:50.676
in the area of gender fluidity,

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.567
as an evangelical Christian.

00:04:53.427 --> 00:04:55.371
For Christians like me,

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:59.323
we believe that God
created us man and woman.

00:04:59.553 --> 00:05:00.704
So what do I do?
