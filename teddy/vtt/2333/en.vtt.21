Listen, I know this can sound

00:10:34.736 --> 00:10:37.521
So I'd like to tell you
about a hero of mine.

00:10:37.847 --> 00:10:39.576
A hero of grace.

00:10:40.347 --> 00:10:42.235
It's 2014.

00:10:42.918 --> 00:10:44.068
In Iran.

00:10:44.696 --> 00:10:48.600
And the mother of a murdered son
is in a public square.

00:10:51.281 --> 00:10:54.844
The man who murdered her son
is also in that square,

00:10:54.868 --> 00:10:56.614
by a gallows,

00:10:57.313 --> 00:10:59.606
on a chair of some kind,

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.982
a noose around his neck
