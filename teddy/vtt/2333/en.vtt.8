00:03:58.162 --> 00:04:00.400
let me tell you a little bit
more about myself.

00:04:00.424 --> 00:04:01.617
I'm Caucasian,

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:04.599
cisgender male,

00:04:04.623 --> 00:04:07.196
middle class, evangelical Christian.

00:04:20.815 --> 00:04:23.712
know that I'm about
to cut across the grain.

00:04:23.736 --> 00:04:25.869
And you may tune me out as well.

00:04:26.315 --> 00:04:27.466
So as we go,

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.531
if you're having a hard time hearing me,

00:04:29.555 --> 00:04:32.156
I just gently ask that you reflect
