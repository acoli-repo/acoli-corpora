00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.089
when our relationships die

00:02:32.113 --> 00:02:35.109
because we think
we have to agree or disagree

00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:36.878
no matter what.

00:02:37.807 --> 00:02:41.403
Think about the conversations
we've had around Brexit,

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:43.126
or Hong Kong,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.435
maybe Israeli settlements
or perhaps impeachment.

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:50.763
I bet we could all think
of at least one personal relationship

00:02:50.787 --> 00:02:55.514
that's been strained or maybe even ended
because of these topics,

00:02:55.538 --> 00:02:56.887
or tragically,

00:02:56.911 --> 00:03:00.109
over a topic much more trivial than those.
