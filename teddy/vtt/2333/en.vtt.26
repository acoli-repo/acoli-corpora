00:12:59.086 --> 00:13:00.236
(Laughter)

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.627
But if we did, I'd hope we'd simply say,

00:13:03.651 --> 00:13:05.051
"Can we have coffee?"

00:13:06.222 --> 00:13:08.806
And maybe there's somebody
you need to have coffee with

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.297
and find your common ground with them.

00:13:11.909 --> 00:13:14.829
Or maybe there's somebody
you're in a relationship with

00:13:14.853 --> 00:13:17.787
and you need to exchange
extravagant grace.

00:13:18.569 --> 00:13:19.719
Maybe go first.

00:13:21.323 --> 00:13:23.314
These two strategies have taught me

00:13:23.338 --> 00:13:26.574
how to exchange extravagant grace
in my relationships

00:13:26.598 --> 00:13:30.859
and to enjoy the beautiful design
of my neighbors.
