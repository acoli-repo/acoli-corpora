Just like a farmer works
to cultivate the soil.

00:03:32.687 --> 00:03:35.252
And common ground is a common term,

00:03:35.276 --> 00:03:37.379
so let me at least explain
what I don't mean,

00:03:37.403 --> 00:03:40.847
which is I don't mean by common ground
that we were exact,

00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:43.037
or that we totally agree and approve.

00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:46.371
All I mean is that we find
one unifying thing

00:03:46.395 --> 00:03:51.307
that we can have in a relationship
in common with another person.

00:03:52.456 --> 00:03:55.098
You know, sometimes
that one thing is hard to find.

00:03:55.122 --> 00:03:56.956
So I'd like to share a personal story,

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.138
but before I do,

00:03:58.162 --> 00:04:00.400
let me tell you a little bit
more about myself.
