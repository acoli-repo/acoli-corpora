And that immediately gives me
common ground with anybody.

00:05:33.696 --> 00:05:35.231
What it also gives me ...

00:05:37.454 --> 00:05:40.326
is the belief that each
and every one of us

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.398
have been given the right to life

00:05:43.422 --> 00:05:46.318
by that same intelligent designer.

00:05:50.514 --> 00:05:51.847
I dug deeper though.

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:54.736
I found that my faith didn't teach me

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.054
to start relationships
by arguing with somebody

00:05:57.078 --> 00:05:59.624
until they believed what I believed,

00:05:59.648 --> 00:06:00.879
or I convinced them.
