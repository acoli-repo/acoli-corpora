00:06:56.648 --> 00:07:00.815
and it would give us the common ground
to have a relationship.

00:07:01.863 --> 00:07:04.814
And it's the relationship
that cures agonism,

00:07:04.838 --> 00:07:07.196
not giving up what we believe.

00:07:09.045 --> 00:07:11.728
So for me to honor my faith,

00:07:11.752 --> 00:07:14.997
it means rejecting
these rigid symptoms of agonism.

00:07:15.021 --> 00:07:17.894
Meaning, I can and I will love you.

00:07:17.918 --> 00:07:19.910
I can and I will accept you,

00:07:19.934 --> 00:07:23.243
and I don't have to buy into the lie

00:07:23.267 --> 00:07:26.029
that if I do these things,
I have to give up what I believe

00:07:26.053 --> 00:07:28.148
or chose to fear and hate you.

00:07:28.617 --> 00:07:31.632
Because I'm focusing
on what we have in common.
