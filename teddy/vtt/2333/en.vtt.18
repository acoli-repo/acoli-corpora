00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:02.434
So we need the grace of a savior,

00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:04.330
who for me is Jesus.

00:09:05.275 --> 00:09:07.815
And while I define grace
in the context of my faith,

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:12.013
I know there's a lot of other people
who have defined it differently

00:09:12.037 --> 00:09:13.299
and in different ways.

00:09:13.323 --> 00:09:16.923
One of my favorites is radio broadcaster
Oswald Hoffmann, who said,

00:09:16.947 --> 00:09:20.500
"Grace is the love that loves the unlovely

00:09:20.524 --> 00:09:22.587
and the unlovable."

00:09:23.064 --> 00:09:25.597
And I just love that picture of grace.

00:09:26.361 --> 00:09:27.551
Because I know I am,

00:09:27.575 --> 00:09:29.607
and maybe a lot of you can think of a time

00:09:29.631 --> 00:09:32.440
when we're just pretty dadgum unlovable.
