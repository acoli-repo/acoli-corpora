00:01:28.872 --> 00:01:32.785
See, what my neighbor suffered from
is a condition called agonism.

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.849
And sometimes we all suffer
from the same condition.

00:01:36.873 --> 00:01:40.632
It's not a medical condition,
but it is contagious.

00:01:41.522 --> 00:01:43.926
So let's talk a little bit
about what agonism is.

00:01:44.316 --> 00:01:46.404
My favorite definition of agonism

00:01:46.428 --> 00:01:52.187
is taking a warlike stance
in contexts that are not literally war.

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:56.021
Agonism comes from the same
Greek root word "agon"

00:01:56.045 --> 00:01:57.494
from which we get "agony."

00:01:57.518 --> 00:01:59.370
How very appropriate.
