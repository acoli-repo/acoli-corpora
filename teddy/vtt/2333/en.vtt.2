We were really angry to have
our children stereotyped like that,

00:01:01.387 --> 00:01:05.767
but I know that's a relatively
minor example of racial profiling.

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:09.673
But isn't it sometimes
what we all tend to do

00:01:09.697 --> 00:01:12.006
with people who think differently,

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.831
or believe differently
or maybe even vote differently?

00:01:16.483 --> 00:01:19.014
Instead of engaging as true neighbors,

00:01:19.038 --> 00:01:20.791
we keep our distance

00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:22.387
and our actions towards those

00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:26.077
are guided by who we think
sees the world as we do

00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:27.701
or who we think doesn't.

00:01:28.872 --> 00:01:32.785
See, what my neighbor suffered from
is a condition called agonism.
