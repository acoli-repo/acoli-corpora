00:02:56.911 --> 00:03:00.109
over a topic much more trivial than those.

00:03:01.276 --> 00:03:03.895
The cure for agonism is not out of reach.

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.783
The question is how.

00:03:06.704 --> 00:03:08.664
So might I suggest two strategies

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:11.307
that my experience
has taught me to start with.

00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:16.410
First, cultivate common ground,

00:03:16.434 --> 00:03:18.967
which means focusing on what we share.

00:03:19.862 --> 00:03:23.149
I want you to know I'm using my words
very, very deliberately.

00:03:23.173 --> 00:03:26.377
By "cultivate," I mean
we have to intentionally work

00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:28.734
to find common ground with someone.

00:03:29.218 --> 00:03:32.035
Just like a farmer works
to cultivate the soil.
