00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You know, I'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of TED

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is compassion, these very moving demonstrations we've just seen:

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
HIV in Africa, President Clinton last night.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And I'd like to do a little collateral thinking, if you will,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm a psychologist, but rest assured,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I will not bring it to the scrotal.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
