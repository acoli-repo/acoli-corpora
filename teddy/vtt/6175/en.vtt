00:00:03.063 --> 00:00:04.507
The archive.

00:00:05.317 --> 00:00:08.659
One may envision rooms and shelves

00:00:08.683 --> 00:00:11.147
stocked with boxes
and cartons of old stuff.

00:00:11.623 --> 00:00:15.298
And yet, for those who are
patient enough to dig through it,

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:18.099
the archive provides
the precious opportunity

00:00:18.123 --> 00:00:19.877
to touch the past,

00:00:19.901 --> 00:00:22.426
to feel and learn from the experiences

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.453
of once-living people who now seem
dead and buried deeply in the archive.

00:00:28.038 --> 00:00:32.363
But what if there was a way
to bring the archive to life?
