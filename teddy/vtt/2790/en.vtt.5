00:02:26.627 --> 00:02:30.601
is because the Martian day
is longer than the Earth day.

00:02:30.954 --> 00:02:33.751
Our Earth day is 24 hours,

00:02:33.775 --> 00:02:37.149
because that's how long it takes
the Earth to rotate,

00:02:37.173 --> 00:02:39.174
how long it takes to go around once.

00:02:39.198 --> 00:02:41.110
So our day is 24 hours.

00:02:41.486 --> 00:02:48.306
It takes Mars 24 hours and approximately
40 minutes to rotate once.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.748
So that means that the Martian day
is 40 minutes longer than the Earth day.

00:02:55.207 --> 00:03:00.362
So teams of people who are operating
the rovers on Mars, like this one,
