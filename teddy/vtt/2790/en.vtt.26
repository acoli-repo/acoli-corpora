who will be going to Mars could be
in this audience or listening today.

00:13:04.201 --> 00:13:09.803
I have wanted to work at JPL
on these missions since I was 14 years old

00:13:09.827 --> 00:13:12.049
and I am privileged to be a part of it.

00:13:12.073 --> 00:13:16.127
And this is a remarkable time
in the space program,

00:13:16.151 --> 00:13:19.325
and we are all in this journey together.

00:13:19.349 --> 00:13:24.560
So the next time you think
you don't have enough time in your day,

00:13:24.584 --> 00:13:29.362
just remember, it's all a matter
of your Earthly perspective.

00:13:29.386 --> 00:13:30.537
Thank you.
