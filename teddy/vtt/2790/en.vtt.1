so that he's not as alone
on Mars until he can be rescued.

00:00:30.726 --> 00:00:33.488
So while you're watching the movie,
or even if you haven't,

00:00:33.512 --> 00:00:35.060
when you think about Mars,

00:00:35.084 --> 00:00:39.884
you're probably thinking about
how far away it is and how distant.

00:00:39.908 --> 00:00:42.487
And, what might not
have occurred to you is,

00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:46.408
what are the logistics really like
of working on another planet --

00:00:46.432 --> 00:00:48.678
of living on two planets

00:00:48.702 --> 00:00:54.536
when there are people on the Earth
and there are rovers or people on Mars?

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.718
So think about when you have friends,
families and co-workers

00:00:58.742 --> 00:01:01.900
in California, on the West Coast
or in other parts of the world.
