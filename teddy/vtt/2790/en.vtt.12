00:05:58.837 --> 00:06:03.344
Again, we didn't start out thinking,
"Oh, let's invent a language."

00:06:03.368 --> 00:06:04.658
It was just very confusing.

00:06:04.682 --> 00:06:06.863
I remember somebody
walked up to me and said,

00:06:06.887 --> 00:06:10.320
"I would like to do this activity
on the vehicle tomorrow, on the rover."

00:06:10.344 --> 00:06:15.455
And I said, "Tomorrow, tomorrow,
or Mars, tomorrow?"

00:06:15.987 --> 00:06:21.039
We started this terminology because
we needed a way to talk to each other.

00:06:21.063 --> 00:06:22.191
(Laughter)

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:26.491
Tomorrow became "nextersol" or "solorrow."

00:06:27.216 --> 00:06:30.831
Because people have different preferences
for the words they use.
