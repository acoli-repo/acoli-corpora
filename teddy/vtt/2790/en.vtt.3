00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:30.557
So we don't have people on Mars
right now, but we do have rovers.

00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:35.686
And actually right now, on Curiosity,
it is 6:10 in the morning.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.481
So, 6:10 in the morning on Mars.

00:01:38.876 --> 00:01:40.877
We have four rovers on Mars.

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:44.908
The United States has put four rovers
on Mars since the mid-1990s,

00:01:44.932 --> 00:01:48.871
and I have been privileged enough
to work on three of them.

00:01:48.895 --> 00:01:53.416
So, I am a spacecraft engineer,
a spacecraft operations engineer,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.287
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in Los Angeles, California.

00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:03.017
And these rovers
are our robotic emissaries.
