So many of you have probably seen
the movie "The Martian."

00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:08.958
But for those of you who did not,
it's a movie about an astronaut

00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:13.525
who is stranded on Mars,
and his efforts to stay alive

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.045
until the Earth can send a rescue mission
to bring him back to Earth.

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:22.344
Gladly, they do re-establish communication

00:00:22.368 --> 00:00:24.906
with the character,
astronaut Watney, at some point

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.201
so that he's not as alone
on Mars until he can be rescued.
