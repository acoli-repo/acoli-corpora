We have not sent people
to Mars yet, but we hope to.

00:12:36.513 --> 00:12:40.352
And between companies like SpaceX and NASA

00:12:40.376 --> 00:12:43.865
and all of the international
space agencies of the world,

00:12:43.889 --> 00:12:47.656
we hope to do that
in the next few decades.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:53.505
So soon we will have people on Mars,
and we truly will be multi-planetary.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.412
