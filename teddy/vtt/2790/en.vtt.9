00:04:29.308 --> 00:04:32.297
until soon you're coming to work
in the middle of the night --

00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:34.138
the middle of the Earth night.

00:04:34.162 --> 00:04:37.780
Right? So you can imagine
how confusing that is.

00:04:37.804 --> 00:04:39.956
Hence, the Mars watch.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.981
(Laughter)

00:04:41.005 --> 00:04:44.523
This weights in this watch
have been mechanically adjusted

00:04:44.547 --> 00:04:47.075
so that it runs more slowly.

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:48.988
Right? And we didn't start out --

00:04:49.012 --> 00:04:51.238
I got this watch in 2004

00:04:51.262 --> 00:04:54.566
when Spirit and Opportunity,
the rovers back then.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.196
We didn't start out thinking

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.651
that we were going to need Mars watches.

00:04:58.675 --> 00:05:03.106
Right? We thought, OK,
we'll just have the time on our computers
