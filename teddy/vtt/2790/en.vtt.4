00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:03.017
And these rovers
are our robotic emissaries.

00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:09.319
So, they are our eyes and our ears,
and they see the planet for us

00:02:09.343 --> 00:02:11.176
until we can send people.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.493
So we learn how to operate
on other planets through these rovers.

00:02:16.517 --> 00:02:20.823
So before we send people, we send robots.

00:02:21.326 --> 00:02:25.277
So the reason there's a time difference
on Mars right now,

00:02:25.301 --> 00:02:26.603
from the time that we're at

00:02:26.627 --> 00:02:30.601
is because the Martian day
is longer than the Earth day.
