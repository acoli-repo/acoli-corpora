00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.951
(Laughter)

00:07:01.975 --> 00:07:05.835
So we have the watches and the language,
and you're detecting a theme here, right?

00:07:05.859 --> 00:07:07.855
So that we don't get confused.

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:12.226
But even the Earth daylight
could confuse us.

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:15.008
If you think that right now,
you've come to work

00:07:15.032 --> 00:07:17.127
and it's the middle of the Martian night

00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:20.449
and there's light streaming in
from the windows

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:22.621
that's going to be confusing as well.

00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:25.586
So you can see from
this image of the control room

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.879
that all of the blinds are down.

00:07:27.903 --> 00:07:30.906
So that there's no light to distract us.
