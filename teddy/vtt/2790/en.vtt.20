00:09:59.661 --> 00:10:04.326
roaming the LA freeways,
in the middle of the night --

00:10:05.288 --> 00:10:07.311
in the middle of the Earth night.

00:10:07.335 --> 00:10:12.132
And we did actually
start calling ourselves Martians.

00:10:12.581 --> 00:10:18.187
So those of us who were on Mars time
would refer to ourselves as Martians,

00:10:18.211 --> 00:10:21.064
and everyone else as Earthlings.

00:10:21.088 --> 00:10:22.388
(Laughter)

00:10:22.412 --> 00:10:28.107
And that's because when you're moving
a time-zone every day,

00:10:28.131 --> 00:10:33.944
you start to really feel separated
from everyone else.
