00:03:56.558 --> 00:04:02.127
this team needs to be at work
at 5:00 p.m. Mars time every day,

00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:09.151
then we have to come to work
on the Earth 40 minutes later every day,

00:04:10.142 --> 00:04:12.321
in order to stay in sync with Mars.

00:04:12.345 --> 00:04:15.297
That's like moving a time zone every day.

00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:20.776
So one day you come in at 8:00,
the next day 40 minutes later at 8:40,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.069
the next day 40 minutes later at 9:20,

00:04:24.093 --> 00:04:25.682
the next day at 10:00.

00:04:25.706 --> 00:04:29.284
So you keep moving 40 minutes every day,

00:04:29.308 --> 00:04:32.297
until soon you're coming to work
in the middle of the night --
