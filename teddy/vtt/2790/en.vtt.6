00:02:55.207 --> 00:03:00.362
So teams of people who are operating
the rovers on Mars, like this one,

00:03:00.386 --> 00:03:05.798
what we are doing is we are living
on Earth, but working on Mars.

00:03:05.822 --> 00:03:11.287
So we have to think as if we are actually
on Mars with the rover.

00:03:11.654 --> 00:03:15.233
Our job, the job of this team,
of which I'm a part of,

00:03:15.257 --> 00:03:21.186
is to send commands to the rover
to tell it what to do the next day.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.239
To tell it to drive or drill
or tell her whatever she's supposed to do.

00:03:25.553 --> 00:03:30.019
So while she's sleeping --
and the rover does sleep at night
