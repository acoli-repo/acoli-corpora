00:10:28.131 --> 00:10:33.944
you start to really feel separated
from everyone else.

00:10:33.968 --> 00:10:37.887
You're literally in your own world.

00:10:38.704 --> 00:10:45.629
So I have this button on that says,
"I survived Mars time. Sol 0-90."

00:10:45.653 --> 00:10:48.398
And there's a picture of it
up on the screen.

00:10:48.422 --> 00:10:54.051
So the reason we got these buttons
is because we work on Mars time

00:10:54.075 --> 00:10:59.124
in order to be as efficient as possible
with the rover on Mars,

00:10:59.148 --> 00:11:01.438
to make the best use of our time.
