So that there's no light to distract us.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.282
The blinds went down all over the building
about a week before landing,

00:07:35.306 --> 00:07:38.573
and they didn't go up
until we went off Mars time.

00:07:39.027 --> 00:07:42.208
So this also works
for the house, for at home.

00:07:42.232 --> 00:07:45.005
I've been on Mars time three times,
and my husband is like,

00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:46.844
OK, we're getting ready for Mars time.

00:07:46.868 --> 00:07:53.070
And so he'll put foil all over the windows
and dark curtains and shades

00:07:53.094 --> 00:07:56.241
because it also affects your families.

00:07:56.265 --> 00:08:01.144
And so here I was living in kind of
this darkened environment, but so was he.
