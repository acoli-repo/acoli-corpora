00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.740
But the impact on families
was just across the board;

00:08:32.764 --> 00:08:36.426
it wasn't just those of us
who were working on the rovers

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.664
but our families as well.

00:08:38.688 --> 00:08:41.167
This is David Oh,
one of our flight directors,

00:08:41.191 --> 00:08:45.665
and he's at the beach in Los Angeles
with his family at 1:00 in the morning.

00:08:45.689 --> 00:08:47.112
(Laughter)

00:08:47.136 --> 00:08:50.116
So because we landed in August

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.586
and his kids didn't have to go back
to school until September,

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:59.358
they actually went on to Mars time
with him for one month.

00:08:59.382 --> 00:09:04.151
They got up 40 minutes later every day.
