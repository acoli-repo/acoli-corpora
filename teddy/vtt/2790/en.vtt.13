Because people have different preferences
for the words they use.

00:06:30.855 --> 00:06:34.231
Some of you might say "soda"
and some of you might say "pop."

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:38.035
So we have people who say
"nextersol" or "solorrow."

00:06:38.562 --> 00:06:43.286
And then something that I noticed after
a few years of working on these missions,

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.962
was that the people who work
on the rovers, we say "tosol."

00:06:48.426 --> 00:06:51.960
The people who work on the
landed missions that don't rove around,

00:06:51.984 --> 00:06:53.456
they say "tosoul."

00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:58.677
So I could actually tell what mission
you worked on from your Martian accent.

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.951
