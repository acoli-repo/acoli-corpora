00:03:25.553 --> 00:03:30.019
So while she's sleeping --
and the rover does sleep at night

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.413
because she needs
to recharge her batteries

00:03:32.437 --> 00:03:36.333
and she needs to weather
the cold Martian night.

00:03:36.357 --> 00:03:37.719
And so she sleeps.

00:03:37.743 --> 00:03:42.511
So while she sleeps, we work
on her program for the next day.

00:03:42.857 --> 00:03:45.839
So I work the Martian night shift.

00:03:45.863 --> 00:03:47.454
(Laughter)

00:03:47.478 --> 00:03:54.106
So in order to come to work on the Earth
at the same time every day on Mars --

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.534
like, let's say I need to be
at work at 5:00 p.m.,

00:03:56.558 --> 00:04:02.127
this team needs to be at work
at 5:00 p.m. Mars time every day,
