Because he was building these crops.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And with the money he earned he could stay this year.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And for the first time ever in three generations,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
his children would go to school.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And he said, "Of course I will.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore."

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
When we think about solutions to poverty,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
we cannot deny individuals

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
their fundamental dignity.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Because at the end of the day,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
