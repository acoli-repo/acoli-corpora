00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and has seen their yields and incomes

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
double or triple on average,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
but this didn't happen overnight.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
In fact, when you go back to the beginning,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
there were no private investors

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
for a market class that made under a dollar a day,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
to research, to experiment, to fail,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to innovate and try again.
