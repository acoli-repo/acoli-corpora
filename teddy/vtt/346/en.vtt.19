00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So that in the terrorist attacks of November

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
they were the first responder,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
in India.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
This idea of scale is critical.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Because we're starting to see these enterprises

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
have reached at least a quarter million people.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
But that's obviously not enough.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And it's where the idea of partnership

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
becomes so important.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Whether it's by finding those innovations
