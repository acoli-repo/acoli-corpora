00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And while, again, you needed patience

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
to move a technology for the poor

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
in India into Pakistan,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
just to get the permits,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
over time we were able to start a company

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
with Dr. Sono, who runs a large

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
community development organization in the Thar Desert,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And though that company has just started,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
our assumption is that there too

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
we'll see the impact on millions.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
We're starting to see these happening all around the world.
