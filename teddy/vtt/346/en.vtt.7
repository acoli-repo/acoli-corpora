00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
a long time horizon in terms of allowing those

entrepreneurs time to experiment,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to use the market as the best listening device that we have,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and the expectation of below-market returns,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000

for three reasons.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
First, they tend to work in markets

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
where people make one, two, three dollars a day
