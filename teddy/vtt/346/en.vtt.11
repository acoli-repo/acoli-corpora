00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that the farmers wanted to use.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
At the same time Amitabha was

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
obsessed with this drip irrigation technology

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
that had been invented in Israel.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
It was a way of bringing small amounts of water

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
directly to the stalk of the plant.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And it could transform

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
because these systems were both too expensive,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and they were constructed for fields that were too large.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
The average small village farmer

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
works on two acres or less.
