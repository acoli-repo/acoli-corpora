00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Today there is a raging debate

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
as to how best we lift people out of poverty,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
how best we release their energies.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
On the one hand, we have people that say

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And on the other we have people who say

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the problem is that we need more aid.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in Africa since 1970

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation
