00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
had gotten access to a technology

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
that had allowed him to change his own life.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
His name was Raja,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and warm expressive hands

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
that reminded me of my father.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And he said it was the first dry season

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
in his entire life that he hadn't taken

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
his 12 children and 50 grandchildren

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
on a two day journey across the desert

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
to work as day laborers at a commercial farm

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
for about 50 cents a day.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Because he was building these crops.
