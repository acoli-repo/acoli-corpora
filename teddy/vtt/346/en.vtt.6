00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Patient capital works between,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and tries to take the best of both.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and are building solutions

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
but as individual customers, consumers, clients,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
people who want to make decisions in their own lives.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Patient capital requires that we have

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
incredible tolerance for risk,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
a long time horizon in terms of allowing those

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
entrepreneurs time to experiment,
