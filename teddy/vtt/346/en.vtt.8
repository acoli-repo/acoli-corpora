00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
where people make one, two, three dollars a day

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and they are making all of their decisions within that income level.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Second, the geographies in which they work

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
have terrible infrastructure --

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
no roads to speak of, sporadic electricity

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and high levels of corruption.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Third, they are often creating markets.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Even if you're bringing clean water

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
for the first time into rural villages, it is something new.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And so many low-income people

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
have seen so many failed promises broken

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them
