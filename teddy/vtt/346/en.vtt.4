00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and we'll hand a lot of aid,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
but when it comes to our poor brethren,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
we want little to do with it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
They point to the successes of aid:

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
the eradication of smallpox,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and the distribution of tens of millions

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Both sides are right.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Even more problematic, they're not listening to

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
poor people themselves.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
After 25 years of working on issues of

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
poverty and innovation,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented
