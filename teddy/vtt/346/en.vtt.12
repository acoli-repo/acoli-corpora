00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
works on two acres or less.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and he would redesign it from the perspective

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
of the poor farmers themselves,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
because he spent so many years listening to what they needed

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
not what he thought that they should have.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And he used three fundamental principles.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
The first one was miniaturization.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
The drip irrigation system

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
had to be small enough that a farmer only had

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
to risk a quarter acre,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
even if he had two,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.
