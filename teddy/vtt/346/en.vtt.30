00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
to have the courage to embrace both love and power.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
For that is what we'll need, as we move forward

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
to dream and imagine what it will really take

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
to build a global economy that includes all of us,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and to finally extend that fundamental proposition

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
and looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.
