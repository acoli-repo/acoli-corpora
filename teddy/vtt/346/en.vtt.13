00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Second, it had to be extremely affordable.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
In other words, that risk on the quarter acre

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
needed to be repaid in a single harvest,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
or else they wouldn't take the risk.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
infinitely expandable.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
the farmers could buy a second

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and a third and a fourth.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and has seen their yields and incomes
