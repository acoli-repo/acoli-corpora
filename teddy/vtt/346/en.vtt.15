00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
to research, to experiment, to fail,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to innovate and try again.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And when he had a prototype

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
that's when patient capital could come in.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And we helped him build a company, for profit,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
that would build on IDE's knowledge,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and start looking at sales and exports,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.
