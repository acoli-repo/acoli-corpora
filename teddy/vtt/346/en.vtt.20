00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
becomes so important.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Whether it's by finding those innovations

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
that can access the capital markets,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
government itself, or partner with major corporations,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
President Obama understands that.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
to focus on what works in this country,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and look at how we can scale it.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And I would submit that it's time to consider

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
a global innovation fund

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
that would find these entrepreneurs around the world

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
who really have innovations, not only for their country,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
but ones that we can use in the developed world as well.
