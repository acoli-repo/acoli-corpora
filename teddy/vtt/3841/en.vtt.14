00:06:59.955 --> 00:07:01.767
and I would let them do 
what they want with it.

00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:03.690
I just want to represent 
them in a beautiful light.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.378
I just want to portray them in a way that

00:07:06.378 --> 00:07:09.649
their grandchildren are going
to look at their grandfather,

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:11.204
and they're going to be like,

00:07:11.204 --> 00:07:16.288
"Whoa, my grandfather is as 
cool as Beyoncé." (Laughter)

00:07:16.288 --> 00:07:18.144
It's a really important thing.

00:07:18.144 --> 00:07:21.643
(Applause)

00:07:21.643 --> 00:07:22.948
It's really important,

00:07:22.948 --> 00:07:24.604
because that's the way

00:07:24.604 --> 00:07:28.430
people are going to look differently at 
their own culture, at their own land.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.614
They're going to think about it differently.
