00:12:28.433 --> 00:12:31.083
more than the memory of the brain.

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:33.395
The respect is stepping forward,

00:12:33.395 --> 00:12:36.240
not stepping backward, and I really think that

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.190
by engaging your body in the
moment, in the ceremony,

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.553
in the places, people welcome you

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:43.237
and understand your energy.

00:12:43.237 --> 00:12:44.900
BG: You told me that most of the videos

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.569
you have made are 
actually one single shot.

00:12:47.569 --> 00:12:49.177
You don't do much editing.

00:12:49.177 --> 00:12:50.921
I mean, you edited the ones for us

00:12:50.921 --> 00:12:53.486
at the beginning of the sessions
because of the length, etc.

00:12:53.486 --> 00:12:55.313
Otherwise, you just go in and capture

00:12:55.313 --> 00:12:57.119
whatever happens in front of your eyes

00:12:57.119 --> 00:12:59.853
without much planning, and so is that the case?

00:12:59.853 --> 00:13:01.586
It's correct?
