00:12:59.853 --> 00:13:01.586
It's correct?

00:13:01.586 --> 00:13:03.594
VM: My idea is that I think that

00:13:03.594 --> 00:13:07.614
as long as we don't cut, in a way,

00:13:07.614 --> 00:13:10.719
as long as we let the viewer watch,

00:13:10.719 --> 00:13:13.688
more and more viewers 
are going to feel closer,

00:13:13.688 --> 00:13:16.501
are going to get closer to the moment,

00:13:16.501 --> 00:13:20.337
to that moment and to that place.

00:13:20.337 --> 00:13:23.869
I really think of that as a matter 
of respecting the viewer,

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:27.581
to not cut all the time from one place to another,

00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:29.645
to just let the time go.

00:13:29.645 --> 00:13:31.749
