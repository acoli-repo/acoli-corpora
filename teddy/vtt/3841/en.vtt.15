They're going to think about it differently.

00:07:30.614 --> 00:07:35.710
It may be a way to maintain 
a certain diversity.

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:40.549
Why you will record?

00:07:40.549 --> 00:07:42.710
Hmm. There's a really good quote

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.634
by American thinker Hakim Bey

00:07:44.634 --> 00:07:48.060
which says, "Every recording

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.966
is a tombstone of a live performance."

00:07:51.966 --> 00:07:54.981
It's a really good 
sentence to keep in mind

00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:58.889
nowadays in an era saturated by images.

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:00.409
What's the point of that?
