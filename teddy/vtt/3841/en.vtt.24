00:11:59.313 --> 00:12:02.000
but you are not always absolutely welcome.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.634
You walk into sacred rituals,

00:12:04.634 --> 00:12:08.471
private moments in a village, a town,

00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:10.680
a group of people.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.576
How do you break the barrier

00:12:12.576 --> 00:12:14.859
when you show up with a lens?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.605
VM: I think you break it with your body,

00:12:20.605 --> 00:12:23.243
more than with your knowledge.

00:12:23.243 --> 00:12:25.610
That's what it taught me to travel,

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.433
to trust the memory of the body

00:12:28.433 --> 00:12:31.083
more than the memory of the brain.
