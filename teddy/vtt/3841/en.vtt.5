reaching millions of viewers.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.920
After a while, I got a bit —

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.830
I wanted to go somewhere else.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.800
I felt the need to travel and
to discover some other music,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.735
to explore the world,

00:02:42.735 --> 00:02:44.523
going to other corners,

00:02:44.523 --> 00:02:46.564
and actually it was also

00:02:46.564 --> 00:02:50.535
this idea of nomadic cinema,
sort of, that I had in mind.

00:02:50.535 --> 00:02:57.583
How could the use of new technologies 
and the road fit together?

00:02:57.583 --> 00:02:59.431
How could I edit my films in a bus

00:02:59.431 --> 00:03:01.466
crossing the Andes?
