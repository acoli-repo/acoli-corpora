00:04:28.136 --> 00:04:30.735
to many other places

00:04:30.735 --> 00:04:33.412
and musicians around the world.

00:04:33.412 --> 00:04:36.381
My desire was to make it as a trek.

00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:38.147
To do all those films,

00:04:38.147 --> 00:04:39.778
it would have been impossible

00:04:39.778 --> 00:04:41.229
with a big company behind me,

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.630
with a structure or anything.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.711
I was traveling alone with a backpack —

00:04:45.711 --> 00:04:48.180
computer, camera, microphones in it.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.965
Alone, actually, but 
just with local people,

00:04:50.965 --> 00:04:53.800
meeting my team, which was absolutely not

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.715
professional people, on the spot there,

00:04:57.715 --> 00:04:59.976
going from one place to another

00:04:59.976 --> 00:05:01.457
and to make cinema as a trek.
