00:00:27.953 --> 00:00:31.936
that I started to make films 10 years ago,

00:00:31.936 --> 00:00:35.424
first with a friend, Christophe Abric.

00:00:35.424 --> 00:00:37.809
He had a website, La Blogothèque,

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.475
dedicated to independent music.

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:42.130
We were crazy about music.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.822
We wanted to represent 
music in a different way,

00:00:44.822 --> 00:00:47.410
to film the music we love,
the musicians we admired,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.871
as much as possible, far 
from the music industry

00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:53.253
and far from the cliches attached to it.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:56.219
We started to publish every week

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.969
sessions on the Internet.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.290
We are going to see a few extracts now.
