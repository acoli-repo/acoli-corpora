00:13:59.315 --> 00:14:01.420
in very different forms of cults,

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.308
and trying to understand 
how people live together

00:14:03.308 --> 00:14:04.753
with spirituality nowadays.

00:14:04.753 --> 00:14:08.489
BG: The man who is going to 
appear onstage momentarily,

00:14:08.489 --> 00:14:10.199
and Vincent's going to introduce him,

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:13.851
is one of the subjects of 
one of his past videos.

00:14:13.851 --> 00:14:15.718
When did you do a video with him?

00:14:15.718 --> 00:14:18.272
VM: I guess four years ago,

00:14:18.272 --> 00:14:20.758
four years in my first travel.

00:14:20.758 --> 00:14:23.602
BG: So it was one of 
your first ones in Brazil.

00:14:23.602 --> 00:14:25.833
VM: It was amongst the 
first ones in Brazil, yeah.

00:14:25.833 --> 00:14:27.290
I shot the film in Recife,

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:29.259
in the place where he is from.

00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:32.269
BG: So let's introduce him. 
Who are we waiting for?
