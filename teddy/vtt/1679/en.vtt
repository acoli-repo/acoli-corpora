Information technology grows in an exponential manner.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's not linear. And our intuition is linear.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
When we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
we made linear predictions where that animal would be,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and that worked fine. It's hardwired in our brains.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But the pace of exponential growth

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
is really what describes information technologies.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And it's not just computation.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
There is a big difference between linear and exponential growth.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If I take 30 steps linearly -- one, two, three, four, five --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I get to 30.
