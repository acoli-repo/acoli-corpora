I'm going to start with a little story.

00:00:02.092 --> 00:00:05.204
So, I grew up in this neighborhood. When I was 15 years old,

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:09.755
I went from being what I think was a strapping young athlete,

00:00:09.755 --> 00:00:13.716
over four months, slowly wasting away until

00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:15.604
I was basically a famine victim

00:00:15.604 --> 00:00:17.628
with an unquenchable thirst.

00:00:17.628 --> 00:00:21.237
I had basically digested away my body.

00:00:21.237 --> 00:00:25.531
And this all came to a head when I was on a backpacking trip,

00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:27.576
my first one ever actually, on Old Rag Mountain

00:00:27.576 --> 00:00:31.560
in West Virginia, and was putting my face into puddles
