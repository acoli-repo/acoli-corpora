00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.976
that it would immunize me
against making mistakes.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.976
And it worked

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.976
for a while,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.976
until I met Mrs. Drucker.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.976
I was a resident at a teaching
hospital here in Toronto

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.976
when Mrs. Drucker was brought
to the emergency department

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.976
of the hospital where I was working.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.476
At the time I was assigned
to the cardiology service

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.976
on a cardiology rotation.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.976
And it was my job,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.715
when the emergency staff called
for a cardiology consult,

00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:27.976
to see that patient in emerg.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.976
and to report back to my attending.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.976
And I saw Mrs. Drucker,
and she was breathless.
