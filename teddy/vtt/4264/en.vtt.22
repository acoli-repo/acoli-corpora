00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.239
and that's when my chief asked
to speak to me quietly in her office.

00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:06.976
And she said the three words:

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.976
Do you remember?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.976
"Do you remember that patient
you saw with the sore throat?"

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.334
Well it turns out, he didn't
have a strep throat.

00:11:15.358 --> 00:11:17.597
He had a potentially
life-threatening condition

00:11:17.621 --> 00:11:18.976
called epiglottitis.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.976
You can Google it,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.143
but it's an infection, not
of the throat, but of the upper airway,

00:11:24.167 --> 00:11:26.976
and it can actually cause
the airway to close.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.976
And fortunately he didn't die.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.976
He was placed on intravenous antibiotics
