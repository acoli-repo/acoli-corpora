00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.976
Why did I go into medicine?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.976
Slowly but surely,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.976
it lifted.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.976
I began to feel a bit better.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.976
And on a cloudy day,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.953
there was a crack in the clouds
and the sun started to come out

00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:12.976
and I wondered,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.976
maybe I could feel better again.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.976
And I made myself a bargain

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.976
that if only I redouble
my efforts to be perfect

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.976
and never make another mistake again,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.976
please make the voices stop.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.976
And they did.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.976
And I went back to work.
