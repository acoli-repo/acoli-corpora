Baseball is filled
with some amazing statistics.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.976
And there's hundreds of them.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
"Moneyball" is about to come out,
and it's all about statistics

00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:39.501
and using statistics to build
a great baseball team.

00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:41.976
I'm going to focus on one stat

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.976
that I hope a lot of you have heard of.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.976
It's called batting average.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.976
So we talk about a 300,
a batter who bats 300.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.976
That means that ballplayer
batted safely, hit safely

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.976
three times out of 10 at bats.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
That means hit the ball into the outfield,

00:00:58.024 --> 00:00:59.976
it dropped, it didn't get caught,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.239
and whoever tried to throw it to first
base didn't get there in time
