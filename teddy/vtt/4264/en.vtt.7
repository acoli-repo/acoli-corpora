00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the origins and exertions of every muscle,

00:03:30.024 --> 00:03:32.976
every branch of every artery
that came off the aorta,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.976
differential diagnoses obscure and common.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.976
I even knew the differential diagnosis

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
in how to classify renal tubular acidosis.

00:03:40.024 --> 00:03:41.976
And all the while,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.976
I was amassing more and more knowledge.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.976
And I did well, I graduated with honors,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.976
cum laude.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.976
And I came out of medical school

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.976
with the impression

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.429
that if I memorized everything
and knew everything,

00:03:55.453 --> 00:03:56.976
or as much as possible,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.976
as close to everything as possible,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.976
that it would immunize me
against making mistakes.
