00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.976
and talk about my mistakes,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.976
if I can't find the still-small voice

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.976
that tells me what really happened,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.976
how can I share it with my colleagues?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.976
How can I teach them about what I did

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.976
so that they don't do the same thing?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.976
If I were to walk into a room --

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.976
like right now, I have no
idea what you think of me.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.976
When was the last time
you heard somebody talk

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
about failure after failure after failure?

00:13:23.024 --> 00:13:24.976
Oh yeah, you go to a cocktail party

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.048
and you might hear
about some other doctor,

00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:28.976
but you're not going to hear somebody

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.976
talking about their own mistakes.
