00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.976
And I went back to work.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.976
And then it happened again.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.976
Two years later I was an attending
in the emergency department

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.191
at a community hospital
just north of Toronto,

00:10:39.215 --> 00:10:41.976
and I saw a 25 year-old
man with a sore throat.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.976
It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.976
He kept pointing here.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.334
I looked at his throat,
it was a little bit pink.

00:10:48.358 --> 00:10:50.454
And I gave him a prescription
for penicillin

00:10:50.478 --> 00:10:51.976
and sent him on his way.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.976
And even as he was walking out the door,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.976
he was still sort
of pointing to his throat.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.976
And two days later I came to do
my next emergency shift,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.239
and that's when my chief asked
to speak to me quietly in her office.
