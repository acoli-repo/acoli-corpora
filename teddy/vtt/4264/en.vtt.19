00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.976
It's the one that says,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.976
not that what you did was bad,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.976
but that you are bad.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.976
And it was what I was feeling.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.976
And it wasn't because of my attending;
he was a doll.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.429
He talked to the family, and I'm quite
sure that he smoothed things over

00:09:45.453 --> 00:09:47.976
and made sure that I didn't get sued.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.976
And I kept asking myself these questions.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.976
Why didn't I ask my attending?
Why did I send her home?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.976
And then at my worst moments:

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.976
Why did I make such a stupid mistake?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.976
Why did I go into medicine?
