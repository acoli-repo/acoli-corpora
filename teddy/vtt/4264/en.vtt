00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.976
I think we have to do something

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.976
about a piece of the culture
of medicine that has to change.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.976
And I think it starts
with one physician, and that's me.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.976
And maybe I've been around long enough

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.667
that I can afford to give away
some of my false prestige

00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:13.976
to be able to do that.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.096
Before I actually begin
the meat of my talk,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.976
let's begin with a bit of baseball.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.976
Hey, why not?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.976
We're near the end, we're getting
close to the World Series.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.976
We all love baseball, don't we?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.976
(Laughter)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.976
Baseball is filled
with some amazing statistics.
