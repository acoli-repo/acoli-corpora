00:08:28.263 --> 00:08:30.976
And at about the nine day

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.976
Mrs. Drucker,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.976

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.976
They say you never forget the names

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.976

the unhealthy shame that exists

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.976
in our culture of medicine --

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.976
where I felt alone, isolated,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.976
not feeling the healthy kind
of shame that you feel,
