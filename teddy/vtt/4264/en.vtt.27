00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.976
talking about their own mistakes.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.976
If I were to walk into a room
filled with my colleages

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.976
and ask for their support right now

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.429
and start to tell what I've just
told you right now,

00:13:38.453 --> 00:13:40.976
I probably wouldn't get
through two of those stories

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.477
before they would start
to get really uncomfortable,

00:13:43.501 --> 00:13:44.976
somebody would crack a joke,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
they'd change the subject
and we would move on.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.976
And in fact, if I knew
and my colleagues knew

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.976
that one of my orthopedic colleagues
took off the wrong leg in my hospital,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.976
believe me, I'd have trouble

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.976
making eye contact with that person.
