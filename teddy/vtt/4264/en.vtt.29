00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.976
And we have this idea

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.143
that if we drive the people
who make mistakes

00:14:34.167 --> 00:14:35.976
out of medicine,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.976
what will we be left
with, but a safe system.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.976
But there are two problems with that.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.976
In my 20 years or so

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.976
of medical broadcasting and journalism,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.239
I've made a personal study of medical
malpractice and medical errors

00:14:51.263 --> 00:14:52.976
to learn everything I can,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.810
from one of the first articles
I wrote for the Toronto Star

00:14:55.834 --> 00:14:57.976
to my show "White Coat, Black Art."

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.976
And what I've learned

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.976
is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous.
