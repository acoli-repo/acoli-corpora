00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:00.976
make them moist and garrulous

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.976
and put a little bit
of alcohol on their breath,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.239
and suddenly my history
is laced with contempt.

00:16:05.263 --> 00:16:06.976
I don't take the same history.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.976
I'm not a robot;

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.976
I don't do things the same way each time.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.976
And my patients aren't cars;

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.976
they don't tell me their symptoms
in the same way each time.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.976
Given all of that,
mistakes are inevitable.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.976
So if you take the system,
as I was taught,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.976
and weed out all the error-prone
health professionals,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
well there won't be anybody left.
