00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.976
In both cases, these
are gross underestimates,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.381
because we really aren't
ferreting out the problem

00:15:34.405 --> 00:15:35.976
as we should.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.976
And here's the thing.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.976
In a hospital system

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.976
where medical knowledge is doubling

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.976
every two or three years,
we can't keep up with it.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.976
Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.976
We can't get rid of it.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.976
We have our cognitive biases,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.143
so that I can take a perfect history
on a patient with chest pain.

00:15:57.167 --> 00:15:59.167
Now take the same patient with chest pain,

00:15:59.191 --> 00:16:00.976
make them moist and garrulous
