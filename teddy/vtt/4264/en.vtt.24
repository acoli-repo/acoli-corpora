00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.976
Now in both cases, I didn't send them home

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.334
and I don't think there
was any gap in their care.

00:12:04.358 --> 00:12:05.976
One I thought had a kidney stone.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.976
I ordered a kidney X-ray. When
it turned out to be normal,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.976
my colleague who was doing
a reassessment of the patient

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.976
noticed some tenderness in the right
lower quadrant and called the surgeons.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.976
The other one had a lot of diarrhea.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.976
I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.976
and asked my colleague to reassess him.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.976
And he did

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.976
and when he noticed some tenderness in the right
lower quadrant, called the surgeons.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.976
In both cases,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.976
they had their operations
and they did okay.
