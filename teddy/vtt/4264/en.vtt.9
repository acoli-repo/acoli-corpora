00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.976
And I saw Mrs. Drucker,
and she was breathless.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.976
And when I listened to her,
she was making a wheezy sound.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.976
And when I listened to her
chest with a stethoscope,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.976
I could hear crackly sounds on both sides

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.976
that told me that she was in congestive
heart failure.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.976
This is a condition
in which the heart fails,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.976
and instead of being able
to pump all the blood forward,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.976
some of the blood backs up into the lung,
the lungs fill up with blood,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.096
and that's why you have
shortness of breath.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.976
And that wasn't a difficult
diagnosis to make.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.976
I made it and I set to work treating her.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.976
I gave her aspirin. I gave her medications
to relieve the strain on her heart.
