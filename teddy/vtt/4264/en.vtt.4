00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.976
in a certain part
of a certain remote place

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.976
and you have a loved one

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.976
who has blockages in two coronary arteries

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.976
and your family doctor refers
that loved one to a cardiologist

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.976
who's batting 200 on angioplasties.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.976
But, but, you know what?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.976
She's doing a lot better this year.
She's on the comeback trail.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.976
And she's hitting a 257.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.976
Somehow this isn't working.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.976
But I'm going to ask you a question.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.976
What do you think a batting average

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.143
for a cardiac surgeon
or a nurse practitioner
