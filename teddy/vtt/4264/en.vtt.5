00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.143
for a cardiac surgeon
or a nurse practitioner

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:31.976
or an orthopedic surgeon,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.976
an OBGYN, a paramedic

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.976
is supposed to be?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.976
1,000, very good.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.976
Now truth of the matter is,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.976
nobody knows in all of medicine

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.976
what a good surgeon

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.976
or physician or paramedic

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.976
is supposed to bat.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.976
What we do though is we send
each one of them, including myself,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.976
out into the world

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.976
with the admonition, be perfect.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.976
Never ever, ever make a mistake,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.143
but you worry about the details,
about how that's going to happen.
