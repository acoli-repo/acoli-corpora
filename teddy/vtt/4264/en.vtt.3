00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.976
as in Ted Williams legendary --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.976
the last Major League Baseball player

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.976
to hit over 400 during a regular season.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.334
Now let's take this back
into my world of medicine

00:01:39.358 --> 00:01:40.976
where I'm a lot more comfortable,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.976
or perhaps a bit less comfortable

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.976
after what I'm going to talk to you about.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.976
Suppose you have appendicitis

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.976
and you're referred to a surgeon

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.976
who's batting 400 on appendectomies.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.976
(Laughter)

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.976
Somehow this isn't working out, is it?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.976
Now suppose you live

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.976
in a certain part
of a certain remote place
