00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.976
I gave her aspirin. I gave her medications
to relieve the strain on her heart.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.976
I gave her medications that we call
diuretics, water pills,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.976
to get her to pee out the access fluid.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.620
And over the course
of the next hour and a half or two,

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:11.976
she started to feel better.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.976
And I felt really good.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.976
And that's when I made my first mistake;

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.976
I sent her home.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.976
Actually, I made two more mistakes.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.976
I sent her home

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.976
without speaking to my attending.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.976
I didn't pick up the phone and do
what I was supposed to do,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.477
which was call my attending
and run the story by him
