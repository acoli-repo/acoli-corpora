95% of your nasal cavity

00:00:30.846 --> 00:00:33.981
is used just to filter that air
before it hits your lungs.

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:35.577
But at the very back of your nose

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:37.956
is a region called
the olfactory epithelium,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.695
a little patch of skin
that's key to everything you smell.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.917
The olfactory epithelium has
a layer of olfactory receptor cells,

00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:45.837
special neurons that sense smells,

00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:47.690
like the taste buds of your nose.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.857
When odor molecules hit
the back of your nose,

00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:53.262
they get stuck in a layer of mucus
covering the olfactory epithelium.

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:56.096
As they dissolve, they bind
to the olfactory receptor cells,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.764
which fire and send signals
through the olfactory tract

00:00:58.788 --> 00:00:59.918
up to your brain.

00:00:59.942 --> 00:01:01.601
As a side note, you can tell a lot
