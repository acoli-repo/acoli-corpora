As a side note, you can tell a lot

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:03.687
about how good
an animal's sense of smell is

00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:05.726
by the size of its olfactory epithelium.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.085
A dog's olfactory epithelium

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:09.479
is 20 times bigger
than your puny human one.

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:13.075
But there's still a lot we don't know
about this little patch of cells, too.

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:15.494
For example, our olfactory
epithelium is pigmented,

00:01:15.518 --> 00:01:17.669
and scientists don't really know why.

00:01:17.693 --> 00:01:20.556
But how do you actually tell
the difference between smells?

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.105
It turns out that your brain has

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:24.538
40 million different
olfactory receptor neurons,

00:01:24.562 --> 00:01:27.038
so odor A might trigger

00:01:27.062 --> 00:01:29.834
neurons 3, 427, and 988,

00:01:29.858 --> 00:01:32.096
and odor B might trigger
