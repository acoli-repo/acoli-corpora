00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.566
Each of those signals goes first
to a relay center

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.496
in the middle of the cerebral hemisphere

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.536
and then out to other
regions of the brain.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.576
But smell, because it evolved
before most of your other senses,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.486
takes a direct route
to these different regions of the brain,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.971
where it can trigger
your fight-or-flight response,

00:02:13.995 --> 00:02:16.475
help you recall memories,
or make your mouth water.

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.410
But even though we've all got
the same physiological set-up,

00:02:19.434 --> 00:02:21.629
two nostrils and millions
of olfactory neurons,

00:02:21.653 --> 00:02:23.434
not everybody smells the same things.

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:25.336
One of the most famous examples of this

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.805
is the ability to smell
so-called "asparagus pee."

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.639
For about a quarter of the population,

00:02:29.663 --> 00:02:31.226
urinating after eating asparagus
