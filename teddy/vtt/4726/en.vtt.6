00:02:59.783 --> 00:03:03.050
People with allicin anosmia
can't smell garlic.

00:03:03.074 --> 00:03:05.923
Those with eugenol anosmia
can't smell cloves.

00:03:05.947 --> 00:03:08.523
And some people can't smell anything

00:03:08.547 --> 00:03:09.727
at all.

00:03:09.751 --> 00:03:12.279
This kind of full anosmia
could have several causes.

00:03:12.303 --> 00:03:14.494
Some people are born
without a sense of smell.

00:03:14.518 --> 00:03:17.531
Others lose it after an accident
or during an illness.

00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:20.068
If the olfactory epithelium
gets swollen or infected,

00:03:20.092 --> 00:03:21.712
it can hamper your sense of smell,

00:03:21.736 --> 00:03:24.451
something you might have experienced
when you were sick.

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:27.774
Not being able to smell anything
can mess with your other senses, too.

00:03:27.798 --> 00:03:29.425
Many people who can't smell at all

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.031
also can't really taste
the same way the rest of us do.
