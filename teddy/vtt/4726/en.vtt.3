00:01:29.858 --> 00:01:32.096
and odor B might trigger

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.285
neurons 8, 76, and 2,496,678.

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:37.976
All of these different combinations

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.437
let you detect a staggeringly
broad array of smells.

00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:43.172
Olfactory neurons are always fresh
and ready for action.

00:01:43.196 --> 00:01:46.272
They're the only neuron in the body
that gets replaced regularly,

00:01:46.296 --> 00:01:47.626
every four to eight weeks.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.496
Once they are triggered,
the signal travels through a bundle

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.774
called the olfactory tract

00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:54.916
to destinations all over your brain,
making stops in the amygdala,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.486
the thalamus, and the neocortex.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.196
This is different from how sight
and sound are processed.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.566
Each of those signals goes first
to a relay center
