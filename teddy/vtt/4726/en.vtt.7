00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.031
also can't really taste
the same way the rest of us do.

00:03:32.055 --> 00:03:35.921
It turns out that how something tastes
is closely related to how it smells.

00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:38.836
As you chew your food,
air is pushed up your nasal passage,

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.845
carrying with it the smell of your food.

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:42.947
Those scents hit your olfactory epithelium

00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:45.357
and tell your brain a lot
about what you're eating.

00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:48.161
Without the ability to smell,
you lose the ability to taste

00:03:48.185 --> 00:03:50.346
anything more complicated
than the five tastes

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.965
your taste buds can detect:

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.457
sweet, salty,

00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:55.206
bitter, sour, and savory.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.230
So, the next time you smell exhaust fumes,

00:03:57.254 --> 00:03:58.948
salty sea air, or roast chicken,

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:00.890
you'll know exactly how you've done it
