00:02:29.663 --> 00:02:31.226
urinating after eating asparagus

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.082
means smelling a distinct odor.

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:35.578
The other 75% of us don't notice.

00:02:35.602 --> 00:02:38.862
And this isn't the only case
of smells differing from nose to nose.

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:41.909
For some people, the chemical
androstenone smells like vanilla;

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:44.082
to others, it smells like sweaty urine,

00:02:44.106 --> 00:02:45.130
which is unfortunate

00:02:45.154 --> 00:02:48.566
because androstenone is commonly found
in tasty things like pork.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.718
So with the sweaty urine smellers in mind,

00:02:50.742 --> 00:02:52.959
pork producers will castrate male pigs

00:02:52.983 --> 00:02:55.021
to stop them from making androstenone.

00:02:55.045 --> 00:02:57.791
The inability to smell a scent
is called anosmia,

00:02:57.815 --> 00:02:59.759
and there are about 100 known examples.

00:02:59.783 --> 00:03:03.050
People with allicin anosmia
can't smell garlic.
