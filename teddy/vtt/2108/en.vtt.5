00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:30.083
She puzzled and puzzled over every piece

00:02:30.107 --> 00:02:32.459
of her life and her parents' life,

00:02:32.483 --> 00:02:36.460
trying to understand what she was seeing.

00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:38.171
She thought about her town.

00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:41.159
The town had a vermiculite mine in it.

00:02:41.183 --> 00:02:43.992
Vermiculite was used
for soil conditioners,

00:02:44.016 --> 00:02:47.272
to make plants grow faster and better.

00:02:47.296 --> 00:02:50.330
Vermiculite was used to insulate lofts,

00:02:50.354 --> 00:02:52.977
huge amounts of it put under the roof

00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:56.828
to keep houses warm
during the long Montana winters.

00:02:56.852 --> 00:02:59.195
Vermiculite was in the playground.

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:00.648
It was in the football ground.
