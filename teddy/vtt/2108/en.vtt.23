00:11:27.467 --> 00:11:32.460
and I'll never be the same."

00:11:32.484 --> 00:11:35.756
We all enjoy so many freedoms today,

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.712
hard-won freedoms:

00:11:37.736 --> 00:11:41.180
the freedom to write and publish
without fear of censorship,

00:11:41.204 --> 00:11:44.955
a freedom that wasn't here
the last time I came to Hungary;

00:11:44.979 --> 00:11:47.441
a freedom to vote,
which women in particular

00:11:47.465 --> 00:11:49.920
had to fight so hard for;

00:11:49.944 --> 00:11:52.802
the freedom for people of different
ethnicities and cultures

00:11:52.826 --> 00:11:57.758
and sexual orientation to live
the way that they want.

00:11:57.782 --> 00:12:02.592
But freedom doesn't exist
if you don't use it,
