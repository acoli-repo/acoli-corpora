00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:30.898
Then, a few years later, her
father died at the age of 59,

00:01:30.922 --> 00:01:34.828
five days before he was due
to receive his pension.

00:01:34.852 --> 00:01:35.916
He'd been a miner.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.358
She thought he must just have
been worn out by the work.

00:01:41.382 --> 00:01:45.090
But then a few years
later, her mother died,

00:01:45.114 --> 00:01:48.107
and that seemed stranger still,

00:01:48.131 --> 00:01:50.941
because her mother came
from a long line of people

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:54.802
who just seemed to live forever.

00:01:54.826 --> 00:01:58.371
In fact, Gayla's uncle
is still alive to this day,

00:01:58.395 --> 00:02:00.545
and learning how to waltz.
