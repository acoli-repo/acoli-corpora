00:03:56.646 --> 00:04:00.002
But Gayla didn't stop.
She kept doing research.

00:04:00.026 --> 00:04:03.193
The advent of the Internet
definitely helped her.

00:04:03.217 --> 00:04:05.213
She talked to anybody she could.

00:04:05.237 --> 00:04:08.488
She argued and argued,
and finally she struck lucky

00:04:08.512 --> 00:04:10.688
when a researcher came through town

00:04:10.712 --> 00:04:13.122
studying the history of mines in the area,

00:04:13.146 --> 00:04:16.264
and she told him her story,
and at first, of course,

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:18.535
like everyone, he didn't believe her,

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:21.178
but he went back to Seattle
and he did his own research

00:04:21.202 --> 00:04:25.338
and he realized that she was right.

00:04:25.362 --> 00:04:29.400
So now she had an ally.

00:04:29.424 --> 00:04:31.990
Nevertheless, people still
didn't want to know.
