00:07:27.608 --> 00:07:30.246
asking all the same questions,

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.336
I found exactly the same number.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.387
Eighty-five percent.
That's a lot of silence.

00:07:37.411 --> 00:07:39.469
It's a lot of blindness.

00:07:39.493 --> 00:07:43.113
And what's really interesting is that when
I go to companies in Switzerland,

00:07:43.137 --> 00:07:46.531
they tell me, "This
is a uniquely Swiss problem."

00:07:46.555 --> 00:07:50.731
And when I go to Germany, they say,
"Oh yes, this is the German disease."

00:07:50.755 --> 00:07:53.041
And when I go to companies
in England, they say,

00:07:53.065 --> 00:07:56.780
"Oh, yeah, the British
are really bad at this."

00:07:56.804 --> 00:08:01.450
And the truth is, this is a human problem.
