00:08:56.231 --> 00:09:00.962
they're very loyal and quite
often very conservative people.

00:09:00.986 --> 00:09:04.867
They're hugely dedicated
to the institutions that they work for,

00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:07.174
and the reason that they speak up,

00:09:07.198 --> 00:09:10.056
the reason they insist on seeing,

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.553
is because they care so
much about the institution

00:09:13.577 --> 00:09:17.139
and want to keep it healthy.

00:09:17.163 --> 00:09:19.302
And the other thing that people often say

00:09:19.326 --> 00:09:22.530
about whistleblowers is,
"Well, there's no point,

00:09:22.554 --> 00:09:25.099
because you see what happens to them.

00:09:25.123 --> 00:09:26.413
They are crushed.

00:09:26.437 --> 00:09:30.155
Nobody would want to go
through something like that."
