00:00:01.268 --> 00:00:04.829
In the northwest corner
of the United States,

00:00:04.853 --> 00:00:07.703
right up near the Canadian border,

00:00:07.727 --> 00:00:11.529
there's a little town
called Libby, Montana,

00:00:11.553 --> 00:00:16.014
and it's surrounded
by pine trees and lakes

00:00:16.038 --> 00:00:20.737
and just amazing wildlife

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:26.075
and these enormous trees
that scream up into the sky.

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.594
And in there is a little town
called Libby,

00:00:29.618 --> 00:00:33.939
which I visited, which feels
kind of lonely,
