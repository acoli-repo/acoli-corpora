post-traumatic stress syndrome

00:11:02.715 --> 00:11:08.299
that she set up a cafe
in the middle of a military town

00:11:08.323 --> 00:11:13.929
to give them legal, psychological
and medical assistance.

00:11:13.953 --> 00:11:16.869

"You know, Margaret,

00:11:16.893 --> 00:11:20.662
I always used to say I didn't
know what I wanted to be

00:11:20.686 --> 00:11:22.950
when I grow up.

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:27.443
But I've found myself in this cause,

00:11:27.467 --> 00:11:32.460
and I'll never be the same."
