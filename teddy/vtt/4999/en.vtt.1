00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:30.557
We’ve honed in on these three moons 
because each is an ‘ocean world,’

00:00:30.557 --> 00:00:33.587
an environment that contains 
a liquid ocean–

00:00:33.587 --> 00:00:37.877
and liquid can support 
the formation of life.

00:00:37.877 --> 00:00:42.884
Living organisms have to be able to grow, 
reproduce, and feed themselves,

00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:44.072
among other things.

00:00:44.072 --> 00:00:48.402
All of those functions require the 
formation of complex molecules

00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:50.400
from more basic components.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.330
Liquids such as water allow chemical 
compounds to remain in suspension

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.306
instead of sinking under 
the force of gravity.

00:00:58.306 --> 00:01:03.216
This enables them to interact frequently
in a 3-dimensional space and,
