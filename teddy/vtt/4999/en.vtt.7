This compound’s particular chemistry means
it’s not as supportive a medium as water.

00:03:32.144 --> 00:03:35.806
But, paired with the high quantities 
of organic material

00:03:35.806 --> 00:03:38.086
that also rain down from the sky,

00:03:38.086 --> 00:03:43.736
these bodies of liquid methane could
possibly support unfamiliar life forms.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.250
So what might indicate that life exists on
these or other worlds?

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.310
If it is out there, astrobiologists 
speculate that it would be microscopic,

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.130
comparable to the bacteria 
we have on earth.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.190
This would make it difficult to directly 
observe from a great distance,
