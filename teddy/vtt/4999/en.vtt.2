00:00:58.306 --> 00:01:03.216
This enables them to interact frequently
in a 3-dimensional space and,

00:01:03.216 --> 00:01:04.626
in the right conditions,

00:01:04.626 --> 00:01:09.926
go through chemical reactions that 
lead to the formation of living matter.

00:01:09.926 --> 00:01:12.209
That alone isn’t enough;

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:16.469
the small but complex biomolecules 
that we’re familiar with

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:18.321
are sensitive to temperature—

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:21.321
too hot or cold, and they won’t mix.

00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:24.431
Liquid water has an additional advantage

00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:26.901
in that it’s relatively 
temperature-stable,

00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:31.661
meaning it can insulate molecules against
large shifts in heat.
