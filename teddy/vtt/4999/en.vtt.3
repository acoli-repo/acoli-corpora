00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:31.661
meaning it can insulate molecules against
large shifts in heat.

00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:35.782
On Earth, these and other conditions in 
aquatic environments

00:01:35.782 --> 00:01:39.685
may have supported the emergence 
of life billions of years ago.

00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:44.765
Tantalizingly, the same could be true
in other parts of our solar system,

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:48.067
like these three icy moons.

00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:50.387
Europa, which is a moon of Jupiter,

00:01:50.387 --> 00:01:53.817
is probably the most 
intriguing ocean world.

00:01:53.817 --> 00:01:57.877
Beneath a surface layer of ice thicker 
than Mount Everest,

00:01:57.877 --> 00:02:02.395
there exists a liquid ocean as much as
100 kilometers deep.
