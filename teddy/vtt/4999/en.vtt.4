00:01:57.877 --> 00:02:02.395
there exists a liquid ocean as much as
100 kilometers deep.

00:02:02.395 --> 00:02:06.775
Astrobiologists think this hidden 
ocean could harbor life.

00:02:06.775 --> 00:02:08.643
Thanks to the Galileo probe,

00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:11.563
we can deduce that its 
potential salt content

00:02:11.563 --> 00:02:14.963
is similar to that of some lakes on Earth.

00:02:14.963 --> 00:02:19.993
But most of its characteristics will be a 
mystery until we can explore it further.

00:02:19.993 --> 00:02:25.500
Like Jupiter, Saturn also has moons that 
might have the right conditions for life.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.560
For instance– Enceladus is a tiny ball of 
ice that’s small enough to nestle
