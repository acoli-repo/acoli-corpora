For instance– Enceladus is a tiny ball of 
ice that’s small enough to nestle

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.669
within the surface area 
of the Gulf of Mexico.

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:38.839
Similarly to Europa, it likely contains an
ocean deep under the ice.

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:41.667
But Enceladus also has geysers

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:46.657
that frequently vent water vapor and 
tiny ice grains into space.

00:02:46.657 --> 00:02:50.123
Astrobiologists are curious about whether
these geysers

00:02:50.123 --> 00:02:52.483
are connected to the ocean below.

00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:56.673
They hope to send a probe to test whether
the geysers’ plumes of vapor

00:02:56.673 --> 00:03:01.248
contain life-enabling material
from that hidden sea.
