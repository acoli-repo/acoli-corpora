00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.190
This would make it difficult to directly 
observe from a great distance,

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.859
so astrobiologists seek clues 
called biosignatures.

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:11.779
Those may be cells, fossils, or mineral 
traces left behind by living things.

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:16.541
And finding any biosignatures will be 
challenging for many reasons.

00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:18.220
One of the biggest concerns

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.460
is to make sure we sterilize our 
probes extremely thoroughly.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.517
Otherwise we could accidentally 
contaminate ocean worlds

00:04:26.517 --> 00:04:28.640
with Earth’s own bacteria,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.530
which could destroy alien life.
