00:02:56.673 --> 00:03:01.248
contain life-enabling material
from that hidden sea.

00:03:01.248 --> 00:03:04.601
Although it’s the best known substance 
for nurturing life,

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:09.651
water isn’t necessarily the only medium
that can support living things.

00:03:09.651 --> 00:03:12.704
Take Titan, Saturn’s largest moon,

00:03:12.704 --> 00:03:14.954
which has a thick nitrogen atmosphere

00:03:14.954 --> 00:03:18.564
containing methane and many other 
organic molecules.

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:22.284
Its clouds condense and 
rain onto Titan’s surface,

00:03:22.284 --> 00:03:26.394
sustaining lakes and seas 
full of liquid methane.

00:03:26.394 --> 00:03:32.144
This compound’s particular chemistry means
it’s not as supportive a medium as water.
