Cloe Shasha Brooks: Hello, TED Community,

00:00:07.204 --> 00:00:09.072
you are watching a TED interview series

00:00:09.106 --> 00:00:11.408
called How to Deal
with Difficult Feelings.

00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:14.711
Iâ€™m your host, Cloe Shasha Brooks,
and a curator at TED.

00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:18.682
This past year has been full
of both personal and collective grief.

00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:21.585
And this grief has taken many forms.

00:00:21.618 --> 00:00:25.289
And to dive deeper into the world
of understanding and managing grief,

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.758
I'll be speaking first
with Nina Westbrook,

00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:32.829
a marriage and family therapist
who has supported clients through loss.
