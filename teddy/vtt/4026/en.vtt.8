00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.810
on an anti-Muslim poster campaign

00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:03.705
with the MTA -- that's
the New York City subway system.

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.575
Now, the posters were truly offensive,

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.360
not to mentioned poorly designed --

00:04:07.384 --> 00:04:09.218
I mean, if you're going to be bigoted,

00:04:09.242 --> 00:04:10.994
you might as well use a better font.

00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:12.019
(Laughter)

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:15.995
But we decided, why not launch
our own poster campaign

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.893
that says nice things about Muslims,

00:04:17.917 --> 00:04:19.164
while promoting the movie.

00:04:19.188 --> 00:04:21.313
So myself and fellow comedian
Dean Obeidallah

00:04:21.337 --> 00:04:24.833
decided to launch the fighting-bigotry-
with-delightful-posters campaign.

00:04:24.857 --> 00:04:28.607
We raised the money, worked
with the MTA for over 5 months,

00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:29.942
got the posters approved,

00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:32.845
and two days after they
were supposed to go up,
