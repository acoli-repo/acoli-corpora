00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:06.143
I'm an Iranian-American Muslim female,

00:00:06.167 --> 00:00:07.431
like all of you.

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:09.764
And I'm also a social justice comedian,

00:00:09.788 --> 00:00:12.103
something that I insist is an actual job.

00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:14.794
To explain what that is,
let me tell you how I got here.

00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:16.573
I've performed all over the country.

00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:18.894
And let me tell you,
America is majestic, right?

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:20.643
It's got breathtaking nature,

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:21.817
waffle houses

00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:23.824
and diabetes as far as the eye can see.

00:00:23.848 --> 00:00:25.760
It is really something.

00:00:25.784 --> 00:00:28.023
Now, the American population
can be broken up

00:00:28.047 --> 00:00:29.588
into three main categories:

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:31.350
there's mostly wonderful people,
