00:02:29.836 --> 00:02:33.534
the average American prefers comedy,
as you can see from this graph.

00:02:33.558 --> 00:02:34.709
(Laughter)

00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:36.093
Comedy is very popular.

00:02:36.117 --> 00:02:37.268
And by the way,

00:02:37.292 --> 00:02:39.238
this is a mathematically accurate graph,

00:02:39.262 --> 00:02:40.786
generated from fake numbers.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.287
(Laughter)

00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:43.496
Now, the question is:

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.305
Why does social justice comedy work?

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.028
Because, first off, it makes you laugh.

00:02:49.052 --> 00:02:52.214
And when you're laughing,
you enter into a state of openness.

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:53.796
And in that moment of openness,

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.484
a good social justice comedian
can stick in a whole bunch of information,

00:02:57.508 --> 00:02:59.038
and if they're really skilled,

00:02:59.062 --> 00:03:00.213
a rectal exam.
