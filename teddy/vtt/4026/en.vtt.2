00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.282
This is not an exhaustive list;

00:01:01.306 --> 00:01:02.980
I'm probably missing 3-7 items.

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:04.226
But the point is,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.979
we have to reckon with the haters.

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:07.814
But there's variance within this group

00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:10.859
and it's not efficient to go
after all of them, right?

00:01:10.883 --> 00:01:14.396
So what I've done is created
a highly scientific Taxonomy of Haters.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.143
I basically took all of the haters,

00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:19.013
I put them in a petri dish,
like a scientist,

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:20.496
and this is what I found.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.671
(Laughter)

00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:23.989
First off, we have the trolls.

00:01:24.013 --> 00:01:26.396
These are your garden-variety
digital haters.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.286
They're the people who quit their jobs

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.424
so they can post on YouTube
videos all day long.
