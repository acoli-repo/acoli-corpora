00:02:59.062 --> 00:03:00.213
a rectal exam.

00:03:00.237 --> 00:03:02.770
(Laughter)

00:03:02.794 --> 00:03:05.995
Here are some ground rules
for social justice comedy:

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.978
first off, it's not partisan.

00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:10.543
This isn't political comedy,
this is about justice,

00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:12.264
and no one is against justice.

00:03:12.288 --> 00:03:14.281
Two, it's inviting and warm,

00:03:14.305 --> 00:03:17.066
it makes you feel like you're sitting
inside of a burrito.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.495
Three, it's funny but sneaky,

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.315
like you could be hearing
an interesting treatise

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:23.553
on income inequality,

00:03:23.577 --> 00:03:26.491
that's encased in a really
sophisticated poop joke.

00:03:26.515 --> 00:03:28.134
(Laughter)

00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:31.181
Here's how I see
social justice comedy working.
