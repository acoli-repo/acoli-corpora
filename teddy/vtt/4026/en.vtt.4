00:01:57.827 --> 00:02:01.365
These guys like to hate
via a seemingly nice organization,

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:03.562
like a church or a nonprofit,

00:02:03.586 --> 00:02:06.300
and they oftentimes like to speak
in an old-timey voice.

00:02:06.324 --> 00:02:10.864
But the group I'm most
interested in is the swing hater.

00:02:10.888 --> 00:02:14.475
The swing hater is sister
to the swing voter --

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:16.228
they just can't decide!

00:02:16.252 --> 00:02:18.130
They're like ideological sluts

00:02:18.154 --> 00:02:20.144
who move from hating to not hating.

00:02:20.168 --> 00:02:22.923
And they do it because they don't have
enough information.

00:02:22.947 --> 00:02:25.925
This is the group I like to target
with social justice comedy.

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:27.259
Why comedy?

00:02:27.283 --> 00:02:29.812
Because on a scale of comedy to brochure,

00:02:29.836 --> 00:02:33.534
the average American prefers comedy,
as you can see from this graph.
