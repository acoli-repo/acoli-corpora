00:04:58.937 --> 00:05:01.525
they have great frittata recipes.

00:05:01.549 --> 00:05:06.056
Now clearly, frittatas are considered
political by the MTA.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.537
Either that, or the mere mention
of Muslims in a positive light

00:05:09.561 --> 00:05:11.585
was considered political -- but it isn't.

00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:12.862
It's about justice.

00:05:12.886 --> 00:05:14.045
So we decided to change

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.677
our fighting-bigortry-
with-delightful-posters campaign

00:05:16.701 --> 00:05:20.180
and turn it into the fighting-bigotry-
with-a-delightful-lawsuit campaign.

00:05:20.224 --> 00:05:21.839
(Laughter)

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:24.827
So basically, what I'm saying
is a couple of dirt-bag comedians

00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:27.382
took on a major New York City agency

00:05:27.406 --> 00:05:28.946
and the comedians won.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.546
(Applause and cheers)
