Here's how I see
social justice comedy working.

00:03:31.205 --> 00:03:34.503
A few years ago, I rounded up a bunch
of Muslim-American comedians --

00:03:34.527 --> 00:03:35.693
in a non-violent way --

00:03:35.717 --> 00:03:37.241
(Laughter)

00:03:37.265 --> 00:03:38.737
And we went around the country

00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:41.698
to places like Alabama, Arizona,
Tennessee, Georgia --

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:43.921
places where they love the Muzzies --

00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:46.633
and we did stand-up shows.

00:03:46.657 --> 00:03:48.971
We called the tour
"The Muslims Are Coming!"

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:51.260
(Laughter)

00:03:51.284 --> 00:03:52.990
We turned this into a movie,

00:03:53.014 --> 00:03:55.238
and then after the movie came out,

00:03:55.262 --> 00:03:58.665
a known hate group spent 300,000 dollars

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.810
on an anti-Muslim poster campaign
