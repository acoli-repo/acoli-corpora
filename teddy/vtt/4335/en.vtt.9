00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.216
And you can also see other features
like oxygen and nitrogen

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.696
in that white glimmer

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.056
in the circle showing you the auroras

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.976
and also some wisps around the tropics.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.016
So these are pictures
that conclusively show us

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.736
that our atmosphere isn't just
tightly bound to us here on Earth

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.376
but it's actually
reaching out far into space,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.320
and at an alarming rate, I might add.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.896

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.376
Mars, our nearest neighbor,
is much smaller than Earth,
