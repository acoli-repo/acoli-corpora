00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.736
So you can see that gravity
is really at play here.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.056
But another fundamental
characteristic about planets

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.816
is what you don't see here,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.416
and that's the star, the Sun,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.560
that all of the planets
in the solar system are orbiting around.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.920
And that's fundamentally driving
atmospheric escape.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.096
The reason that fundamentally stars
drive atmospheric escape from planets

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.496
is because stars offer planets
particles and light and heat

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.616
that can cause the atmospheres to go away.
