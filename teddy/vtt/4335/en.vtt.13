00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.760
like why Mars is red,
from that lost hydrogen.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.096
But hydrogen isn't
the only gas that's lost.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.296
I mentioned helium on Earth
and some oxygen and nitrogen,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.096
and from MAVEN we can also look
at the oxygen being lost from Mars.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.576
And you can see
that because oxygen is heavier,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.736
it can't get as far as the hydrogen,

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.936
but it's still escaping
away from the planet.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.040
You don't see it all confined
into that red circle.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.816
So the fact that we not only see
atmospheric escape on our own planet

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.456
but we can study it elsewhere
and send spacecraft
