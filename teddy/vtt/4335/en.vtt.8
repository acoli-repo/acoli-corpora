00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.976
that interplay
between heating from the star

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.320
and overcoming the force
of gravity on the planet.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.736
So I've told you that it happens

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.096
at the rate of 400 pounds
a minute for hydrogen

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.200
and almost seven pounds for helium.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.696
But what does that look like?

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.536
Well, even in the '80s,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.296
we took pictures of the Earth

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.776
in the ultraviolet

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.696
using NASA's Dynamic Explorer spacecraft.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.536
So these two images of the Earth

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.296
show you what that glow
of escaping hydrogen looks like,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.576
shown in red.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.216
And you can also see other features
like oxygen and nitrogen
