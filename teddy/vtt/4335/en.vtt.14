WEBVTT

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.456
but we can study it elsewhere
and send spacecraft

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.576
allows us to learn
about the past of planets

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.856
but also about planets in general

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.656
and Earth's future.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.336
So one way we actually
can learn about the future

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.440
is by planets so far away
that we can't see.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.496
And I should just note though,
before I go on to that,

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.976
I'm not going to show you
photos like this of Pluto,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.416
which might be disappointing,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.456
but that's because we don't have them yet.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.736
But the New Horizons mission
is currently studying atmospheric escape

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.096
being lost from the planet.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.840
So stay tuned and look out for that.
