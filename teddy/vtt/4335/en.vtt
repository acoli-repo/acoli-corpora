00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.735
So when you look out
at the stars at night,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.216
it's amazing what you can see.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.696
It's beautiful.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.816
But what's more amazing
is what you can't see,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.216
because what we know now

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.616
is that around every star
or almost every star,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.896
there's a planet,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.120
or probably a few.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.216
So what this picture isn't showing you

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.376
are all the planets that we know about

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.800
out there in space.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.496
But when we think about planets,
we tend to think of faraway things

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.376
that are very different from our own.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.816
But here we are on a planet,
