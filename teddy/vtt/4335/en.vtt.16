00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.936
where the planets are blocking
the light from the star

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.240
that allows us to see that light blinking.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.816
And by surveying the stars
in the night sky

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.256
for this blinking motion,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.936
we are able to find planets.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.136
This is how we've now been able
to detect over 5,000 planets

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.376
in our own Milky Way,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.256
and we know there are
many more out there, like I mentioned.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.176
So when we look at the light
from these stars,

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.696
what we see, like I said,
is not the planet itself,

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.776
but you actually see
a dimming of the light

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.456
that we can record in time.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.895
So the light drops as the planet
decreases in front of the star,
