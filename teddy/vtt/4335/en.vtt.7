00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.616
that can cause the atmospheres to go away.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.456
So if you think of a hot-air balloon,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.616
or you look at this picture
of lanterns in Thailand at a festival,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.136
you can see that hot air
can propel gasses upward.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.416
And if you have enough energy and heating,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.776
which our Sun does,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.696
that gas, which is so light
and only bound by gravity,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.480
it can escape into space.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.536
And so this is what's actually
causing atmospheric escape

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.256
here on Earth and also on other planets --

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.976
that interplay
between heating from the star
