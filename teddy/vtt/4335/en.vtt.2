00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.760
And this is gas that is going off
and never coming back.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.456
So hydrogen, helium and many other things

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.336
make up what's known
as the Earth's atmosphere.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.176
The atmosphere is just these gases
that form a thin blue line

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.416
that's seen here from
the International Space Station,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.680
a photograph that some astronauts took.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.576
And this tenuous veneer around our planet

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.936
is what allows life to flourish.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.816
It protects our planet
from too many impacts,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.856
from meteorites and the like.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.656
And it's such an amazing phenomenon
