00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.056
all around the planet

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.576
that's making it look puffier

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.920
and thus blocking
more of the light that you see.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.776
So using this technique,
we've actually been able to discover

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.056
a few transiting exoplanets
that are undergoing atmospheric escape.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.896
And these planets
can be called hot Jupiters,

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.536
for some of the ones we've found.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.136
And that's because
they're gas planets like Jupiter,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.936
but they're so close to their star,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.216
about a hundred times closer than Jupiter.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.696
And because there's all this
lightweight gas that's ready to escape,

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.416
and all this heating from the star,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.256
you have completely catastrophic rates
of atmospheric escape.
