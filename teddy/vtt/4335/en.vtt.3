00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.656
And it's such an amazing phenomenon

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.496
that the fact that it's disappearing

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.320
should frighten you,
at least a little bit.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.456
So this process is something that I study

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.720
and it's called atmospheric escape.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.256
So atmospheric escape
is not specific to planet Earth.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.016
It's part of what it means
to be a planet, if you ask me,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.376
because planets, not just here on Earth
but throughout the universe,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.976
can undergo atmospheric escape.
