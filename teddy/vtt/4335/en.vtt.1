00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.816
But here we are on a planet,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.136
and there are so many things
that are amazing about Earth

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.336
that we're searching far and wide
to find things that are like that.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.856
And when we're searching,
we're finding amazing things.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.096
But I want to tell you
about an amazing thing here on Earth.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.856
And that is that every minute,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.296
400 pounds of hydrogen

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.936
and almost seven pounds of helium

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.800
escape from Earth into space.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.760
And this is gas that is going off
and never coming back.
