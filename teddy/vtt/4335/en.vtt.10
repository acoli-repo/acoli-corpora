Mars, our nearest neighbor,
is much smaller than Earth,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.176
so it has much less gravity
with which to hold on to its atmosphere.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.416
And so even though Mars has an atmosphere,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.656
we can see it's much thinner
than the Earth's.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.136
Just look at the surface.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.616
You see craters indicating
that it didn't have an atmosphere

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.496
that could stop those impacts.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.296
Also, we see that it's the "red planet,"

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.856
and atmospheric escape plays a role

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.456
in Mars being red.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.056
That's because we think
Mars used to have a wetter past,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.656
and when water had enough energy,
it broke up into hydrogen and oxygen,
