00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.976
that was actually close to the Sun,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.616
and get rid of all the gas in it?

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.696
We now think that if you start
with something like a hot Jupiter,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.536
you actually can't end up
with Mercury or the Earth.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.736
But if you started with something smaller,

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.536
it's possible that enough gas
would have gotten away

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.696
that it would have
significantly impacted it

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.056
and left you with something very different
than what you started with.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.976
So all of this sounds sort of general,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.536
and we might think about the solar system,

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.336
but what does this have to do
with us here on Earth?

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.136
Well, in the far future,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.296
the Sun is going to get brighter.
