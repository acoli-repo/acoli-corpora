00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.136
for the purposes of this talk
and atmospheric escape,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.176
Pluto is a planet in my mind,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.136
in the same way that planets
around other stars that we can't see

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.936
are also planets.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.656
So fundamental characteristics of planets

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.696
include the fact that they are bodies

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.536
that are bound together by gravity.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.056
So it's a lot of material
just stuck together

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.680
with this attractive force.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.096
And these bodies are so big
and have so much gravity.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.416
That's why they're round.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.056
So when you look at all of these,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.296
including Pluto,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.520
they're round.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.736
So you can see that gravity
is really at play here.
