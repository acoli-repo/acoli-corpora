00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.656
and when water had enough energy,
it broke up into hydrogen and oxygen,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.416
and hydrogen being so light,
it escaped into space,

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.376
and the oxygen that was left

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.216
oxidized or rusted the ground,

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.960
making that familiar
rusty red color that we see.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.896
So it's fine to look at pictures of Mars

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.376
and say that atmospheric escape
probably happened,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.496
but NASA has a probe that's currently
at Mars called the MAVEN satellite,

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.056
and its actual job
is to study atmospheric escape.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.656
It's the Mars Atmosphere
and Volatile Evolution spacecraft.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.336
And results from it have already
shown pictures very similar
