00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.256
you have completely catastrophic rates
of atmospheric escape.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.896
So unlike our 400 pounds per minute
of hydrogen being lost on Earth,

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.176
for these planets,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.280
you're losing 1.3 billion
pounds of hydrogen every minute.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.656
So you might think, well,
does this make the planet cease to exist?

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.696
And this is a question
that people wondered

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.536
when they looked at our solar system,

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.896
because planets
closer to the Sun are rocky,

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.856
and planets further away
are bigger and more gaseous.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.256
Could you have started
with something like Jupiter

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.976
that was actually close to the Sun,
