00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.840
So stay tuned and look out for that.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.696
But the planets
that I did want to talk about

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.016
are known as transiting exoplanets.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.816
So any planet orbiting a star
that's not our Sun

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.776
is called an exoplanet,
or extrasolar planet.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.256
And these planets that we call transiting

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.536
have the special feature

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.656
that if you look
at that star in the middle,

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.056
you'll see that actually it's blinking.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.936
And the reason that it's blinking

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.976
is because there are planets
that are going past it all the time,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.136
and it's that special orientation

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.936
where the planets are blocking
the light from the star
