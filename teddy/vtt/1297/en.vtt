00:00:00.148 --> 00:00:03.530
I'm going to talk to you about optimism --

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.013
or more precisely, the optimism bias.

00:00:06.013 --> 00:00:07.658
It's a cognitive illusion

00:00:07.658 --> 00:00:10.400
that we've been studying in my lab for the past few years,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.135
and 80 percent of us have it.

00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:14.869
It's our tendency to overestimate

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.792
our likelihood of experiencing good events in our lives

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:21.900
and underestimate our likelihood of experiencing bad events.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.917
So we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer,

00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:26.423
being in a car accident.

00:00:26.423 --> 00:00:29.609
We overestimate our longevity, our career prospects.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.054
In short, we're more optimistic than realistic,
