00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:30.148
along with a bomb that has a 50% chance
of blowing up after the lid is closed.

00:01:30.148 --> 00:01:32.756
Until we reopen the lid,
there is no way of knowing

00:01:32.756 --> 00:01:35.281
whether the bomb exploded or not,

00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:40.531
and thus, no way of knowing
if the cat is alive or dead.

00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:43.834
In quantum physics,
we could say that before our observation

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:46.606
the cat was in a superposition state.

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:51.656
It was neither alive nor dead but
rather in a mixture of both possibilities,

00:01:51.656 --> 00:01:54.678
with a 50% chance for each.

00:01:54.678 --> 00:01:58.842
The same sort of thing happens
to physical systems at quantum scales,

00:01:58.842 --> 00:02:01.611
like an electron orbiting
in a hydrogen atom.
