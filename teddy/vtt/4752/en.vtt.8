00:03:57.526 --> 00:04:00.350
one blows up and the other doesn't?

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.496
You might be thinking,

00:04:01.496 --> 00:04:03.806
"This is just some theoretical
mumbo jumbo.

00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:06.388
This sort of thing can't happen
in the real world."

00:04:06.388 --> 00:04:08.923
But it turns out that quantum entanglement


00:04:08.923 --> 00:04:12.157
has been confirmed in 
real world lab experiments.

00:04:12.157 --> 00:04:15.794
Two subatomic particles entangled
in a superposition state,

00:04:15.794 --> 00:04:19.663
where if one spins one way
then the other must spin the other way,

00:04:19.663 --> 00:04:22.450
will do just that,
even when there's no way


00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.986
for information to pass
from one particle to the other

00:04:25.986 --> 00:04:30.007
indicating which way to spin
to obey the rules of entanglement.
