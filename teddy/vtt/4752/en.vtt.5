Suppose that instead of one cat in a box,
we have two cats in two different boxes.

00:02:31.157 --> 00:02:34.820
If we repeat the Schrödinger's cat experiment
with this pair of cats,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.780
the outcome of the experiment
can be one of four possibilities.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.869
Either both cats will be alive,
or both will be dead,

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:45.700
or one will be alive 
and the other dead, or vice versa.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.117
The system of both cats
is again in a superposition state,

00:02:49.117 --> 00:02:53.644
with each outcome having a 25% chance
rather than 50%.

00:02:53.644 --> 00:02:55.897
But here's the cool thing:

00:02:55.897 --> 00:02:58.508
quantum mechanics tells us
it's possible to erase

00:02:58.508 --> 00:03:03.984
the both cats alive and both cats dead
outcomes from the superposition state.
