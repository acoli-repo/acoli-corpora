00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.628
Consider throwing a ball
straight into the air.

00:00:10.628 --> 00:00:13.852
Can you predict the motion
of the ball after it leaves your hand?

00:00:13.852 --> 00:00:15.176
Sure, that's easy.

00:00:15.176 --> 00:00:18.730
The ball will move upward
until it gets to some highest point,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.668
then it will come back down
and land in your hand again.

00:00:21.668 --> 00:00:23.386
Of course, that's what happens,

00:00:23.386 --> 00:00:26.765
and you know this because you have
witnessed events like this countless times.

00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:31.417
You've been observing the physics
of everyday phenomena your entire life.
