00:00:59.703 --> 00:01:03.702
behaves according to the laws 
of classical mechanics.

00:01:03.702 --> 00:01:05.880
But systems on the scale of atoms

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.870
behave according to the laws 
of quantum mechanics.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.432
This quantum world turns out to be
a very strange place.

00:01:13.432 --> 00:01:17.932
An illustration of quantum strangeness
is given by a famous thought experiment:

00:01:17.932 --> 00:01:20.090
Schrödinger's cat.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.449
A physicist, who doesn't particularly 
like cats, puts a cat in a box,

00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:30.148
along with a bomb that has a 50% chance
of blowing up after the lid is closed.
