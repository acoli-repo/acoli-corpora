00:02:58.508 --> 00:03:03.984
the both cats alive and both cats dead
outcomes from the superposition state.

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:06.819
In other words,
there can be a two cat system,

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.502
such that the outcome will always be
one cat alive and the other cat dead.

00:03:12.502 --> 00:03:17.395
The technical term for this is that the
states of the cats are entangled.

00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:21.022
But there's something truly mindblowing
about quantum entanglement.

00:03:21.022 --> 00:03:25.011
If you prepare the system of two cats
in boxes in this entangled state,

00:03:25.011 --> 00:03:28.957
then move the boxes to opposite 
ends of the universe,

00:03:28.957 --> 00:03:32.752
the outcome of the experiment
will still always be the same.
