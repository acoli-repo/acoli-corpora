00:01:58.842 --> 00:02:01.611
like an electron orbiting
in a hydrogen atom.

00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:04.186
The electron isn't really orbiting at all.

00:02:04.186 --> 00:02:07.144
It's sort of everywhere in space,
all at once,

00:02:07.144 --> 00:02:10.920
with more of a probability of being
at some places than others,

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.000
and it's only after 
we measure its position

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.876
that we can pinpoint where it is
at that moment.

00:02:15.876 --> 00:02:18.971
A lot like how we didn't know
whether the cat was alive or dead

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:20.831
until we opened the box.

00:02:20.831 --> 00:02:23.576
This brings us to the strange
and beautiful phenomenon

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.871
of quantum entanglement.

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:31.157
Suppose that instead of one cat in a box,
we have two cats in two different boxes.
