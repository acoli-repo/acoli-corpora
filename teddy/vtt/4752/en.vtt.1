You've been observing the physics
of everyday phenomena your entire life.

00:00:31.417 --> 00:00:35.884
But suppose we explore a question
about the physics of atoms,

00:00:35.884 --> 00:00:37.950
like what does the motion of an electron

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.906
around the nucleus of a 
hydrogen atom look like?

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:45.045
Could we answer that question based on
our experience with everyday physics?

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.872
Definietly not. Why?

00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:51.474
Because the physics that governs the
behavior of systems at such small scales

00:00:51.474 --> 00:00:55.224
is much different than the physics
of the macroscopic objects

00:00:55.224 --> 00:00:57.690
you see around you all the time.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.703
The everyday world you know and love

00:00:59.703 --> 00:01:03.702
behaves according to the laws 
of classical mechanics.
