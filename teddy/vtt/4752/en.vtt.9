00:04:25.986 --> 00:04:30.007
indicating which way to spin
to obey the rules of entanglement.

00:04:30.007 --> 00:04:32.960
It's not surprising then that
entanglement is at the core

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.301
of quantum information science,

00:04:35.301 --> 00:04:39.486
a growing field studying how to use
the laws of the strange quantum world

00:04:39.486 --> 00:04:41.549
in our macroscopic world,

00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:46.372
like in quantum cryptography, so spies
can send secure messages to each other,

00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:49.479
or quantum computing,
for cracking secret codes.

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.743
Everyday physics may start to look
a bit more like the strange quantum world.

00:04:53.743 --> 00:04:56.992
Quantum teleportation 
may even progress so far,

00:04:56.992 --> 00:05:00.323
that one day your cat will 
escape to a safer galaxy,
