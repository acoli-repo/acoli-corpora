00:03:28.957 --> 00:03:32.752
the outcome of the experiment
will still always be the same.

00:03:32.752 --> 00:03:37.617
One cat will always come out alive,
and the other cat will always end up dead,

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:42.221
even though which particular cat
lives or dies is completely undetermined

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:44.609
before we measure the outcome.

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.196
How is this possible?

00:03:46.196 --> 00:03:49.647
How is it that the states of cats
on opposite sides of the universe

00:03:49.647 --> 00:03:51.822
can be entangled in this way?

00:03:51.822 --> 00:03:54.325
They're too far away to communicate
with each other in time,

00:03:54.325 --> 00:03:57.526
so how do the two bombs always 
conspire such that

00:03:57.526 --> 00:04:00.350
one blows up and the other doesn't?
