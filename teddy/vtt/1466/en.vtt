00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The moment I say "school,"

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
so many memories come back to me.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's like after every exam,
when I walk out,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the teacher would say, "Hey, come.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
How did you do?"

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I would say with a great smile,
"I will definitely pass."

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And I didn't understand why,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
in one hand they say, "Speak the truth,"

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.762
in the other hand, when you say
the truth, they hated you.

00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:24.000
So it went on like that,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and I didn't know where
else to find myself.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So I remember those nights

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I used to go to sleep
