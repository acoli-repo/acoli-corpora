00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
This is a song that came about

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
because I think it's difficult to be in the world

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and not be aware of what's going on,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and the wars and so forth.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
This song kind of came out of all of that.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
which I still stand by,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
but this has got something else in it.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
It's called "Peace on Earth."
