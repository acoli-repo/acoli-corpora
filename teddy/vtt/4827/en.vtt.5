00:02:29.414 --> 00:02:32.123
In that case, the total 
number of comparisons

00:02:32.123 --> 00:02:35.983
would be 409,280,

00:02:35.983 --> 00:02:38.135
taking almost five days.

00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:40.624
You're still doing 
way too many comparisons.

00:02:40.624 --> 00:02:42.515
Here's a better idea.

00:02:42.515 --> 00:02:44.885
First, pick a random book.

00:02:44.885 --> 00:02:49.606
Call it the partition and compare it
to every other book.

00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:51.515
Then, divide the line

00:02:51.515 --> 00:02:55.666
by placing all the books 
that come before the partition on its left

00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:58.825
and all the ones that come after it
on its right.

00:02:58.825 --> 00:03:00.415
You've just saved loads of time
