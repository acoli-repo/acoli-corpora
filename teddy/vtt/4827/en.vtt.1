which means that 
first thing in the morning,

00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:36.557
students will show up in droves

How can you get them all sorted in time?

00:00:39.493 --> 00:00:44.779
One way would be to start at one end
of the line with the first pair of books.

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:48.626
If the first two books are in order,
then leave them as they are.

00:00:48.626 --> 00:00:50.920
Otherwise, swap them.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.216
Then, look at the second and third books,

00:00:53.216 --> 00:00:54.879
repeat the process,

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.935
and continue until you reach 
the end of the line.

00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:01.185
At some point, you'll come across
the book that should be last,
