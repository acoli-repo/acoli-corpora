00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:01.185
At some point, you'll come across
the book that should be last,

00:01:01.185 --> 00:01:04.710
and keep swapping it with every
subsequent book,

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.280
moving it down the line until it
reaches the end where it belongs.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.225
Then, start from the beginning
and repeat the process

00:01:12.225 --> 00:01:15.510
to get the second to last book
in its proper place,

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.821
and keep going until all books are sorted.

00:01:18.821 --> 00:01:21.862
This approach is called Bubble Sort.

00:01:21.862 --> 00:01:24.156
It's simple but slow.

00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:29.331
You'd make 1,279 comparisons
in the first round,

00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:33.623
then 1,278, and so on,
