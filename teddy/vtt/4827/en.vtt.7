00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:32.926
Each round of partitioning requires
about 1,280 comparisons.

00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:35.466
If your partitions are pretty balanced,

00:03:35.466 --> 00:03:41.256
dividing the books into 128 sub-lines of ten
would take about seven rounds,

00:03:41.256 --> 00:03:43.947
or 8,960 seconds.

00:03:43.947 --> 00:03:48.736
Sorting these sub-lines would add
about 22 seconds each.

00:03:48.736 --> 00:03:51.817
All in all, this method 
known as QuickSort

00:03:51.817 --> 00:03:54.883
could sort the books 
in under three and a half hours.

00:03:54.883 --> 00:03:55.997
But there's a catch.

00:03:55.997 --> 00:03:59.575
Your partitions could end up lopsided,
saving no time at all.

00:03:59.575 --> 00:04:01.477
Luckily, this rarely happens.
