00:02:58.825 --> 00:03:00.415
You've just saved loads of time

00:03:00.415 --> 00:03:03.845
by not having to compare 
any of the books on the left

00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:07.245
to any of the ones 
on the right ever again.

00:03:07.245 --> 00:03:09.665
Now, looking only 
at the books on the left,

00:03:09.665 --> 00:03:12.542
you can again pick a random partition book

00:03:12.542 --> 00:03:17.266
and separate those books that come
before it from those that come after it.

00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:19.736
You can keep creating 
sub-partitions like this

00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:22.384
until you have a bunch of small sub-lines,

00:03:22.384 --> 00:03:27.764
each of which you'd sort quickly using
another strategy, like Insertion Sort.

00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:32.926
Each round of partitioning requires
about 1,280 comparisons.
