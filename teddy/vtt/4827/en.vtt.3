00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:33.623
then 1,278, and so on,

00:01:33.623 --> 00:01:38.542
adding up to 818,560 comparisons.

00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:44.273
If each took just one second,
the process would take over nine days.

00:01:44.273 --> 00:01:48.569
A second strategy would be to start
by sorting just the first two books.

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.733
Then, take the third book and compare it
with the book in the second spot.

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:57.173
If it belongs before the second book,
swap them,

00:01:57.173 --> 00:01:59.641
then compare it 
with the book in the first spot,

00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:01.682
and swap again if needed.
