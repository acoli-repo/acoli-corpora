00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:01.682
and swap again if needed.

00:02:01.682 --> 00:02:03.880
Now you've sorted the first three books.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.732
Keep adding one book at a time
to the sorted sub-line,

00:02:07.732 --> 00:02:11.809
comparing and swapping the new book
with the one before it

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:16.004
until it's correctly placed
among the books sorted so far.

00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:18.213
This is called Insertion Sort.

00:02:18.213 --> 00:02:22.944
Unlike Bubble Sort, it usually doesn't
require comparing every pair of books.

00:02:22.944 --> 00:02:26.954
On average, we'd expect to only need
to compare each book

00:02:26.954 --> 00:02:29.414
to half of the books that came before it.

00:02:29.414 --> 00:02:32.123
In that case, the total 
number of comparisons
