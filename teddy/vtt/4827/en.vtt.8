Luckily, this rarely happens.

00:04:01.477 --> 00:04:04.910
That's why QuickSort is one of the most
efficient strategies

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.916
used by programmers today.

00:04:06.916 --> 00:04:10.847
They use it for things like sorting items
in an online store by price,

00:04:10.847 --> 00:04:14.858
or creating a list of all the gas stations
close to a given location

00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:16.379
sorted by distance.

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:20.407
In your case, you're done quick sorting
with time to spare.

00:04:20.407 --> 00:04:22.668
Just another high-stakes day 
in the library.
