00:00:00.768 --> 00:00:02.397
Think about your day for a second.

00:00:02.421 --> 00:00:05.668
You woke up, felt fresh air on your face
as you walked out the door,

00:00:05.692 --> 00:00:08.143
encountered new colleagues
and had great discussions

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:10.269
and felt in awe
when you found something new.

00:00:10.293 --> 00:00:12.971
But I bet there's something
you didn't think about today,

00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:14.291
something so close to home,

00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:16.754
you probably don't think
about it very often at all.

00:00:16.778 --> 00:00:20.041
And that's that all those sensations,
feelings, decisions and actions

00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:22.023
are mediated by the computer in your head

00:00:22.047 --> 00:00:23.237
called your brain.

00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:25.946
Now, the brain may not look
like much from the outside --

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.337
a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh,

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.575
amorphous.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.294
But the last 100 years of neuroscience
have allowed us to zoom in on the brain
