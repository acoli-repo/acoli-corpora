We know that professors are less likely
to help female or minority students.

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:04.996
And we know that resumes
with white-sounding names

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.913
get more callbacks than resumes
with black-sounding names.

00:07:09.043 --> 00:07:10.241
Why is that?

00:07:11.011 --> 00:07:13.454
Because of our expectations
of what is normal.

00:07:14.135 --> 00:07:15.714
We think it is normal

00:07:15.738 --> 00:07:17.843
when a black student has spelling errors.

00:07:18.264 --> 00:07:19.979
We think it is normal

00:07:20.003 --> 00:07:23.195
when a female or minority student
does not succeed.

00:07:23.962 --> 00:07:25.601
And we think it is normal

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:28.711
that a white employee
is a better hire than a black employee.

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:31.993
But studies also show
that discrimination of this kind,
