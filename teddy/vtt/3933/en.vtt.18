I can accept the preexisting notion
of normal -- that normal is good,

00:09:01.018 --> 00:09:05.033
and anything outside of that very
narrow definition of normal is bad.

00:09:05.758 --> 00:09:09.604
Or I can challenge
that preexisting notion of normal

00:09:10.462 --> 00:09:11.635
with my work

00:09:12.034 --> 00:09:13.310
and with my voice

00:09:14.338 --> 00:09:15.761
and with my accent

00:09:16.632 --> 00:09:18.148
and by standing here onstage,

00:09:18.172 --> 00:09:21.495
even though I'm scared shitless
and would rather be in the bathroom.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.836
(Laughter)

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.677
(Applause)
