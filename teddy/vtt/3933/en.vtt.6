00:02:58.282 --> 00:03:01.027
so I figured I should just ignore them

00:03:01.051 --> 00:03:03.640
and start working
on the second part of the video.

00:03:04.104 --> 00:03:05.634
I recorded my audio,

00:03:05.658 --> 00:03:08.657
but every time I sat down to edit,

00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:10.354
I just could not do it.

00:03:11.688 --> 00:03:14.676
Every single time, it would take me
back to my childhood,

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.521
when I had a much harder time speaking.

00:03:17.934 --> 00:03:20.738
I've stuttered for as long
as I can remember.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:23.562
I was the kid in class

00:03:23.586 --> 00:03:26.223
who would never raise his hand
when he had a question --

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.421
or knew the answer.

00:03:27.445 --> 00:03:28.760
Every time the phone rang,

00:03:28.784 --> 00:03:32.419
I would run to the bathroom
so I would not have to answer it.
