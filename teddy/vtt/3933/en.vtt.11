For example, the sea
is described as wine red,

00:05:30.252 --> 00:05:33.799
people's faces are sometimes green
and sheep are purple.

00:05:34.838 --> 00:05:36.213
But it's not just Homer.

00:05:36.237 --> 00:05:38.546
If you look at all
of the ancient literature --

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.770
Ancient Chinese, Icelandic, Greek, Indian

00:05:40.794 --> 00:05:43.471
and even the original Hebrew Bible --

00:05:43.495 --> 00:05:46.071
they all mention very few colors.

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:50.125
And the most popular theory
for why that might be the case

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:52.553
is that cultures begin
to recognize a color

00:05:52.577 --> 00:05:55.662
only once they have the ability
to make that color.

00:05:55.686 --> 00:05:57.536
So basically, if you can make a color,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.186
only then can you see it.

00:05:59.727 --> 00:06:03.386
A color like red, which was fairly easy
for many cultures to make --
