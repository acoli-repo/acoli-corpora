(Voice-over) SS: Audio editing
is like Photoshop for your voice.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.911
I can slow it down, speed it up,
make it deeper, add an echo.

00:04:37.935 --> 00:04:41.682
And if I stutter along the way,
and if I stutter along the way,

00:04:41.706 --> 00:04:43.325
I just go back in and fix it.

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:44.744
It's magic.

00:04:44.768 --> 00:04:47.673
SS: Using my highly edited
voice in my work

00:04:47.697 --> 00:04:51.252
was a way for me
to finally sound normal to myself.

00:04:52.302 --> 00:04:54.447
But after the comments on the video,

00:04:54.924 --> 00:04:56.929
it no longer made me feel normal.

00:04:57.897 --> 00:05:00.270
And so I stopped
using my voice in my work.
