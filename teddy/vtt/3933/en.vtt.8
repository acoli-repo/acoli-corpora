00:03:57.635 --> 00:04:01.442
I spent my childhood
feeling that if I spoke,

00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:06.621
it would become obvious
that there was something wrong with me,

00:04:06.645 --> 00:04:08.142
that I was not normal.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.729
So I mostly stayed quiet.

00:04:12.142 --> 00:04:15.905
And so you see, eventually for me to even
be able to use my voice in my work

00:04:15.929 --> 00:04:17.502
was a huge step for me.

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:19.587
Every time I record audio,

00:04:19.611 --> 00:04:23.106
I fumble my way through saying
each sentence many, many times,

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.764
and then I go back in

00:04:24.788 --> 00:04:28.370
and pick the ones
where I think I suck the least.
