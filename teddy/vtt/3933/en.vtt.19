(Video) Sheep (SS's voice):
I'm now slowly starting to use my voice

00:09:36.496 --> 00:09:37.650
in my work again.

00:09:37.674 --> 00:09:38.825
And it feels good.

00:09:38.849 --> 00:09:40.817
It does not mean I won't have a breakdown

00:09:40.841 --> 00:09:43.308
the next time a couple dozen
people say that I talk

00:09:43.332 --> 00:09:45.640
(Mumbling) like I have peanut
butter in my mouth.

00:09:45.664 --> 00:09:46.666
(Laughter)

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.370
SS: It just means I now have
a much better understanding

00:09:49.394 --> 00:09:51.138
of what's at stake,

00:09:51.162 --> 00:09:53.662
and how giving up is not an option.

00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:59.405
The Ancient Greeks didn't just wake up
one day and realize

00:09:59.429 --> 00:10:00.754
that the sky was blue.
