00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:31.300
And I'm still quiet.

00:00:32.293 --> 00:00:36.939
And then, slowly, all the other people
in the room begin to turn toward me

00:00:36.963 --> 00:00:39.218
and ask, almost in unison,

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.592
(Voice-over, several voices)
"Have you forgotten your name?"

00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:47.706
As the chant gets louder,
I want to respond, but I don't.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.849
I'm a visual artist.

00:00:52.754 --> 00:00:55.335
Some of my work is humorous,

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.960
and some is a bit funny but in a sad way.
