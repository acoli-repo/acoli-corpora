(Video) Frankenstein's monster
(SS's voice): (Grunts)

00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:32.273
(Laughter)

00:01:32.297 --> 00:01:34.397
SS: I just had to grunt
a lot for that one.

00:01:34.421 --> 00:01:37.104
A few years ago,
I made this educational video

00:01:37.128 --> 00:01:40.024
about the history of video games.

00:01:40.048 --> 00:01:43.790
And for that one, I got to do
the voice of Space Invader.

00:01:43.814 --> 00:01:45.870
(Video) Space Invader (SS's voice): Hi.

00:01:45.894 --> 00:01:47.341
SS: A dream come true, really,

00:01:47.365 --> 00:01:48.367
(Laughter)

00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:50.470
And when that video was posted online,

00:01:50.494 --> 00:01:53.184
I just sat there on the computer,
hitting "refresh,"

00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:54.684
excited to see the response.

00:01:55.208 --> 00:01:56.622
The first comment comes in.

00:01:56.646 --> 00:01:57.940
(Video) Comment: Great job.

00:01:57.964 --> 00:01:59.114
SS: Yes!

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:00.964
I hit "refresh."
