(Video) Comment: Could you remake this
without peanut butter in your mouth?

00:02:32.137 --> 00:02:36.604
SS: OK, at least the feedback
is somewhat constructive. Hit "refresh."

00:02:36.628 --> 00:02:39.174
(Video) Comment: Please don't use
this narrator again

00:02:39.198 --> 00:02:40.560
u can barely understand him.

00:02:40.584 --> 00:02:41.735
SS: Refresh.

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.739
(Video) Comment: Couldn't follow
because of the Indian accent.

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:46.247
SS: OK, OK, OK, two things.

00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:48.343
Number one, I don't have an Indian accent,

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:50.294
I have a Pakistani accent, OK?

00:02:50.318 --> 00:02:53.458
And number two, I clearly
have a Pakistani accent.

00:02:53.482 --> 00:02:55.503
(Laughter)

00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:58.258
But comments like that kept coming in,

00:02:58.282 --> 00:03:01.027
so I figured I should just ignore them
