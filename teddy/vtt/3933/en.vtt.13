So when I first read
the comments on the video,

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.765
my initial reaction was to take it
all very personally.

00:06:36.543 --> 00:06:38.441
But the people commenting did not know

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:41.325
how self-conscious I am about my voice.

00:06:42.258 --> 00:06:44.905
They were mostly reacting to my accent,

00:06:44.929 --> 00:06:48.446
that it is not normal
for a narrator to have an accent.

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:50.592
But what is normal, anyway?

00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:54.835
We know that reviewers will find
more spelling errors in your writing

00:06:54.859 --> 00:06:56.230
if they think you're black.

00:06:57.144 --> 00:07:01.436
We know that professors are less likely
to help female or minority students.
