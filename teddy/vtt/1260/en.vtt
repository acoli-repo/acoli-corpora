00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Imagine if you could record your life --

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
everything you said, everything you did,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
available in a perfect memory store at your fingertips,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
so you could go back

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and find memorable moments and relive them,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
or sift through traces of time

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and discover patterns in your own life

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that previously had gone undiscovered.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Well that's exactly the journey

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that my family began

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
five and a half years ago.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is my wife and collaborator, Rupal.
