00:00:00.927 --> 00:00:02.642
Who do you want to be?

00:00:03.317 --> 00:00:05.295
It's a simple question,

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:07.071
and whether you know it or not,

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:10.360
you're answering it every day
through your actions.

00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:15.444
This one question will define
your professional success

00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:17.492
more than any other,

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:21.497
because how you show up
and treat people means everything.

00:00:22.116 --> 00:00:26.318
Either you lift people up
by respecting them,

00:00:26.342 --> 00:00:30.402
making them feel valued,
appreciated and heard,
