00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.316
Public space must be as free and abundant
as the air we breathe.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.398
In our real estate-driven cities,

00:00:07.422 --> 00:00:10.133
where open space
is increasingly carved up,

00:00:10.157 --> 00:00:12.673
traded and sold as a commodity,

00:00:12.697 --> 00:00:15.323
architects must defend public space,

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:17.315
advocate for more of it,

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:20.617
and reclaim space that's been
squandered by neglect

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:22.081
or lack of vision.

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:23.768
In our practice,

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:27.136
this sometimes means
openly sparring with a client

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.088
to carve out public space,

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.803
or inventing stealthy,
under-the-radar ways
