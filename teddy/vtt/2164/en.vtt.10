00:04:58.165 --> 00:05:00.514
So I lifted my arm and took a stroke.

00:05:00.538 --> 00:05:01.768
"Now one more."

00:05:01.792 --> 00:05:04.514
So I took a second and a third stroke.

00:05:05.197 --> 00:05:06.657
By the fourth one,

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:09.625
I saw a penguin swimming
underneath my stomach.

00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:13.455
It came up to my left
and started swimming with me.

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.543
"See? A penguin is cheering you on,"

00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:17.000
said that voice within.

00:05:17.024 --> 00:05:20.471
(Applause and cheers)

00:05:20.495 --> 00:05:22.895
I looked up to my people on the boat.

00:05:23.395 --> 00:05:26.727
They had the same smile on their faces
that I had on mine.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.268
The same smile that we all have

00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:31.681
when we are stuck in a difficult situation
