00:01:57.531 --> 00:02:00.490
go to school, come back,
swim for three hours,

00:02:00.514 --> 00:02:02.561
go home, eat and sleep.

00:02:02.863 --> 00:02:05.633
When you win a medal
or set a world record,

00:02:05.657 --> 00:02:09.981
this mirror shows the happiness
that you and your loved ones feel,

00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:13.617
but also reflects the tears that you shed

00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:16.041
all by yourself, alone in the water.

00:02:16.673 --> 00:02:19.561

is a very lonely sport.

00:02:19.585 --> 00:02:21.426

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.180
looking into the infinite,
seemingly bottomless ocean underneath me,

00:02:26.204 --> 00:02:29.466
with nothing to keep me company
but my own thoughts.

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:33.053
And so, I have not only
been tested as a swimmer
