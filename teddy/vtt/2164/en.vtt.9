00:04:26.911 --> 00:04:31.132
but what I wasn't prepared for
was the density of the water.

00:04:31.577 --> 00:04:34.659
Every stroke felt
like pulling through oil.

00:04:34.683 --> 00:04:36.136
And in the first five minutes,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.426
I had that paralyzing thought
of just giving up.

00:04:39.953 --> 00:04:42.643
How nice it would be
to just forget about all this,

00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:43.818
get on the boat,

00:04:43.842 --> 00:04:45.553
stand underneath the hot shower

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:48.529
or wrap myself in a warm blanket?

00:04:48.553 --> 00:04:50.014
But with that thought,

00:04:50.038 --> 00:04:54.625
also came a stronger,
a more willful voice from deep within.

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:58.141
"You know you have it in you
to just take one more stroke."

00:04:58.165 --> 00:05:00.514
So I lifted my arm and took a stroke.
