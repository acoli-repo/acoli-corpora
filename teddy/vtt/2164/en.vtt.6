00:02:58.776 --> 00:03:02.982
This isolation has been
my sport's biggest gift to me.

00:03:03.338 --> 00:03:04.768
Through open water swimming,

00:03:04.792 --> 00:03:09.186
I have come to know myself in ways
that I could have never expected to.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.508
I remember, at the age of 14,

00:03:11.532 --> 00:03:15.381
when I jumped into an ocean
for the first time for a swim,

00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:16.625
and throughout this swim,

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:19.656
the waves were picking me up
and throwing me down,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.759
I saw the child in me,
who enjoys such adventures.

00:03:24.077 --> 00:03:25.799
While crossing the English Channel,

00:03:25.823 --> 00:03:28.577
after already having swam for 10 hours,

00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:31.306
when I got stuck in one place
for one and a half hour
