00:08:26.594 --> 00:08:30.236
when I can't find motivation
or joy in what I'm doing,

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.030
all I ask myself is,

00:08:32.054 --> 00:08:34.454
"Is this the best I can do right now?"

00:08:34.938 --> 00:08:37.144
And the meaning of my "best" changes.

00:08:37.168 --> 00:08:40.096
On some days, it means not giving up,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.263
continuing to swim in freezing water
and setting a world record.

00:08:43.605 --> 00:08:45.228
But on many other days,

00:08:45.252 --> 00:08:47.801
it means getting over
my depressing thoughts,

00:08:47.825 --> 00:08:49.244
stepping out of the house

00:08:49.268 --> 00:08:51.942
and being able to do the daily chores.

00:08:51.966 --> 00:08:54.966
What does not change is that voice within.

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.545
That internal compass

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:59.369
which guides me
to a better self every day.
