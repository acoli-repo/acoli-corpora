00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.636
and set a world record
in the freezing Antarctic ocean.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.939
(Applause)

00:01:35.963 --> 00:01:38.788
When you spend so much time with a sport,

00:01:38.812 --> 00:01:40.979
it ceases to be just that

00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:42.791
and becomes a mirror.

00:01:42.815 --> 00:01:45.082
And that shows who you really are.

00:01:45.657 --> 00:01:50.307
You see that your mettle as an athlete
is not only tested on race day

00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:52.291
but every single day,

00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:56.094
when the sport demands that you get up
at 4:30 in the morning,

00:01:56.118 --> 00:01:57.507
swim for two hours,

00:01:57.531 --> 00:02:00.490
go to school, come back,
swim for three hours,
