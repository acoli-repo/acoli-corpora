00:09:28.934 --> 00:09:30.609
makes me kind of feel --

00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:32.093
if you can excuse my pun --

00:09:32.117 --> 00:09:33.474
kind of at sea.

00:09:33.498 --> 00:09:34.679
But --

00:09:34.703 --> 00:09:36.652
BS: (Laughs) No pun intended, of course.

00:09:36.676 --> 00:09:38.958
SRK: But what is your next
goal as a swimmer?

00:09:38.982 --> 00:09:40.942
BS: I have a major fear of competition,

00:09:40.966 --> 00:09:44.065
so what better goal to set
than aiming for the Olympics?

00:09:44.089 --> 00:09:46.827
Because open water swimming
is an Olympic sport now.

00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:48.859
(Applause)

00:09:48.883 --> 00:09:51.580
Even saying it out loud gives me shivers,

00:09:51.604 --> 00:09:53.061
because it's such a huge goal

00:09:53.085 --> 00:09:55.630
that I don't want to accept
that I have set that goal,

00:09:55.654 --> 00:09:58.188
but that's the thrill of it,
that's the part of it.

00:09:58.212 --> 00:10:02.577
And my idea is that if I make it
to the Olympics or I don't make it,
