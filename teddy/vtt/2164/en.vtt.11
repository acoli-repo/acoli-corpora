00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:31.681
when we are stuck in a difficult situation

00:05:31.705 --> 00:05:33.372
and we see a ray of hope.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.736
We take it as a sign from destiny,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.085
and we just keep pushing forward.

00:05:38.109 --> 00:05:39.474
Just as I did,

00:05:39.498 --> 00:05:41.188
and 41 minutes later,

00:05:41.212 --> 00:05:44.022
set the world record
for swimming the longest distance

00:05:44.046 --> 00:05:45.347
in the Antarctic Ocean.

00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:49.211
(Applause)

00:05:49.235 --> 00:05:52.163
Imagine, it doesn't even
snow in Rajasthan.

00:05:52.187 --> 00:05:53.536
(Laughter)

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.219
That voice, which has accompanied me
through all my difficult situations

00:05:57.243 --> 00:05:58.609
throughout my swims,

00:05:58.633 --> 00:06:00.323
would have never shown itself
