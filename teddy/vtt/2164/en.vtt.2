00:00:59.323 --> 00:01:02.077
I would be kicking, splashing, screaming,

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:03.553
gulping down water,

00:01:03.577 --> 00:01:06.276
holding onto my mom for my dear life.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.045
That's how I learned how to swim.

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:10.586
I started pool-swimming
when I was two and a half,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.144
and open water swimming
when I was 14 years old.

00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:19.159
And so I have given
over 25 years of my life to this sport,

00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:22.478
during which I have swum
in all five oceans of the world,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.296
crossed the English Channel --

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.996
which is also known
as the Mount Everest of swimming --

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.636
and set a world record
in the freezing Antarctic ocean.
