00:03:57.981 --> 00:04:00.799
not knowing that we were creating history,

00:04:00.823 --> 00:04:03.141
I saw the protective daughter in me,

00:04:03.165 --> 00:04:06.958
who just wanted to see her mom
fulfill her own dreams.

00:04:06.982 --> 00:04:08.339
And four years ago,

00:04:08.363 --> 00:04:10.577
when I jumped into the Antarctic Ocean,

00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:14.109
wearing nothing but a swimsuit,
cap and goggles,

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:17.264
with an unwavering spirit of just doing,

00:04:17.288 --> 00:04:19.097
I saw a fighter in me.

00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:22.582
When I jumped into that
zero-to-one-degree-Celsius water,

00:04:22.606 --> 00:04:26.887
I realized that I had prepared
my body and mind for the cold,

00:04:26.911 --> 00:04:31.132
but what I wasn't prepared for
was the density of the water.
