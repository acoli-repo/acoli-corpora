00:05:58.633 --> 00:06:00.323
would have never shown itself

00:06:00.347 --> 00:06:03.331
if I had not spent so much time alone,

00:06:03.355 --> 00:06:06.227
had not paid attention
to every single thought

00:06:06.251 --> 00:06:07.651
that crossed my mind.

00:06:08.165 --> 00:06:12.625
When you find yourself alone
in an ocean, with your thoughts,

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:15.506
the dangers that you face
are not just external,

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.434
like whales, sharks, jellyfish

00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:20.325
or even demotivating people.

00:06:20.998 --> 00:06:23.672
But the more dangerous demons you face

00:06:23.696 --> 00:06:26.664
are the fear and negativity inside you

00:06:26.688 --> 00:06:29.244
that tell you, "You're not good enough.

00:06:29.268 --> 00:06:31.252
You will never reach the other shore.
