00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:33.053
And so, I have not only
been tested as a swimmer

00:02:33.077 --> 00:02:37.355
but also as a thinking, feeling,
imaginative human being.

00:02:37.673 --> 00:02:40.363
Be it my first test as a marathon swimmer,

00:02:40.387 --> 00:02:44.974
when I decided to swim for 12 hours
non-stop in a swimming pool

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:49.251
or crossing the English Channel
in 13 hours and 55 minutes.

00:02:49.728 --> 00:02:52.244
When you're swimming, you don't talk,

00:02:52.268 --> 00:02:53.934
you don't hear very well,

00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:57.228
and your vision is restricted
to what's right in front of you

00:02:57.252 --> 00:02:58.452
or underneath you.

00:02:58.776 --> 00:03:02.982
This isolation has been
my sport's biggest gift to me.
