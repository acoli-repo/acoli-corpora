00:09:00.117 --> 00:09:02.007
And I believe

00:09:02.031 --> 00:09:07.299
that a truly successful life
is the one which is spent in the pursuit

00:09:07.323 --> 00:09:11.117
of becoming the best possible
version of yourself

00:09:11.141 --> 00:09:13.219
when you take that last breath.

00:09:13.243 --> 00:09:14.393
Thank you.

00:09:14.417 --> 00:09:21.272
(Applause)

00:09:22.323 --> 00:09:24.979
SRK: I think the only sport
I can't do is swim --

00:09:25.003 --> 00:09:26.161
I sink like a rock.

00:09:26.185 --> 00:09:28.910
So standing next to
the world's best swimmer

00:09:28.934 --> 00:09:30.609
makes me kind of feel --
