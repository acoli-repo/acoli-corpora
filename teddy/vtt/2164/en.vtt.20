00:09:58.212 --> 00:10:02.577
And my idea is that if I make it
to the Olympics or I don't make it,

00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:03.752
that doesn't matter,

00:10:03.776 --> 00:10:05.641
but in the process of training for it,

00:10:05.665 --> 00:10:08.299
I will have become a better swimmer
and a better person.

00:10:08.323 --> 00:10:10.640
SRK: Inshallah, you will make it
to the Olympics.

00:10:10.664 --> 00:10:12.228
And I want to tell you

00:10:12.252 --> 00:10:14.664
a lot of people who are watching
this show at home,

00:10:14.688 --> 00:10:18.207
there's lots of people, all of whom
are thinking only positively for you,

00:10:18.231 --> 00:10:19.804
so when you go for the Olympics,

00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:23.381
imagine all of us will be wearing
our penguin suits and swimming with you,

00:10:23.405 --> 00:10:25.709
and saying, "Go on,
go on, Bhakti, go on, go on."

00:10:25.733 --> 00:10:27.431
BS: Can you be my personal penguin?

00:10:27.455 --> 00:10:29.161
SRK: I am your penguin now.

00:10:29.776 --> 00:10:32.645
It would have been cooler
if you said, like, a shark and all,
