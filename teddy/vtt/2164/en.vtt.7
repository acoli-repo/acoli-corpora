because of the currents,

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:36.339
I saw the strong
and dedicated athlete in me,

00:03:36.363 --> 00:03:39.827
who did not want to disappoint
her parents or her country.

00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:42.629
In an open water marathon
held in Switzerland,

00:03:42.653 --> 00:03:45.661
when I won my first
gold medal for India --

00:03:45.685 --> 00:03:50.529

00:03:55.616 --> 00:03:57.957
this time in a relay with my mother,

00:03:57.981 --> 00:04:00.799
not knowing that we were creating history,
