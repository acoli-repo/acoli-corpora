They're literally beginning to exhibit
the same brain-wave patterns.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.275
And I don't just mean
they're feeling the same emotions.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.798
There's something even more
startling happening.

00:01:38.822 --> 00:01:41.719
Let's take a look inside
Haley's brain for a moment.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.421
There are billions of interconnected
neurons in an impossible tangle.

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:48.252
But look here, right here --

00:01:48.276 --> 00:01:51.037
a few million of them
are linked to each other

00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:54.500
in a way which represents a single idea.

00:01:54.524 --> 00:01:58.564
And incredibly, this exact pattern
is being recreated in real time

00:01:58.588 --> 00:02:01.666
inside the minds of everyone listening.
