It's important, therefore,
to test your talk on trusted friends,

00:07:00.768 --> 00:07:03.372
and find out which parts
they get confused by.

00:07:03.396 --> 00:07:05.704
Four, here's the final tip:

00:07:05.728 --> 00:07:08.505
Make your idea worth sharing.

00:07:09.242 --> 00:07:11.895
By that I mean, ask yourself the question:

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:13.737
"Who does this idea benefit?"

00:07:14.489 --> 00:07:17.450
And I need you to be honest
with the answer.

00:07:17.474 --> 00:07:20.386
If the idea only serves you
or your organization,

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.687
then, I'm sorry to say,
it's probably not worth sharing.

00:07:23.711 --> 00:07:25.822
The audience will see right through you.

00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:28.528
But if you believe that the idea
has the potential

00:07:28.552 --> 00:07:30.450
to brighten up someone else's day
