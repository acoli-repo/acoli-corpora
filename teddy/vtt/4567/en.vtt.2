00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.079
a strange and beautiful object
that we call an idea.

00:01:04.034 --> 00:01:05.369
Let me show you what I mean.

00:01:05.393 --> 00:01:06.544
Here's Haley.

00:01:06.568 --> 00:01:08.534
She is about to give a TED Talk

00:01:08.558 --> 00:01:10.401
and frankly, she's terrified.

00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:12.074
(Video) Presenter: Haley Van Dyck!

00:01:12.098 --> 00:01:15.098
(Applause)

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:20.373
Over the course of 18 minutes,

00:01:20.397 --> 00:01:24.361
1,200 people, many of whom
have never seen each other before,

00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:28.505
are finding that their brains
are starting to sync with Haley's brain

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:29.967
and with each other.

00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:33.385
They're literally beginning to exhibit
the same brain-wave patterns.
