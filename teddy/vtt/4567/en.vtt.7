00:03:26.592 --> 00:03:30.061
So, for example, if one little
component of your worldview

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:32.911
is the idea that kittens are adorable,

00:03:32.935 --> 00:03:35.330
then when you see this,

00:03:35.354 --> 00:03:36.934
you'll react like this.

00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:39.035
But if another component of your worldview

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:41.322
is the idea that leopards are dangerous,

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:42.591
then when you see this,

00:03:42.615 --> 00:03:44.876
you'll react a little bit differently.

00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:47.112
So, it's pretty obvious

00:03:47.136 --> 00:03:51.049
why the ideas that make up
your worldview are crucial.

00:03:51.073 --> 00:03:54.069
You need them to be as reliable
as possible -- a guide,

00:03:54.093 --> 00:03:57.881
to the scary but wonderful
real world out there.

00:03:57.905 --> 00:04:01.652
Now, different people's worldviews
can be dramatically different.
