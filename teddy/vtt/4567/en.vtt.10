00:04:59.014 --> 00:05:02.379
you need to slash back your content
so that you can focus

00:05:02.403 --> 00:05:05.156
on the single idea
you're most passionate about,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.814
and give yourself a chance
to explain that one thing properly.

00:05:08.838 --> 00:05:12.591
You have to give context,
share examples, make it vivid.

00:05:12.615 --> 00:05:13.862
So pick one idea,

00:05:13.886 --> 00:05:17.087
and make it the through-line
running through your entire talk,

00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:20.589
so that everything you say
links back to it in some way.

00:05:21.182 --> 00:05:24.557
Two, give your listeners a reason to care.

00:05:25.523 --> 00:05:29.554
Before you can start building things
inside the minds of your audience,

00:05:29.578 --> 00:05:31.983
you have to get their permission
to welcome you in.
