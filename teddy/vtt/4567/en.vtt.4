00:01:58.588 --> 00:02:01.666
inside the minds of everyone listening.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.850
That's right; in just a few minutes,

00:02:03.874 --> 00:02:06.237
a pattern involving millions of neurons

00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:09.046
is being teleported into 1,200 minds,

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.199
just by people listening to a voice
and watching a face.

00:02:12.682 --> 00:02:15.491
But wait -- what is an idea anyway?

00:02:15.515 --> 00:02:18.999
Well, you can think of it
as a pattern of information

00:02:19.023 --> 00:02:22.411
that helps you understand
and navigate the world.

00:02:22.435 --> 00:02:24.411
Ideas come in all shapes and sizes,

00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:26.435
from the complex and analytical

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.538
to the simple and aesthetic.

00:02:28.562 --> 00:02:31.435
Here are just a few examples
shared from the TED stage.
