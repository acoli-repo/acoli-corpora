Some people think that there's
a TED Talk formula:

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.165
"Give a talk on a round, red rug."

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:06.591
"Share a childhood story."

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:08.622
"Divulge a personal secret."

00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:11.417
"End with an inspiring call to action."

00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:12.591
No.

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:14.712
That's not how to think of a TED Talk.

00:00:14.736 --> 00:00:16.725
In fact, if you overuse those devices,

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:20.892
you're just going to come across
as clichÃ©d or emotionally manipulative.

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:24.796
But there is one thing that all
great TED Talks have in common,

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.499
and I would like to share
that thing with you,

00:00:27.523 --> 00:00:30.198
because over the past 12 years,
I've had a ringside seat,
