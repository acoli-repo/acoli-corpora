00:00:27.523 --> 00:00:30.198
because over the past 12 years,
I've had a ringside seat,

00:00:30.222 --> 00:00:34.961
listening to many hundreds
of amazing TED speakers, like these.

00:00:34.985 --> 00:00:37.422
I've helped them prepare
their talks for prime time,

00:00:37.446 --> 00:00:38.882
and learned directly from them

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:41.232
their secrets of what
makes for a great talk.

00:00:41.256 --> 00:00:44.026
And even though these speakers
and their topics all seem

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.201
completely different,

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:48.961
they actually do have
one key common ingredient.

00:00:49.318 --> 00:00:50.547
And it's this:

00:00:51.254 --> 00:00:53.865
Your number one task as a speaker

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:58.476
is to transfer into your listeners' minds
an extraordinary gift --

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.079
a strange and beautiful object
that we call an idea.
