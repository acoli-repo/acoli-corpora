00:02:27.577 --> 00:02:30.522
was because most
of the images I had given it

00:02:30.546 --> 00:02:32.386
were positive images.

00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:36.561
That's because people
tend to share positive images

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:38.775
when they talk about their experiences.

00:02:39.267 --> 00:02:41.808
When was the last time
you saw a selfie at a funeral?

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:46.529
I realized that,
as I worked on improving AI

00:02:46.553 --> 00:02:50.267
task by task, dataset by dataset,

00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:53.188
that I was creating massive gaps,

00:02:53.212 --> 00:02:57.211
holes and blind spots
in what it could understand.

00:02:58.307 --> 00:02:59.641
And while doing so,

00:02:59.665 --> 00:03:02.148
I was encoding all kinds of biases.
