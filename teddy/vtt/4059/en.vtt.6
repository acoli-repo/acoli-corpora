00:02:59.665 --> 00:03:02.148
I was encoding all kinds of biases.

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:06.347
Biases that reflect a limited viewpoint,

00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:08.632
limited to a single dataset --

00:03:09.283 --> 00:03:13.141
biases that can reflect
human biases found in the data,

00:03:13.165 --> 00:03:16.269
such as prejudice and stereotyping.

00:03:17.554 --> 00:03:20.611
I thought back to the evolution
of the technology

00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:23.137
that brought me to where I was that day --

00:03:23.966 --> 00:03:26.199
how the first color images

00:03:26.223 --> 00:03:29.271
were calibrated against
a white woman's skin,

00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:33.810
meaning that color photography
was biased against black faces.
