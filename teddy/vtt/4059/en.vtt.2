One of my guiding principles

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:07.815
what it's like to have these experiences,

00:01:07.839 --> 00:01:13.015
to understand what we share
and believe and feel,

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:18.404
then we're in a great position
to start evolving computer technology

00:01:18.428 --> 00:01:23.015
in a way that's complementary
with our own experiences.

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.926
