00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:33.810
meaning that color photography
was biased against black faces.

00:03:34.514 --> 00:03:37.439
And that same bias, that same blind spot

00:03:37.463 --> 00:03:39.330
continued well into the '90s.

00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:42.855
And the same blind spot
continues even today

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.577
in how well we can recognize
different people's faces

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.801
in facial recognition technology.

00:03:49.323 --> 00:03:52.466
I though about the state of the art
in research today,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.004
where we tend to limit our thinking
to one dataset and one problem.

00:03:57.688 --> 00:04:02.569
And that in doing so, we were creating
more blind spots and biases
