I work on helping computers
communicate about the world around us.

00:00:05.754 --> 00:00:07.547
There are a lot of ways to do this,

00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:10.163
and I like to focus on helping computers

00:00:10.187 --> 00:00:13.061
to talk about what they see
and understand.

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:15.085
Given a scene like this,

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:17.014
a modern computer-vision algorithm

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:20.133
can tell you that there's a woman
and there's a dog.

00:00:20.157 --> 00:00:22.863
It can tell you that the woman is smiling.

00:00:22.887 --> 00:00:26.760
It might even be able to tell you
that the dog is incredibly cute.

00:00:26.784 --> 00:00:28.133
I work on this problem

00:00:28.157 --> 00:00:32.369
thinking about how humans
understand and process the world.
