Elon Musk warns
that it's an existential risk

00:05:01.014 --> 00:05:04.588
and one of the greatest risks
that we face as a civilization.

00:05:05.665 --> 00:05:07.117
Bill Gates has made the point,

00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:10.326
"I don't understand
why people aren't more concerned."

00:05:11.412 --> 00:05:12.730
But these views --

00:05:13.618 --> 00:05:15.352
they're part of the story.

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:18.499
The math, the models,

00:05:18.523 --> 00:05:21.593
the basic building blocks
of artificial intelligence

00:05:21.617 --> 00:05:24.752
are something that we call access
and all work with.

00:05:24.776 --> 00:05:28.561
We have open-source tools
for machine learning and intelligence

00:05:28.585 --> 00:05:30.319
that we can contribute to.
