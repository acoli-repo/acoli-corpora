It has thousands of parts,

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.656
from the foam that makes the seats

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.800
to the electrical wiring
to the light bulbs.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.976
And for many of those parts,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.576
the world's carmakers,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.640
they are dependent
on only a few suppliers.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.656
So it's hardly surprising

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.736
that it is kind of tempting
for those suppliers

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.200
to come together and fix prices.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.816
But just imagine what that could do
