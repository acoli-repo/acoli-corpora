And that means competition on the merits,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.216
that you compete
on the quality of your products,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.176
the prices you can offer,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.360
the services, the innovation
that you produce.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.216
That's competition on the merits.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.520
You have a fair chance
of making it on such a market.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.336
And it's my job,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.136
as Commissioner for Competition,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.856
to make sure that companies
who do business in Europe

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.920
live by those rules.
