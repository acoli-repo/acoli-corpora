00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.520
the builders who build our home,

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.256
the electrician
who comes to fix the wiring,

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.616
the doctor who treats us when we're ill,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.456
not to mention
the other drivers on the road,

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.400
and everyone knows that they are crazy.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.096
And yet, we have to trust them

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.480
to do the right thing.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.160
And the thing is
that the more our societies grow,

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.896
the more important trust becomes

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.216
and the harder it is to build.
