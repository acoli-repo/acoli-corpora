00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.296
But the problem is
that sometimes, for businesses,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.240
competition can be inconvenient,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.800
because competition means
that the race is never over,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.280
the game is never won.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.056
No matter how well
you were doing in the past,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.896
there's always someone

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.200
who are out there
wanting to take your place.
