00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.456
that real and fair competition

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.536
has a vital role to play

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.736
in building the trust we need

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.880
to get the best of our societies,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.976
and that starts with enforcing our rules,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.816
actually just to make
the market work for everyone.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.216
Thank you.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.680
