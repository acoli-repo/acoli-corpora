Starbucks and Apple got

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.920
from some governments in Europe.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.680
Those subsidies stop companies
from competing on equal terms.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.816
They can mean that
the companies that succeed,

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.440
well, they are the companies
that got the most subsidy,

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.696
the ones that are the best-connected,

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.856
and not, as it should be,

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.480
the companies that serve
consumers the best.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.760
So there are times when we need to step in

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.920
to make sure that competition
works the way it should.
