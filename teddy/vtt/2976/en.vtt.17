the effects of lack of competition:

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.240
that the price
for electricity was too high,

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.480
that the price for the medicines
they needed was too high,

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.056
that they had no real choice

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.416
if they wanted to travel
by bus or by plane,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.240
