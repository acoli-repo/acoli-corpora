00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.536
So the temptation to avoid competition

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.760
is powerful.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.560
It's rooted in motives
as old as Adam and Eve:

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.560
in greed for yet more money,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.096
in fear of losing
your position in the market

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.760
and all the benefits it brings.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.896
And when greed and fear

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.776
are linked to power,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.360
you have a dangerous mix.
