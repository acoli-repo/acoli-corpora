If we are all to have the same chances,

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.200
well, we all have to follow
the same fundamental rules.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.240
Of course, some people and some businesses
are more successful than others,

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.976
but we do not trust in a society

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.056
if the prizes are handed out

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.800
even before the contest begins.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.680
And this is where
competition rules come in,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.656
because when we make sure
that markets work fairly,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.896
then businesses compete on the merits,
