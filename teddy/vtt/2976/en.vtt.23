And that is a paradox of modern societies.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.296
And this is especially true

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.120
when technology changes
the way that we interact.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.176

technology can help us

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.536

with ratings systems and other systems

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.600
that enable the sharing economy.

not to trust in other people
