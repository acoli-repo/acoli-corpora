00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.360
But let's take a step back.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.960
Why do we need rules
on competition at all?

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.680
Why not just let businesses compete?

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.296
Isn't that also the best for us

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.616
if they compete freely,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.896
since more competition

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.096
drives more quality,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.640
lower prices, more innovation?

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.280
Well, mostly it is.
