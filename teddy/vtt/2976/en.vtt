00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's go back to 1957.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.696
Representatives
from six European countries

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.456
had come to Rome

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.760
to sign the treaty that was
to create the European Union.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.280
Europe was destroyed.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.080
A world war had emerged from Europe.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.936
The human suffering was unbelievable

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.680
and unprecedented.
