Algorithms that rely on crunching
enormous amounts of data

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.256
can enable our doctors
to give us a much better treatment,

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.920
and many other things.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.520
But no one is going
to hand over their medical data

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.800
or step into a car
that's driven by an algorithm

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.440
unless they trust the companies
that they are dealing with.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.920
And that trust isn't always there.
