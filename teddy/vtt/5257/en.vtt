Imagine, for a second,
a duck teaching a French class,

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:15.163
a ping-pong match in orbit 
around a black hole,

00:00:15.163 --> 00:00:17.788
a dolphin balancing a pineapple.

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:21.288
You probably haven't actually seen
any of these things,

00:00:21.288 --> 00:00:23.913
but you could imagine them instantly.

00:00:23.913 --> 00:00:27.621
How does your brain produce an image
of something you've never seen?

00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:28.954
That may not seem hard,

00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:31.954
but that's only because 
we're so used to doing it.
