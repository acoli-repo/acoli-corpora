00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:08.894
We like to think of romantic feelings

00:00:08.918 --> 00:00:13.033
as spontaneous and indescribable
things that come from the heart.

00:00:13.057 --> 00:00:14.622
But it's actually your brain

00:00:14.646 --> 00:00:18.745
running a complex series of calculations
within a matter of seconds

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.483
that's responsible
for determining attraction.

00:00:21.507 --> 00:00:23.610
Doesn't sound quite as poetic, does it?

00:00:23.634 --> 00:00:26.788
But just because the calculations
are happening in your brain

00:00:26.812 --> 00:00:30.134
doesn't mean those warm,
fuzzy feelings are all in your head.
