That sense of belonging was really key,

00:09:33.641 --> 00:09:37.619
and it showed up in a remarkable,
beautiful way one day

00:09:37.643 --> 00:09:42.561
when we were in the Johannesburg airport,
waiting to go through customs

00:09:42.585 --> 00:09:45.494
on our way to Botswana
for a service learning trip.

00:09:46.046 --> 00:09:49.048
I saw a group of kids
kind of huddled in a circle.

00:09:49.752 --> 00:09:52.435
Usually, with teens,
that means something's going on.

00:09:52.459 --> 00:09:54.014
(Laughter)

00:09:54.363 --> 00:09:56.649
So I kind of walked up behind the kids

00:09:56.673 --> 00:09:59.093
to figure out what they were
talking about.

00:09:59.711 --> 00:10:02.546
They were comparing passport stamps.
