tend to have access
to additional resources,

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.133
like summer enrichment activities,

00:03:36.157 --> 00:03:37.680
internships

00:03:37.704 --> 00:03:39.776
and an expansive curriculum

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.809
that takes them out of the classroom
and into the world

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:47.054
in ways that look great
on college applications.

00:03:47.737 --> 00:03:52.070
But we're not providing
those kinds of opportunities for everyone.

00:03:52.712 --> 00:03:56.117
And the result isn't just
that some kids miss out.

00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:58.807
I think we, as a society, miss out too.

00:03:59.582 --> 00:04:03.655
You see, I've got a crazy theory
about the folks in the middle.
