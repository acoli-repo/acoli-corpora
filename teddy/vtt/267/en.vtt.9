00:04:28.998 --> 00:04:31.148
are capable of a lot more.

00:04:31.665 --> 00:04:36.180
And I think people stay in the middle
because that's where we relegated them to

00:04:36.204 --> 00:04:39.319
and, sometimes, that's just
where they're kind of chilling

00:04:39.343 --> 00:04:41.490
while they figure things out.

00:04:42.609 --> 00:04:44.522
All of our journeys

00:04:44.546 --> 00:04:50.990
are made up of a series of rest stops,
accelerations, losses and wins.

00:04:51.856 --> 00:04:54.522
We have a responsibility to make sure

00:04:54.546 --> 00:05:01.315

and socioeconomic identity
