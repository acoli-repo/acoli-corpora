that one's racial, gender, cultural
and socioeconomic identity

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:05.932
is never the reason you didn't have

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.260
So, just as my mother did with me,

00:05:10.284 --> 00:05:14.307
I began with high expectations
with my young people.

00:05:14.815 --> 00:05:16.871
And I started with a question.

00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:20.998
I stopped asking kids,
"Hey, do you want to go to college?"

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.434
I started asking them,

00:05:23.458 --> 00:05:26.192
"What college would you like to attend?"

00:05:26.855 --> 00:05:28.428
You see, the first question --

00:05:28.452 --> 00:05:33.644
