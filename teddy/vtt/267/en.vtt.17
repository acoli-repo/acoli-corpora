It was so gratifying to see the kids
calling each other and texting each other

00:08:32.724 --> 00:08:35.789
to say, "Hey, why are you late
for SAT prep?"

00:08:36.135 --> 00:08:39.722
And, "What are you packing
for the college tour tomorrow?"

00:08:41.019 --> 00:08:45.198
We really worked to kind of make
college the thing to do.

00:08:45.734 --> 00:08:50.319
We began to create programs
on college campuses

00:08:50.343 --> 00:08:55.332
and events that allow young people
to really visualize themselves

00:08:55.356 --> 00:08:58.530
as college students and college graduates.

Me and my staff
rocked our own college gear
