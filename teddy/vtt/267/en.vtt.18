00:08:59.069 --> 00:09:02.379
Me and my staff
rocked our own college gear

00:09:02.403 --> 00:09:08.495
and had lots of fun, healthy competition
about whose school was better than whose.

00:09:09.355 --> 00:09:11.347
The kids really bought into it,

00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:16.437
and they began to see that something more
was possible for their lives.

00:09:16.871 --> 00:09:21.270
Not only that -- they could look around
at that college-going community

00:09:21.294 --> 00:09:24.270
and see kids who came
from the same backgrounds

00:09:24.294 --> 00:09:25.984
and the same neighborhoods

00:09:26.008 --> 00:09:29.150
and who were aspiring to the same things.
