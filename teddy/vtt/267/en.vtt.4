00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:04.799
As a former research librarian
and an educator,

00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:09.773
my mother knew that I was capable
of accomplishing a lot more.

00:02:10.424 --> 00:02:12.551
But she also understood

00:02:12.575 --> 00:02:16.035
that because I was a young
black woman in America,

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:19.640
I might not have opportunities
out of the middle

00:02:19.664 --> 00:02:23.066
if she wasn't intentional
about creating them.

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:27.394
So she moved me to a different school.

00:02:28.267 --> 00:02:32.557
She signed me up for leadership
activities in my neighborhood.
