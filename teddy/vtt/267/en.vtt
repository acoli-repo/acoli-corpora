about the forgotten middle.

00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:12.116
To me, they are the students,
coworkers and plain old regular folks

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.195
who are often overlooked

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.415
because they're seen
as neither exceptional nor problematic.

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:22.164
They're the kids we think we can ignore

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:26.847
because their needs for support
don't seem particularly urgent.

00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:29.355
They're the coworkers

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:33.616
who actually keep the engines
of our organizations running,
