A young woman I had been
mentoring for a long time, Nicole,

00:07:00.796 --> 00:07:02.860
came to my office one day,

00:07:02.884 --> 00:07:08.190
after her guidance counselor
looked at her pretty strong transcript

00:07:08.214 --> 00:07:10.921
and expressed utter shock and amazement

00:07:10.945 --> 00:07:14.222
that she was even interested
in going to college.

00:07:14.952 --> 00:07:19.744
What the guidance counselor didn't know
was that through her community,

00:07:19.768 --> 00:07:23.553
Nicole had had access
to college prep work,

00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:27.461
SAT prep and international
travel programs.

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:31.256
Not only was college in her future,
