00:10:29.506 --> 00:10:34.133
and all the doctors, lawyers,
teachers, social workers,

00:10:34.157 --> 00:10:36.212
journalists and artists

00:10:36.236 --> 00:10:40.211
who came from our little nook
in New York City,

00:10:40.235 --> 00:10:43.132
I hate to think
of what would have happened

00:10:43.156 --> 00:10:45.556
if we hadn't invested in the middle.

00:10:46.076 --> 00:10:49.779
Just think about all
that their communities and the world

00:10:49.803 --> 00:10:51.470
would have missed out on.

00:10:52.673 --> 00:10:56.944
This formula for the middle
doesn't just work with young people.

00:10:57.724 --> 00:11:00.994
It can transform
our organizations as well.
