Not only was college in her future,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.093
but I'm proud to say that Nicole
went on to earn two master's degrees

00:07:36.117 --> 00:07:39.037
after graduating from Purdue University.

00:07:39.061 --> 00:07:45.121
(Applause)

00:07:45.145 --> 00:07:50.208
We also made it our business
to hold our young people accountable,

00:07:50.232 --> 00:07:55.712
but also to instill a sense
of accountability in those young people

00:07:55.736 --> 00:08:01.492
to themselves, to each other,
to their families and their communities.
