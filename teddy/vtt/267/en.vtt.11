00:05:33.668 --> 00:05:38.183
The first question leaves
a lot of vague possibilities open.

00:05:38.585 --> 00:05:40.426
But the second question

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.161
says something about what I thought
my young people were capable of.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.959
On a basic level,

00:05:46.983 --> 00:05:51.242
it assumes that they're going to
graduate from high school successfully.

00:05:51.715 --> 00:05:53.651
It also assumed

00:05:53.675 --> 00:05:56.921
that they would have
the kinds of academic records

00:05:56.945 --> 00:06:01.016
that could get them college
and university admissions.
