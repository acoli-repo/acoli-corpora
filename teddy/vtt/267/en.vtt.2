As a junior high school student,
I hung out in the middle.

00:01:11.848 --> 00:01:14.781
For a long time,
I had been a good student.

00:01:15.315 --> 00:01:18.363
But seventh grade was a game changer.

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:23.585
I spent my days gossiping, passing notes,

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:26.076
generally goofing off with my friends.

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.217
I spent my homework time on the phone,
reviewing each day's events.
