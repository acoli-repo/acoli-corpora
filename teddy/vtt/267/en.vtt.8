You see, I've got a crazy theory
about the folks in the middle.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.394
I think there are some unclaimed
winning lottery tickets in the middle.

00:04:10.038 --> 00:04:14.260
I think the cure for cancer
and the path to world peace

00:04:14.284 --> 00:04:16.521
might very well reside there.

00:04:17.378 --> 00:04:19.236
Now, as a former middle school teacher,

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.497
I'm not saying that magically everyone
is suddenly going to become an A student.

00:04:25.228 --> 00:04:28.974
But I also believe
that most folks in the middle

00:04:28.998 --> 00:04:31.148
are capable of a lot more.
