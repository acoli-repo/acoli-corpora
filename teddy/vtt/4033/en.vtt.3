00:01:30.288 --> 00:01:31.792
Imagine you're at a party,

00:01:31.816 --> 00:01:35.336
and somebody asks you a question
that you don't know the answer to.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.120
If you have one of these,
in a few seconds, you can know the answer.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.168
But this is just a primitive beginning.

00:01:42.863 --> 00:01:46.194
Even Siri is just a passive tool.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.041
In fact, for the last
three-and-a-half million years,

00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:53.174
the tools that we've had
have been completely passive.

00:01:54.203 --> 00:01:57.858
They do exactly what we tell them
and nothing more.

00:01:57.882 --> 00:02:00.983
Our very first tool only cut
where we struck it.
