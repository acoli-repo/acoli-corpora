00:09:28.765 --> 00:09:31.521
which, by the way,
because it's a non-isomorphic material,

00:09:31.545 --> 00:09:33.419
is super hard for robots to deal with.

00:09:33.443 --> 00:09:35.465
But then the robots
did this fiber winding,

00:09:35.489 --> 00:09:37.940
which was almost impossible
for a human to do.

00:09:37.964 --> 00:09:41.585
And then we had an AI
that was controlling everything.

00:09:41.609 --> 00:09:44.899
It was telling the humans what to do,
telling the robots what to do

00:09:44.923 --> 00:09:47.838
and keeping track of thousands
of individual components.

00:09:47.862 --> 00:09:49.042
What's interesting is,

00:09:49.066 --> 00:09:52.207
building this pavilion
was simply not possible

00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:56.755
without human, robot and AI
augmenting each other.

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.210
OK, I'll share one more project.
This one's a little bit crazy.
