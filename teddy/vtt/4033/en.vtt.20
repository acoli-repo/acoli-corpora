OK, I'll share one more project.
This one's a little bit crazy.

00:10:01.234 --> 00:10:05.702
We're working with Amsterdam-based artist
Joris Laarman and his team at MX3D

00:10:05.726 --> 00:10:08.604
to generatively design
and robotically print

00:10:08.628 --> 00:10:11.623
the world's first autonomously
manufactured bridge.

00:10:12.315 --> 00:10:16.000
So, Joris and an AI are designing
this thing right now, as we speak,

00:10:16.024 --> 00:10:17.196
in Amsterdam.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.541
And when they're done,
we're going to hit "Go,"

00:10:19.565 --> 00:10:22.876
and robots will start 3D printing
in stainless steel,

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.183
and then they're going to keep printing,
without human intervention,

00:10:26.207 --> 00:10:27.765
until the bridge is finished.

00:10:29.099 --> 00:10:32.027
So, as computers are going
to augment our ability
