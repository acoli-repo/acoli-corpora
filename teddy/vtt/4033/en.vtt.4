00:01:57.882 --> 00:02:00.983
Our very first tool only cut
where we struck it.

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:04.862
The chisel only carves
where the artist points it.

00:02:05.343 --> 00:02:10.984
And even our most advanced tools
do nothing without our explicit direction.

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.189
In fact, to date, and this
is something that frustrates me,

00:02:14.213 --> 00:02:15.661
we've always been limited

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:19.186
by this need to manually
push our wills into our tools --

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.507
like, manual,
literally using our hands,

00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:22.959
even with computers.

00:02:24.072 --> 00:02:26.535
But I'm more like Scotty in "Star Trek."

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:28.409
(Laughter)

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:30.579
I want to have a conversation
with a computer.
