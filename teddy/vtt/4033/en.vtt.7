It takes big computers to do this.

00:03:31.762 --> 00:03:33.717
But it comes back to us with designs

00:03:33.741 --> 00:03:36.884
that we, by ourselves,
never could've imagined.

00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:40.238
And the computer's coming up
with this stuff all by itself --

00:03:40.262 --> 00:03:41.940
no one ever drew anything,

00:03:41.964 --> 00:03:44.050
and it started completely from scratch.

00:03:45.038 --> 00:03:47.425
And by the way, it's no accident

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.930
that the drone body looks just like
the pelvis of a flying squirrel.

00:03:51.287 --> 00:03:53.294
(Laughter)

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.342
It's because the algorithms
are designed to work

00:03:56.366 --> 00:03:58.003
the same way evolution does.

00:03:58.715 --> 00:04:01.375
What's exciting is we're starting
to see this technology
