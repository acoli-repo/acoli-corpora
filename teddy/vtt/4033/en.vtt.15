00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.177
that we've never faced before.

00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:31.602
For instance, climate change.

00:07:31.626 --> 00:07:33.646
We're not doing a very
good job on our own,

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.915
we could certainly use
all the help we can get.

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:37.397
That's what I'm talking about,

00:07:37.421 --> 00:07:39.976
technology amplifying
our cognitive abilities

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.552
so we can imagine and design things
that were simply out of our reach

00:07:43.576 --> 00:07:46.135
as plain old un-augmented humans.

00:07:47.984 --> 00:07:50.925
So what about making
all of this crazy new stuff

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:53.390
that we're going to invent and design?

00:07:53.952 --> 00:07:58.045
I think the era of human augmentation
is as much about the physical world

00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:01.134
as it is about the virtual,
intellectual realm.
