So, as computers are going
to augment our ability

00:10:32.051 --> 00:10:34.201
to imagine and design new stuff,

00:10:34.225 --> 00:10:37.120
robotic systems are going to help us
build and make things

00:10:37.144 --> 00:10:39.228
that we've never been able to make before.

00:10:40.347 --> 00:10:44.507
But what about our ability
to sense and control these things?

00:10:44.531 --> 00:10:48.562
What about a nervous system
for the things that we make?

00:10:48.586 --> 00:10:51.098
Our nervous system,
the human nervous system,

00:10:51.122 --> 00:10:53.433
tells us everything
that's going on around us.

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:57.870
But the nervous system of the things
we make is rudimentary at best.

00:10:57.894 --> 00:11:01.457
For instance, a car doesn't tell
