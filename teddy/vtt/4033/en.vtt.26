00:12:57.935 --> 00:13:00.570
put a world-class driver behind the wheel,

00:13:00.594 --> 00:13:03.951
took it out to the desert
and drove the hell out of it for a week.

00:13:03.975 --> 00:13:06.466
And the car's nervous system
captured everything

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:07.972
that was happening to the car.

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:10.617
We captured four billion data points;

00:13:10.641 --> 00:13:12.951
all of the forces
that it was subjected to.

00:13:12.975 --> 00:13:14.634
And then we did something crazy.

00:13:15.268 --> 00:13:16.768
We took all of that data,

00:13:16.792 --> 00:13:20.528
and plugged it into a generative-design AI
we call "Dreamcatcher."

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:25.234
So what do get when you give
a design tool a nervous system,

00:13:25.258 --> 00:13:28.140
and you ask it to build you
the ultimate car chassis?

00:13:28.723 --> 00:13:30.696
You get this.
