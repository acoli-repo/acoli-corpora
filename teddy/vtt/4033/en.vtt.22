For instance, a car doesn't tell
the city's public works department

00:11:01.481 --> 00:11:04.611
that it just hit a pothole at the corner
of Broadway and Morrison.

00:11:04.635 --> 00:11:06.667
A building doesn't tell its designers

00:11:06.691 --> 00:11:09.375
whether or not the people inside
like being there,

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:12.409
and the toy manufacturer doesn't know

00:11:12.433 --> 00:11:14.440
if a toy is actually being played with --

00:11:14.464 --> 00:11:17.003
how and where and whether
or not it's any fun.

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.434
Look, I'm sure that the designers
imagined this lifestyle for Barbie

00:11:21.458 --> 00:11:22.682
when they designed her.

00:11:22.706 --> 00:11:24.153
(Laughter)

00:11:24.177 --> 00:11:27.083
But what if it turns out that Barbie's
actually really lonely?

00:11:27.107 --> 00:11:30.254
(Laughter)
