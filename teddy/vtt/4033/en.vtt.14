00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:01.410
And that's exactly the kind of intuition

00:07:01.434 --> 00:07:05.002
that our deep-learning systems
are starting to develop right now.

00:07:05.722 --> 00:07:07.429
Very soon, you'll literally be able

00:07:07.453 --> 00:07:09.659
to show something you've made,
you've designed,

00:07:09.683 --> 00:07:10.836
to a computer,

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.349
and it will look at it and say,

00:07:12.373 --> 00:07:15.196
"Sorry, homie, that'll never work.
You have to try again."

00:07:15.854 --> 00:07:18.924
Or you could ask it if people
are going to like your next song,

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.836
or your next flavor of ice cream.

00:07:23.549 --> 00:07:26.128
Or, much more importantly,

00:07:26.152 --> 00:07:28.516
you could work with a computer
to solve a problem

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.177
that we've never faced before.
