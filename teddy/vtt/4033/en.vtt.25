00:12:30.016 --> 00:12:33.728
with a couple of guys down in Los Angeles
called the Bandito Brothers

00:12:33.752 --> 00:12:35.159
and their team.

00:12:35.183 --> 00:12:38.616
And one of the things these guys do
is build insane cars

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.513
that do absolutely insane things.

00:12:42.905 --> 00:12:44.355
These guys are crazy --

00:12:44.379 --> 00:12:45.415

00:12:45.439 --> 00:12:46.842

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:53.220
is taking a traditional race-car chassis

00:12:53.244 --> 00:12:54.829
and giving it a nervous system.

00:12:54.853 --> 00:12:57.911
So we instrumented it
with dozens of sensors,

00:12:57.935 --> 00:13:00.570
put a world-class driver behind the wheel,
