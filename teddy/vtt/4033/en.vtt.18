00:08:59.895 --> 00:09:02.884
We're using the human
for what the human is good at:

00:09:02.908 --> 00:09:05.241
awareness, perception and decision making.

00:09:05.265 --> 00:09:07.505
And we're using the robot
for what it's good at:

00:09:07.529 --> 00:09:09.277
precision and repetitiveness.

00:09:10.252 --> 00:09:12.619
Here's another cool project
that Bishop worked on.

00:09:12.643 --> 00:09:15.718
The goal of this project,
which we called the HIVE,

00:09:15.742 --> 00:09:19.593
was to prototype the experience
of humans, computers and robots

00:09:19.617 --> 00:09:22.837
all working together to solve
a highly complex design problem.

00:09:23.793 --> 00:09:25.244
The humans acted as labor.

00:09:25.268 --> 00:09:28.741
They cruised around the construction site,
they manipulated the bamboo --

00:09:28.765 --> 00:09:31.521
which, by the way,
because it's a non-isomorphic material,
