00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:33.139
In fact, I think we're at the dawn
of a new age in human history.

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:38.406
Now, there have been four major historical
eras defined by the way we work.

00:00:39.404 --> 00:00:42.679
The Hunter-Gatherer Age
lasted several million years.

00:00:43.163 --> 00:00:46.739
And then the Agricultural Age
lasted several thousand years.

00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:50.685
The Industrial Age lasted
a couple of centuries.

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:54.996
And now the Information Age
has lasted just a few decades.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.240
And now today, we're on the cusp
of our next great era as a species.
