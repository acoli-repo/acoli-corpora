Then 45 years later, in 1997,

00:05:30.053 --> 00:05:32.525
Deep Blue beats Kasparov at chess.

00:05:34.046 --> 00:05:39.014
2011, Watson beats these two
humans at Jeopardy,

00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:41.966
which is much harder for a computer
to play than chess is.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.802
In fact, rather than working
from predefined recipes,

00:05:45.826 --> 00:05:49.149
Watson had to use reasoning
to overcome his human opponents.

00:05:50.393 --> 00:05:52.832
And then a couple of weeks ago,

00:05:52.856 --> 00:05:57.118
DeepMind's AlphaGo beats
the world's best human at Go,

00:05:57.142 --> 00:05:59.354
which is the most difficult
game that we have.

00:05:59.378 --> 00:06:02.274
In fact, in Go, there are more
possible moves
