00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.415
Thanks to our augmented capabilities,

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:34.816
our world is going to change dramatically.

00:14:35.576 --> 00:14:38.822
We're going to have a world
with more variety, more connectedness,

00:14:38.846 --> 00:14:41.133
more dynamism, more complexity,

00:14:41.157 --> 00:14:43.475
more adaptability and, of course,

00:14:43.499 --> 00:14:44.716
more beauty.

00:14:45.231 --> 00:14:46.795
The shape of things to come

00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:49.109
will be unlike anything
we've ever seen before.

00:14:49.133 --> 00:14:50.292
Why?

00:14:50.316 --> 00:14:54.071
Because what will be shaping those things
is this new partnership

00:14:54.095 --> 00:14:57.765
between technology, nature and humanity.

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:03.083
That, to me, is a future
well worth looking forward to.
