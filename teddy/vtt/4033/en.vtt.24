convincing people to buy
the things we've made.

00:12:04.644 --> 00:12:08.032
But if you had this connection
to the things that you design and create

00:12:08.056 --> 00:12:09.783

00:12:09.807 --> 00:12:13.421

or launched or whatever,

00:12:13.445 --> 00:12:15.065

want in the first place.

00:12:21.618 --> 00:12:24.405
The good news is, we're working
on digital nervous systems

00:12:24.429 --> 00:12:27.230
that connect us to the things we design.

00:12:28.365 --> 00:12:29.992
We're working on one project
