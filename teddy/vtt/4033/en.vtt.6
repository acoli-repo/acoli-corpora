00:02:58.163 --> 00:03:00.771
to synthesize geometry

00:03:00.795 --> 00:03:03.549
to come up with new designs
all by themselves.

00:03:03.996 --> 00:03:06.744
All it needs are your goals
and your constraints.

00:03:06.768 --> 00:03:08.176
I'll give you an example.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.988
In the case of this aerial drone chassis,

00:03:11.012 --> 00:03:13.638
all you would need to do
is tell it something like,

00:03:13.662 --> 00:03:14.935
it has four propellers,

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.090
you want it to be
as lightweight as possible,

00:03:17.114 --> 00:03:19.384
and you need it to be
aerodynamically efficient.

00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:24.322
Then what the computer does
is it explores the entire solution space:

00:03:24.346 --> 00:03:28.273
every single possibility that solves
and meets your criteria --

00:03:28.297 --> 00:03:29.739
millions of them.

00:03:29.763 --> 00:03:31.738
It takes big computers to do this.
