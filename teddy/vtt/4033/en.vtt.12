00:05:59.378 --> 00:06:02.274
In fact, in Go, there are more
possible moves

00:06:02.298 --> 00:06:04.322
than there are atoms in the universe.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.036
So in order to win,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.678
what AlphaGo had to do
was develop intuition.

00:06:11.098 --> 00:06:15.208
And in fact, at some points,
AlphaGo's programmers didn't understand

00:06:15.232 --> 00:06:17.518
why AlphaGo was doing what it was doing.

00:06:19.451 --> 00:06:21.111
And things are moving really fast.

00:06:21.135 --> 00:06:24.362
I mean, consider --
in the space of a human lifetime,

00:06:24.386 --> 00:06:26.619
computers have gone from a child's game

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.968
to what's recognized as the pinnacle
of strategic thought.
