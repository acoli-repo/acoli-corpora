00:03:58.715 --> 00:04:01.375
What's exciting is we're starting
to see this technology

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:02.558
out in the real world.

00:04:02.582 --> 00:04:05.034
We've been working with Airbus
for a couple of years

00:04:05.058 --> 00:04:06.967
on this concept plane for the future.

00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:09.061
It's a ways out still.

00:04:09.085 --> 00:04:12.865
But just recently we used
a generative-design AI

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.696
to come up with this.

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.762
This is a 3D-printed cabin partition
that's been designed by a computer.

00:04:20.786 --> 00:04:23.610
It's stronger than the original
yet half the weight,

00:04:23.634 --> 00:04:26.780
and it will be flying
in the Airbus A320 later this year.

00:04:27.405 --> 00:04:28.964
So computers can now generate;

00:04:28.988 --> 00:04:33.583
they can come up with their own solutions
to our well-defined problems.
