00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:30.579
I want to have a conversation
with a computer.

00:02:30.603 --> 00:02:33.573
I want to say, "Computer,
let's design a car,"

00:02:33.597 --> 00:02:35.136
and the computer shows me a car.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.768
And I say, "No, more fast-looking,
and less German,"

00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:39.955
and bang, the computer shows me an option.

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:41.844
(Laughter)

00:02:42.208 --> 00:02:44.514
That conversation might be
a little ways off,

00:02:44.538 --> 00:02:47.203
probably less than many of us think,

00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:48.990
but right now,

00:02:49.014 --> 00:02:50.165
we're working on it.

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.222
Tools are making this leap
from being passive to being generative.

00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:58.139
Generative design tools
use a computer and algorithms

00:02:58.163 --> 00:03:00.771
to synthesize geometry
