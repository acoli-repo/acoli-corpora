00:04:28.988 --> 00:04:33.583
they can come up with their own solutions
to our well-defined problems.

00:04:34.677 --> 00:04:35.987
But they're not intuitive.

00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:39.097
They still have to start from scratch
every single time,

00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:41.686
and that's because they never learn.

00:04:42.368 --> 00:04:44.134
Unlike Maggie.

00:04:44.158 --> 00:04:45.739
(Laughter)

00:04:45.763 --> 00:04:49.060
Maggie's actually smarter
than our most advanced design tools.

00:04:49.467 --> 00:04:50.907
What do I mean by that?

00:04:50.931 --> 00:04:52.521
If her owner picks up that leash,

00:04:52.545 --> 00:04:54.613
Maggie knows with a fair
degree of certainty

00:04:54.637 --> 00:04:56.041
it's time to go for a walk.

00:04:56.065 --> 00:04:57.250
And how did she learn?

00:04:57.274 --> 00:05:00.598
Well, every time the owner picked up
the leash, they went for a walk.
