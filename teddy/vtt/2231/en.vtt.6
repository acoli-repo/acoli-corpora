00:02:57.208 --> 00:03:00.351
And I can measure the charge separation
with this voltmeter here.

00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:02.143
Now -- let's make sure it's working.

00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:04.434
So when I wave my hand near the plates,

00:03:04.458 --> 00:03:06.684
you can see that the voltage changes

00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:09.250
just like the touchscreen
responds to my hand.

00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.518
But what is it about my hand?
Now I need to do more experiments.

00:03:13.542 --> 00:03:15.851
So I can, say, take a piece of wood

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:19.434
and touch one of the plates
and see that not much happens,

00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:22.101
but if I take a piece of metal
and touch the plate,

00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:24.000
then the voltage changes dramatically.

00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.101
So now I can do further experiments
to see what the difference is

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:29.684
between the wood and the metal,

00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:32.226
and I should find out
that the wood is not conducting
