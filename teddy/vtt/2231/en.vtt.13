Remember one of these things?

00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:38.809
So at first, none of them
wanted to touch it.

00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:41.601
They'd been told for so long
not to break things

00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:44.768
that they're accustomed
to just passive using.

00:06:44.792 --> 00:06:46.809
But then I started asking them questions.

00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:49.351
You know, how does it work?
What parts are magnetic?

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:51.476
Can you make a hypothesis and test it?

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.809
But they still didn't want
to break it open.

00:06:53.833 --> 00:06:56.059
They wanted to take it
home with them, really.

00:06:56.083 --> 00:07:01.309
Until, one kid finally sliced it through
and found really cool stuff inside.
