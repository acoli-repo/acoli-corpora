00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:01.434
and understanding through research,

00:06:01.458 --> 00:06:04.208
a big part of my connection
to the world was complete.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.309
Now, I know that not everyone is
an experimental physicist by profession,

00:06:10.333 --> 00:06:13.917
but I think that everyone could
be doing more hands-on experiments.

00:06:14.792 --> 00:06:16.601
And actually I think we sort of --

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:18.917
I'll give you another example.

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:23.059
I was recently working
with some middle school students,

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:25.059
helping them learn about magnetism,

00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:29.434
and I gave them
a Magna Doodle to take apart.

00:06:29.458 --> 00:06:31.542
Remember one of these things?
