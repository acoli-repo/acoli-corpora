00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.268
Now, for me this focus on experiments

00:05:00.292 --> 00:05:01.976
is also personal.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.018
I didn't grow up doing experiments.

00:05:04.042 --> 00:05:05.934
I didn't know what a physicist did.

00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:09.184
I remember my sister had a chemistry set
that I always wanted to use

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:10.542
but she never let me touch.

00:05:11.708 --> 00:05:14.351
I felt mentally disconnected
from the world

00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:16.393
and didn't know why.

00:05:16.417 --> 00:05:18.268
In fact, when I was nine years old,

00:05:18.292 --> 00:05:20.601
my grandmother called me a solipsist,

00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:22.393
which is something I had to look up.

00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:26.292
It means that you think
that yourself is all that exists.

00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:29.768
And at the time I was pretty offended,

00:05:29.792 --> 00:05:31.893
because whose grandmother calls them that?
