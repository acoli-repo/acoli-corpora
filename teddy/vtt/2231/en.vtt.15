00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.542
And when I drag the pen on it,

00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:39.393
you can see that these filaments
are attached to it.

00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:40.976
So the kids saw this,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.434
and at this point they're like,
this is really cool.

00:07:43.458 --> 00:07:44.726
They got excited.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.684
They all started ripping them open
and taking them apart

00:07:47.708 --> 00:07:50.559
and yelling out the things
that they discovered,

00:07:50.583 --> 00:07:54.351
how these magnetic filaments
connected to the magnetic pen

00:07:54.375 --> 00:07:55.684
and that's how it wrote.

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:59.042
Or, how the oozy white stuff
kept things dispersed so it could write.
