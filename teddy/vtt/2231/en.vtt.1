00:00:36.083 --> 00:00:38.750
So think about it: what would you do?

00:00:39.583 --> 00:00:42.809
What do you really understand
about how your phone works?

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:46.226
What are you willing to test or fix?

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.059
For most people, the answer is, nothing.

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.893
In fact, one survey found

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:55.101

of smartphone users in this country

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:57.643
have never even replaced
their phone batteries,

00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:01.375
and 25 percent didn't even know
this was possible.
