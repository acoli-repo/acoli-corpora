00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:30.393
It's the way that we use our senses,

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:31.726
our hands,

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.393
to connect the world

00:02:33.417 --> 00:02:35.809
and figure out how it works.

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:38.809
And that's the connection
that we're missing.

00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:41.351
So let me give you an example.

00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:43.351
Here's an experiment that I did recently

00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:45.518
to think about how a touchscreen works.

00:02:45.542 --> 00:02:47.434
It's just two metal plates,

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:51.542
and I can put charge
on one of the plates from a battery.

00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:57.184
OK.

00:02:57.208 --> 00:03:00.351
And I can measure the charge separation
with this voltmeter here.
