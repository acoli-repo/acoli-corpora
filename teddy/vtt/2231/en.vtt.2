00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:01.375
and 25 percent didn't even know
this was possible.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.643
Now, I'm an experimental physicist,

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:06.292
hence the toys.

00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:12.184
I specialize in making new types
of nanoscale electronic devices

00:01:12.208 --> 00:01:15.542
to study their fundamental
quantum mechanical properties.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:21.726
But even I wouldn't know where to start
in terms of testing elements on my phone

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.226
if it broke.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.226
And phones are just one example
of the many devices that we depend upon

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.351
but can't test, take apart,
or even fully understand.
