You've interacted with the technology
and understood the basis of these devices.

00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:39.768
Now, I know that it's hard
to add more things to our lives,

00:10:39.792 --> 00:10:42.143
especially experiments.

00:10:42.167 --> 00:10:45.101
But I think that
the challenge is worth it.

00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:49.226
Think about how something works,
then take it apart to test it.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:53.375
Manipulate something and prove
some physical principle to yourself.

00:10:54.292 --> 00:10:57.333
Put the human back in the technology.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:01.143
You'll be surprised at
the connections that you make.
