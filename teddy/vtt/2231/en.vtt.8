00:03:56.875 --> 00:04:00.351
But experimenting is a step
beyond just taking things apart.

00:04:00.375 --> 00:04:04.393
It's testing and doing
hands-on critical thinking.

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:07.893
And it doesn't really matter whether
I'm testing how a touchscreen works

00:04:07.917 --> 00:04:11.393
or if I'm measuring how conducting
different types of materials are,

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:14.893
or even if I'm just using my hands
to see how hard it is to break

00:04:14.917 --> 00:04:17.351
different thicknesses of materials.

00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:20.559
In all cases, I'm gaining control
and understanding

00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:22.792
of the basis of the things that I use.

00:04:23.875 --> 00:04:25.601
And there's research behind this.

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:27.518
For one, I'm using my hands,

00:04:27.542 --> 00:04:29.583
which seem to promote well-being.
