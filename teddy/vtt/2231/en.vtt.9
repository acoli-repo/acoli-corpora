I'm also engaging in hands-on learning,

00:04:32.792 --> 00:04:36.768
which has been shown
to improve understanding and retention,

00:04:36.792 --> 00:04:39.333
and even activate
more parts of your brain.

00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:43.518
So hands-on thinking through experiments

00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:45.768
connects our understanding,

00:04:45.792 --> 00:04:47.893
even our sense of vitality,

00:04:47.917 --> 00:04:50.833
to the physical world
and the things that we use.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:53.559
Looking things up on the internet

00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:55.208

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.268
Now, for me this focus on experiments
