Now, superconductors can be complex,

00:10:03.542 --> 00:10:08.101
but even simple experiments
can connect us better to the world.

00:10:08.125 --> 00:10:12.976
So now if I tell you that flash memory
works by rotating small magnets,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.518
then you can imagine it. You've seen it.

00:10:15.542 --> 00:10:17.768
Or, if I say that MRI machines

00:10:17.792 --> 00:10:22.226
use magnetism to rotate
magnetic particles in your body,

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.101
you've seen it done.

00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:31.250
You've interacted with the technology
and understood the basis of these devices.
