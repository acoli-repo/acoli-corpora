and I should find out
that the wood is not conducting

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.893
but the metal is conducting like my hand.

00:03:34.917 --> 00:03:37.643
And, you see, I build up my understanding.

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:40.768
Like, now I can see why I can't use
a touchscreen with gloves,

00:03:40.792 --> 00:03:42.458
because gloves aren't conducting.

00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:48.476
But I've also broken down
some of the mystery behind the technology

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.601
and built up my agency,

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:55.333
my personal input and interactions
with the basis of my devices.

00:03:56.875 --> 00:04:00.351
But experimenting is a step
beyond just taking things apart.
