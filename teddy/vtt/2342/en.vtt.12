00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.343
that's what the figures are called,
that's where we get the GDP --

00:06:00.367 --> 00:06:02.796
in the New Zealand national accounts,

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.856
the milk of buffalo, goats, sheep and cows

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.036
is of value

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.214
but not human breast milk.

00:06:09.238 --> 00:06:10.551
(Laughter)

00:06:11.506 --> 00:06:14.218
It is the very best food on the planet.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.967
It is the very best investment
that we can make in the future health

00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:21.462
and education of that child.

00:06:21.486 --> 00:06:23.307
It doesn't count at all.

00:06:23.918 --> 00:06:29.260
All of those activities are on
the wrong side of the production boundary.
