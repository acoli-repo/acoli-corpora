00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:00.499
And ever since that time,

00:07:01.517 --> 00:07:03.651
New Zealand has been told

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:09.560
our growth figures are great,
because we're rebuilding Christchurch.

00:07:11.028 --> 00:07:13.041
Nothing was ever lost

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:16.410
from the national accounting framework

00:07:16.434 --> 00:07:18.132
because of the loss of lives,

00:07:18.156 --> 00:07:20.056
the loss of land,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.759
the loss of buildings,

00:07:21.783 --> 00:07:24.028
the loss of special spaces.

00:07:25.155 --> 00:07:29.193
Now, it might also
be becoming obvious to you

00:07:29.217 --> 00:07:34.068
that this boundary of production works
in terms of our environment.
