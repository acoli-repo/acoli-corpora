Well, GDP has got many other problems, OK?

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.392
We don't behave in a way that assists GDP.

00:12:35.416 --> 00:12:37.473
Large numbers of people around the planet

00:12:37.497 --> 00:12:42.421
are now using household assets --
their cars, their homes, themselves --

00:12:42.445 --> 00:12:44.945
for Uber, for Airbnb.

00:12:44.969 --> 00:12:49.385
And no, we're not supposed to use
assets from the unpaid sector

00:12:49.409 --> 00:12:51.818
to make money in the market sector.

00:12:51.842 --> 00:12:53.683
This is confusing!

00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:55.805
(Laughter)

00:12:56.311 --> 00:12:59.486
And very difficult to measure.
