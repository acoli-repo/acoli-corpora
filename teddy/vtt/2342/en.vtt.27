I think time use is the most important
indicator going forward.

00:13:31.086 --> 00:13:35.054
Every one of us has exactly
the same amount of it.

00:13:35.078 --> 00:13:40.898
If there are going to be critical issues
as we move forward,

00:13:40.922 --> 00:13:44.319
we need a solid database,

00:13:44.343 --> 00:13:48.616
because whatever we change
away from the GDP,

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.386
we're going to be stuck with it
for about 50 years,

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.566
and we need something
that's solid and immutable

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.623
and that everybody understands,

00:13:56.647 --> 00:13:59.588
because if I put
time use data in front of you,

00:13:59.612 --> 00:14:02.177
you'll immediately start nodding.
