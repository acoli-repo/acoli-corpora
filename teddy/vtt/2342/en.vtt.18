00:08:58.666 --> 00:09:01.896
One of the things that you notice
about these rules --

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:08.913
they are revised; 1968
they were revised, 1993, 2008 --

00:09:09.644 --> 00:09:12.622
is that the revisions
are mostly done by statisticians,

00:09:12.646 --> 00:09:17.323
and the statisticians do know
what is wrong with the data,

00:09:17.347 --> 00:09:22.056
but hardly any of the economists
ever stop to ask that same question.

00:09:22.686 --> 00:09:26.360
So, in 2019,

00:09:26.384 --> 00:09:29.624
the GDP is in even worse shape.
