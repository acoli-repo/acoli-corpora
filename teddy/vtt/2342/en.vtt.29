00:14:28.781 --> 00:14:31.947
at measuring the devastation of it,

00:14:31.971 --> 00:14:35.758
of measuring how little
we protect anymore.

00:14:36.687 --> 00:14:38.972
And yet, with climate change,

00:14:38.996 --> 00:14:44.624
we don't all have to be scientists
to see, to feel, to know

00:14:44.648 --> 00:14:47.148
what is happening to our beautiful planet.

00:14:48.616 --> 00:14:51.088
We need, in this country,

00:14:51.882 --> 00:14:56.770
the paramountcy of what we can learn
from kaitiakitanga,

00:14:56.794 --> 00:14:58.604
from whanaungatanaga,

00:14:58.628 --> 00:15:03.270
from what Maori, who have been here
for centuries, can teach us.
