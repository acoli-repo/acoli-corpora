drugs, endangered species,

00:04:01.653 --> 00:04:03.873
trafficking of people --

00:04:03.897 --> 00:04:06.708
all of this is great for growth

00:04:06.732 --> 00:04:08.214
and it all counts.

00:04:09.102 --> 00:04:12.789
On the other side
of the boundary of production,

00:04:12.813 --> 00:04:16.458
there was this extraordinary
phrase in the rules

00:04:18.244 --> 00:04:24.679
that the work done by the people
they called "nonprimary producers"

00:04:24.703 --> 00:04:28.148
was "of little or no value."

00:04:29.287 --> 00:04:33.892
So I thought, let's see how many
nonprimary producers we have here today.
