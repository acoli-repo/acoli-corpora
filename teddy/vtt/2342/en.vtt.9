So I thought, let's see how many
nonprimary producers we have here today.

00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:37.289
So in the last week or so,

00:04:37.313 --> 00:04:42.421
how many of you have transported
members of your household or their goods

00:04:42.445 --> 00:04:43.949
without payment?

00:04:45.021 --> 00:04:48.477
How many of you have done
a bit of cleaning, a bit of vacuuming,

00:04:48.501 --> 00:04:51.606
a bit of sweeping,
a bit of tidying up the kitchen?

00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:53.507
Yeah?

00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:57.390
How about going shopping
for members of the household?

00:04:58.004 --> 00:05:01.723
Preparing food? Cleaning up afterwards?
