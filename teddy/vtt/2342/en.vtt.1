I remember a woman
who'd been injured in a farm accident,

00:00:30.783 --> 00:00:33.497
and it was coming up to shearing time

00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:34.679
on the farm,

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:39.047
and she had to be replaced by a shepherd,

00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:42.128
by a rousie in the woolshed,

00:00:42.152 --> 00:00:47.449
and of course there was still someone
needed to manage the household

00:00:47.473 --> 00:00:50.743
and to prepare the food
for the shearing gangs.

00:00:51.307 --> 00:00:54.681
And her mother came to help with that.

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:00.138
But the family got
no compensation for the mother,
