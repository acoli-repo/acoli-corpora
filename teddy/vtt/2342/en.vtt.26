00:13:00.399 --> 00:13:03.247
So economists don't want to know

00:13:03.271 --> 00:13:06.967
what's wrong with their
most important GDP,

00:13:06.991 --> 00:13:11.772
and I think they've got so many problems,
they can just move off to a quiet corner

00:13:11.796 --> 00:13:13.728
and continue to publish that

00:13:13.752 --> 00:13:16.596
and not come anywhere near the rest of us

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.168
with this talk of capitals

00:13:19.192 --> 00:13:22.048
and natural assets

00:13:22.072 --> 00:13:26.716
and other ways in which to colonize
the rest of our lives.

00:13:27.291 --> 00:13:31.062
I think time use is the most important
indicator going forward.
