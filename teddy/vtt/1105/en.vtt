00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The things we make

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
have one supreme quality --

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
they live longer than us.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We perish, they survive;

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
we have one life, they have many lives,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and in each life they can mean different things.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Which means that, while we all have one biography,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
they have many.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I want this morning to talk

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
about the story, the biography -- or rather the biographies --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
of one particular object,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
one remarkable thing.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It doesn't, I agree,
