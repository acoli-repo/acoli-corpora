00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.097
This is exactly why machine learning
is such a powerful tool.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.130
These approaches analyze patterns
in relationship and map meaning to them.

00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:36.930
Just a few years ago,
scientists used machine learning

00:03:36.963 --> 00:03:40.763
to translate between two
totally unknown human languages.

00:03:40.797 --> 00:03:43.563
Not by using a Rosetta Stone
or a dictionary,

00:03:43.563 --> 00:03:48.030
but by mapping them on patterns
in higher-dimensional space.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.297
But for machine learning
to work effectively,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.630
it needs data --

00:03:51.663 --> 00:03:54.430
it needs lots and lots of data.

00:03:54.463 --> 00:03:56.197
In the past half-century,

00:03:56.197 --> 00:03:59.697
marine researchers
have painstakingly collected

00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:04.297
and hand annotated just a few thousand
sperm whale vocalizations,
