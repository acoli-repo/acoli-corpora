00:04:59.963 --> 00:05:03.763
if we find an event where a whale
was talking about something yesterday,

00:05:03.797 --> 00:05:05.930
that alone would be a major finding,

00:05:05.963 --> 00:05:09.230
something that has thus far
only been shown in humans.

00:05:09.263 --> 00:05:11.563
And once we've really mastered listening,

00:05:11.563 --> 00:05:14.797
we're going to try
really carefully to talk back

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.030
even on the most simplistic level.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.763
Finally, Project CETI will build
an open-source platform

00:05:19.797 --> 00:05:22.597
where we will make our data sets
available to the public,

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.697
encouraging the global community

00:05:24.697 --> 00:05:27.097
to come along on this journey
for understanding.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.530
These animals could be the most
intelligent beings on this planet.
