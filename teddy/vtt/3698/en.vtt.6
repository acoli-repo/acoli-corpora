00:02:57.063 --> 00:03:00.097
didn't just seem possible,

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.397
it almost seemed inevitable.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.263
But how can analyzing patterns
help us converse with whales

00:03:05.297 --> 00:03:06.563
and other animals?

00:03:06.563 --> 00:03:10.963
Well, step one is to understand
the elements of sperm whale communication.

00:03:10.997 --> 00:03:15.063
These codas you heard don't appear
to be sentences as we know them,

00:03:15.063 --> 00:03:18.030
but there's clear structure
in how these animals communicate.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.963
Sperm whales send codas
back and forth to each other

00:03:20.997 --> 00:03:22.297
in sequences,

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.297
and there are regional dialects
like British and Australian accents.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.097
This is exactly why machine learning
is such a powerful tool.
