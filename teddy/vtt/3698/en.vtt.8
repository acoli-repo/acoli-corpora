WEBVTT

00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:04.297
and hand annotated just a few thousand
sperm whale vocalizations,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.630
but in order to learn
sperm whale communication,

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:09.063
we'll need to collect millions,

00:04:09.063 --> 00:04:11.063
if not tens of millions

00:04:11.063 --> 00:04:13.963
of carefully annotated
sperm whale vocalizations

00:04:13.997 --> 00:04:15.897
correlated with behaviors.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.063
We'll do it with noninvasive,
autonomous, free-swimming robots,

00:04:19.063 --> 00:04:20.763
aerial-aquatic drones,

00:04:20.797 --> 00:04:22.397
bottom-mounted hydrophone arrays

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.697
and more.

00:04:23.697 --> 00:04:27.063
We'll work with our close partners
at the Dominica Sperm Whale Project

00:04:27.063 --> 00:04:29.197
to cover a 20-square-kilometer area

00:04:29.197 --> 00:04:33.763
that is frequented by over 25
well-known families of sperm whales.
