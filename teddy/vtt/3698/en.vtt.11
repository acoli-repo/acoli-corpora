00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.530
These animals could be the most
intelligent beings on this planet.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.397
They have a neocortex and spindle cells --

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.530
structure that in humans
control our higher thoughts,

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.763
emotions, memory, language and love.

00:05:40.797 --> 00:05:44.463
And all the platforms that we develop
can be cross-applied to other animals:

00:05:44.497 --> 00:05:46.097
to elephants, birds,

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.763
primates, dolphins --

00:05:47.797 --> 00:05:49.297
essentially any animal.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.963
In the late 1960s,

00:05:50.997 --> 00:05:54.963
our team member, Roger Payne,
discovered that whales sing.

00:05:54.997 --> 00:05:56.263
(Recording: whale singing)

00:05:56.297 --> 00:05:58.930
A finding that sparked
the Save the Whales movement

00:05:58.963 --> 00:06:01.597
led to the end of large-scale whaling
