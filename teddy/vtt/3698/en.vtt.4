00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:02.030
But it wasn't until 2018

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.363
when I was on fellowship

00:02:03.363 --> 00:02:05.797
at the Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Study

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.897
that I realized that perhaps the best way
to understand the ocean

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.197
and its inhabitants

00:02:10.197 --> 00:02:13.297
wasn't just by seeing the world
through their eyes,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.630
but by listening --

00:02:14.663 --> 00:02:16.797
by really, deeply listening.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.897
I became interested in sperm whales
when I heard their sounds.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.630
They sounded like they were
coming from another universe;

00:02:22.663 --> 00:02:27.097
a siren song being broadcast
from the darkest reaches of the sea.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.530
These weren't the typical
harmonious whale songs
