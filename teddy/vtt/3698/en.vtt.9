00:04:29.197 --> 00:04:33.763
that is frequented by over 25
well-known families of sperm whales.

00:04:33.797 --> 00:04:38.430
We're going to put specific focus
on the interactions of mothers and calfs,

00:04:38.463 --> 00:04:40.630
training our machine learning algorithms

00:04:40.663 --> 00:04:43.263
to learn whale language
from the bottom up.

00:04:43.297 --> 00:04:45.597
All this data we'll have sent
through a pipeline

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.063
and analyzed by the Project CETI
translation team.

00:04:48.063 --> 00:04:52.063
The raw audio and context data will
go through our machine learning engine

00:04:52.063 --> 00:04:54.430
where it's going to be first
sorted by structure.

00:04:54.463 --> 00:04:57.363
The linguistics team will then search
for things like syntax

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:58.630
and time displacement.

00:04:58.663 --> 00:04:59.930
For example,

00:04:59.963 --> 00:05:03.763
if we find an event where a whale
was talking about something yesterday,
