00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.530
These weren't the typical
harmonious whale songs

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.097
that I had been accustomed to.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.397
These sounded more
like digital data transfer.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.863
We assembled the future Project CETI team

00:02:37.863 --> 00:02:41.230
and began discussing how to use
the most advanced technologies

00:02:41.263 --> 00:02:43.363
to communicate with whales.

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:44.930
One of the principal conclusions

00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:47.630
was that machine learning
had a really good chance

00:02:47.663 --> 00:02:50.597
of understanding the patterns
of sperm whale communication.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.297
And the time to apply
these technologies was now.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.063
Cracking the interspecies
communication code

00:02:57.063 --> 00:03:00.097
didn't just seem possible,
