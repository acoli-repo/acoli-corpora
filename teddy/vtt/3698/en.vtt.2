00:00:58.497 --> 00:01:00.197
our team of AI specialists,

00:01:00.197 --> 00:01:01.963
roboticists, linguists

00:01:01.997 --> 00:01:03.430
and marine biologists

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:05.763
aim to use the most
cutting-edge technologies

00:01:05.797 --> 00:01:07.697
to make contact with another species,

00:01:07.697 --> 00:01:11.197
and hopefully communicate back.

00:01:11.197 --> 00:01:13.730
We believe that by listening
deeply to nature,

00:01:13.763 --> 00:01:16.230
we can change our perspective of ourselves

00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:21.297
and reshape our relationship
with all life on this planet.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.730
This of course seems
like an impossible goal.

00:01:24.763 --> 00:01:27.530
People have been trying
to make contact with other animals

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.863
for hundreds of years.

00:01:28.863 --> 00:01:31.263
How could we do what others could not,
