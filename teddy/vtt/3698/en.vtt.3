How could we do what others could not,

00:01:31.297 --> 00:01:35.430
especially given that I'm sitting here
on my couch in New York City

00:01:35.463 --> 00:01:37.930
in the middle of a pandemic and protests?

00:01:37.963 --> 00:01:41.763
I've spent the last 20 years
as a marine biologist and oceanographer,

00:01:41.797 --> 00:01:44.863
studying the ocean
from all different perspectives,

00:01:44.863 --> 00:01:46.730
from microbes to sharks.

00:01:46.763 --> 00:01:48.630
I've assembled interdisciplinary teams

00:01:48.663 --> 00:01:50.797
that have built the first shark-eye camera

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.063
to see the world
from a shark's perspective,

00:01:53.063 --> 00:01:54.930
and have collaborated with engineers

00:01:54.963 --> 00:01:59.863
to design robots so gentle
that they don't even stress a jellyfish.

00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:02.030
But it wasn't until 2018
