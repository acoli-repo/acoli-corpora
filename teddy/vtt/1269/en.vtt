00:00:00.598 --> 00:00:03.271
Pat Mitchell: Your first time back on the TEDWomen stage.

00:00:03.271 --> 00:00:06.214
Sheryl Sandberg: First time back. Nice to see everyone. It's always so nice to look out

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:08.132
and see so many women.

00:00:08.132 --> 00:00:13.262
It's so not my regular experience, 
as I know anyone else's.

00:00:13.262 --> 00:00:18.654
PM: So when we first started talking about, maybe the subject wouldn't be social media,

00:00:18.654 --> 00:00:23.310
which we assumed it would be, but 
that you had very much on your mind

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.464
the missing leadership positions, particularly 
in the sector of technology and social media.
