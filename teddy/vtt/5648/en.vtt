00:00:06.996 --> 00:00:09.454
On the edge of the vast Sahara desert,

00:00:09.454 --> 00:00:13.038
citizens snuck out of the city of Timbuktu

00:00:13.038 --> 00:00:15.454
and took to the wilderness.

00:00:15.454 --> 00:00:19.746
They buried chests in the desert sand,
hid them in caves,

00:00:19.746 --> 00:00:22.579
and sealed them in secret rooms.

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.288
Inside these chests was a treasure 
more valuable than gold:

00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:30.204
the cityâ€™s ancient books.
