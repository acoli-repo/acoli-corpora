Hello there, this is Chris Anderson,
and I am hugely, hugely,

00:00:09.246 --> 00:00:13.704
tremendously excited to welcome you to
a new series of the TED interview.

00:00:14.621 --> 00:00:17.496
Now, then, this season, we're
trying something new.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.996
We're organising the whole season
around a single theme,

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:25.996
albeit a theme that some of you may
consider inappropriate. But hear me out.

00:00:26.663 --> 00:00:30.246
The theme is the case for optimism.
