00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:03.576
So how many of you have ever
been in a cave before?

00:00:03.576 --> 00:00:04.987
Okay, a few of you.

00:00:04.987 --> 00:00:06.619
When you think of a cave, most of you think

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:08.780
of a tunnel going through solid rock,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.711
and in fact, that's how most caves are.

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:12.094
Around this half of the country,

00:00:12.094 --> 00:00:14.100
most of your caves are made of limestone.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.048
Back where I'm from, most of our 
caves are made of lava rock,

00:00:17.048 --> 00:00:18.881
because we have a lot of volcanoes out there.

00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:20.931
But the caves I want to share 
with you today are made

00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:24.044
completely of ice, specifically glacier ice

00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:26.042
that's formed in the side of the tallest mountain

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:29.125
in the state of Oregon, called Mount Hood.

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:32.188
Now Mount Hood's only 
one hour's drive from Portland,
