00:00:28.557 --> 00:00:31.912
so why don't we talk about
pregnancy in the same way?

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.503
There are entire textbooks written about
the developmental arc of adolescence,

00:00:38.527 --> 00:00:42.738
and we don't even have a word
to describe the transition to motherhood.

00:00:43.271 --> 00:00:44.436
We need one.

00:00:45.272 --> 00:00:48.502
I'm a psychiatrist who works
with pregnant and postpartum women,

00:00:48.526 --> 00:00:50.182
a reproductive psychiatrist,

00:00:50.206 --> 00:00:53.124
and in the decade that I've been
working in this field,

00:00:53.148 --> 00:00:54.868
I've noticed a pattern.

00:00:54.892 --> 00:00:56.848
It goes something like this:

00:00:56.872 --> 00:00:58.330
a woman calls me up,

00:00:58.354 --> 00:01:00.035
she's just had a baby,
