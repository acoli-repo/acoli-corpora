00:03:56.567 --> 00:04:01.949
But at the same time,
her mind is pushing away,

00:04:01.973 --> 00:04:06.609
because she remembers there are
all these other parts to her identity --

00:04:07.434 --> 00:04:08.989
other relationships,

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.835
her work,

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.111
hobbies,

00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:14.662
a spiritual and intellectual life,

00:04:14.686 --> 00:04:16.954
not to mention physical needs:

00:04:16.978 --> 00:04:20.341
to sleep, to eat, to exercise,

00:04:20.366 --> 00:04:21.837
to have sex,

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:23.275
to go to the bathroom,

00:04:23.299 --> 00:04:24.467
alone --

00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:25.660
(Laughter)

00:04:25.684 --> 00:04:26.854
if possible.

00:04:27.727 --> 00:04:31.761
This is the emotional
tug-of-war of matrescence.
