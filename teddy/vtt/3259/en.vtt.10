they would feel less stigmatized,

00:05:01.556 --> 00:05:05.681
and I think it would even reduce
rates of postpartum depression.

00:05:06.332 --> 00:05:08.276
I'd love to study that one day.

00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:11.299
I'm a believer in talk therapy,

00:05:11.323 --> 00:05:14.152
so if we're going to change the way
our culture understands

00:05:14.176 --> 00:05:15.970
this transition to motherhood,

00:05:15.994 --> 00:05:18.158
women need to be talking to each other,

00:05:18.182 --> 00:05:19.504
not just me.

00:05:20.313 --> 00:05:23.942
So mothers, talk about your matrescence

00:05:23.966 --> 00:05:26.613
with other mothers, with your friends,

00:05:26.637 --> 00:05:28.866
and, if you have one, with your partner,

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.777
so that they can understand
their own transition
