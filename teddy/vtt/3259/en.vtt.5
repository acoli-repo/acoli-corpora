00:02:27.148 --> 00:02:30.594
And it took me two years,
but in an out-of-print essay

00:02:30.618 --> 00:02:34.588
written in 1973 by Dana Raphael,

00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:39.115
I finally found a helpful way
to frame this conversation:

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.581
matrescence.

00:02:41.672 --> 00:02:46.484
It's not a coincidence that "matrescence"
sounds like "adolescence."

00:02:47.174 --> 00:02:50.866
Both are times when body morphing
and hormone shifting

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.594
lead to an upheaval
in how a person feels emotionally

00:02:54.618 --> 00:02:56.867
and how they fit into the world.

00:02:56.891 --> 00:03:01.050
And like adolescence,
matrescence is not a disease,
