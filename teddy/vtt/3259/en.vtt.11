their own transition

00:05:31.801 --> 00:05:33.426

But it's not just about
protecting your relationship.

00:05:37.534 --> 00:05:40.979
When you preserve
a separate part of your identity,

00:05:41.003 --> 00:05:44.920
you're also leaving room
for your child to develop their own.

00:05:46.295 --> 00:05:50.145
When a baby is born, so is a mother,

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.978
each unsteady in their own way.

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:55.896
Matrescence is profound,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.688
but it's also hard,

00:05:57.712 --> 00:05:59.563
and that's what makes it human.
