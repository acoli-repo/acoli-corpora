00:00:58.354 --> 00:01:00.035
she's just had a baby,

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.497
and she's concerned.

00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:05.956
She says, "I'm not good at this.
I'm not enjoying this.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.186
Do I have postpartum depression?"

00:01:08.615 --> 00:01:10.980
So I go through the symptoms
of that diagnosis,

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.993
and it's clear to me
that she's not clinically depressed,

00:01:14.017 --> 00:01:15.497
and I tell her that.

00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:17.414
But she isn't reassured.

00:01:17.438 --> 00:01:20.593
"It isn't supposed to feel
like this," she insists.

00:01:20.617 --> 00:01:23.909
So I say, "OK. What did you
expect it to feel like?"

00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:29.152
She says, "I thought motherhood
would make feel whole and happy.

00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:33.135
I thought my instincts
would naturally tell me what to do.
