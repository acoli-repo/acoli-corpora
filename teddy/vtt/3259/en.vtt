Do you remember a time
when you felt hormonal and moody?

00:00:05.263 --> 00:00:07.247
Your skin was breaking out,

00:00:07.271 --> 00:00:11.373
your body was growing
in strange places and very fast,

00:00:12.235 --> 00:00:13.392
and at the same time,

00:00:13.416 --> 00:00:16.375
people were expecting you to be
grown-up in this new way.

00:00:17.096 --> 00:00:18.407
Teenagers, right?

00:00:19.344 --> 00:00:24.155
Well, these same changes happen
to a woman when she's having a baby.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:28.533
And we know that it's normal
for teenagers to feel all over the place,

00:00:28.557 --> 00:00:31.912
so why don't we talk about
pregnancy in the same way?
