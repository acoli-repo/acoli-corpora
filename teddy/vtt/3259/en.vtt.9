This is the emotional
tug-of-war of matrescence.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.565
This is the tension
the women calling me were feeling.

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:37.869
It's why they thought they were sick.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.961
If women understood the natural
progression of matrescence,

00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:49.628
if they knew that most people found it
hard to live inside this push and pull,

00:04:49.652 --> 00:04:52.577
if they knew that under
these circumstances,

00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:57.151
ambivalence was normal
and nothing to be ashamed of,

00:04:57.175 --> 00:04:59.205
they would feel less alone,

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.532
they would feel less stigmatized,
