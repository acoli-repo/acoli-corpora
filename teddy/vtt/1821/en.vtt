There's an ancient and universal concept
that words have power,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.334
that spells exist,

00:00:06.358 --> 00:00:09.055
and that if we could only
pronounce the right words,

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:11.908
then -- whoosh! -- you know,
an avalanche would come

00:00:11.932 --> 00:00:13.937
and wipe out the hobbits, right?

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:15.948
So this is a very attractive idea,

00:00:15.972 --> 00:00:18.599
because we're very lazy,
like the Sorcerer's Apprentice,

00:00:18.623 --> 00:00:20.694
or the world's greatest
computer programmer.

00:00:20.718 --> 00:00:22.628
This idea has a lot of traction with us.

00:00:22.652 --> 00:00:24.790
We love the idea that words,
when pronounced,

00:00:24.814 --> 00:00:26.632
are little more than pure information,

00:00:26.656 --> 00:00:28.915
but they evoke physical action
in the real world

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.098
that helps us do work.
