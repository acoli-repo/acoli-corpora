00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
When we park in a big parking lot,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
how do we remember where we parked our car?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here's the problem facing Homer.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And we're going to try to understand

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
what's happening in his brain.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So we'll start with the hippocampus, shown in yellow,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which is the organ of memory.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If you have damage there, like in Alzheimer's,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you can't remember things including where you parked your car.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It's named after Latin for "seahorse,"

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which it resembles.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And like the rest of the brain, it's made of neurons.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So the human brain

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
has about a hundred billion neurons in it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And the neurons communicate with each other
