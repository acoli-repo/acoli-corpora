00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.800
and I like to call them the feathermakers.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.816
It is the major difference between birds
and any other animals we have on earth,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.456
and if you can't make a feather,
you cannot call yourself a bird.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.696
(Laughter)

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.816
For us humans, who are earthbound,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.520
birds represent freedom.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.656
This feather has enabled birds
to conquer gravity

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.736
and take to the air
in an extraordinary way.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.840
Don't you sometimes wish
you could fly like a bird?
