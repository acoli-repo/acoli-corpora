00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.136
and we hunted termites around the compound
for its dinner every day.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.376
After a few days, it had regained strength

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.656
and we released it.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.216
We were so happy to see it flap its wings

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.136
and fly off gracefully.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.600
And that experience
changed the way we looked at birds.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.616
We went on to actually make a magazine,

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.856
and we called it the Hawk Magazine,

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.976
and this was in honor of this bird

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.936
that we had helped
within our own high school.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.240
Those experiences in high school
made me the conservationist I am today.
