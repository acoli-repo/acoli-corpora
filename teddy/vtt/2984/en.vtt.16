These birds continue
to provide the continent

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.976
with very crucial ecosystem
services that Africa needs.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.856
Moreover, there is huge potential

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.280
for Africa to lead the world
in avian tourism.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.176
The economy will definitely benefit.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.416
Imagine how many communities
will benefit from groups of tourists

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.616
visiting their villages
just to see the endemic birds

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.040
that can only be found in those villages.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.040
How can we help birds together?
