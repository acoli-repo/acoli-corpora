00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.696
and this helps us a lot
because it saves us money --

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.096
we don't lose our crops --

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.016
and secondly, we don't have
to buy harmful chemicals

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.800
to handle these rodents.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.496
The beautiful sunbirds
we see in our environments

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.936
are part of nature's pollination crew,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.296
and they help our plants to form fruits.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.896
Together with other
pollinators like insects,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.456
they have actually helped us

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.320
to get most of the food crops
that we depend on for many years.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.496
Unfortunately, the story of birds
is by far not perfect.
