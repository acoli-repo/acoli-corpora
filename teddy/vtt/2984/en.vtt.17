How can we help birds together?

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.936
There is now a chance for all of you

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.775
to turn your passion for birds

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.696
into contributing
to their continued survival,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.559
and you can do that
by becoming a citizen scientist.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.216
Citizen science is a growing trend
around the world,

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.296
and we are having scenarios
where people are sharing information

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.296
with the rest of the community
about traffic updates,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.576
security alerts and so on.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.376
That is exactly what
we realized as bird-watchers,
