How do I tell you
what birds live in my home,

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.096
or where I school, or where I work?"

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:09.816
So we were forced to renovate our strategy
and come up with a sustainable solution.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.136
It was easy:

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.376
we immediately realized that mobile phones

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.056
were becoming increasingly
common in Africa

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.760
and most of the regions
could get access to one.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.216
So we came up with
mobile phone applications

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.376
that you can use on your iPhone
and on your Android phone,

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.496
and we made them freely available

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.776
for every bird-watching
enthusiast out there.
