00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.416
With me here today

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.160
I brought something beautiful.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.576
This is a feather from one of the most
beautiful birds we have in Kenya,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.560
the crested guinea fowl.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.536
But this feather is more than just that.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.816
If you've taken time when you are outdoors

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.736
to look at the feathers around you,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.976
you'll have noticed

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.736
that there is this huge variety
of different sizes,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.960
shapes and even colors.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.536
The feather is one of the most
astonishing pieces of technology
