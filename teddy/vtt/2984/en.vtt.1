The feather is one of the most
astonishing pieces of technology

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.096
invented by the natural world,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.136
and for centuries, this feather
has helped birds to keep dry,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.040
to keep warm and even power flight.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.360
Only one section of the tree of life
can actually make a feather.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.336
Among all the world's animals,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.536
birds are the only ones
who can make something

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.894
like what I'm holding today.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.336
I personally have given them a nickname,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.800
and I like to call them the feathermakers.
