00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.136
which is mapping all birds of prey
in the continent of Africa,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.456
and the Kenya Bird Map,

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.416
which is mapping about 1,100 species
that occur in my country, Kenya.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.416
These two projects
now have online databases

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.896
that are allowing people to submit data,

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.896
and this is converted
into very interactive websites

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.000
that the public can consume
and make decisions from.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.936
But when we started,
there was a big challenge.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.416
We received many complaints
from bird-watchers,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.696
and they will say,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.056
"I'm in a village,
and I cannot access a computer.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.696
How do I tell you
what birds live in my home,
