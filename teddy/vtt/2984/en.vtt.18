00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.376
That is exactly what
we realized as bird-watchers,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.456
and we thought, because birds
are found everywhere,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.656
if we've got all of you
and everyone else in Africa

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.056
to tell us the birds
they find where they live,

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.496
where they school,
or even where they work,

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.056
then we can be able to come up
with a map of every single species,

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.816
and from there scientists will be able

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.896
to actually prioritize
conservation efforts

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.376
to those habitats that matter the most.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.456
Take for example these two projects,

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.256
the Africa Raptor DataBank,

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.136
which is mapping all birds of prey
in the continent of Africa,
