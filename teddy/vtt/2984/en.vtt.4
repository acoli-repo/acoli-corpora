00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.096
Indeed, these birds have been
part of our lives and cultures

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.776
all over the world for centuries,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.936
and every society has a story about birds.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.656
You probably have heard
childhood stories of different birds

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.656
and how they relate with man.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.496
I personally recently learned

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.296
that our human ancestors
would follow flocks of vultures

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.736
and then they would help them

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.216
to identify where carcasses
have been dropped by large carnivores,

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.600
and these humans will scavenge
and eat part of that meat.
