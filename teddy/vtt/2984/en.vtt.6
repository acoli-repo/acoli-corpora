From birds such as
these beautiful penguins

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.456
that live in the cold ice caps

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.536
to even others like the larks,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.696

birds also love and date
just like us humans.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.576
In fact, you'll be surprised to know
that males dress to impress the women,
