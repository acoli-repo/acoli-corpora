Moreover, power lines
are electrocuting birds

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.536
and wind farms are slicing birds

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.480
when they fly through the blades.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.336
Recently, we've heard the talk
of climate change

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.176
making a lot of headlines,

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.216
and it's also affecting birds,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.616
because birds are being forced to migrate
to better breeding and feeding grounds

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.776
because unfortunately
where they used to live

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.000
is no longer habitable.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.496
My own perspective
towards birds was changed

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.696
when I was a small boy in high school,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.376
and there was this boy who struck,

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.800
injuring the wing and the leg
of a bird we called the augur buzzard.
