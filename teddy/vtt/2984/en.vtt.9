And birds help us so much,

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.616
and they play very crucial roles
in our ecosystems each day.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.896
Vultures clean up our environment

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.296
by literally digesting
disease-causing pathogens,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.176
and they finish carcasses
that would otherwise cost us lots of money

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.096
to clear from the environment.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.056
A sizable flock of vultures
is capable of bringing down a carcass

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.376
the size of a zebra straight to the bone

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.320
within just about 30 minutes.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.856
Owls help to rid
the environments of rodents

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.696
and this helps us a lot
because it saves us money --
