00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.253
I wanted, yeah, to make them
understand it,

00:03:32.277 --> 00:03:36.241
to really experience it through my art

00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:39.758
in the form of an interactive story,

00:03:39.782 --> 00:03:41.111
a video game.

00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:45.062
So, in our game --

00:03:45.086 --> 00:03:48.431
we called it "Sea of Solitude" --

00:03:48.455 --> 00:03:50.956
you are a person named Kay,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.358
who is suffering from
such strong loneliness

00:03:54.382 --> 00:03:56.696
that her inner feelings --

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.958
the anger,

00:03:57.982 --> 00:04:01.771
the feeling of hopelessness,
worthlessness --
