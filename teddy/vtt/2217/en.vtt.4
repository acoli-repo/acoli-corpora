Nourishing friendships
as an adult is work.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.071
You need to be consistent with connecting.

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:11.668
You need to be open,
you need to be honest.

00:02:11.692 --> 00:02:13.811
And this is all I struggled with,

00:02:13.835 --> 00:02:16.848
because I tend to camouflage
my real feelings

00:02:16.872 --> 00:02:19.096
by trying to appear always happy

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.488
and trying to make
everyone else happy, too,

00:02:21.512 --> 00:02:23.803
by trying to fix their problems.

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:28.207
And I know a lot of us are guilty of this,

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:32.082
because it's an easy way to not
think about your own issues.
