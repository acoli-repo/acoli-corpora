00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:30.102
up until, as a young adult,
I moved to another city

00:01:30.126 --> 00:01:32.947
for my first job as a comic artist.

00:01:33.857 --> 00:01:38.670
And like so many young,
thriving people all over the planet,

00:01:38.694 --> 00:01:42.698
I concentrated all my energy
into my work life.

00:01:43.816 --> 00:01:49.486
But, if you spend, like, 90 percent
of your daily capacity

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.608
trying to succeed at work,

00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:53.228
of course there is nothing left

00:01:53.252 --> 00:01:56.189
to take care of all the other
important aspects in your life,

00:01:56.213 --> 00:01:58.228
like your human relationships.

00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:04.353
Nourishing friendships
as an adult is work.
