00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:35.620
And, well, the only thing Kay wears,

00:04:35.644 --> 00:04:37.497
the only thing,

00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:39.130
is her backpack.

00:04:40.272 --> 00:04:44.973
It's the baggage we all carry
throughout our life.

00:04:44.997 --> 00:04:48.252
And Kay doesn't know how to cope
with her emotions in the right way,

00:04:48.276 --> 00:04:51.024
so her backpack becomes bigger and bigger

00:04:51.048 --> 00:04:52.492
until it bursts,

00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:56.794
and she finally is forced
to overcome her own struggles.

00:04:58.135 --> 00:05:03.221
In our story, we present many different
manifestations of loneliness.
