00:00:01.358 --> 00:00:03.587
Have you ever felt lonely?

00:00:04.842 --> 00:00:07.557
The urge of wanting
to connect with people,

00:00:07.581 --> 00:00:10.662
but you seem to have no one
you really would want to contact?

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:14.689
Or, it's a Friday night
and you want to be with others,

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:20.266
but you have no energy to go out,
so instead you sit at home all evening,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.796
watch Netflix

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.977
and feel more alone than ever?

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.624
You feel like a monster

00:00:26.648 --> 00:00:29.145
between humans that know how to function.
