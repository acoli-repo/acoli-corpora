00:11:59.918 --> 00:12:06.173
Look at what part of your life
is so big that others fall short.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.354
Look at what emotions you barely feel

00:12:10.378 --> 00:12:11.928
or maybe feel too much

00:12:11.952 --> 00:12:14.541
and move towards lowering those peaks.

00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:17.772
Most of all, it's about understanding

00:12:17.796 --> 00:12:21.500
that all the wide range
of emotions and struggles

00:12:21.524 --> 00:12:23.939
makes us what we are:

00:12:23.963 --> 00:12:25.183
humans.

00:12:26.162 --> 00:12:27.324
Thank you.

00:12:27.348 --> 00:12:29.142
