00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:33.603
but just fragile beings that are simply
overwhelmed by what life throws at them.

00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:39.062
All of those emotions,

00:09:39.086 --> 00:09:42.511
be it self-doubt or even self-destruction,

00:09:42.535 --> 00:09:44.838
don't completely vanish in our game.

00:09:46.292 --> 00:09:52.190
The key message is to not only
chase for joy or happiness

00:09:52.214 --> 00:09:55.164
but to embrace all your emotions

00:09:55.188 --> 00:09:57.365
and bring them into balance,

00:09:59.138 --> 00:10:02.934
being OK with sometimes not being OK.
