00:11:27.956 --> 00:11:30.129
But I don't want to overcome it anymore.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.113
I love it.

00:11:32.137 --> 00:11:36.748
I just needed to bring it
to a healthy size,

00:11:36.772 --> 00:11:39.843
so it doesn't stand in the way
of deeper relationships anymore,

00:11:39.867 --> 00:11:42.402
but even help me to connect with people.

00:11:44.264 --> 00:11:47.743
So, if you have an inner monster

00:11:47.767 --> 00:11:51.456
that is born out of negative emotions,

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.915
it is not only the goal
to kill that monster

00:11:54.939 --> 00:11:58.775
but to understand that we humans
are complex beings.

00:11:59.918 --> 00:12:06.173
Look at what part of your life
is so big that others fall short.
