00:10:59.155 --> 00:11:00.629
Our game is not a therapy.

00:11:00.653 --> 00:11:02.273
It's not meant to be a therapy.

00:11:02.297 --> 00:11:05.217
It's just my friends and me
sharing our stories

00:11:05.241 --> 00:11:07.932
through our art, video games.

00:11:07.956 --> 00:11:12.687
But we are so deeply thankful
for every single message

00:11:12.711 --> 00:11:14.447
that people feel better,

00:11:14.471 --> 00:11:17.999
just because we shared
our story with them.

00:11:19.456 --> 00:11:20.915
So ...

00:11:20.939 --> 00:11:27.932
I didn't completely overcome
my urge to help others.

00:11:27.956 --> 00:11:30.129
But I don't want to overcome it anymore.
