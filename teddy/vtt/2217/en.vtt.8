00:03:57.982 --> 00:04:01.771
the feeling of hopelessness,
worthlessness --

00:04:01.795 --> 00:04:03.774
turn to the outside,

00:04:03.798 --> 00:04:05.334
and she becomes a monster.

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:08.086
The game -- well, Kay --

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.093
is actually a representation of me

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:15.222
and the path I went through
to overcome my struggles.

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:18.421
The game plays, actually, in Kay's mind,

00:04:18.445 --> 00:04:23.268
so you walk through a world
that is flooded by her tears,

00:04:23.292 --> 00:04:27.494
and the weather is changing by her mood,

00:04:27.518 --> 00:04:29.461
how her mood is changing.
