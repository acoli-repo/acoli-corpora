They grow all over the world,

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:35.969
bearing every imaginable colour, shape,

00:00:40.224 --> 00:00:42.942
many orchids trick insects,

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:46.942
sometimes even into having sex with them.

00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:48.212

most orchids need to attract insects

00:00:50.742 --> 00:00:54.224
to gather their pollen and 
carry it between plants.

00:00:54.224 --> 00:00:56.394

00:00:56.394 --> 00:00:59.864
which attract a range of pollinators 
with sweet nectar,

00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:03.864
these masters of deception 
deploy other tactics–
