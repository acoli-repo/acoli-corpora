00:03:58.831 --> 00:04:02.769
Random genetic mutations in orchids 
may result in a trait–

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.339
like a scent or a shape–

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:09.349
that, by chance, matches the needs 
of a single insect species.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.279
The huge diversity within the insect 
world also increases the likelihood

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:17.329
that an orchid will find 
a unique audience.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.459
Able to make more seeds and offspring with
the help of its dedicated pollinators,

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:25.839
the orchid successfully reproduces 
in isolation,

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:28.499
and becomes a new species.

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:33.219
But because of their dependence on 
sometimes just one pollinator species,
