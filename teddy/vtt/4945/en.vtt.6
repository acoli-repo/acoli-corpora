00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:02.466
random compound combinations 
have given some orchid species

00:03:02.466 --> 00:03:08.064
precisely the same signature scent 
as particular insect species.

00:03:08.064 --> 00:03:11.800
This matching scent allows them to 
attract male pollinators

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.160
who fall over and over again

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.640
for the flowers masquerading as females

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.630
of their own species.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.390
Sexual deception isn’t the only trick 
orchids have up their sleeves.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.326
Their oldest scam is mimicking the shapes 
and colours

00:03:26.326 --> 00:03:28.996
of other nectar-producing flowers—

00:03:28.996 --> 00:03:31.096
but without the sweet nectar.
