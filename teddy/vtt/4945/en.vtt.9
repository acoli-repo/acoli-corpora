Over time, though,

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.379
more orchid species have formed 
than died out,

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:46.519
and orchids are some of the most diverse 
flowering plants.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:50.047
They have such exuberant and otherworldly 
shapes

00:04:50.047 --> 00:04:53.517
