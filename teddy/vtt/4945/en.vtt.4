flips a hinge in the flower,

00:02:04.717 --> 00:02:07.717
forcing his body into the pollen.

00:02:07.717 --> 00:02:09.167
At the next flower he visits,

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:14.127
that same hinge pushes his pollen-covered 
body onto the stigma,

00:02:14.127 --> 00:02:15.627
fertilizing it.

00:02:15.627 --> 00:02:18.537
Some orchids make such convincing mates

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:21.347
that insects even ejaculate on them,

00:02:21.347 --> 00:02:23.767
wasting valuable sperm.

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:28.147

sexual deception is scent:

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:33.331
orchids mimic the precise scent 
of a single insect species.
