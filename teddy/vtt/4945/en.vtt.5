00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:33.331
orchids mimic the precise scent 
of a single insect species.

00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:36.491
This is possible because many insects 
and flowers

00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:40.763
produce simple organic compounds 
called hydrocarbons,

00:02:40.763 --> 00:02:44.773
which form a layer that protects 
their bodies from drying out.

00:02:44.773 --> 00:02:48.983
The precise blend of compounds 
in this layer is species-specific.

00:02:48.983 --> 00:02:53.086
Its scent can double as a way for insects 
to attract potential mates,

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:55.816
known as a sex pheromone.

00:02:55.816 --> 00:02:58.266
Over the course of many 
thousands of years,

00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:02.466
random compound combinations 
have given some orchid species
