00:00:59.864 --> 00:01:03.864
these masters of deception 
deploy other tactics–

00:01:03.864 --> 00:01:06.954
like pretending to be an insect’s mate,

00:01:06.954 --> 00:01:09.144
letting off alluring scents,

00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:12.604
and mimicking the appearance 
of other species.

00:01:12.604 --> 00:01:17.104
One of their most intriguing methods 
is sexual deception.

00:01:17.104 --> 00:01:20.354
Through a combination of sexy shapes 
and pheromones,

00:01:20.354 --> 00:01:23.524
orchids convince insects 
to mate with them.

00:01:23.524 --> 00:01:25.694
Take the bee orchid,

00:01:25.694 --> 00:01:30.804
whose petals look almost exactly like 
the velvety body of a bee.
