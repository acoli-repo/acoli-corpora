If you're at all like me,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
this is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in San Francisco:

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
you build experimental kite-powered hydrofoils

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
capable of more than 30 knots.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And you realize that there is incredible power in the wind,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and it can do amazing things.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And one day, a vessel not unlike this

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
will probably break the world speed record.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But kites aren't just toys like this.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Kites: I'm going to give you a brief history,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and tell you about the magnificent future

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
of every child's favorite plaything.
