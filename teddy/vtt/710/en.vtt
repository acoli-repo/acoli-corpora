Pat Mitchell: What is the story of this pin?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Madeleine Albright: This is "Breaking the Glass Ceiling."

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
PM: Oh.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And the cease-fire had been translated

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
into a series of sanctions resolutions,
