For the past few years,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.369
I've been spending my summers
in the marine biological laboratory

00:00:06.393 --> 00:00:08.383
in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.

00:00:08.931 --> 00:00:13.093
And there, what I've been doing
is essentially renting a boat.

00:00:13.117 --> 00:00:15.717
What I would like to do is ask you

00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:17.971
to come on a boat ride with me tonight.

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:24.729
So, we ride off from Eel Pond
into Vineyard Sound,

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:27.264
right off the coast of Martha's Vineyard,

00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:30.625
equipped with a drone
to identify potential spots
