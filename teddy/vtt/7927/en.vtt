Hi.

00:00:01.998 --> 00:00:04.876
It's about as intimidating
as I thought it would be.

00:00:04.917 --> 00:00:06.044
(Laughter)

00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:09.589
And yet you’d think or I’d think

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.759
that I'd be accustomed
to more stressful situations.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.221
You see, I work in international security
and in conflict resolution.

00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:21.934
And today, I'm here to talk
about some of our blind spots

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:23.811
related to decarbonization.

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:28.441
Now, what does one have to do
with the other, you may ask.

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:29.859
Good question.
