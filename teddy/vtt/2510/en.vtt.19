You'd be getting in and out of the car,
looking to your right, talking about:

00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:33.565
"Father, forgive me, for I have sinned,"
all day long -- you can't do it!

00:09:33.589 --> 00:09:35.842
So we came up with some
incredible initiatives,

00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:39.361
engagements for our community
and police to build that trust back.

00:09:39.385 --> 00:09:40.944
We began to deal with our youth

00:09:40.968 --> 00:09:44.146
and with those who we consider
are on the wrong side of the fence.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.903
We knew we had an economic problem,

00:09:45.927 --> 00:09:47.419
so we began to create jobs.

00:09:47.443 --> 00:09:49.491
We knew there was sickness
in our community

00:09:49.515 --> 00:09:52.009
and they didn't have access
to proper medical care,

00:09:52.033 --> 00:09:53.192
so we'd partner up.

00:09:53.216 --> 00:09:55.289
We got to that intersection
and partnered up

00:09:55.313 --> 00:09:57.400
with anybody that wanted
to partner with us

00:09:57.424 --> 00:09:59.591
and talked about
what we needed holistically,

00:09:59.615 --> 00:10:01.128
never thinking about the crime.
