00:10:27.754 --> 00:10:30.635
our crime numbers, our homicides --

00:10:30.659 --> 00:10:33.116
everything had dropped
down, back to the 1970s.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.556
And it might go back further,

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.497
but the problem is, we only
started keeping data since 1970.

00:10:37.521 --> 00:10:40.617
Forty-year crime low, so much so,
I had other commanders call me,

00:10:40.641 --> 00:10:42.058
"Hey Mel, whatcha doin', man?

00:10:42.082 --> 00:10:44.186
Whatcha doin'? We gotta get some of that!"

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.625
(Laughter)

00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:47.308
And so we gave them some of that.

00:10:48.968 --> 00:10:50.420
And in a short period of time,

00:10:50.444 --> 00:10:52.721
the city went to a 30-year crime low.

00:10:53.181 --> 00:10:55.830
For the first time in 30 years,
we fell, Baltimore city,

00:10:55.854 --> 00:10:58.218
to under 200 homicides -- 197 to be exact.

00:10:58.242 --> 00:10:59.401
And we celebrated,

00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:03.108
because we had learned
to become great servers,
