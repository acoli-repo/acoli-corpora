00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:33.706
I predate War on Our Fellow Man --
I mean, War on Drugs.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.213
I predate all of that.

00:00:35.855 --> 00:00:37.009
I predate so much

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:38.816
and I've been through ebbs and flows

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.207
and I've been through good and bad times,

00:00:41.231 --> 00:00:45.389
and still I absolutely love
being a police officer.

00:00:46.207 --> 00:00:49.958
I love being a police officer
because it's always been a calling for me

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:51.362
and never a job.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.584
And even with that,

00:00:54.538 --> 00:00:58.814
my personal truth is that
law enforcement is in a crisis.

00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:01.130
It's an invisible crisis,
