00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.849
And so somehow, along the way,

00:06:30.873 --> 00:06:32.304
we've gotten out of balance.

00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:35.066
And because we are a proud profession,

00:06:35.952 --> 00:06:39.093
it is very hard for us to look
in the mirror and see our mistakes.

00:06:39.117 --> 00:06:40.838
It's even harder to make a change.

00:06:41.775 --> 00:06:44.648
And so, as I try to hurry
and get through this,

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:46.365
I need to say this:

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:48.331
it's not just law enforcement, though.

00:06:48.818 --> 00:06:51.149
Because every one of us
makes up a community.

00:06:51.674 --> 00:06:53.359
Everybody makes up a community.

00:06:53.678 --> 00:06:55.606
And as communities -- can I say this? --

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.002
we have put too much responsibility
on law enforcement.
