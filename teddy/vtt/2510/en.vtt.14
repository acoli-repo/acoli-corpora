00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:01.419
Too much.

00:07:01.443 --> 00:07:05.686
(Applause)

00:07:06.706 --> 00:07:09.353
And then we have the audacity
and the nerve to get upset

00:07:09.377 --> 00:07:11.480
with law enforcement
when we take action.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:13.679
There is no way in the world

00:07:14.615 --> 00:07:18.158
that we, as a community,
should be calling the police

00:07:18.182 --> 00:07:20.071
for kids playing ball in the street.

00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:24.807
No way in the world that we
should be calling the police

00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:26.917
because my neighbor's
music is up too loud,

00:07:26.941 --> 00:07:29.695
because his dog came over
to my yard and did a number two;

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:32.240
there's no way we should
be calling the police.
