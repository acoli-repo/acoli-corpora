00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.734
We would retire and I would
go off into the sunset,

00:02:00.758 --> 00:02:03.591
maybe do ministry full time,
love my wife a long time.

00:02:03.615 --> 00:02:05.256
Y'all know what I'm talking about.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.685
(Laughter)

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.432
But we decided that I would retire.

00:02:08.456 --> 00:02:11.635
But then there was a higher power than I.

00:02:12.492 --> 00:02:15.360
There was a love for the city

00:02:15.384 --> 00:02:18.585
that I loved, that I grew up in,
that I was educated in --

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.309
a city that pulled my heart
back into the system.

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.221
So we didn't retire.

00:02:24.916 --> 00:02:26.310
We didn't retire

00:02:26.334 --> 00:02:28.798
and so what happened was,

00:02:28.822 --> 00:02:32.050
over the next -- I would say,
18 months, 19 months,
