00:04:00.728 --> 00:04:01.881
We had to change it.

00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:04.628
And so what we did
is we started to think holistically

00:04:04.652 --> 00:04:05.968
and not paramilitarily.

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:07.922
So we thought differently.

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.018
And we started to realize

00:04:10.042 --> 00:04:12.352
that it could never be
and never should have been

00:04:12.376 --> 00:04:13.885
us versus them.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.118
And so I decided to come
to that intersection

00:04:17.142 --> 00:04:20.363
where I could meet all classes,
all races, all creeds, all colors;

00:04:20.387 --> 00:04:22.928
where I would meet the businesses
and the faith-based,

00:04:22.952 --> 00:04:24.238
and the eds, the meds,

00:04:24.262 --> 00:04:25.770
and I would meet all the people

00:04:25.794 --> 00:04:28.623
that made up the communities
that I had authority over.

00:04:29.205 --> 00:04:31.165
So I met them and I began to listen.
