And they don't take care
of that community.

00:08:33.153 --> 00:08:35.821
I could go on and on,
but I really need to wrap this up.

00:08:35.845 --> 00:08:38.496
Community and policing:

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.821
we've all lost that precious gift,
and I call it relational equity.

00:08:43.498 --> 00:08:45.421
We've lost it with one another.

00:08:45.445 --> 00:08:47.460
It's not somebody else's fault --

00:08:47.484 --> 00:08:48.808
it's all of our fault.

We all take responsibility in this.

00:08:51.361 --> 00:08:54.562

00:08:54.586 --> 00:08:56.224
and nation to make it great again.

00:08:56.248 --> 00:08:57.407
It is never too late.

00:08:57.431 --> 00:08:58.747
It is never too late.

00:08:59.428 --> 00:09:00.829
You see, after three years
