00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.118
but he absolutely understands it,

00:12:02.142 --> 00:12:04.214
and more importantly, he embraces it.

00:12:04.238 --> 00:12:05.957
So I'm very excited now.

00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:08.930
Listen, I'm excited about Baltimore today,

00:12:08.954 --> 00:12:13.203
because we, as many cities,
I believe shall rise from the ashes.

00:12:13.973 --> 00:12:16.862
I believe -- I truly believe --

00:12:16.886 --> 00:12:17.908
(Applause)

00:12:17.932 --> 00:12:19.710
that we will be great again.

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:21.810
I believe,

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.541
as we continue to wrap arms
and continue to say,

00:12:25.565 --> 00:12:26.763
"We're in this together,"

00:12:26.787 --> 00:12:28.630
because it's not just an intersection:

00:12:28.654 --> 00:12:32.288
once we meet, we now gotta get
on the same path for the same goals,
