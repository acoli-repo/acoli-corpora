00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.412
And so in order to bring change
that I desperately wanted

00:03:32.436 --> 00:03:34.143
and I desperately felt in my heart,

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:36.456
I had to start listening
to that inner spirit.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.913
I had to start listening
to that man on the inside

00:03:38.937 --> 00:03:42.040
that went against everything
that I had been trained to do.

00:03:42.772 --> 00:03:44.166
But we still did it.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.887
We still did it because we listened
to that inner spirit,

00:03:46.911 --> 00:03:48.172
because I realized this:

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:52.245
if I was to see real police reform

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.898
in the communities that I had
authority over for public safety,

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.973
we had to change our stinkin' thinkin'.
