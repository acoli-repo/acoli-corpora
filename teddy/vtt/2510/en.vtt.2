00:00:59.616 --> 00:01:01.130
It's an invisible crisis,

00:01:01.154 --> 00:01:03.780
and it has been for many, many years.

00:01:04.787 --> 00:01:06.656
Even though we in law enforcement say,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.282
"You know what?
We can't arrest our way out of this."

00:01:11.258 --> 00:01:13.069
We say in law enforcement things like,

00:01:13.093 --> 00:01:15.609
"Yeah, it's illegal to profile."

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:17.166
You know what?

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.548
In law enforcement, we even agree
that we have to adopt this thinking

00:01:20.572 --> 00:01:22.777
and become more oriented
to community policing.

00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:25.711
And yet all the while, still,

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:27.932
we continue in the same vein,

00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:31.916
the same vein that contradicts
everything that we just admitted.
