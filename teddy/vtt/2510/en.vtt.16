00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:00.009
So it takes all of us, all of us.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.820
And when I say community,

00:08:01.844 --> 00:08:04.871
I'm talking about everything
that makes up a community, even --

00:08:04.895 --> 00:08:07.826
listen, because I'm a preacher,
I'm very hard on the churches,

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.597
because I believe the churches
too often have become MIA,

00:08:10.621 --> 00:08:11.778
missing in action.

00:08:11.802 --> 00:08:14.370
I believe they have shifted
over the last 10, 20 years

00:08:14.394 --> 00:08:15.870
from being community churches,

00:08:15.894 --> 00:08:19.362
where you walk outside your door,
round the corner and you're in church.

00:08:19.386 --> 00:08:22.246
They shifted from that and became
commuter churches.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.730
So you now have churches who have
become disconnected by default

00:08:26.754 --> 00:08:29.209
from the very community
where they're planted.
