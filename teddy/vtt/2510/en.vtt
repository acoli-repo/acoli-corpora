00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:03.468
I have been a police officer
for a very, very long time.

00:00:03.492 --> 00:00:08.690
And you see these notes in my hand
because I'm also a black preacher.

00:00:09.305 --> 00:00:10.988
(Laughter)

00:00:11.012 --> 00:00:13.227
And if you know anything
about black preachers,

00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:16.463
we'll close, and then we'll keep
going for another 20 minutes.

00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:17.524
(Laughter)

00:00:17.548 --> 00:00:19.941
So I need this to keep
pushing this thing forward.

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:22.214
I've been a police officer
for a very long time,

00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:23.818
and I mean I predated technology.

00:00:23.842 --> 00:00:25.438
I'm talking about before pagers.

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:26.695
(Laughter)

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:28.980
Laugh if you want to,
but I'm telling the truth.

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:33.706
I predate War on Our Fellow Man --
I mean, War on Drugs.
