00:04:29.205 --> 00:04:31.165
So I met them and I began to listen.

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:32.641
See, police have a problem.

00:04:32.665 --> 00:04:35.260
Off the top, we want to bring
things into the community

00:04:35.284 --> 00:04:38.252
and come up with these extravagant
strategies and deployments,

00:04:38.276 --> 00:04:40.451
but we never talk
to the community about them.

00:04:40.475 --> 00:04:43.303
And we shove them into the community
and say, "Take that."

00:04:43.806 --> 00:04:46.203
But we said we'd get rid
of that stinkin' thinkin',

00:04:46.227 --> 00:04:47.775
so we talked to our communities.

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:49.667
We said, "This is your community table.

00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:51.954
We'll pull up a chair.
We want to hear from you.

00:04:51.978 --> 00:04:53.918
What's going to work in your community?"

00:04:53.942 --> 00:04:56.071
And then some great things
started to happen.

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:57.246
See, here's the thing:

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.990
I had to figure out a way to shift
130 cops that were under my tutelage
