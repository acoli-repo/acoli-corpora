the same vein that contradicts
everything that we just admitted.

00:01:33.131 --> 00:01:35.834
And so that's the reason for me,
several years ago.

00:01:36.313 --> 00:01:39.408
Because I was tired of the racism,
I was tired of discrimination,

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:42.025
I was tired of the "-isms"
and the schisms.

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.429
I was just so tired.

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:46.057
I was tired of the vicious cycle,

00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:49.310
and I was tired of it even
in the beloved agency

00:01:49.334 --> 00:01:52.247
in the department that I still love today.

00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:54.900
And so my wife and I, we sat down

00:01:54.924 --> 00:01:57.741
and we decided and we targeted
a date that we would retire.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.734
We would retire and I would
go off into the sunset,
