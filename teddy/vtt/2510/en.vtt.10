00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.990
I had to figure out a way to shift
130 cops that were under my tutelage

00:05:03.014 --> 00:05:05.126
from being occupiers of communities

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.339
to being partners.

00:05:07.355 --> 00:05:09.047
I had to figure out how to do that.

00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:11.050
Because here's the crazy thing:

00:05:11.074 --> 00:05:14.719
in law enforcement, we have evolved
into something incredible.

00:05:14.743 --> 00:05:16.680
Listen, we have become great protectors.

00:05:16.704 --> 00:05:18.132
We know how to protect you.

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:22.948
But we have exercised that arm
so much, so very much.

00:05:22.972 --> 00:05:26.138
If I was a natural police department

00:05:26.162 --> 00:05:28.043
and I represented a police department,

00:05:28.067 --> 00:05:30.956
you would see this incredible,
beautiful, 23-inch arm.
