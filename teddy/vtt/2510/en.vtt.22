00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:03.108
because we had learned
to become great servers,

00:11:03.132 --> 00:11:04.869
become great servers first.

00:11:04.893 --> 00:11:07.215
But I gotta tell you this:
these last few years,

00:11:08.607 --> 00:11:10.227
as much as we had learned

00:11:10.856 --> 00:11:13.803
to become great proactive police officers

00:11:13.827 --> 00:11:17.588
and great relational police officers
rather than reactive,

00:11:17.612 --> 00:11:19.677
these last years have disappointed me.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.052
They have broken my heart.

00:11:22.644 --> 00:11:24.481
The uprising still hurts.

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:27.270
It still hurts my heart,

00:11:27.294 --> 00:11:30.276
because truly I believe
that it should've never happened.
