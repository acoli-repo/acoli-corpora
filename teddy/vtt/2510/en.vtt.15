00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:32.240
there's no way we should
be calling the police.

00:07:32.264 --> 00:07:34.906
But we have surrendered
so much of our responsibility.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.064
Listen, when I was a little boy
coming up in Baltimore --

00:07:38.088 --> 00:07:40.225
and listen, we played
rough in the street --

00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:42.660
I ain't never see the police
come and break us up.

00:07:43.026 --> 00:07:44.951
You know who came? It was the elders.

00:07:44.975 --> 00:07:47.110
It was the parental figures
in the community.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.027
It was those guardians,
it was that village mentality.

00:07:50.051 --> 00:07:53.106
They came and said, "Stop that!"
and "Do this." and "Stop that."

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:57.411
We had mentors throughout
all of the community.

00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:00.009
So it takes all of us, all of us.
