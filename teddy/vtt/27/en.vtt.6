00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.016
I've dissected all the different things
that can go wrong with our memories

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.056
that can really threaten your case.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.576
And now I'm turning my attention
to helping people tackle

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.040
recording and reporting of workplace
harassment and discrimination.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.056
There's three things that I've learned
from my research on this

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.816
that you can immediately apply

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.016
if you've been harassed
or discriminated against at work.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.096
I want to help you
turn your memory into evidence --

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.296
evidence that even
a memory skeptic like me

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.160
is unlikely to find fault with.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.296
First of all, James Comey had it right.
