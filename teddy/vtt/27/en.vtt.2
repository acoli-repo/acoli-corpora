You see, most of us will,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.736
at some point in our lives,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.656
experience workplace
harassment or discrimination.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.096
Research shows that particularly
women, people of color

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.256
and people who openly identify as LGBTQI
are likely to be targeted,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.496
and for some people, this is a pervasive
and persistent part of their reality.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.376
And for most of these people --

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.016
98 percent according to some studies --

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.240
most of these people will never
speak up and tell their employer.
