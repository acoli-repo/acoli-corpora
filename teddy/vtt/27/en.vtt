Me Too and Time's Up have highlighted

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.976
that harassment and discrimination
are a shockingly common part

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.056
of many people's lived reality,

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.856
and that this reality
extends into the workplace.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.976
Whether in tech or finance,
sports or the service industry,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.736
every day we seem to hear another story
about an abuse of power

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.216
or another grossly inappropriate
workplace behavior.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.216
People are furious.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.600
They're taking to Twitter and social media
to voice that this must change.
