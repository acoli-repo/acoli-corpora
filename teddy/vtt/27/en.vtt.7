First of all, James Comey had it right.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.736
The former head of the FBI
used to sit in his car,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.176
lock himself in after meetings
with the president

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.176
and write down absolutely everything
he could remember about what happened.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.016
The now-famous recordings
proved to be quite useful later on.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.816
Be like Comey.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.816
Now, you don't need to lock yourself
into your car to do this,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.136
but please, immediately
after something happens,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.296
I want you to contemporaneously
record what happened.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.816
And do this before talking
to anyone else about it.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.776
Because as soon as your share your story

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.416
with friends or family
or colleagues or therapists,
