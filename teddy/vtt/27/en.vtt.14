00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.096
and it's completely evidence-based.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.816
You don't have to talk to a person,

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.296
there's no fear of judgment,

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.000
and you can do it
whenever and wherever you need.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.240
Now you have the power to walk through
an evidence-based memory interview.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.856
Now, this is called a cognitive interview.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.096
This is the same technique that police use
when they're doing their job properly.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.216
So in best-case scenarios,

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.056
people who are being asked
about important emotional events

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.256
are being asked in line
with the cognitive interview.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.136
Now, this walks you through
all the relevant information
