Contemporaneous,
time-stamped evidence is better.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.696
Finally, make sure what you're writing
down is actually relevant.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.656
Too often, we see that people
bring out Facebook messages,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.896
they bring out time-stamped
pieces of evidence,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.016
but sure, they're
not particularly relevant,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.856
they're not particularly useful.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.736
It's easy to write an emotional,
unstructured account of what happened --

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.296
understandable because
it's an emotional experience --

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.376
but those might not actually be
the details that matter later on

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.640
for an investigation.
