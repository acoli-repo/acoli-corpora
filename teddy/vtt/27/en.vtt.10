00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.640
for an investigation.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.096
Write down this list.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.160
I want you to keep track of this
and simply fill in the blanks.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.376
First of all, what happened?

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.976
In as much detail as possible,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.656
describe the situation,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.336
and do it on the day it happened
if at all possible.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.856
Second, who was there?

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.216
Were there any witnesses?

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.816
This becomes crucial potentially later on.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.416
What exact time and date did this happen?

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.496
What location? Where did this happen?

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.856
Who did you tell after the event?

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.816
How did it make you feel
during and after it happened?
