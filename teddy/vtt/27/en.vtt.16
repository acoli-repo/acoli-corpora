But a reporting tool is only as useful
as the audience that's listening.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.616
So if your employer
is truly committed to change,

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.376
we've decided to also offer them
the tool to respond.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.336
So if organizations work with us

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.416
and are truly committed to doing something

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.616
about workplace harassment
and discrimination,

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.536
they're also able to respond to you
even if you've chosen to stay anonymous.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.816
We think it's important that you can work
together with your employer

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.560
to tackle this issue.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.336
We think that everybody wins
when we bring light into this dark issue.
