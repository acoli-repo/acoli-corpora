They're taking to Twitter and social media
to voice that this must change.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.856
But it's time to move beyond the hashtag.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.376
It's time for us to report
harassment and discrimination

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.576
to those who can fix this mess.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.136
And it's time for us
to talk about harassment

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.096
in a more inclusive way:

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.216
not just about sexual harassment,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.216
but to encourage people to come forward

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.856
about harassment and discrimination
based on other characteristics

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.560
such as age, disability or ethnicity.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.896
Because only together can we fix

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.960
the underlying causes
and consequences of harassment.
