00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.416
Now, these three pieces of advice
are a good start,

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.816
but of course they don't overcome
a lot of the other barriers to reporting.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.736
According to the Equality
and Human Rights Commission,

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.016
which published a report in 2018,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.776
there's one key recommendation
to overcome some of the other fears

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.760
often associated with reporting
these kinds of incidents to your employer.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.240
One piece of advice that they made?

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.016
Have an online, anonymous reporting tool.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.656
Only that way, they say,

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.960
can you truly overcome many
of the fears associated with reporting.
