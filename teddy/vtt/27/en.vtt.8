00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.416
with friends or family
or colleagues or therapists,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.056
you have the potential to distort
or change your memory of the event.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.160
Uncontaminated, contemporaneous
evidence is worth gold.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.096
Second: the type of evidence matters.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.736
Sure, you can do a handwritten
note of what happens,

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.640
but how do you prove when you wrote it?

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.736
Instead, pull out
your computer or smartphone

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.256
and make a note that's time-stamped,

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.960
where you can prove
this was recorded at this time.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.680
Contemporaneous,
time-stamped evidence is better.
