00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.240
most of these people will never
speak up and tell their employer.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.136
Too often, harassment and discrimination
is a lonely and isolating experience,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.016
but we need to help people
out from under their desks.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.280
We need to empower people to have a voice.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.816
The reasonable first question
that everybody asks

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.856
once they've been harassed
is "What do I do now?"

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.840
And this is what I want to help you with.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.320
Navigating the barriers to reporting
can be absolutely dizzying.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.976
How can we speak up in a society

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.736
that too often discredits
or diminishes our experiences?
