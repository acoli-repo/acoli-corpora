00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:00.454
such as the Myers-Briggs tests,
for example.

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:01.835
I don't know if you've done those.

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:03.739
A lot of companies 
use these for recruitment.

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.036
You answer a lot of questions,

00:01:07.036 --> 00:01:10.792
and this is supposed to reveal
something about your core personality.

00:01:10.792 --> 00:01:14.093
And of course, the popular fascination 
with this is enormous.

00:01:14.093 --> 00:01:15.761
In magazines like this, you'll see,

00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:19.223
in the bottom left corner,
they'll advertise in virtually every issue

00:01:19.223 --> 00:01:21.333
some kind of personality thing.

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.113
And if you pick up one of those magazines,

00:01:23.113 --> 00:01:24.361
it's hard to resist, isn't it?

00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:27.226
Doing the test to find
what is your learning style,

00:01:27.226 --> 00:01:30.354
what is your loving style,
or what is your working style?
