00:09:27.231 --> 00:09:30.237
which is always the same,
throughout your life, no matter what,

00:09:30.237 --> 00:09:32.807
in a sense you're kind of trapped.

00:09:32.807 --> 00:09:35.418
You're born with an essence,

00:09:35.418 --> 00:09:38.101
that's what you are until you die,

00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:41.130
if you believe in an afterlife, 
maybe you continue.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.100
But if you think of yourself
as being, in a way,

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.880
not a thing as such, 
but a kind of a process,

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.407
something that is changing,

00:09:49.407 --> 00:09:50.944
then I think that's quite liberating.

00:09:50.944 --> 00:09:53.812
Because unlike the the waterfalls,

00:09:53.812 --> 00:09:56.307
we actually have the capacity to channel

00:09:56.307 --> 00:09:59.929
the direction of our development for ourselves
to a certain degree.

00:09:59.929 --> 00:10:02.302
Now we've got to be careful here, right?
