00:05:58.994 --> 00:06:01.638
Now if everything else 
in the universe is like this,

00:06:01.638 --> 00:06:03.944
why are we different?

00:06:03.944 --> 00:06:05.508
Why think of ourselves

00:06:05.508 --> 00:06:09.460
as somehow not just being 
a collection of all our parts,

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.328
but somehow being a separate,
permanent entity which has those parts?

00:06:14.328 --> 00:06:17.438
Now this view is not particularly new, 
actually.

00:06:17.438 --> 00:06:19.113
It has quite a long lineage.

00:06:19.113 --> 00:06:20.463
You find it in Buddhism,

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:23.009
you find it in 17th, 
18th-century philosophy

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.604
going through to the current day,
people like Locke and Hume.

00:06:26.604 --> 00:06:28.687
But interestingly, it's also a view

00:06:28.687 --> 00:06:32.731
increasingly being heard reinforced
by neuroscience.
