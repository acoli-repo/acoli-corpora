00:09:59.929 --> 00:10:02.302
Now we've got to be careful here, right?

00:10:02.302 --> 00:10:05.392
If you watch the X-Factor too much,
you might buy into this idea

00:10:05.392 --> 00:10:07.721
that we can all be whatever we want to be.

00:10:07.721 --> 00:10:09.039
That's not true.

00:10:09.039 --> 00:10:11.209
I've heard some fantastic musicians
this morning,

00:10:11.209 --> 00:10:14.927
and I am very confident
that I could in no way be as good as them.

00:10:14.927 --> 00:10:17.324
I could practice hard 
and maybe be good,

00:10:17.324 --> 00:10:20.328
but I don't have
that really natural ability.

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:22.985
There are limits to what we can achieve.

00:10:22.985 --> 00:10:25.460
There are limits to what 
we can make of ourselves.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.122
But nevertheless, we do have 
this capacity

00:10:28.122 --> 00:10:32.112
to, in a sense, shape ourselves.
