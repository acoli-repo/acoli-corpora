00:10:28.122 --> 00:10:32.112
to, in a sense, shape ourselves.

00:10:32.112 --> 00:10:34.368
The true self, as it were then,

00:10:34.368 --> 00:10:38.429
is not something that is just there
for you to discover,

00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:42.078
you don't sort of look into your soul
and find your true self,

00:10:42.078 --> 00:10:43.899
What you are partly doing, at least,

00:10:43.899 --> 00:10:46.290
is actually creating your true self.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:48.213
And this, I think, is very,
very significant,

00:10:48.213 --> 00:10:50.179
particularly at this stage of life you're at.

00:10:50.179 --> 00:10:51.578
You'll be aware of the fact

00:10:51.578 --> 00:10:54.132
how much of you changed over recent years.

00:10:54.132 --> 00:10:57.371
If you have any videos of yourself, 
three or four years ago,

00:10:57.371 --> 00:11:00.651
you probably feel embarrassed 
because you don't recognize yourself.
