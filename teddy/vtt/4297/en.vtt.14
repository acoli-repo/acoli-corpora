all of which operate, in a way,
quite independently.

00:07:10.987 --> 00:07:14.097

that they relate

00:07:14.097 --> 00:07:16.958
that we get this sense of self.

00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:20.447

00:07:20.447 --> 00:07:25.106
It's like a mechanical trick.

00:07:25.106 --> 00:07:27.586
It's not that we don't exist,

00:07:27.586 --> 00:07:30.870
it's just that the trick is 
to make us feel that inside of us
