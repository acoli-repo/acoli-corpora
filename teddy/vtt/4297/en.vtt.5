00:02:28.187 --> 00:02:30.959
I don't know whether this number plate,
which says "messiah 1,"

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.251
indicates that the driver
believes in the messiah,

00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:35.445
or that they are the messiah.

00:02:35.445 --> 00:02:38.158
Either way, they have beliefs 
about messiahs.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.620
We have knowledge.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.878
We have sensations and experiences as well.

00:02:41.878 --> 00:02:44.395
It's not just intellectual things.

00:02:44.395 --> 00:02:46.998
So this is kind of 
the common-sense model, I think,

00:02:46.998 --> 00:02:48.150
of what a person is.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.441
There is a person who has all the things
that make up our life experiences.

00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:56.960
But the suggestion 
I want to put to you today

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.395
is that there's something 
fundamentally wrong with this model.
