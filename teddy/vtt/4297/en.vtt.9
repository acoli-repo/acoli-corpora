If you have a memory transplant,
are you the same person?

00:04:31.227 --> 00:04:34.602
If you have a belief transplant, 
would you be the same person?

00:04:34.602 --> 00:04:39.501
Now this idea, that what we are, 
the way to understand ourselves,

00:04:39.501 --> 00:04:43.962
is as not of some permanent being,
which has experiences,

00:04:43.962 --> 00:04:46.360
but is kind of a collection of experiences,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.971
might strike you as kind of weird.

00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:51.055
But actually, I don't think 
it should be weird.

00:04:51.055 --> 00:04:52.914
In a way, it's common sense.

00:04:52.914 --> 00:04:57.215
Because I just invite you 
to think about, by comparison,

00:04:57.215 --> 00:05:00.172
think about pretty much anything else
in the universe,
