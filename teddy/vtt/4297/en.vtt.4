00:01:59.082 --> 00:02:01.251
Here's the common-sense idea.

00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:02.287
There is you.

00:02:02.287 --> 00:02:05.595
You are the individuals you are,
and you have this kind of core.

00:02:05.595 --> 00:02:10.227
Now in your life, what happens
is that you, of course,

00:02:10.227 --> 00:02:12.446
accumulate different experiences
and so forth.

00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:14.716
So you have memories,

00:02:14.716 --> 00:02:16.966
and these memories help 
to create what you are.

00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:19.623
You have desires, maybe for a cookie,

00:02:19.623 --> 00:02:22.418
maybe for something
that we don't want to talk about

00:02:22.418 --> 00:02:24.293
at 11 o'clock in the morning
in a school.

00:02:24.293 --> 00:02:26.274
You will have beliefs.

00:02:26.274 --> 00:02:28.187
This is a number plate
from someone in America.

00:02:28.187 --> 00:02:30.959
I don't know whether this number plate,
which says "messiah 1,"
