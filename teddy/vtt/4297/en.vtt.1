00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:30.498
which sort of reinforce the idea

00:00:30.498 --> 00:00:34.249
that for each one of us,
we have a kind of a core, an essence.

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:37.683
There is something about what it means
to be you which defines you,

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:40.003
and it's kind of permanent and unchanging.

00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:41.813
The most kind of crude way
in which we have it,

00:00:41.813 --> 00:00:43.107
are things like horoscopes.

00:00:43.107 --> 00:00:46.147
You know, people are very wedded
to these, actually.

00:00:46.147 --> 00:00:48.111
People put them on their Facebook profile

00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:49.594
as though they are meaningul,

00:00:49.594 --> 00:00:52.271
you even know 
your Chinese horoscope as well.

00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:54.724
There are also 
more scientific versions of this,

00:00:54.724 --> 00:00:57.781
all sorts of ways of profiling
personality type,

00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:00.454
such as the Myers-Briggs tests,
for example.
