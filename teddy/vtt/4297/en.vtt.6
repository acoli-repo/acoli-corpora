00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.395
is that there's something 
fundamentally wrong with this model.

00:03:00.395 --> 00:03:02.853
And I can show you what's wrong
with one click.

00:03:02.853 --> 00:03:09.708
Which is there isn't actually a "you"
at the heart of all these experiences.

00:03:09.708 --> 00:03:11.321
Strange thought?
Well, maybe not.

00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:13.079
What is there, then?

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.348
Well, clearly there are memories,
desires, intentions, sensations,

00:03:16.348 --> 00:03:18.291
and so forth.

00:03:18.291 --> 00:03:20.549
But what happens is
these things exist,

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.618
and they're kind of all integrated,

00:03:22.618 --> 00:03:26.407
they're overlapped, they're connected
in various different ways.

00:03:26.407 --> 00:03:28.997
They're connecting partly,
and perhaps even mainly,

00:03:28.997 --> 00:03:32.324
because they all belong to one body
and one brain.
