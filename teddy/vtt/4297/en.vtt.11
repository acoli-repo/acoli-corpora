00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.351
We understand, very easily,
very straightforwardly,

00:05:30.351 --> 00:05:32.083
that water is nothing more


00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:37.117
than the hydrogen and oxygen molecules
suitably arranged.

00:05:37.117 --> 00:05:39.030
Everything else in the universe is the same.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.199
There's no mystery about my watch,
for example.

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.562
We say the watch has a face, and hands,

00:05:46.562 --> 00:05:48.362
and a mechanism and a battery,

00:05:48.362 --> 00:05:49.523
But what we really mean is,


00:05:49.523 --> 00:05:51.128
we don't think 
there is a thing called the watch

00:05:51.128 --> 00:05:53.861
to which we then attach all these bits.

00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:56.897
We understand very clearly 
that you get the parts of the watch,

00:05:56.897 --> 00:05:58.994
you put them together,
and you create a watch.

00:05:58.994 --> 00:06:01.638
Now if everything else 
in the universe is like this,
