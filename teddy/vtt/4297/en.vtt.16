00:07:56.696 --> 00:08:00.674
These are three psychologists,
Thomas Metzinger, Bruce Hood,

00:08:00.674 --> 00:08:02.978
Susan Blackmore,

00:08:02.978 --> 00:08:05.963
a lot of these people do talk 
the language of illusion,

00:08:05.963 --> 00:08:08.029
the self is an illusion, it's a fiction.

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:11.075
But I don't think this is 
a very helpful way of looking at it.

00:08:11.075 --> 00:08:11.852
Go back to the watch.

00:08:11.852 --> 00:08:15.904
The watch isn't an illusion, 
because there is nothing to the watch

00:08:15.904 --> 00:08:18.152
other than a collection of its parts.

00:08:18.152 --> 00:08:20.109
In the same way, 
we're not illusions either.

00:08:20.109 --> 00:08:25.552
The fact that we are, in some ways,
just this very, very complex collection,

00:08:25.552 --> 00:08:27.137
ordered collection of things,

00:08:27.137 --> 00:08:29.012
does not mean we're not real.

00:08:29.012 --> 00:08:31.911
I can give you 
a very sort of rough metaphor for this.
