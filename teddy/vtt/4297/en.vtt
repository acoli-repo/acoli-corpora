00:00:00.891 --> 00:00:01.988
Is there a real you?

00:00:01.988 --> 00:00:04.338
This might seem to you 
like a very odd question.

00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:06.897
Because, you might ask,

00:00:06.897 --> 00:00:09.225
how do we find the real you,

00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:11.259
how do you know what the real you is?

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:12.223
And so forth.

00:00:12.223 --> 00:00:15.591
But the idea that there must be a real you,

00:00:15.591 --> 00:00:16.634
surely that's obvious.

00:00:16.634 --> 00:00:19.895
If there's anything real 
in the world, it's you.

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:21.840
Well, I'm not quite sure.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.457
At least we have to understand 
a bit better what that means.

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:28.291
Now certainly, I think there are
lots of things in our culture around us

00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:30.498
which sort of reinforce the idea
