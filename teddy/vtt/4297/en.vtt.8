00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:04.208
In some ways, it's a small difference
from the common-sense understanding.

00:04:04.208 --> 00:04:06.462
In some ways, it's a massive one.

00:04:06.462 --> 00:04:08.638
It's the shift between thinking of yourself

00:04:08.638 --> 00:04:12.034
as a thing which has 
all the experiences of life,

00:04:12.034 --> 00:04:14.977
and thinking of yourself
as simply that collection

00:04:14.977 --> 00:04:16.999
of all experiences in life.

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:19.847
You are the sum of your parts.

00:04:19.847 --> 00:04:21.969
Now those parts are also physical parts, 
of course,

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.871
brains, bodies and legs and things,

00:04:23.871 --> 00:04:26.174
but they aren't so important, actually.

00:04:26.174 --> 00:04:28.847
If you have a heart transplant,
you're still the same person.

00:04:28.847 --> 00:04:31.227
If you have a memory transplant,
are you the same person?
