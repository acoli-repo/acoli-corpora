00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.356
is something more unified

00:07:37.493 --> 00:07:39.825
You might think that if it's true,

00:07:39.825 --> 00:07:43.576
that for each one of us there is
no abiding core of self,

00:07:43.576 --> 00:07:45.561

00:07:49.493 --> 00:07:51.807

00:07:51.807 --> 00:07:53.615
There is no real you.

Well, a lot of people actually do use 
this talk of illusion and so forth.

00:07:56.696 --> 00:08:00.674
These are three psychologists,
