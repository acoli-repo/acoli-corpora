00:06:28.687 --> 00:06:32.731
increasingly being heard reinforced
by neuroscience.

00:06:32.731 --> 00:06:36.375
This is Paul Broks, 
he's a clinical neuropsychologist,

00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:37.574
and he says this:

00:06:37.574 --> 00:06:39.956
"We have a deep intuition
that there is a core,

00:06:39.956 --> 00:06:42.505
an essence there, 
and it's hard to shake off,

00:06:42.505 --> 00:06:45.516
probably impossible to shake off, 
I suspect.

00:06:45.516 --> 00:06:49.443
But it's true that neuroscience shows
that there is no centre in the brain

00:06:49.443 --> 00:06:51.733
where things do all come together."

00:06:51.733 --> 00:06:54.203
So when you look at the brain,

00:06:54.203 --> 00:06:58.220
and you look at how the brain
makes possible a sense of self,

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.004
you find that there isn't 
a central control spot in the brain.
