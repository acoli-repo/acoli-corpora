00:04:57.215 --> 00:05:00.172
think about pretty much anything else
in the universe,

00:05:00.172 --> 00:05:02.922
maybe apart from the 
very most fundamental forces or powers.

00:05:02.922 --> 00:05:05.657
Let's take something like water.

00:05:05.657 --> 00:05:08.198
Now my science isn't very good.

00:05:08.198 --> 00:05:11.213
We might say something like 
water has two parts hydrogen

00:05:11.213 --> 00:05:13.099
and one parts oxygen, right?

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:14.747
We all know that.

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:18.212
I hope no one in this room
thinks that what that means

00:05:18.212 --> 00:05:22.414
is there is a thing called water, 
and attached to it 


00:05:22.414 --> 00:05:25.051
are hydrogen and oxygen atoms,

00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:26.244
and that's what water is.

00:05:26.244 --> 00:05:27.099
Of course we don't.

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.351
We understand, very easily,
very straightforwardly,
