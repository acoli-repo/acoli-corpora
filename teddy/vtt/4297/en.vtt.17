I can give you 
a very sort of rough metaphor for this.

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:34.516
Let's take something like a waterfall.

00:08:34.516 --> 00:08:38.123
These are the Iguazu Falls, in Argentina.

00:08:38.123 --> 00:08:40.625
Now if you take something like this,

00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:43.919
you can appreciate the fact 
that in lots of ways,

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.029
there's nothing permanent about this.

00:08:46.029 --> 00:08:47.462
For one thing, it's always changing.

00:08:47.462 --> 00:08:50.309
The waters 
are always carving new channels.

00:08:50.309 --> 00:08:52.600
with changes and tides and the weather,

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.024
some things dry up, 
new things are created.

00:08:57.024 --> 00:09:00.511
Of course the water that flows 
through the waterfall
