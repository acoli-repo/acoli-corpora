00:03:28.997 --> 00:03:32.324
because they all belong to one body
and one brain.

00:03:32.324 --> 00:03:35.387
But there's also a narrative, 
a story we tell about ourselves,

00:03:35.387 --> 00:03:38.282
the experiences we have
when we remember past things.

00:03:38.282 --> 00:03:40.514
We do things because of other things.

00:03:40.514 --> 00:03:44.126
So what we desire
is partly a result of what we believe,

00:03:44.126 --> 00:03:47.692
and what we remember is also
informing us what we know.

00:03:47.692 --> 00:03:50.354
And so really, there are all these things,

00:03:50.354 --> 00:03:53.393
like beliefs, desires, 
sensations, experiences,

00:03:53.393 --> 00:03:55.823
they're all related to each other,

00:03:55.823 --> 00:03:59.371
and that just is you.

00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:04.208
In some ways, it's a small difference
from the common-sense understanding.
