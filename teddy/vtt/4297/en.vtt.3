what is your loving style,
or what is your working style?

00:01:30.354 --> 00:01:32.954
Are you this kind of person or that?

00:01:32.954 --> 00:01:36.987
So I think that we have a common-sense idea

00:01:36.987 --> 00:01:39.634
that there is a kind of core 
or essence of ourselves

00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:41.168
to be discovered.

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:44.424
And that this is kind of a permanent truth
about ourselves,

00:01:44.424 --> 00:01:46.864
something that's the same throughout life.

00:01:46.864 --> 00:01:50.615
Well, that's the idea I want to challenge.

00:01:50.615 --> 00:01:52.457
And I have to say now,
I'll say it a bit later,

00:01:52.457 --> 00:01:55.285
but I'm not challenging this
just because I'm weird,

00:01:55.285 --> 00:01:59.082
the challenge actually has a very,
very long and distinguished history.

00:01:59.082 --> 00:02:01.251
Here's the common-sense idea.
