the appropriate response

00:11:05.169 --> 00:11:06.740
and truly listen

00:11:06.764 --> 00:11:08.556
when someone else is talking.

00:11:09.518 --> 00:11:12.347
And in silencing our minds,

00:11:12.371 --> 00:11:16.658

and inadequacies,

00:11:16.682 --> 00:11:20.156
which can help us formulate our response

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.398
with more clarity and empathy.

is one of the greatest gymnasts
in the history of the sport.
