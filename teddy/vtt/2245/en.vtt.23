WEBVTT

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.968
is one of the greatest gymnasts
in the history of the sport.

00:11:30.992 --> 00:11:33.805
She's the only athlete
to have earned the trifecta:

00:11:34.362 --> 00:11:36.361
she's a national champion,

00:11:36.385 --> 00:11:37.978
a world champion

00:11:38.002 --> 00:11:39.526
and an Olympic champion.

00:11:40.465 --> 00:11:42.839
She's also not one for small talk,

00:11:42.863 --> 00:11:45.732
so I was a bit surprised one day
when she came to my office,

00:11:45.756 --> 00:11:47.081
sat on the couch

00:11:47.105 --> 00:11:49.421
and just started talking --

00:11:49.445 --> 00:11:51.143
first about her major,

00:11:51.167 --> 00:11:52.732
then about graduate school

00:11:52.756 --> 00:11:56.536
and then about everything else
that seemed to pop into her mind.

00:11:57.186 --> 00:12:00.561
My inner voice whispered to me
