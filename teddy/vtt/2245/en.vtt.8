00:03:59.553 --> 00:04:01.421
My first few seasons as a head coach

00:04:01.445 --> 00:04:02.870
were abysmal,

00:04:02.894 --> 00:04:06.852
and after putting up with
my brash coaching style for a few years,

00:04:06.876 --> 00:04:09.224
our team asked me for a team meeting.

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:10.565
Well, I love team meetings,

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:12.723
so I said, "Yay!
Let's have a team meeting."

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:15.865
And for two solid hours,

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:21.650
they gave me examples of how my arrogance
was hurtful and demeaning.

00:04:22.603 --> 00:04:23.852
Yeah, not yay.

00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:27.176
They explained to me

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.292
that they wanted to be supported,

00:04:29.316 --> 00:04:30.744
not belittled.
