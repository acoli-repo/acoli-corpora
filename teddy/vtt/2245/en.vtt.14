00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:00.809
a team meeting we had
halfway through her freshman season.

00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:04.146
We were in there with the team,
the coaching staff, the support staff,

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.701
sports psychologist,

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:11.166
and Katelyn very clearly
and unapologetically said,

00:07:12.212 --> 00:07:14.214
"I just don't want to be great again."

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.379
I felt like I got sucker punched.

00:07:19.813 --> 00:07:22.194
My first thought was,

00:07:22.218 --> 00:07:25.726
"Then why the heck am I
going to honor your scholarship?"

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.861
It was a really snarky thought,
and thankfully I didn't say it out loud,
