First of all, you may be able
to dictate your way to a win,

00:03:00.484 --> 00:03:03.678
but you can't dictate your way to success.

00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:08.525
Let me take you back to 1990,
when I was first appointed the head coach

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.792
of the UCLA Women's Gymnastics Team.

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:15.172
And I would like to share with you
that I've never done gymnastics.

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:17.172
I grew up in the world of ballet.

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:20.038
I have never done a cartwheel,

00:03:20.062 --> 00:03:22.953
and I couldn't teach you
how to do a proper cartwheel.

00:03:22.977 --> 00:03:24.022
(Laughter)

00:03:24.046 --> 00:03:25.335
It's sadly true.

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:30.617
And I knew nothing about
how to develop a team culture.
