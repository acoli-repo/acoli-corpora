00:02:03.497 --> 00:02:05.994
and when the end result is a win,

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.400
the human component of how we got there

00:02:10.424 --> 00:02:13.643
often gets swept under the proverbial rug,

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:15.382
and so does the damage.

00:02:16.647 --> 00:02:18.967
So I'm calling for a time-out.

00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:20.210
Time-out.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.833
We need to redefine success.

00:02:23.968 --> 00:02:30.780
Real success is developing
champions in life for our world,
