00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.786
we have a crisis

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.482
in the win-at-all-cost cultures

00:01:03.506 --> 00:01:05.404
that we have created.

00:01:06.272 --> 00:01:07.720
In our schools,

00:01:07.744 --> 00:01:10.462
in our businesses, in politics,

00:01:10.486 --> 00:01:13.411
winning at all cost
has become acceptable.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.907
As a society,

00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:19.663
we honor the people
at the top of the pyramid.

00:01:19.687 --> 00:01:26.350
We effusively applaud those people who win
championships and elections and awards.

00:01:27.276 --> 00:01:29.243
But sadly, quite often,

00:01:29.267 --> 00:01:32.955
those same people
are leaving their institutions
