00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:02.094
Are you focusing on the end result,

00:10:02.929 --> 00:10:04.641
or are you excited to use that time

00:10:04.665 --> 00:10:06.959
to help your child
develop into a champion?

00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:08.986
It's very simple:

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.362
you will know you're focusing
on the end result

00:10:11.386 --> 00:10:13.757
if you ask questions about the end result.

00:10:14.234 --> 00:10:15.431
"Did you win?"

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.693
"How many points did you score?"

00:10:18.404 --> 00:10:19.795
"Did you get an A?"

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:27.610
If you truly are motivated about helping
your child develop into a champion,

00:10:27.634 --> 00:10:30.706
you will ask questions
about the experience
