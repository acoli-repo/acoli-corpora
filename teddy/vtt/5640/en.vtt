00:00:06.726 --> 00:00:11.814
Since 2000, the annual number of people
convicted of crimes in the United States

00:00:11.814 --> 00:00:17.819
has stayed steady, but the average number
of people in jail each year has shot up.

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:19.379
How can that be?

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:22.109
The answer lies in the bail system—

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.489
which isn’t doing 
what it was intended to do.

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.489
The term "bail" refers to the release
of people awaiting trial

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.149
on condition that they return 
to court to face charges.
