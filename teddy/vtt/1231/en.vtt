00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Today I want to talk to you about

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
swimming across the North Pole,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
across the most northern place in the whole world.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And perhaps the best place to start is with my late father.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
He was a great storyteller.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
He could tell a story about an event,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
was of the first British atomic bomb test.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
He had been there and watched it go off.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And he said that the explosion was so loud
