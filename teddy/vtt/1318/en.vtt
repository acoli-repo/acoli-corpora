00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:06.126
I want to discuss with you this afternoon

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.588
why you're going to fail
to have a great career.

00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:09.987
(Laughter)

00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:12.205
I'm an economist.

00:00:12.706 --> 00:00:14.089
I do dismal.

00:00:14.823 --> 00:00:18.394
End of the day, it's ready
for dismal remarks.

00:00:19.204 --> 00:00:22.844
I only want to talk to those of you
who want a great career.

00:00:23.185 --> 00:00:26.907
I know some of you have already decided
you want a good career.

00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:28.321
You're going to fail, too.

00:00:28.345 --> 00:00:29.416
(Laughter)

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.049
Because -- goodness,
you're all cheery about failing.
