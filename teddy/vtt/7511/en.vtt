00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.500
It was a strange feeling,
walking into the local supermarket,

00:00:04.542 --> 00:00:06.711
only to find empty shelves,

00:00:06.711 --> 00:00:09.047
and, most notably, no toilet paper.

00:00:09.422 --> 00:00:13.384
We didn't have raw-material shortages
or manufacturing defects,

00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:15.970
and we didn't discover
new uses for toilet paper.

00:00:16.888 --> 00:00:19.474
It was panic buying by everyday people.

00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:22.018
Supply chains just couldn't keep up.

00:00:22.518 --> 00:00:25.688
And before we knew it,
the rumored shortage became a real one.

00:00:26.606 --> 00:00:28.232
You remember that, don't you?

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:32.528
Well, maybe not, because
I'm not talking about COVID-19.
