00:10:59.185 --> 00:11:02.075
then in the world that's been
violently whitewashed,

00:11:02.099 --> 00:11:04.772
we will become the pinpricks
of color pushing through,

00:11:05.286 --> 00:11:07.184
much like those widows of Vrindavan.

00:11:09.093 --> 00:11:12.537
How then, with so many of us,

00:11:12.561 --> 00:11:14.641
will the crosshairs of a gun

00:11:14.665 --> 00:11:16.567
be able to pick out Karar,

00:11:17.412 --> 00:11:18.567
Malala,

00:11:19.048 --> 00:11:20.203
Alisha?

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:23.521
Can they kill us all?

00:11:26.533 --> 00:11:28.306
The time is now to stand up,

00:11:29.171 --> 00:11:30.539
to stand out.
