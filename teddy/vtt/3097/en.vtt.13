00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.675
And so, it's been a sea
of white for centuries.

00:06:32.608 --> 00:06:35.702
However, only as recently as 2013,

00:06:35.726 --> 00:06:39.456
the widows of Vrindavan
have started to celebrate Holi,

00:06:39.947 --> 00:06:41.957
the Indian festival of color,

00:06:42.665 --> 00:06:44.934
which they are prohibited
from participating in.

00:06:46.615 --> 00:06:48.235
On this one day in March,

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.962
these women take the traditional
colored powder of the festival

00:06:52.705 --> 00:06:54.178
and color each other.

00:06:55.454 --> 00:06:59.383
With every handful of the powder
they throw into the air,

00:06:59.407 --> 00:07:03.241
their white saris slowly start
to suffuse with color.
