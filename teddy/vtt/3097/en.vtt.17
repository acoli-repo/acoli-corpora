a canvas we get to paint however we want.

00:08:33.467 --> 00:08:35.697
Somebody who loved this world of fashion

00:08:35.721 --> 00:08:37.187
was Karar Nushi.

00:08:37.548 --> 00:08:39.640
He was a student and actor from Iraq.

00:08:40.348 --> 00:08:42.693
He loved his vibrant, eclectic clothes.

00:08:43.164 --> 00:08:47.983
However, he soon started receiving
death threats for how he looked.

00:08:48.764 --> 00:08:50.195
He remained unfazed.

00:08:50.754 --> 00:08:52.602
He remained fabulous,

00:08:52.626 --> 00:08:54.594
until July 2017,

00:08:54.618 --> 00:08:58.660
when Karar was discovered dead
on a busy street in Baghdad.
