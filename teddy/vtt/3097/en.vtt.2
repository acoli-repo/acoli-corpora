00:00:59.173 --> 00:01:00.350
(Laughter)

00:01:00.374 --> 00:01:02.436
Well, almost.

00:01:04.253 --> 00:01:06.240
This became my daily prayer:

00:01:06.264 --> 00:01:09.738
"God, please make me
just like everybody else."

00:01:11.342 --> 00:01:13.927
I think this went straight
to God's voicemail, though.

00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:15.003
(Laughter)

00:01:15.027 --> 00:01:17.529
And eventually, it became pretty clear

00:01:17.553 --> 00:01:21.373
that I was not growing up to be
the son that my father always wanted.

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:22.983
Sorry, Dad.

00:01:25.523 --> 00:01:28.358
No, I was not going to magically change.

00:01:28.382 --> 00:01:33.687
And over time, I grew less and less sure
that I actually wanted to.
