00:11:29.171 --> 00:11:30.539
to stand out.

00:11:31.407 --> 00:11:33.782
Where sameness is safeness,

00:11:33.806 --> 00:11:36.331
with something as simple as what we wear,

00:11:36.355 --> 00:11:38.567
we can draw every eye to ourselves

00:11:39.041 --> 00:11:43.427
to say that there are differences
in this world, and there always will be.

00:11:44.183 --> 00:11:45.417
Get used to it.

00:11:46.511 --> 00:11:49.430
And this we can say without a single word.

00:11:49.844 --> 00:11:52.798
Fashion can give us
a language for dissent.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.208
It can give us courage.

00:11:55.971 --> 00:12:00.258
Fashion can let us literally wear
our courage on our sleeves.
