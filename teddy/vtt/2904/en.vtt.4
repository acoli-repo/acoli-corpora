00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.536
And if you want to build a system
on top of computer vision,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.016
say a self-driving vehicle
or a robotic system,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.496
this is the kind
of information that you want.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.759
You want something so that
you can interact with the physical world.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.016
Now, when I started working
on object detection,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.336
it took 20 seconds
to process a single image.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.240
And to get a feel for why
speed is so important in this domain,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.656
here's an example of an object detector

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.096
that takes two seconds
to process an image.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.736
So this is 10 times faster

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.296
than the 20-seconds-per-image detector,
