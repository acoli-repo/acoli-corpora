(Applause)

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.256
But we wanted to make detection
even more accessible and usable,

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.336
so through a combination
of model optimization,

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.656
network binarization and approximation,

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.600
we actually have object detection
running on a phone.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.120
(Applause)

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:04.016
And I'm really excited because
now we have a pretty powerful solution
