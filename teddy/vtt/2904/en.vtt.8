00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.776
Instead, we trained a single network
to do all of detection for us.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.080
It produces all of the bounding boxes
and class probabilities simultaneously.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.176
With our system, instead of looking
at an image thousands of times

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.656
to produce detection,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.936
you only look once,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.880
and that's why we call it
the YOLO method of object detection.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.336
So with this speed,
we're not just limited to images;

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.776
we can process video in real time.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.896
And now, instead of just seeing
that cat and dog,

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.880
we can see them move around
and interact with each other.
