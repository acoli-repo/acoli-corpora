00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.296
than the 20-seconds-per-image detector,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.976
and you can see that by the time
it makes predictions,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.040
the entire state of the world has changed,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.296
and this wouldn't be very useful

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.736
for an application.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.256
If we speed this up
by another factor of 10,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.096
this is a detector running
at five frames per second.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.656
This is a lot better,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.656
but for example,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.976
if there's any significant movement,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.560
I wouldn't want a system
like this driving my car.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.360
This is our detection system
running in real time on my laptop.
