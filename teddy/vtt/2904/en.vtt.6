This is our detection system
running in real time on my laptop.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.136
So it smoothly tracks me
as I move around the frame,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.880
and it's robust to a wide variety
of changes in size,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.640
pose,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.136
forward, backward.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.376
This is great.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.136
This is what we really need

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.056
if we're going to build systems
on top of computer vision.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.080
(Applause)

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.456
So in just a few years,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.136
we've gone from 20 seconds per image

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.696
to 20 milliseconds per image,
a thousand times faster.
