Ten years ago,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.776
computer vision researchers
thought that getting a computer

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.496
to tell the difference
between a cat and a dog

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.496
would be almost impossible,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.216
even with the significant advance
in the state of artificial intelligence.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.800
Now we can do it at a level
greater than 99 percent accuracy.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.536
This is called image classification --

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.656
give it an image,
put a label to that image --

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.720
and computers know
thousands of other categories as well.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.576
I'm a graduate student
at the University of Washington,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.496
and I work on a project called Darknet,
