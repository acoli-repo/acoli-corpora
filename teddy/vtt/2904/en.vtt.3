00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.816
where we look at an image
and try to find all of the objects,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.296
put bounding boxes around them

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.840
and say what those objects are.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.680
So here's what happens
when we run a detector on this image.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.496
Now, with this kind of result,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.216
we can do a lot more
with our computer vision algorithms.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.216
We see that it knows
that there's a cat and a dog.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.496
It knows their relative locations,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.736
their size.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.696
It may even know some extra information.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.680
There's a book sitting in the background.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.536
And if you want to build a system
on top of computer vision,
