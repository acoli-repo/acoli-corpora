00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.496
and I work on a project called Darknet,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.216
which is a neural network framework

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.056
for training and testing
computer vision models.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.056
So let's just see what Darknet thinks

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.840
of this image that we have.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.856
When we run our classifier

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.096
on this image,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.576
we see we don't just get
a prediction of dog or cat,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.936
we actually get
specific breed predictions.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.136
That's the level
of granularity we have now.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.776
And it's correct.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.640
My dog is in fact a malamute.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.376
So we've made amazing strides
in image classification,
