00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.696
to 20 milliseconds per image,
a thousand times faster.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.136
How did we get there?

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.176
Well, in the past,
object detection systems

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.136
would take an image like this

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.616
and split it into a bunch of regions

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.896
and then run a classifier
on each of these regions,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.456
and high scores for that classifier

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.616
would be considered
detections in the image.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.696
But this involved running a classifier
thousands of times over an image,

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.640
thousands of neural network evaluations
to produce detection.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.776
Instead, we trained a single network
to do all of detection for us.
