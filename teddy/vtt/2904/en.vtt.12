in a tissue biopsy.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.320
And there are researchers around the globe
already using this technology

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.656
for advances in things
like medicine, robotics.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.056
This morning, I read a paper

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.656
where they were taking a census
of animals in Nairobi National Park

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.816
with YOLO as part
of this detection system.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.936
And that's because Darknet is open source

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.480
and in the public domain,
free for anyone to use.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.296
