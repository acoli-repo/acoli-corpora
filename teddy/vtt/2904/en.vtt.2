00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.376
So we've made amazing strides
in image classification,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.400
but what happens
when we run our classifier

00:01:03.424 --> 00:01:05.384
on an image that looks like this?

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.280
Well ...

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.536
We see that the classifier comes back
with a pretty similar prediction.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.656
And it's correct,
there is a malamute in the image,

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.376
but just given this label,
we don't actually know that much

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.067
about what's going on in the image.

00:01:25.091 --> 00:01:26.651
We need something more powerful.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.856
I work on a problem
called object detection,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.816
where we look at an image
and try to find all of the objects,
