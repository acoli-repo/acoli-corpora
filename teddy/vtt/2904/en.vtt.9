00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.880
we can see them move around
and interact with each other.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.616
This is a detector that we trained

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.016
on 80 different classes

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.296
in Microsoft's COCO dataset.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.656
It has all sorts of things
like spoon and fork, bowl,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.480
common objects like that.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.456
It has a variety of more exotic things:

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.736
animals, cars, zebras, giraffes.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.696
And now we're going to do something fun.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.816
We're just going to go
out into the audience
