00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.576
And this is great.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.776
And all of the processing
is happening in real time

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.000
on the laptop.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.536
And it's important to remember

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.776
that this is a general purpose
object detection system,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.800
so we can train this for any image domain.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.856
The same code that we use

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.336
to find stop signs or pedestrians,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.336
bicycles in a self-driving vehicle,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.216
can be used to find cancer cells

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.256
in a tissue biopsy.
