00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:34.165
So there's about 25,000 things
there that can go wrong.

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:38.991
So motor racing is very much
about attention to detail.

00:00:39.015 --> 00:00:42.254
The other thing about Formula
1 in particular

00:00:42.278 --> 00:00:44.378
is we're always changing the car.

00:00:44.402 --> 00:00:46.658
We're always trying to make it faster.

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:49.642
So every two weeks, we will be making

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:53.842
about 5,000 new components
to fit to the car.

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:56.020
Five to 10 percent of the race car

00:00:56.044 --> 00:00:59.772
will be different
every two weeks of the year.

00:00:59.796 --> 00:01:02.081
So how do we do that?
