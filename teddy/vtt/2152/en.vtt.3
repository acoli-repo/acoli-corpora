00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:32.495
to say when things are not
working the way they should do,

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:35.320
and we're sending that data
back to the garage

00:01:35.344 --> 00:01:40.299
using telemetry at a rate
of two to four megabits per second.

00:01:40.323 --> 00:01:43.426
So during a two-hour race,
each car will be sending

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.701
750 million numbers.

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:48.844
That's twice as many numbers
as words that each of us

00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:50.475
speaks in a lifetime.

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:53.093
It's a huge amount of data.

00:01:53.117 --> 00:01:55.738
But it's not enough just
to have data and measure it.

00:01:55.762 --> 00:01:57.896
You need to be able to do
something with it.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.290
So we've spent a lot of time and effort
