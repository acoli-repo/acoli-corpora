00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.471
when things start to go
bad, you have a short time

00:04:00.495 --> 00:04:02.302
to make a difference.

00:04:02.326 --> 00:04:05.056
So what we did is we took a data system

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.187
which we run every two weeks
of the year in Formula 1

00:04:08.211 --> 00:04:11.189
and we installed it
on the hospital computers

00:04:11.213 --> 00:04:13.479
at Birmingham Children's Hospital.

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.918
We streamed data
from the bedside instruments

00:04:15.942 --> 00:04:18.475
in their pediatric intensive care

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:21.930
so that we could both look
at the data in real time

00:04:21.954 --> 00:04:24.802
and, more importantly, to store the data

00:04:24.826 --> 00:04:27.859
so that we could start to learn from it.

00:04:27.883 --> 00:04:32.243
And then, we applied an application on top
