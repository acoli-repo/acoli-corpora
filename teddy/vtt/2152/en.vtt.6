00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:00.795
These were all undetected
by normal thresholds

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.203
which would be applied to data.

00:03:03.227 --> 00:03:06.346
So the question is, why
couldn't we see it?

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.927
Was this a predictable event?

00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:11.937
Can we look more
at the patterns in the data

00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:15.317
to be able to do things better?

00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:17.967
So this is a child,

00:03:17.991 --> 00:03:21.199
about the same age
as the racing car on stage,

00:03:21.223 --> 00:03:22.829
three months old.

00:03:22.853 --> 00:03:25.434
It's a patient with a heart problem.

00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:28.902
Now, when you look at some of the data
on the screen above,

00:03:28.926 --> 00:03:33.804
things like heart rate, pulse,
oxygen, respiration rates,
