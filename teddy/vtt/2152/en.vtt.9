WEBVTT

00:04:27.883 --> 00:04:32.243
And then, we applied an application on top

00:04:32.267 --> 00:04:35.513
which would allow us to tease
out the patterns in the data

00:04:35.537 --> 00:04:38.469
in real time so we could
see what was happening,

00:04:38.493 --> 00:04:42.182
so we could determine when
things started to change.

00:04:42.206 --> 00:04:46.045
Now, in motor racing, we're
all a little bit ambitious,

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:48.594
audacious, a little bit
arrogant sometimes,

00:04:48.618 --> 00:04:51.992
so we decided we would also
look at the children

00:04:52.016 --> 00:04:54.949
as they were being transported
to intensive care.

00:04:54.973 --> 00:04:57.497
Why should we wait
until they arrived in the hospital

00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:59.097
before we started to look?

00:04:59.121 --> 00:05:02.094
And so we installed a real-time link
