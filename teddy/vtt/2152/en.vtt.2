So how do we do that?

00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:05.825
Well, we start our life
with the racing car.

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:09.816
We have a lot of sensors
on the car to measure things.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.698
On the race car in front of you here

00:01:11.722 --> 00:01:14.857
there are about 120 sensors
when it goes into a race.

00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:18.509
It's measuring all sorts
of things around the car.

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.561
That data is logged. We're logging about

00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:24.265
500 different parameters
within the data systems,

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.930
about 13,000 health parameters and events

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:32.495
to say when things are not
working the way they should do,
