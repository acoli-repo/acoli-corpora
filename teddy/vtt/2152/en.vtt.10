WEBVTT

00:04:59.121 --> 00:05:02.094
And so we installed a real-time link

00:05:02.118 --> 00:05:04.930
between the ambulance and the hospital,

00:05:04.954 --> 00:05:08.706
just using normal 3G
telephony to send that data

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.193
so that the ambulance became an extra bed

00:05:11.217 --> 00:05:14.329
in intensive care.

00:05:14.353 --> 00:05:18.031
And then we started looking at the data.

00:05:18.055 --> 00:05:20.952
So the wiggly lines
at the top, all the colors,

00:05:20.976 --> 00:05:24.146
this is the normal sort of data
you would see on a monitor --

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.918
heart rate, pulse,
oxygen within the blood,

00:05:27.942 --> 00:05:30.553
and respiration.
