00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.769
and on the far right-hand side,

00:02:31.793 --> 00:02:34.555
where everything starts getting
a little bit catastrophic,

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.940
that is the patient going
into cardiac arrest.

00:02:37.964 --> 00:02:41.172
It was deemed to be
an unpredictable event.

00:02:41.196 --> 00:02:44.961
This was a heart attack
that no one could see coming.

00:02:44.985 --> 00:02:47.511
But when we look at the information there,

00:02:47.535 --> 00:02:49.860
we can see that things
are starting to become

00:02:49.884 --> 00:02:53.889
a little fuzzy about five minutes
or so before the cardiac arrest.

00:02:53.913 --> 00:02:55.926
We can see small changes

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.309
in things like the heart rate moving.

00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:00.795
These were all undetected
by normal thresholds
