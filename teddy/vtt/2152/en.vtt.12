00:05:58.283 --> 00:06:01.129
we can see that the data
is speaking to us.

00:06:01.153 --> 00:06:04.665
It's telling us that something
is going wrong.

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:08.481
The plot with the red and the green blobs,

00:06:08.505 --> 00:06:11.286
this is plotting different components

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.833
of the data against each other.

00:06:13.857 --> 00:06:17.673
The green is us learning
what is normal for that child.

00:06:17.697 --> 00:06:20.283
We call it the cloud of normality.

00:06:20.307 --> 00:06:22.524
And when things start to change,

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:25.088
when conditions start to deteriorate,

00:06:25.112 --> 00:06:27.326
we move into the red line.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:28.983
There's no rocket science here.

00:06:29.007 --> 00:06:33.096
It is displaying data that exists
already in a different way,
