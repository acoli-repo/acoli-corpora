Motor racing is a funny old business.

00:00:02.593 --> 00:00:04.886
We make a new car every year,

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.074
and then we spend the rest of the season

00:00:07.098 --> 00:00:09.850
trying to understand
what it is we've built

00:00:09.874 --> 00:00:13.071
to make it better, to make it faster.

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:16.346
And then the next year, we start again.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.584
Now, the car you see in front
of you is quite complicated.

00:00:20.608 --> 00:00:24.203
The chassis is made
up of about 11,000 components,

00:00:24.227 --> 00:00:26.671
the engine another 6,000,

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:29.764
the electronics
about eight and a half thousand.

00:00:29.788 --> 00:00:34.165
So there's about 25,000 things
there that can go wrong.
