00:06:29.007 --> 00:06:33.096
It is displaying data that exists
already in a different way,

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.487
to amplify it, to provide
cues to the doctors,

00:06:36.511 --> 00:06:39.225
to the nurses, so they can
see what's happening.

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:42.355
In the same way that a good racing driver

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:46.399
relies on cues to decide
when to apply the brakes,

00:06:46.423 --> 00:06:47.875
when to turn into a corner,

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:50.793
we need to help
our physicians and our nurses

00:06:50.817 --> 00:06:54.413
to see when things
are starting to go wrong.

00:06:54.437 --> 00:06:57.359
So we have a very ambitious program.

00:06:57.383 --> 00:07:02.095
We think that the race is on to do
something differently.
