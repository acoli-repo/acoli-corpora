00:06:57.383 --> 00:07:02.095
We think that the race is on to do
something differently.

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:04.999
We are thinking big.
It's the right thing to do.

00:07:05.023 --> 00:07:08.411
We have an approach which,
if it's successful,

00:07:08.435 --> 00:07:11.055
there's no reason why it
should stay within a hospital.

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:12.783
It can go beyond the walls.

00:07:12.807 --> 00:07:14.854
With wireless connectivity these days,

00:07:14.878 --> 00:07:18.298
there is no reason why
patients, doctors and nurses

00:07:18.322 --> 00:07:20.469
always have to be in the same place

00:07:20.493 --> 00:07:22.462
at the same time.

00:07:22.486 --> 00:07:26.457
And meanwhile, we'll take
our little three-month-old baby,

00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:30.214
keep taking it to the track,
keeping it safe,
