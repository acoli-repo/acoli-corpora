WEBVTT

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.290
So we've spent a lot of time and effort

00:02:00.314 --> 00:02:02.159
in turning the data into stories

00:02:02.183 --> 00:02:05.264
to be able to tell,
what's the state of the engine,

00:02:05.288 --> 00:02:07.536
how are the tires degrading,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.284
what's the situation
with fuel consumption?

00:02:11.308 --> 00:02:14.072
So all of this is taking data

00:02:14.096 --> 00:02:17.874
and turning it into knowledge
that we can act upon.

00:02:17.898 --> 00:02:20.512
Okay, so let's have a look
at a little bit of data.

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:22.542
Let's pick a bit of data from

00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:25.621
another three-month-old patient.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:29.792
This is a child, and what you're
seeing here is real data,

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.769
and on the far right-hand side,
