The Parsed Corpus of Early New High German is a treebank developed in 
part using Dan Bikel's statistical parser at 
<http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~dbikel/software.html> and Beth Randall's 
CorpusSearch software at <http://corpussearch.sourceforge.net/>. The 
original source text used in development of the treebank was acquired 
from Wikisource at <http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Lutherbibel>.

This project was partially funded by the Benjamin Franklin Fellowship and
the Dean's Summer Fellowship awarded by the University of Pennsylvania.

The creator asks that you please contact her at the address provided above
if any errors are found, in order to aid in the further development and
improvement of the treebank.
