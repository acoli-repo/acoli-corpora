# Parsed Corpus of Early New High German

The Parsed Corpus of Early New High German provides a syntactic annotation of parts of Luther's Septembertestament in accordance with specifications of the Penn Treebank annotation family (also applied to other Germanic languages), created and published by Caitlin Light (2011), see below for acknowledgements and terms of use.

We provide the originally released version 0.5 of the data in its original form and (except for the addition of this readme) without any alternations as part of the collection of open source corpora maintained by the Applied Linguistics Labs at Goethe University Frankfurt and the University of Augsburg, Germany. We do so without any intend to imply an involvement with the creation of this data or its subsequent development, but as a means to keep it available to the scientific community: We found that when the original hosting platform [shut down public wikis in 2014 (and ultimately ceded operating in 2019)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikispaces) this data was no longer available to the public. Because of its importance to the study of Early Modern High German, we thus publish the internal copy of the data that we had archived. This does not necessarily represent the most recent version of this data.

Also note that only the data is provided, the accompanying documentation (published on the website, not part of the data release) is lost. In particular, this includes the documentation any the specifics of the annotation scheme. Much of this can be recovered from the [Penn-style annotations](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/other-corpora.html) for Old English and Icelandic, and this information is also partially covered in the PhD thesis of [Caitlin Light](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~clight/), _The syntax and pragmatics of fronting in Germanic_. The thesis is publicly available [from ProQuest](https://www.proquest.com/docview/1289068283), and a summary can be found in a [presentation](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~clight/newcastle-talk.pdf) by Caitlin Light.

The Parsed Corpus of Early New High German is a treebank developed in 
part using Dan Bikel's statistical parser at 
<http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~dbikel/software.html> and Beth Randall's 
CorpusSearch software at <http://corpussearch.sourceforge.net/>. The 
original source text used in development of the treebank was acquired 
from Wikisource at <http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Lutherbibel>.

This project was partially funded by the Benjamin Franklin Fellowship and
the Dean's Summer Fellowship awarded by the University of Pennsylvania.
